          <p eId="para_9">We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. He is joined by Mr. Ciaran Wright, senior auditor.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Apologies have been received from Deputies Shane Cassells and Pat Deering.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Last week we did not approve the minutes of the meeting of 8 November as there was one slight change to be made to the wording. Are the minutes of that meeting agreed to? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">Are the minutes of 29 November and 6 December agreed? Agreed. The next item is matters arising out of the minutes. There is not anything specific because the correspondence will cover most items.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The first item of correspondence in category A, briefing documents and opening statements, is Nos. 1788 A and 1791 A, from Mr. Seán Ó Foghlú, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, dated 6 December 2018 and 11 December, respectively, providing a briefing note and opening statement for today's meeting on the provision of school transport. We will note and publish these. Is that agreed? Agreed. The next item, No. 1790 A, is an opening statement from Bus Éireann. We will note and publish it. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The next item is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both, as well as follow-up to Committee of Public Accounts meetings and other items for publication. We held over three items from last week's meeting for further review. The first item was from Ms Mary Lawlor, public affairs manager, NAMA, dated 29 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee on Project Nantes with a breakdown of the €24 billion in asset sales categorised by the jurisdiction of purchaser. We requested a note from the parliamentary legal adviser on section 172. We will deal with that, not today but as soon as possible. We will consider that letter from NAMA as part of the briefing we will get from the parliamentary legal adviser. We note and publish this.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The next item is No. 1767 B from the clerk to the committee of the Committee on Procedure, dated 30 November 2018, forwarding a complaint on matters raised by the committee in advance of the recent presidential election. The complainant believes the committee raised the matter of presidential expenses in order that it would become an issue in the election campaign. We agreed to note and publish a redacted form of the correspondence last week so as not to identify the person involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> However, I propose that the committee draft a letter to the Committee on Procedure and a similar one to the individual who raised the matter stating that the committee's consideration of the Comptroller and Auditor General's appropriation accounts 2016, Vote 1 - President's Establishment, was within the remit of the committee and that the committee's work highlighted important issues regarding transparency in the funding of the Office of the President. Is that agreed?</p>

          <p eId="para_17">Part of our problem was that it was not looked at until close to the election. We need to consider how we knit that into our work programme at the appropriate time.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2018-12-13T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">What I am suggesting to the committee is that the Vote for the President's Establishment is done as part of the group of Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach at the Estimates committee. We will take it as part of the day we have the Department of the Taoiseach here dealing with its Votes. There is a number of Votes associated with the Department of the Taoiseach, such as the Attorney General's office, the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Central Statistics Office. There is quite a bit in the group of Votes under the Department of the Taoiseach and this is an associated Vote that is always taken as part of that group in the Estimates debate. We will group it as part of the meeting we will have with the Department of the Taoiseach because that Department discusses it at Estimates time. I propose in the work programme to take that group early in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I do not agree with the premise of the letter and I support responding to it. I will make two points. Was an audit committee established within Áras an Uachtaráin as part of the changes that were made?</p>

        <speech by="#DavidCullinane" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Deputy David Cullinane<recordedTime time="2018-12-13T09:10:00+00:00"/></from>

          <p eId="para_30">For the benefit of those watching, we dealt with Vote 1, which is voted expenditure by the Oireachtas, and the Accounting Officer for the Department of the Taoiseach is the Accounting Officer. That Accounting Officer is who we had previously before the committee on this topic and he is who we will have present when we deal with the Votes for the Department of the Taoiseach, and we will include that as a specific item.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> It is important, however, to clarify what the Deputy has said. That allowance is paid directly from the Central Fund and does not go through voted expenditure at all, and that was one of the issues. The Central Fund is managed by the Department of Finance. We will specifically have to deal with that amount with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance when the Secretary General is before the committee. What is known as the Central Fund, the finance accounts of the State, does not go through the Oireachtas for a vote. The main other such items that are not voted through the Oireachtas, including that allowance that we spoke about, include interest on the national debt, contributions to the EU, payments for judges.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">That allowance, by the way, cannot be audited by the audit team or anybody. Was that not the issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_38">We will formally do it. Rather than us pre-empting our discussion in the spring, I am merely saying it must involve the two Secretaries General to deal with the full aspect of expenditure in Áras an Uachtaráin, those of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">That goes as far back as the 1990s. When the Accounting Officers appear before us, it would be useful for them to give some understanding of why it was decided to do it that way. Just as that is an anomaly, there may well be other anomalies. It would be interesting to see how such anomalies originate.</p>

I guess it was done in order that there would not be a controversial debate on the floor of the Dáil about such expenditure in an Estimates process. What was valid in 1938 may not be valid in 2018. That is a matter we will discuss when we come to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> We will look at that Finance account specifically. It is always a concern to me that large items are paid through this account and never discussed on the floor of the Dáil. People will have heard me say this previously. We will pay special attention to that account this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">The next item is No. 1768 B from Mr Ciarán Breen, director, the State Claims Agency, dated 30 November 2018, providing further information requested by the committee regarding medical negligence, open disclosure and CervicalCheck and Thalidomide-related litigation. We held this over from the last day. There is useful information in this correspondence that will feed into our periodic report. We asked for a breakdown of various aspects of the claims. The agency does not want to identify hospitals and talks about groups of hospitals. We do not want to go there at this point in time - we can consider the matter next year. However, there are two items. It gives a breakdown on the number of claims for maternity services and the total number of claims. One issue I had asked was, how much, out of what it pays every year, goes to the wards of court. It has given the figures: in 2015, 2016, 2017 and up to 31 October this year, it was €101 million, €81 million, €126 million and €87 million, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">The Joint Committee on Justice and Equality has done a report on wards of court which the Dáil will debate in the new year. However, this is very interesting information that we have never seen before. It seems to be the practice that in serious cases it is agreed in the court that the person be made a ward of court. It looks as though a very high percentage of the payments made by the State Claims Agency are actually paid to the wards of court fund. This prompts another question as the wards of court fund is outside the reach of public scrutiny whereas when it is in the State Claims Agency it is within public scrutiny. I suggest we ask for one further piece of information in relation to that table 3, namely the total other payments for compensation so we can see the percentage of total payments to wards of court. I asked a question merely on guesswork but I am stunned at the amount of money that is going directly to wards of court. It illustrates the scale of the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I have said previously that a number of things were conflated when the State Claims Agency was before the committee. The whole issue of open disclosure is an area that we will have to examine thoroughly.

          <p eId="para_56">It would be useful if this played a part in our examination. Entities such as the Air Corps would fall into our examination when the State Claims Agency is again before the committee. It would have done some supervision and there are issues which certainly require scrutiny. There is also the matter of open disclosure in non-clinical claims. We need to look at a range of things including CervicalCheck, the wards of court and the difference in the types of hospitals where claims arise. The other component is also important. If we are to prevent future claims we must look at how they do their work on risk assessment. If that fails, we will end up with claims that we should not have.</p>

We have had some engagement with the State Claims Agency but we can see there is work to be done on the costs of the claims, prevention and minimising, what has been done and the lessons learned.

          <p eId="para_58">I wish to raise something tangential to this. Where something happens in a hospital, and inevitably things do, there is an internal and external review. Claims often arise from these incidents but there is no record of those reviews. I raised this at the last meeting. For instance, in response to a question about external reviews - I did not ask about internal reviews - the Saolta Group in Galway has stated it has no record of external reviews carried out in the last ten years or the cost. That is the official answer.</p>

There should be some kind of oversight in an organisation of where things might have gone wrong, have lessons been learned and if changes have been implemented. That might be the area on which to focus when addressing Saolta, and to ask if Saolta does not have the information, what is its risk management function doing if it is not doing that.</p>

It is a three page letter with one thing I want to confirm. In the second last paragraph of the letter on page 7, it is stated that persons B and C remain employees of UL. It continues by stating that UL continues to engage with persons B and C so as to ensure they can return to the workplace as soon as possible. I raised this the last day and I think we might have written back. If we have not, I want to know where in the workplace is being referred to. Is it a situation where the people involved are being offered some other job in some other section and not the job they were in before this incident? We need clarification.

          <p eId="para_88">If I can finish, on reading this it looks like that there is a fairly short timeframe for providing these slides. I have been talking to some of the people involved. Some of the applications, included in these 18, go back to April. A fresh application, however, came in. It is not acknowledged anywhere that the original application for these slides goes back to last April and May, in some situations. It gives the impression that it is a shorter duration by virtue of the fact that there was a second application.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> The key issue here is the format in which slides or photographs are produced. I refer to them being usable in the event of a court case. There was to have been a meeting with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris. That was cancelled at very short notice, something like 12 hours notice, to the great disappointment of the 221 Plus group. This is one of the issues that would have featured at that meeting. Much of information here is accurate but there is one item of information that certainly takes a liberty - and a significant liberty. </p>
          <p eId="para_90"> The failure to begin with was that people were not given information about their own health. That has now been repeated because some people, albeit a small number, have to go to court to determine whether these records can be released. I do not think we were given any kind of indication that there was a dispute when the HSE was before this committee. For me, that is misleading this committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I understand everything that was said. I have also been speaking to some of the ladies directly involved. For public information, I want to touch on a few points in the letter. It is an extensive letter with very detailed information. We welcome the information provided. It is the first time anybody will have seen this level of information on this matter. I do want to make some points for people watching. The letter states that in respect of the cytology slides it is a condition of the laboratory that it holds the document for up to ten years once testing has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> The letter from the HSE continues on page 2 with the kernel of the issue Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned. The HSE has put what it calls a protocol in place because it states that these slides are a critical piece of primary physical evidence that will be relied on by patients to advance their claims and by the laboratories and the HSE in defending any such claims. An exact protocol was put in place by the HSE as to how the slides are to be released. I will come back to that because it is relevant. The HSE states that it wants to maintain the chain of custody and to ensure that the slides are issued through laboratory to laboratory transfers. Even though the HSE, and the national screening service, is the legal custodian of these slides, they are normally held in laboratories.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> It goes on to state that a digital image is taken to record the condition of the slide prior to its dispatch so as to ensure that if a slide is lost or damaged in transit, a secondary record of the contents of that slide will be available. Typically, the taking of such images requires the input of a specialist cytologist or screener. That is some of the reason for the delay. I am just putting that on the record. I am not agreeing or disagreeing. It is being stated by the HSE that some of the issues patients have might result from a single patient slide being in one or two, or more, laboratories and more than one laboratory, therefore, might have to be contacted for some individual patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> The letter goes on to state that early on, before the HSE established its protocol, some people, because it is their medical information, were contacting the laboratories directly. The HSE was losing a chain of custody, as it calls it, of evidence that might be very relevant. It put this protocol in place and that has ensured that the HSE now has a centralised approach. I ask the Deputies to pick up on what I am saying when I am finished. The HSE has stated that the updated position, as of Friday, 28 November, was that slides have been released under the protocol to 30 patients represented by 16 different firms of solicitors. The number of patients who received slides following direct contact with the laboratories, before the protocol was put in place, was 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> On the next page, the HSE gives the release time for 49 slides. That is not 49 people because some people might have slides in more than one laboratory. It is clear that 25% of them were well over the eight week period. I cannot find this in the letter but the HSE has stated that, in its protocol, when arrangements are being put in place to meet a request for slides to be transferred from laboratory to laboratory, it must also be to an identified person with relevant experience taking overall responsibility for maintaining the physical environment in which the slides are stored and examined. I think we have to agree with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I will move on. The court case concerns the fact that some people want their slides released but not in accordance with the HSE protocol. I think the essence of the case is not that people cannot get their slides. The HSE states that slides should be issued according to this protocol. People are saying they want their slides but not through the protocol. Deputy Catherine Murphy may correct me if I am wrong. I think this is why the HSE, from a centralised base, wants to maintain the chain of custody. It states that if slides are being transferred from laboratory to laboratory and from named physician to named physician, it wants this done in accordance with the protocol and it probably wants to maintain the integrity of that protocol rather than this happening outside of it. I am almost finished now, and Deputy Murphy may pick me up on anything she wants to pick me up on, but this is such an important issue that it is important to put this information out there. Then it states, "[A] firm has indicated that it wishes to have the High Court rule on the arrangements that should be applied to the release of slides where no legal proceedings are in being." They might not be in being now but they might be at a later date. The correspondence continues, "For completeness, it should be noted that...on 8 November last, the HSE had not received the information necessary to release slides relating to the 51 patients in question (i.e. the 18 patients who have issued proceedings and the 33 other patients who have not)." What had happened in these cases is that the HSE had identified the laboratory in Northern Ireland; however, it had not given the name of the responsible person in the laboratory. The HSE stated that it considers it likely that many of the requests that were referred to at our recent meeting are possibly part of that 51 in respect of which slides have not been released because the HSE has not been given the name of the person who was going to take custody for it in the laboratory in Northern Ireland. The correspondence gives the turnaround times relating to the slides in the table on the following page. If it looks as if I am defending the HSE, all I have been doing is summarising its position in its letter. The essence of the matter seems to be that there are a number of cases held up in which the person in the laboratory has not been identified and the HSE states it will not give a slide to a laboratory unless it knows who the responsible person is. Then there are other people who do not want to go through the HSE protocol. This seems to be the essence of the court case. I call Deputy Murphy. That is just my reading of the HSE's letter.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I agree with a lot of the Chairman's summary. Certainly, no one, not least the women involved, would want the original slides to be exposed to any kind of damage. That would not be in anyone's interest. Quite rightly, there is a protocol. My understanding is that the protocol was deemed not sufficient by one solicitor who had experience of contesting a case in the courts and that this same solicitor, who has a number of clients, went back and suggested some amendments to the protocol within a week - this was in September - and has not been engaged with since. It is important to say that. Essentially, the HSE is stating, "It is our protocol. It cannot be amended." My understanding is that the difficulty is that the resolution of the photograph of the slide that the HSE proposes would be not sufficient to show up the abnormalities. What use is that? This is the kernel of the problem. Going back to our relying on information when a public body comes before the committee, we were told there was a 22-day turnaround. It was as if we were inventing a problem. This problem has been acknowledged in this letter and it will be further acknowledged next week. I hope the matter does not have to go to court. There would be absolutely zero point in going to court if there were a satisfactory outcome to the matter. It strikes me that there was zero discussion of there being a problem here when we had representatives of the HSE before the committee. I really take exception to that. We must be able to believe what people tell us when they come before us. The word "candour" has been used here on numerous occasions. We would not have had to keep going back looking for information if it had all been outlined in the first instance. There continues to be a problem, however, and I think the public would be surprised at this, given that the failure, or part of the failure, in the first place was not providing the information that was needed. It must be given in a format that is usable as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">I think the HSE acknowledges on a couple of occasions the unsatisfactory length of time it is taking. It does put its hands up and does not disguise this. In its own way it is important we release this letter today because many people are looking for it and there is significant information in it. Our discussion teasing out the issues here is probably helpful to the process. I ask the HSE please to listen to what is being said here this morning because we were told these matters should not have to go to court. If there are issues with the details of a protocol, I ask the HSE to try to sort them out without going to the High Court if at all possible. I think we would be unanimous on this if it could be done. I thank Deputy Murphy for raising the matter. Without her pursuing it the last day, we would not have this correspondence today. It is very useful for many people involved, especially the women directly affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> The next item of correspondence is 1780 B from the HSE, providing information on the Deloitte report into governance arrangements in respect of section 38 and section 39 organisations. It is expected that we will be given a copy of this report in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> The next item is 1782 B from Mr. Pat Smyth, interim CEO of Tusla, dated 4 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on procedures to secure service level agreements and the memorandum of understanding on information-sharing with An Garda Síochána. We will note and publish this. The important aspects of this letter are the following. Regarding the memorandum of understanding on the sharing of information with An Garda Síochána, Tusla makes quite an issue of the data-sharing agreement and the legal services involved from both organisations. I think they are getting advice on this. Tusla states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_102">Once approved and signed off, Tusla and [An Garda Síochána] will agree an implementation strategy. The time frame for implementation has been set as Q1 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">That is useful. The other item Tusla gives is a full list of all the organisations with which it has commissioned a service level agreement. I think every one of these organisations bar one has signed a service level agreement, and that one exception is in the process of being - to use Tusla's words - "decommissioned" from dealing with Tusla. This is again progress on following up on these service level agreements. We started with the HSE, we found a weakness in Tusla, we referred to it in our periodic reports and Tusla seems to be 100% on top of the job. We will note and publish the correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> The next item of correspondence is 1784 B from Mr. Liam Sloyan, chief executive of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, dated 5 December 2018, providing information requested by the committee on the review of the pricing mechanism for long-term residential care in private and voluntary nursing homes. It includes a note on the progress of the Deloitte prospectus review and a note on the nursing homes steering committee. We will note and publish this. People may be interested in it. It is a follow-on from the information we requested. There are copies of minutes of meetings and of records of information. That is useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> The next item is 1785 B from Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, providing an information note on testing the constitutionality of excise law in a tax appeal case. This was mentioned at our meeting. He says it is not a matter for the Tax Appeals Commission to make any determination but, rather, it is a matter for the courts to decide constitutionality. He provides information on high-income individuals' restriction and a summary of section 485F, carry forward of excess relief for the years 2007 to 2016. This is as a result of a question I asked and it is good to get this in the public domain. The correspondence concerns one of the reasons some high-wealth individuals pay quite reduced amounts in tax. We understood that if they had losses, and if they had claimed this allowance and carried forward losses in a given year rather than using them all, they could carry them forward again.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Some people will be interested in that. We asked for details of the fines imposed by courts in respect of tobacco. We found them farcical. For the millions of euro involved the fines issued were farcical, and the situation has become more farcical now. Three cases went to court. One person was fined €12,000 and two individuals each received a fine of €5,000. One individual received a fine of €5,000. Any defendant who received a sentence had it fully suspended. There is zero deterrent to smuggling in Ireland as far as I can see. We talk about it every year. The revenue or some other body should be given the authority to impose very serious fines. All that happens is that smugglers lose one particular shipment. They carry on the next week with the next lorry-load. That is something we will have to come down on firmly in our periodic report. It is no wonder it is happening on this scale because there is zero enforcement and zero penalties relative to the scale of activity. </p>

It provides a response requested by the committee regarding the value for money query. I propose we forward a copy of the correspondence to the individual who raised the matter. I find this response completely unsatisfactory. From recollection I think we asked some questions. A major fund is available to the SBCI. It does not lend directly. It provides funding to on-lenders, meaning banks or other institutions. I want to know the breakdown of how much is provided through banks and how much is provided through non-bank on-lenders. I find it extraordinary that on writing to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland we got back a three-page letter on money matters without a euro symbol in it. There is a lot of lovely talk about policies and principles. It could have been taken from the opening statement describing what the SBCI does in its annual report. It gives us none of the information we are really looking for; how much the SBCI has loaned, how much the banks have loaned on, how much the non-banks have loaned on-----</p>

          <p eId="para_134">The information on Corrib north and Corrib south states that the contractors have the requisite expertise and knowledge to carry out the urgent assessments required, and the contractor has specialist knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this complex project. That does not necessarily mean that there were no other possibilities. It is not an excuse for not having a tendering process.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The same applies to the contract to support the development of the national mitigation plan, NMP. The Department says the process was shelved because the supplier is considered unique because of the research it offered. Who considered the contractor unique? Again, I do not accept that as a reason not to have a tendering process. The same occurred with a NMP climate modelling contract worth more than €600,000. Again, there were no competitive bids. The Department's reason is that the contractor has a specialist team.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> There is a wider implication here. Even if it was the case that these were unique specialist services, why is in-house expertise not being built up at the Department? It was the same with the national broadband plan. We have ended up with only one bidder because it seems that the only contractor left is the one that can do the job. We all know why that happened; because of privatisation. However I do not accept that for these contracts. An awful lot of contracts are being awarded without any competitive tension at all. We are given the excuse that the Department believes that the supplier is the only organisation or private company that can do the job. That does not cut it. I do not know if the Comptroller and Auditor General has examined the correspondence. </p>

          <p eId="para_137">The point the Deputy is raising is exactly the relevant one. We challenge these outcomes when we become aware of them. We ask the Department to demonstrate to us that this is the only supplier who can do this. It is a little clearer when a public body is locked into an ICT system and there is only one supplier of licences or requisites for it. We then check that the procurement testing for that has been carried out, even on a ten-year cycle, and that there is proper full-life recognition of the costs associated with the contract. A public body cannot just pick a supplier and decide that the State is tied to that supplier.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">----- who would come forward for a contract of €100,00 if it was put out to tender. Following up on what Deputy Cullinane was saying, I am struck by No. 4. The upgrade of the Department's financial management system was worth €74,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">It says the vendor is the sole supplier within Ireland of the software used by the Department of Finance. How did the Department pick a financial management system with only one supplier of that service in Ireland? It is nonsense to think there is not a myriad of companies that could provide a financial management system to the Department. We will write to it asking it to give us an information note regarding each of the items mentioned by the Deputy where there was either a sole supplier or these people had unique expertise. We want a note on each of them as to how the Department arrived at that conclusion. </p>

          <p eId="para_145">I raised this previously. I know we have a very busy work schedule and a lot of work to do but the broader issue concerns procurement. This is another example of where there are problems. This time, it is citing a lack of expertise in the marketplace and saying that in its judgment, only specialised companies can do this work. In other areas, we have seen examples involving leaving it too late before rolling over contracts or putting them out for tender. We know there are ongoing problems in the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills. We have done it but it is bit sketchy. We are coming at it in bits and pieces here and there so I ask that we join it all up and at some point, produce a report on procurement because the problem is that there are no sanctions.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">It involves a slap on the wrist and a note at the end of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report saying that there may be issues regarding non-adherence to procurement rules. We then give the Accounting Officer a slap on the wrist, there is no punishment or sanction and it continues. I know there have been some improvements in the HSE because of our work. Notwithstanding that, it still comes up over and over again for many different reasons. I know we will get to our work programme. Can we look at the issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I support that call. I have raised the matter with regard to computer expertise. What is happening is that there is less and less competition. That is the problem. There is less and less competition under the guise of more competition and we are struggling piecemeal with it so I would certainly welcome an opportunity to come back and deal with it in a more comprehensive manner. We are just beginning to identify the problems. It is a bit like spin-off companies where we barely touch on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">We will write to the Department asking it to give us a detailed explanation in each case involving a sole contractor and tell us how it arrived at that conclusion. For example, €100,000 was paid for the provision of legal advice regarding the Corrib gas field project. The reasons given for not having a competitive process include the contractor having specialist knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this complex project. We would certainly hope that whoever was getting the contract had specialist knowledge and an understanding of the project or it should not have got th.e contract but to suggest that there was nobody else in the country who could have done it does not stand up from our perspective. We will come back to that</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> We now turn to correspondence from and related to private individuals and any other correspondence. No. 1774 C from Senator Gerard Craughwell, dated 3 December 2018, is correspondence requesting the committee to make inquiries regarding the expenditure by the Department of Defence defending High Court actions on its failure to implement the working time directive for the Defence Forces. We will request a note from the Department regarding the matters raised. </p>

          <p eId="para_153">This is an important issue that was raised with me. The Defence Forces are not subject to the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997. Similar Acts are in place in other countries to which the relevant defence forces are subject so we are unique in this respect. Because there is no possibility for class action in this State, individual cases are being taken by the trade union. It seems the WRC is siding with the workers in each and every case. Rather than, again, dragging more and more workers through the WRC with a cost to the State, it would make more sense to deal with the substantive issue. It seems that from the WRC perspective, the EU has a competency in this area that supersedes national law. This is one of the reasons the WRC is making the judgments it is making. Senator Craughwell mentions the European directive in his correspondence. We need to go back to the Department with that substantial point, which is that if it is losing all these individual cases and is faced with more, why does it not deal with the substantial problem here?</p>

          <p eId="para_155"> No. 1783 C is correspondence from an individual regarding the response from the University of Limerick regarding mediation processes at the college. The individual does refer to Dr Fitzgerald's item of correspondence, which we discussed earlier. The individual wishes to know if he is referred to in Dr Fitzgerald's correspondence. It does not appear to be the case. I propose we note this item and inform the individual accordingly.

We will group them all together. Next is the Limerick and Clare ETB, clear audit opinion with the same issue of a material level of non-compliance with national procurement rules. There is also Laois and Offaly ETB, clear audit opinion and attention is drawn to the disclosure statement on internal control that Laois and Offaly ETB would welcome an increase in internal audit resources. We covered that last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Here we go again. UCD and Limerick and Clare ETB are not in compliance with public procurement guidelines. Is there any information on the statement of internal control in the accounts?</p>

          <p eId="para_201">For today, we will note that the procurement issue is one to which we will come back. For anyone who wants a breakdown or background on that, it is in the published financial statements laid before the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The next item is work programme and we want to talk about the meetings early next year. We are not proceeding with the meeting with the Irish Prison Service next week. Is that agreed? I think everyone is agreed to that. Time is very tight and we will come back to that. Thursday, 17 January, we are having the first meeting back with the Department of Justice and Equality about the Irish Prison Service and Vote 21. Hopefully that is agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> The following Tuesday is a separate and private meeting with the whistelblowers and complainants in relation to the University of Limerick. We will pencil that in now, but when we go into private session for another item, we might have a brief discussion on the structure of that meeting. We will do that in private session in a moment, but we will publicly set that date for it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> On Thursday, 24 January, we will deal with the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report on the Waterford Institute of Technology and his special report on the remuneration of certain staff in the University of Limerick and the Institute of Technology, Sligo. Those organisations, the Higher Education Authority and the Department of Education and Skills will attend on 24 January. All of these have to be confirmed.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> On 31 January, we are back to our housing meeting. We will have the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and specifically the Irish Council for Social Housing. We will deal with the Vote for housing and planning. We will try to conclude our meetings about housing at that meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> On 2 February, we have the Vote from the Minister for Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on chapter 1 deals with the financial outturn for 2017. Chapter 2 deals with the collection of pension contributions due to the Exchequer. Chapter 3 deals with the control of funding for voted public services. Chapter 22 relates to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council. We will have to make arrangements as to whether it will take a separate slot at the meeting or be a part of the bigger meeting because I think the council is meant to be independent. We will work out the format of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">I think we got a bit confused. As I understood it, after our last meeting when Deputy O'Connell was here, we would ask the HSE. The Brothers of Charity Services in Ireland would not have to come, but we would ask their representatives and go through this. The issue was that they seemed to be applying rules and people were being charged, some of whom were reimbursed, others of whom were reimbursed from a certain date but not the whole time period. The person who contacted me took issue with the information that Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE provided to this committee. I have unilaterally written my own rebuttal to Mr. Mitchell, putting a series of questions. I sent it off lately, so I have no response. It would be good to have the HSE and the Brothers of Charity before the committee but Deputy O'Connell said at the meeting, and others agreed, that such a hearing could be broadened to include other indirect charges being applied to long-term residents in nursing homes.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">In the correspondence I just referred to, the thalidomide issue is dealt with in paragraph 4 on page 3. The final sentence states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_264">Subsequently the Chief State Solicitor's Office, due to pressure on resources in its office, came off record in the Thalidomide matters and was replaced by Hayes, Solicitors, a firm with an established track-record in the Defence of medicinal product liability litigation. For transparency purposes, payments to Counsel, whether on or off panel, are published biannually on the SCA's website. No payments have been made to any of the State's Counsel in the Thalidomide cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_266">Of course the State cannot be a soft touch or anything like that. We are talking about eight or nine people and it is being defended in the High Court and we have Hayes Solicitors on record, which is a private firm that is incurring a cost to the State and all so on. The State's default position will be to defend every case and I would love to know why it is throwing money at this when there are so few people who are clearly thalidomide sufferers. I would like an explanation because it would be much cheaper to mediate and get it done.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">We need to have a look at the structure of the State Claims Agency and we have not done that sufficiently. It became clear when we were looking at the CervicalCheck issue that proceedings had to be issued in court before the agency even knew about it. It did not seem that there was a mechanism to do open disclosure in a way that was non-legalistic. That has to be part of what we do when we examine the agency because we will have to keep going back on individual streams of work that relate to different issues such as CervicalCheck or thalidomide unless we get to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">I will make a general point related to how long things take. Regarding the summit on the catastrophic infants' cases, the agency in its correspondence states, "The Agency only ever becomes involved when the letter of claim is received." By that time, the solicitor has done all the research and all the work and then submits his or her claim. The agency further states, "This has the inevitable consequence that the Agency has to "play catch-up" as it can only commence its liability and causation investigations when it receives a letter of claim." By definition, then, the system is geared such that there will be a significant time lag. This is another example of it. The agency will be before the committee again as part of our work programme but we will write to it in the meantime if there is a gap in its responses to the issues we raised with it the last day.</p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2018-12-13T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_285">Special report 98 looks at the arrangements in place for the provision of school transport. The examination was carried out to ascertain whether the Department of Education and Skills can demonstrate that it is achieving value for money through its arrangements with Bus Éireann to deliver the school transport service and whether there is adequate oversight of the service by the Department. The special report was based on financial and service data relating to 2015. The briefing material provided by the Department includes data for later periods and there have been some significant subsequent developments which the Accounting Officer will explain. However, as the key findings of the report are likely to still apply, I will present them as reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Primary school children are eligible to avail of school transport services if they live not less than 3.2 km from their nearest suitable school. The eligibility minimum distance for post-primary pupils is 4.8 km. Pupils who do not qualify under the eligibility rules may use the school transport service if there is spare capacity on a bus route. Such users are known as concessionary ticket holders. Eligible children who hold a medical card and special needs pupils are exempt from charges for availing of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> The cost to the Department of school transport services in 2015 was €173 million, or close to €1 million per school day. The bulk of the cost is accounted for by payments to Bus Éireann, which received €149 million in 2015, or 86% of the amount spent by the Department. Bus Éireann also collected a little less than €14 million in fees from fare-paying pupils. The balance of the expenditure by the Department is accounted for by various grants, including for special needs escorts and transport grants. The average annual cost of transporting eligible pupils was approximately €1,800 per head in 2015. Fees recouped from fare-paying pupils amounted to a little more than 8% of the costs. </p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Although there has been a steady increase in the total number of enrolments in primary and post-primary schools over the past decade, the number of pupils who are eligible for and avail of the school transport service has fallen significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">In 2007, the number of eligible pupils who availed of the scheme was 127,000 or 16% of enrolled pupils. By 2015, this had dropped to 89,000 or 10% of enrolled pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_290"> The school transport bus fleet is made up of a mix of large, medium and small buses. Taxis are also used to transport some pupils with special needs. Much of the service is subcontracted by Bus Éireann to private bus and taxi operators. Payments to subcontractors accounted for 71% of the cost of the service provided by Bus Éireann in 2015. Based on assumed average carrying capacities for vehicle types, we estimated the bus fleet as a whole had a potential carrying capacity of 163,000 pupils in 2015. Relative to the number of eligible pupils, the estimated level of spare carrying capacity in the fleet was 48%. Some of this spare capacity is taken up by concessionary ticket holders but the estimated residual spare capacity in 2015 was still significant, at about 35%. There was also evidence that some ticket holders do not use the transport available on a daily basis resulting in further underutilisation. At the same time, there is local demand in certain areas for concessionary access to school transport services that cannot be accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> The examination also looked at the oversight arrangements in place between the Department and Bus Éireann. We found that in 2015 the Department was still relying on arrangements that had been in place for over 40 years contained in a 1975 document entitled, Summary of Accounting Arrangements. I concluded that the accounting arrangements provided for in the 1975 agreement are inadequate given the level of costs involved. Reporting requirements are weak and there is an absence of key performance indicators or other metrics that would allow the Department to assess service performance and the achievement of value for money. I recognise there have been some developments since the report was completed on a service level agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> The accounting arrangements provide for the Department to pay an annual lump sum transport management charge to cover Bus Éireann's indirect and unspecified other direct costs. The charge is provided for in the agreement at 13% of direct costs. By agreement between Bus Éireann and the Department, the management charge was capped at €16.7 million in 2011, at €15 million a year between 2012 and 2014 and at €11.3 million for 2015. Information provided by Bus Éireann to the Department and the costs to be met from the management charge indicate that, notwithstanding the cap, the amount paid was in excess of costs in each of the four years to 2014, resulting in an accumulated surplus being held by Bus Éireann estimated by the Department at €11.2 million at the end of 2015. The report includes a number of recommendations for improvement in the oversight and accounting arrangements. The Accounting Officer will be able to brief members on implementation progress in that regard.</p>

          <from> Mr. Seán Ó Foghlú<recordedTime time="2018-12-13T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_293">I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to appear before it. I will not read my full opening statement given the tightness of time. I will focus on our response to the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> The Department’s general agreement with the recommendations is recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. As the Comptroller and Auditor General has stated, progress has been made on implementing the recommendations since that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> On forecasting, while the school transport scheme continues to be a demand-led scheme, in planning for projected demand the Department liaises closely with the National Council for Special Education in regard to projected enrolment trends at primary and post-primary. The Department is undertaking a route audit with independent professional advice to ensure that route design is optimised from a value for money point of view, taking into account the location of eligible children. In the process of preparing for that review, the Department worked with Bus Éireann on the digitisation of its route maps.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The Department has strengthened the governance framework around school transport and continues to do so. We have worked with Bus Éireann to put in place a number of additional elements of our governance framework, which builds on the 1975 arrangement that underpins our relationship with Bus Éireann on school transport provision. A service level agreement has been put in place between the two organisations. This sets out the reporting arrangements in place between the two organisations, the roles and responsibilities of both organisations, the agreed outputs to be delivered by Bus Éireann and the key performance indicators for the operation of the scheme. The agreement is under review and it is intended that an updated service level agreement will be put in place in 2019, with a view to further strengthening the governance framework around school transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> Also in the context of reporting and performance monitoring, certain overhead costs and other indirect costs attributable by Bus Éireann to the school transport scheme are known collectively as the transport management charge. The Department commissioned an independent expert to carry out a review of the apportionment methodology for it. The report was completed in March 2018. The report provides a detailed analysis and classification of the costs incorporated into the charge. Based on the recommendations of the report, the Department has developed a reporting framework and we are working with Bus Éireann with a view to completing these reports initially on a biannual basis with a view to moving to quarterly reports. In addition, the Department has been taking steps to reduce the accumulated surplus arising from the charge. The surplus of €11.2 million recorded in the Comptroller and Auditor General' report will be eliminated by the end of the current year.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> In regard to the final recommendation, all operational meetings between the Department and Bus Éireann are minuted and agreed by all attendees as a standing agenda item. While it did not generate recommendations, it is noted that a central part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report was an examination of Bus Éireann’s procurement processes. The report records that Bus Éireann was compliant with public procurement guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> I will mention two other areas of note in the school transport scheme. The first concerns concessionary transport. The purpose of the school transport scheme, having regard to resources, is to support the transport of children who live in remote areas. We have heard about the distance criteria. Families of eligible children living in areas where it is uneconomic to provide a transport service are eligible for the remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements if a service is not available. A number of non-eligible children are also transported in those circumstances, where bus places are available, after all eligible children are catered for. The transport is provided in the interest of maximising the utilisation of the existing fleet and in providing a service to families where the capacity exists to do so. Since the number of spare places is dependent on the number of eligible children requiring transport, there can be no guarantee from year to year of a place for those who do not meet the eligibility criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> On the special education needs scheme, the purpose of the scheme, having regard to available resources, is to support the transport to and from school of children with special educational needs arising from a diagnosed disability. In general, such children are eligible for school transport if they are attending the nearest recognised mainstream school or unit that is or can be resourced to meet their needs. Eligibility is determined following consultation with the National Council for Special Education through its network of special education needs organisers, SENOs. The Department and Bus Éireann are very conscious of the specialised nature of transport provision for these children. This is reflected in the standard of service provided by Bus Éireann, factoring the individual requirements of the children concerned into the planning of these services which generally operate on a door-to-door basis. Eligible children are exempt from school transport charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> At a cost of almost €190 million in 2017, school transport constitutes a significant expenditure of taxpayer money. The scheme is under financial pressure from increasing demographics at primary and post-primary level but, more significantly, from the increase in the numbers of children with special educational needs being transported. While cognisant of the costs associated with the scheme, and having taken on board the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, the Department is continuing to strengthen the process to ensure value for money in the delivery of the school transport scheme, while also ensuring that all eligible children are accommodated with school transport services. </p>
          <p eId="para_302"> I am very happy to provide any further information sought and respond to questions from the committee. As the Chairman noted, we are joined by representatives of Bus Éireann. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_220">
          <from> Mr. Stephen Kent<recordedTime time="2018-12-13T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_303">I am joined by Ms Miriam Flynn, who is our chief schools officer, and Mr. Tom Delaney, our chief financial officer. They have joined me as part of a new senior management team at Bus Éireann. We are very pleased to be here to answer any questions and assist the examination of the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> We have been operating the school transport scheme successfully for over 50 years. We do not exercise discretion on the policy and all applications are simply dealt with in accordance with the rules and guidelines. It is important to note at the outset that the delivery of our operation on the ground is highly complex and the scheme is administered by Bus Éireann on a cost recovery basis only.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The scheme has expanded dramatically in terms of vehicle numbers as the number of services provided under the scheme has increased from 1,700 contractor vehicles in 1998 to more than 4,500 now.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">More than 460 new school transport services were approved by the Department and introduced by Bus Éireann in 2017. This year alone, another 300 new services are expected to be introduced by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. The vast majority of these will cater for children with special educational needs. All newly sanctioned services are opened to public tender by Bus Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> With regard to the management of the overall network, 95% of Bus Éireann fleet operates two double trips daily, with the bus used for different school runs both morning and evening, comprising two return trips. More than 60% of contractors also operate double trips. It is important to note that 83% of the costs of the scheme comprise payments to contractors. Due to the nature of special educational needs routes, where the individual needs of a child are taken into account, many of these services are operated in single vehicles on a door-to-door basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> On procurement, more than 90% of routes are subcontracted to private operators and 20% of these routes are tendered on an annual basis by Bus Éireann in compliance with EU guidelines on procurement. We welcome the finding of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which demonstrates that Bus Éireann is fully compliant with public procurement standards. This is testament to our stringent and equitable standards, which we apply to all our procedures and practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> The Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted opportunities for improved governance and I will touch on those. There has been the introduction of a service level agreement, there are monthly operations meetings to review periodic financial and statistical reports and there are quarterly meetings with the chief executive and senior officials from the Department. I can provide some context in the information we cover in this regard. We provide a formal budget and projected costs for the financial year, which are agreed at the start of every year, and these consider both internal and external cost drivers, emerging trends, the anticipated level of demand and policy developments which may have a bearing on each of the cost headings each year. We prepare a schedule of monthly payments based on the number of school days each month, the mode of transport and the eligible children travelling. This is furnished to the Department at the beginning of each year, and it is designed to provide an estimate of the annual projected cost. These figures are reviewed at monthly meetings and amended as required. Sometimes there must be change, such as when there is a status red weather warning and costs have to be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Individual statutory accounts are not produced for school transport as it is not structured as a separate company within Bus Éireann. However, all finances pertaining to school transport are audited and a separate statement of account for the school transport scheme is prepared as part of the company’s annual independent audit.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Bus Éireann is committed to providing the highest levels of transparency to the Department across all cost allocations. We have engaged specifically with the Department on allocations related to the indirect costs of staff, property and information technology, which account for nearly 85% of these indirect charges. Most recently, we are in joint agreement that all these costs are demonstrably related to school transport. A biannual review is in place to ensure that the basis for cost allocation is robust and transparent. Bus Éireann accounts are fully audited by Deloitte. An additional audit of all school transport activity is undertaken to comply with the summary of accounting arrangement in line with the 1975 agreement. This year and taking into account the comments of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Bus Éireann is in discussions with our auditors regarding a separate audit under general accepted accounting principles for the school transport part of our business.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> Bus Éireann’s 2017 accounts noted that a €6.7 million ring-fenced surplus was held within its reserves on behalf of the Department to be used solely for future expenditure on school transport-related activities. In recent years, this has included spend on the creation of a new online ticketing system, an improved telephony and call management system and new school buses, all of which were authorised by the Department. Currently there is no surplus in reserve and our 2018 financial statements will support this position.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> On the subject of the special needs scheme, it has evolved in recent years with a significant growth in the provision of transport for special educational needs children. This year, we received in excess of 3,000 new individual special educational needs applications or requests for amendments to services and this contributes to the growing cost of providing services. It is also worth noting that while the volume of work has increased because it is complex to deliver, there has not been a corresponding increase in the costs of administration associated with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> We welcome the expansion of the scheme in recent years and we are conscious that we must also continue to strategically refine our own resources, processes, procedures and technology supports to ensure we meet its growing needs. We will do all that in close liaison with the Department of Education and Skills. We are committed to full transparency and to continuing this close co-operation as the scheme evolves. We fully enforce the rules of the scheme, comply with the performance requirements of the service level agreement and every day we try to deliver high standards of safety, consistency and reliability for all students who avail of the school transport scheme. We do this on behalf of the State. We have been operating the school transport scheme for over 50 years and we look forward to continuing to providing this vital service into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">I welcome the representatives of the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Bus Éireann. The roll-out of the bus system for schools was a good idea and I availed of it when I attended secondary school in 1968, which is a good few years ago now. While it was a great scheme when it was rolled out, there is always a "but". I am a rural Deputy representing County Kilkenny and every year, from July onwards, school transport, in particular concessionary tickets, causes me a major headache. I will focus on that issue today. As I mentioned, the service is good for most but it is not good for those who are left behind. That is the problem. I hear daily about problems and even last week a constituent with four children contacted me here in Leinster House about a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Most parents work nowadays and it is not like it was years ago, when one parent stayed at home while the other was the breadwinner. It has changed and both parents must work, so getting children to and from school is the issue. The Fianna Fáil Party did some research for the 2016 general election and we updated the results this year. It found that 350 pupils with concessionary tickets did not access the school transport service this year and that €4 million would be sufficient to cover the costs involved. I accept that is a simplified version and rolling out services to this group would be a different job for Bus Éireann. It is small money in the overall purse of taxpayers' money. The Department and the Minister should address the issue. I repeatedly bring it to his attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> There was a recession and we changed the rules in 2009 or 2010. Now that the recession is over, we should review the scheme and look after the 350 children who have been left behind this year, if my figure is correct. We should try to include them in the school transport scheme. Will the witnesses comment on that first?</p>

          <p eId="para_319">The concessionary element is a key part of this, as we organise the scheme on the basis of eligible pupils first and then concessionary pupils. All pupils are supposed to have applied for transport by the end of April and all payments are supposed to be made towards the end of July. The first problem is that people do not necessarily all apply and pay fees on time. That is a challenge when it comes to organising routes. Getting past that, Bus Éireann, on behalf of the Department, must organise the routes, starting on the basis of the people who applied and implementing them on the basis of those who have paid. Once all the eligible people who have paid have filled the seats, the remaining seats are available for concessionary tickets. A large number of children are travelling under the school transport scheme using concessionary tickets. In the 2017-18 school year, they numbered just over 27,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> This year, there were approximately 3,000 applicants who applied for concessionary transport who did not receive it. Of those, just 1,129 applied on time but did not secure a seat, while 1,888 applied late and did not receive a seat.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The figure is just around about 3,000. We are speculating on a scheme here. It is a matter for a Government to make policy but I do not mind taking this a little distance. If were to have a scheme where concessionary transport was available to everyone then, we would have a different number of applicants. Those applicants are on the basis of the scheme we have at the moment, not on the basis of a putative scheme that may provide transport for all concessionary users. </p>
          <p eId="para_322"> We were very conscious of this being an issue. Obviously on the establishment of the current Government, we had a review and published the outcomes. We are continuing further work on the nature of "concessionary" and whether there is a way we can seek to meet some of the need that has been identified, such as for a large group of concessionary users - not individuals - who seek to go a certain distance and who may already be eligible for school transport. We are exploring options in that regard and, yes, they would cost money. They probably would cost more than the figure to which the Deputy has referred because obviously one must organise transport. We are looking at that. One of the tensions we have in the scheme is that we have a scheme where costs are going up, especially on the special education side. We also have a tension, and it is an appropriate tension, to provide a social service to people who want to have it. That is a tension always. We want to make sure that we strike the right balance and that balance is obviously in the rules of the scheme and so on. Yes, we recognise it is a difficult issue. I am not sure it is as small as the Deputy set out and I am not sure it is even as small as I have set out. If we had in place an open choice to be transported to anywhere up to a certain distance limit, that could actually cost a huge amount of money. Obviously there may be room to develop the scheme slightly. We are looking at whether that is a possibility and that would obviously cost money if we were to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">I understand there is waste and will give examples affecting my constituents. I have experienced this myself as I must drive through these areas. A 40-seater bus serves a small place called Paulstown and brings children to Kilkenny but seven children have been left off. I believe that it would not cost an awful lot of money to provide a 50-seater bus.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I disagree with the changes that have been made to the qualifying criteria for concessionary transport. I know that the Department is not to blame for the changes because we, as politicians, are responsible for the changes. I come from a little place called Ballyhale which is in the southern part of County Kilkenny. In 1967, the three primary schools in the locality were amalgamated into one school. For 40 years there were no problems and everything worked beautifully but all of a sudden these changes were made. My grandchildren attend the school. Unfortunately, after a service being continuously provided for 40 years in the parish, due to the changes that were made here, parents of the children have been told that they should send their children to a different parish because that school is nearer. That is crazy stuff as everyone will agree who knows the loyalty that people have to their parishes, particularly in rural areas. While I am not talking about all rural areas, people tend to be very loyal to their parishes. There is religious loyalty because one receives the holy sacraments of baptism, first communion and confirmation in one's parish church. All of that has gone on for generations and the same applies to hurling, football, soccer of whatever sport one plays. Unfortunately, at the stroke of a pen we, as politicians, changed the criteria in 2010 or whenever. Therefore, after three generations have availed of school transport, parents have been told they must send their children to their nearest schools. I measured the distance that obliged one family in the parish, with three children, to travel. It was 0.25 km and the family was told the children had to attend a school located outside of the parish. We all know that one's loyalty is to one's parish. The family was told this because of the new criteria and, unfortunately, siblings will be separated as a result. The older siblings can attend one school but the next lot must attend school in another parish, which is nearer in terms of kilometres but not in any other way. That is a crazy situation so we must review the matter. I do not blame the Department for this situation. It is us, the politicians, who must review the scheme. I ask the Minister and my own party to review the matter and I hope it will be reviewed shortly. I ask the Secretary General to comment. </p>

          <p eId="para_325">I do not want to comment about individual situations but I will comment about the situation in principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> If we were to say to Bus Éireann you can run bigger buses where there are not enough eligible pupils for them, that is a policy change that costs money. It can be done but it is a policy change that costs money, and it would have to be applied across the country and in all areas. We have to have a consistent national policy. Yes, that could be done. Yes, it could cost a lot of money because Bus Éireann run buses of different sizes at different times. Yes, it can be done but, yes, it could cost a lot of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> In relation to the amalgamations, the policy view was taken arising from the value for money, VFM, review. There is a very good example in the VFM of a few Catholic schools that happen to be in the same Catholic parish, where parents were living closer to one school but only could get school transport to the school further away. To be honest, we cannot set a scheme in stone in relation to amalgamations which were made 50 years ago. </p>

          <p eId="para_330"> The other point is this is about school transport. Parents can choose to send their children to other schools, if they wish. I know there are challenges on parents to get students to different schools in respect of transport and so on. This is not requiring them to attend school. Parents can choose which school to attend, obviously subject to there being places in schools. This is about the availability of school transport to support that. I draw that distinction because I think it is an important distinction. </p>
          <p eId="para_331"> If we introduced and kept the level of choice to allow people to go to somebody under the former closed or close school rule, as well as the closest school, which was the policy dilemma, we would then have a myriad of choice, and a myriad of choice in transport costs a huge amount of money. It is a reasonable policy to say that the State will support a child to go to his or her nearest primary school. If a parent wishes to choose for a child to go to a different primary school, that is a reasonable choice for a parent to make but it is a choice that parents can make and arrange themselves. </p>

          <p eId="para_332">Does the Secretary General think parishes, particularly in rural Ireland, should be recognised in the criteria? I am not talking about parents who want to pick specialist schools for their children and want the State to pay for it. I am talking about parents sending their children to one primary school in a parish. The parents have no choice because there is only one primary school in the parish. After 40 years, the grandparents, parents and grandchildren, have all of a sudden been told that the option is closed. These people have a right to get the same service that they were promised in 1968 and enjoyed for 40 years. Unfortunately, politicians have changed the situation with the stroke of a pen. If people went to court and outlined that they always had access to the school then I think the Government would be bound by it.</p>

There was one in 2015, according to the report compiled by the Comptroller and Auditor General. To me, the term "surplus" sounds like a profit was made. It is a crying shame to have a surplus and a profit when a couple of hundred children have been omitted from the scheme. It is a pity that money could not be used to bring the children to school rather than have a surplus and profit. Does a surplus mean there was a profit? </p>

There was a reserve held, which was held by Bus Éireann and referred to in their accounts in latter years, which was assignable, on agreement by us, to certain costs. We made the call this year that we would not let the company retain that any more. That is no longer being retained and will not be retained by the end of 2018. There was no profit in the scheme.

Bus Éireann is subcontracting them for the routes. The routes are given out, many of which I know, around Kilkenny and Carlow and everywhere else. Would the Department not get better value if it went directly to the subcontractors, put the routes out to tender and saw who came in with the best price? Would that not save us money at a cost of €190 million? When one has a monopoly and no-one to compete against, it does not sound like good business. The service level agreement that is being talked about was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report up to 2015. I question it as well. If we even got a sample of putting it out to public auction to see who would come in at the best prices, we might get a better and cheaper service. I ask the Secretary General to comment.</p>

Some 83% of the money we give it is procured out. Bus Éireann does that efficiently and it follows public procurement in doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">It would take a national organiser to do it on that basis. There is no alternative national organiser that we see. The bulk of what Bus Éireann does is to outsource procurement, which is done to Government procurement standards. There is no question about the procurement by Bus Éireann of the services. I think it is very really helpful that the value for money question was confirmed by the Comptroller and Auditor General. We get updates and sign-offs on reports from Bus Éireann to confirm that this is the case. We are looking at other ways that we can confirm that this is the case. I am not saying that we just take it on its word forever but we have to look at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I do not see an alternative national organiser to step in and organise all of those services and to procure and to work it out. We are, however, undertaking the audit of routes and when we look at that, which I referred to in my opening statement, we can then see if that informs any other policy choices. Of course, there are policy choices. At the moment our very strong policy option is to work with Bus Éireann as the route provider providing that it is outsourcing the vast majority of the service, as it does. The private sector is hugely involved in school transport.</p>

Could the Department of Education and Skills not run the system directly and put it out to tender without Bus Éireann? It is a second layer of bureaucracy that could be avoided with better value for money. I am just a lay person asking these questions. I am a businessman and farmer as well, and when I am trying to get a price, I put it out to two or three people to see which is the best price. That is how I work my business and try to get value for money.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">I do not believe the Department should do the route work. There is a transport expertise that is unique to Bus Éireann. There is route design, ticketing, and a whole range of things with which we, as a Department, do not want to be involved. We have set up agencies to provide State examinations and to do the work of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. We set up one on education welfare that is now within Tusla under the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I do not believe the Department itself should be undertaking that work. Given the extent to which Bus Éireann outsources in the first place, it is the company's transport management expertise that is vital and very important to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> On value for money, we have to ensure that we understand all of the costs and that we are on top of all of the costs, and its accountants are signing off on these, and we are checking as appropriate. That is part of the service level agreement that we have discussed, along with a number of other matters.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">There are two aspects to this. The Deputy asked about value for money and whether we are making a profit. First, 90% of the routes that we operate are put out to tender and procured in complete compliance with EU guidelines. Anybody who gets to operate them will have won them on a competitive basis. Second, 83% of all of the costs associated with the delivery of this scheme at the moment go back to the contractors. They come through the Department, they pass through us and they go out there. This company has been through a radical transformation, as the Deputy may be aware, even in the past couple of years, and it continues to take on board a lot of the findings that we have. We have a transport management charge that tries to recover the indirect costs. It has fallen almost every year. It has fallen from €11.2 million and is part of the transformation that we tried to do again last year. It will be of the order this year of €10.5 million of costs. That goes to cover all of the indirect costs that surround and go into the business. We try to deliver and utilise it to get as many double trips into the business as we can into every single route. That is an important point.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">That leads in certain instances to more capacity on the first bus and less on the second. From our experience, it is still better value and cheaper to the State to do that rather than contracting two separate vehicles and different contractors to do it. There is value delivered on that. We continue to try to utilise the capacity. Even though, as the Deputy states, there is concessionary use there, we try to ensure that where we take it in, that there is a contribution coming back into the value of the route. Those students are having to pay in to utilise it and that contributes to the value of it. What we are doing is that we never stop. We have a new management team here with a school transport officer just in place and what we are undertaking is a full structural review within our business as to who is delivering it.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> We have delivered a lot of the services directly ourselves with our own Bus Éireann fleet and drivers, supported by a lot of clerical administrative staff. We are now looking at the full needs of the scheme in conjunction with the Department. In particular, as we have recognised that as special education needs have grown, some of the assistance we must do in that regard has to grow. One does not see that cost coming up. If anything, one can see that everything we are charging through what is called the school transport management charge, which is almost a misnomer because it is a recovery of all the indirect costs of providing the service, is coming down year on year since 2008. To the Deputy's point, I can categorically state that we operate this on a cost-recovery basis. There is no profit in this for us at present. That is another matter for us, but that is within the scheme. Where there has been a surplus from one year to the next, it is identified, completely ring-fenced and brought to the Department-----</p>

The Comptroller and Auditor General report identified a surplus and it has gone back. Sometimes, as I have said here, depending on where we are, that surplus has been used, if the Department agrees, where we have needed to invest in a technology system or in more customer service support systems. We bring that to the Department and it decides whether we are allowed to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">Parents are tearing their hair out as they try to get their children to school. The surplus that is handed back should be utilised to look after parents who are in need of transport. In 2015, the level of spare capacity was 18%. Almost 20% of capacity was available in 2015. What was the situation in 2017? What is the situation in 2018? Given that we have the situation that we have, it is extraordinary that 20% of capacity is not being utilised. The 2015 figure I mentioned came from the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I would like to explain what constitutes spare capacity. Mr. Kent and Mr. Ó Foghlú have touched on this. We try to ensure we get the maximum utilisation out of all vehicles. Approximately 95% of Bus Éireann vehicles operate more than one trip, morning and evening. The same can be said of more than 60% of contractors. Even though there may be spare capacity on one of the trips, the Department is still getting a more cost-effective network and better value for money. I assure the committee that where capacity exists on a particular route, it is fully utilised to meet the demand that exists for concessionary transport on that route. If there is demand for concessionary transport, any spare places are allocated on that basis. This year, we probably have the highest number of concessionary pupils travelling. The total number is approximately 28,400. We aim to try to utilise capacity as best we can. We also have to look at capacity in the context of the value for money it provides and the utilisation we get out of the individual vehicles. I would like to touch on one other point, which is that there will always be an element of spare capacity. If 35 eligible children present for travel, one has to procure a 50-seater vehicle. There will always be cases in which a certain element of spare capacity exists anyway. The key priority for us is to look at this issue in the context of the amount of utilisation we can get out of the vehicle and the cost that the State would incur if a separate vehicle had to be procured. The two issues of utilisation and cost-efficiency are looked at in tandem.</p>

          <p eId="para_379">Some parents in Kilkenny have conducted a survey on the matter of seat utilisation. The hoarding of seats is a big issue in rural Ireland, where I come from. I am talking about seats in respect of which tickets have been allocated. I have received answers on this from Bus Éireann on several occasions. Seats are being allocated but are not being used; they are being hoarded. The survey to which I refer was conducted for a month earlier this year on the bus that brings children from Paulstown to Kilkenny. It was found that on every day of the survey, 11 seats were available on the bus - going in and coming home - and seven children were left on the side of the road. The parents did this survey themselves. The 11 seats that were not being used were being hoarded, perhaps by parents who were bringing their children to school on their way to work. Perhaps they keep these seats for rainy days on which they cannot bring their children to school. Something should be done about such terrible practices. Seven children are being passed and left on the side of the road, even though there are 11 empty seats on the bus from Paulstown to Kilkenny. I am just giving an example. I do not mean to mention my own area all the time. It is a crying disgrace to see 11 seats being left empty as the bus goes in and out, while seven children are left on the side of the road. This survey was carried out over the course of a month. It found that on average, ten or 11 seats were empty every single day. Bus Éireann or the Department should wake up and do something about this. If a seat is not used over a period of two or three weeks, it should be taken off the person who is not using it. Some allowances can be made. Parents are keeping these seats to use them on a rainy day when they are not going into Kilkenny for a work day or something like that. I am not saying I know what the situation is. It is a disgrace that 11 seats were continuously available for a month without being used, while seven children were left on the side of the road. Something should be done about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">The witnesses are welcome. I thank them for all the information. I congratulate Bus Éireann on being the first group to come before us having complied with all procurement rules. I have not seen that previously. Well done. I am aware that Bus Éireann is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General. I thank its representatives for their co-operation. The officials from the Department are present to discuss their oversight of the scheme. It is a great scheme. I know there are operational difficulties on the ground, but I will leave them for the moment and look at what we are here for. The Chairman might advise when I have two minutes left because I want to ask a practical question that relates to Connemara.</p>

          <p eId="para_408">Having got the congratulations out of the way, and having referred to the essential nature of the service, I must mention that the report is damning in respect of the Department's oversight. I realise that things have moved on since then. I suggest we should look at the conclusions in the report. Even though this is ostensibly a cost-based service, the report identifies serious flaws in the recovery of costs, particularly the management charge, which I will come to. Oversight reporting requirements were weak, there was no service level agreement, and forecasting was poor. The report makes three recommendations, within which there are a number of elements. What do the officials from the Department have to say about the serious flaws in the recovery of costs? I understand what Bus Éireann has said. The witnesses can correct me if I am wrong in my understanding that the management charge was fixed at 13% of the direct costs, regardless. It was capped at that level. There was a surplus arising from that year after year. The figure for "accumulated service" was €11.2 million when the report was compiled, but it had decreased to €6 million last year. I might be wrong, but I think it was recommended that this should be eliminated on the basis that there was no adequate explanation from the Department of how it was fixed and so on. Mr. McCarthy might correct me if I am wrong when I say the recommendation was to get rid of it. I understand it is gone now. Where has it gone to? How did it happen? If it was correctly done on a cost recovery basis, how was this charge allowed? Where has it gone to? I understand it has gone this year as a result of the special report. Is that right? It did not go on foot of any action from the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_415">I am going to come to that now. We also focused on the fixed charge. We carried out a detailed report on the fixed charge at that time as well. We concluded that the best way to reduce the fixed charge was to cap it. Previously we had a cheap seat for every child, which meant that we did not have spare capacity. When we moved away from that, the extent of the charge meant that reserves were building up, from which Bus Éireann was occasionally able to purchase buses with our agreement. The company purchased computer equipment, dealt with other matters, improved their mapping of routes and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">It arose from the arrangement we had. We looked at the value for money represented by having a seat for every child because the reserve was building up. We agreed an allocation from it, and we worked on the basis of allowing Bus Éireann to keep it from year to year. We had discussions internally and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In parallel with the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, we decided that we did not wish Bus Éireann to retain it from year to year and that we would fund any costs on an agreed basis in a year. That is the basis on which we are proceeding. It was public knowledge. We had talked about it openly at this committee. We recorded it in our accounts in 2017. It is in Bus Éireann's accounts as well.</p>

Whether it is a 44-seat or a 52-seat bus can sometimes depend on the locality being served. Part and parcel of that is that where there has been demand, particularly for concessionary seats, we will try to make sure that every seat is occupied. We also try to take into account the mixed nature of bus types we use. There is a combination of singles, 14-seaters, mid-size vehicles and bigger buses.</p>

Until we know exactly where the demand will emerge every year, we almost have to evaluate it on a year-to-year basis. To cater for that, particularly in the case of any mix or change in demand, we retender the contract. As I said, 20% of all of the service is retendered to make sure we are getting efficiency and value. Second, all of the routes continue to be reviewed. At this point we have made it clear that if there is any audit requirement, or if any way can be found to improve efficiency and utilisation, we will work with anybody who wants to review that with us.

          <p eId="para_453">If I may clarify, the point I was making earlier about spare capacity and utilisation is linked. We try to get the maximum utilisation out of a vehicle. We may require a 50-seat vehicle to operate a post-primary trip with 44 children. That bus can do a primary run which may have only 25 children on it. We will try to utilise that vehicle because it is more cost-effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">Unfortunately, it has an adverse effect on spare capacity numbers but it affords a greater level of efficiency and is far more cost-effective from a value-for-money and a departmental perspective. When one looks at the figures in isolation, it is the multiple runs where the level of spare capacity is higher. Where one vehicle is doing a single run, the levels of spare capacity are much lower.</p>

I refer to the situation in Galway, about which I want to make a general point. Children go to school, and they have tickets. If they go home at 4 p.m. or thereafter, they miss all of the after-school activities. A letter was written to us in respect of this matter and we were asked if the children could use their tickets on regular buses. In this case, it is Carraroe, ag gabháil siar do dtí Ceantar na nOileán. Those children have a choice of missing after-school activities and going home on the school bus or, with the permission of Bus Éireann, using their tickets on regular buses which are passing back towards Carraroe in any event. However, they cannot do the latter. Am I making my point clearly enough?</p>

          <p eId="para_457">Yes. Unfortunately, it would not only be our consent that would be required because one is talking about the scheduled services that are operated under the supervision of the National Transport Authority, which determines the fares and sets the fare strategy in respect of those services. We collect the revenue in the context of how those fares are set. In an ideal world, if we had integrated tickets, we all agree they might work on those services. An integrated ticket would recognise revenue on a particular trip and then revenue on another trip. Perhaps that is something we can aspire to but at the moment it is not possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">We are beyond aspiring to it. We have major changes to make in the context of climate change. We are talking here about one child but the circumstances involved are reflective of those of quite a number of people. The person who wrote that letter stated that there are over 20 students involved. Are we going to obliged 20 people to drive their children home in cars or jeeps simply because we are waiting for an ideal time when there will be integrated tickets in place?</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I referred to the balance between social policy and cost but that is also an example of where we would be creating 20 empty seats a couple of days a week on a bus. Children may choose not to take the school bus; they may take a public bus and pay for it later. The issue is that there is a public service. Whether there is space on it, I do not know. The issue is that whether the State should pay for the two seats. The first seat on the school service and the second seat on the public bus, or is it possible to rotate seats so that, potentially, somebody else could use the school bus seat. That is very difficult to manage on a day-to-day basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">On that point, there was an exchange between us and the Department. One of the notes we provided to the Department is on our estimation that we had allocated approximately 84,000 sq. m to offices and depots when we were asked to do that. It is something that would be picked up as part of an annual review of how much is being utilised depending on how many staff are in different locations. We have clerical staff in place in 16 locations in Ireland. We operate 11 depots throughout Ireland. We try to continually review the number in the fleet and how many people are in different places to determine if it is reasonable. It is probably a reasonable number as opposed to something that is scientifically apportioned. That is how we got to it. It is a reasonable number that was developed in conjunction with the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">That leads to the next question. It is something we should look at because if one is dealing with one operator, there is only one set of management and vehicles to deal with and one maintenance and health and safety strategy and so on. It is an alternative to tendering each time and going in to see if Marc MacSharry, the bus operator in Sligo, has everything he needs from a safety and organisational perspective. While there would certainly be initial capital cost in making sure the fleet was appropriate to the demand, it would be worthy of examination. Is it safe to say the scheme is designed totally based on demand? We will see what is looked for next year and then we will put a series of tenders together that will deliver for those children.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">I was thinking about where we have capacity issues in larger cities. We have a housing crisis. It is replicated in urban centres around the country. Mr. Ó Foghlú will know from parliamentary questions and representations we make to him about the smaller schools that are under pressure, where every year there is a child whose brother has a place on the school bus who cannot get one because there is a new way of measuring the route to the school which means it is not the closest school or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Bearing in mind the difficulties we have in many urban centres and in Dublin, and while there are always pressures to build new schools - I am aware of two new schools in Harold's Cross - has there been any cross-departmental analysis of the introduction of a more proactive transport scheme to try to encourage the repopulation of rural schools? Using transport as a tool might be of assistance in terms of housing and pressures in many of the urban centres. For example, school X with its facilities and infrastructure in a rural area could be built up to a viable number of students, which, in turn, would take pressure off the urban difficulties we are having in abundance throughout the country. Has any such analysis been conducted? Is there an aversion to examining something like that? I am guessing there has been no such analysis due to all of the other pressures on the Departments</p>

A number of rural schools throughout the State are under pressure and from a political perspective any councillor, Deputy or Senator would be able to verify that this is the case. We have pressures in respect of many other issues, not least school places, housing and so on. Could using school transport in that way be worth looking at?

          <p eId="para_621">I will make two comments in response. First, I can recall a case of a second level school in the west where the patron had decided to close the school. The Department did an analysis, having regard to school transport costs. Notwithstanding that the school had 250 pupils, we calculated that it was more cost efficient and of more benefit to the local community to leave a second level school in the town. There was a Catholic patron at second level and it transferred the patronage to the local VEC, as it was at the time. Work like that can be done. At a very high level, we have Project Ireland 2040 and we have economic targets to develop populations in the regions in scale. I am on the project 2040 delivery board and a lot of work is being done to bring together perspectives from the different Departments to enable economic growth, including houses and jobs. Obviously, educational infrastructure will link to that in the regions. At a high level, there is a serious policy to seek to have diversity of economic growth and capital investment from the State to support that.</p>

We deal with that through a range of agencies. The services to the islands are probably more specialised and have a very particular community sense to them. Therefore, it is the Department that leads around those areas that is responsible.

          <p eId="para_702">In terms of a good understanding of the cost base for the provision of the service, the 1975 agreement is out of date. There are certain aspects of it for which we never got an explanation, including, for instance, why a 13% add-on for management costs was ever appropriate. Part of the recommendation there was that there needs to be a better understanding of what makes up that charge, why it should be what it is and so on. Work has been done over the past number of years to try to get a better fix on the costs. We noted that the assurance that was being given on the account that is produced under the 1975 agreement was an assurance that the account was produced in the manner required under that agreement. It was not an assurance that this is an account of the cost of the service, which is what the Department is moving towards.</p>

For example, Bus Éireann could not afford to keep other buses locked up for 20 weeks of the year. It makes no sense. What percentage of buses is provided by the private sector?</p>

When making the comparison one should be comparing similar type maintenance, similar kilometres, etc. In terms of the direct provision, as will have been noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General, it has always been at a slight premium in terms of what we pay relative to the market.

That comes to more than €90 million for the 12,000 students, which is well over €7,000. All of those children with special needs must get to school, but where does the Department draw the line between offering the grant to the parents to provide their own transport and providing transport itself? If it costs €8,000 per year on average to operate this system, where does the Department decide the cut-off point is? What grant does it award? It is based on distance. What are the minimum and maximum grants?</p>

          <p eId="para_837">I am not sure what the minimum and maximum are, but I can get the Chairman that information. We have a process for allocating transport for children with special needs on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The application will come to us, signed off by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. We will then contact Bus Éireann to see if a route is currently available. There could be a special needs school transport vehicle going by the house, in which case we will just put the child on it, possibly at no additional cost or a small additional cost. If we calculate that the grant would be cheaper than amending a route then we will offer the parents a grant, but often they cannot take it because both are working, so it is not all about economics and it is addressed on each child case by case.</p>

It has led to the situation where even when long distances are involved some parents feel the grant is not sufficient. If it is in the region of €3,000 but the Department is paying €8,000 for somebody to go with a contractor on a bus, I can understand the reason some parents would be reluctant to take it up if it is in the region of €3,000.

          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward<recordedTime time="2018-12-13T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_862">I compliment the Department on its provision for special needs. It is a fantastic service. I am aware of it from a person in my family. The Department is rolling out a great service.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> We must have been hardier in my day because I used to be on a bus for an hour and a half to two and a half hours. We were hardier in the 1970s than nowadays. I did not know there were restrictions on time. At the same time, we were damn glad to get the bus.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> In a case where the bus is full and there are no tickets available if anyone is even an hour late in paying, he or she is finished for the year. I was involved in several cases where families forgot to pay over a weekend, or in one case it was only an hour late, and they were excluded for the year because they did not pay on time. There was no appeal system. Those who were late were just ruled out for the whole year until the following year. Most of them learned from that and they paid the following year.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Parents are frustrated by the notification system. They might be told on a Friday evening that even though the school is open on Monday no bus would be available. That is frustrating for parents and people in general. Working parents must make alternative arrangements. An early warning system should be in place to warn parents, for example, a month in advance, that children on concessionary tickets will not get a place on the bus. Something must be done about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> In effect, there is no appeals system. I have been through it on several occasions. An inspector comes out and makes a decision and that is the end of the story. He might come out a second time if one contacts him. The inspector covering my area is based in Waterford. However, there is never a change. Whatever decision is made is upheld and there is no come-back on it. In one case there was a third of a kilometre involved between two schools in adjacent parishes. I did the journey myself in the car based on where the children were let off the bus in the evening and the distances were equal. Even though I went to the inspector there was no give whatsoever. Three generations of a family had been to the school concerned. The family was told to go into a new parish for the sake of a third of a kilometre even though where the children were being dropped off meant it was the same distance between both schools but no one would listen. That was the end of the story. The provision of a place on a school bus was ruled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> Another case concerning health and safety has been going on for years. The Garda was contacted by parents as the bus was turning at a dangerous junction. We appealed it on several occasions. The inspector came out two or three times and said the bus would continue to turn at that point. I thought it was very cruel that they did not take the safety aspect of where they were turning into consideration. People were trying to drop children off on a bad bend in the road, and they were waiting for them with no place to park but they got no hop on that one. I do not think the appeals system is working. A better system should be in place for parents and politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> I have called on the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to amend the rules governing the school transport scheme which state that, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, nor will larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles be provided to cater for children travelling on a concessionary basis, to ensure who apply for a concessionary ticket can be accommodated. I put the same question to the Department and Bus Éireann. From an operational point of view, would Bus Éireann be open to amending the rule and would there be a significant additional cost associated with amending the rule?</p>

          <p eId="para_917">At this stage, I can safely say we have concluded our discussion. I thank the witnesses from the Departments of Education and Skills and Transport, Tourism and Sport and Bus Éireann. I thank them for the material that has been provided to the committee. We made some requests for information which Bus Éireann or one of the Departments will send directly to the committee secretariat in writing. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff. I hope the witnesses and members have a happy Christmas and wish them all the best for the new year.</p>
