CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Section 32 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may enter into co-operation agreements with a body established in the State. As I said when speaking to amendment No. 26, this section will enable an coimisiún to engage with a range of body within the State if it will assist an coimisiún to discharge its functions. The section also provides that an coimisiún may co-operate with bodies outside of the State if they are to provide similar function an coimisiún, as section 32(3) indicates. This may, in particular, include members of the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services, ERGA. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has been an active member of the European regulators group and I expect an coimisiún will maintain this strong tradition by co-operating and working with other European national regulatory authorities. Amendment No. 74 would amend section 32 4) to require that where the commission enters into an agreement to co-operate with a body, it should provide not only the Minister, as provided for in the Bill, but also the relevant Oireachtas joint committee with a copy of the agreement.  I thank the Senator for her amendment and I am absolutely in favour of the oversight of public bodies by the Oireachtas. That is why section 28 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, contains strong provisions requiring the chairperson and individual commissioners to appear before an Oireachtas committee to give account of the performance of their functions. I cannot accept the amendment as drafted because reference cannot be made to specific Oireachtas committees in legislation in the manner in the amendment. However, I will reflect on the amendment with a view to further consideration in the context of Report Stage. In doing so, I will consider the appropriate balance to be struck between parliamentary oversight and any provisions that may impinge on the independence of an coimisiún, which is provided for in section 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendments and acknowledge her expertise in the area of data protection. Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, is intended to specify the circumstances under which, and the bodies to which, the commission may disclose personal data. I believe that the intention of amendment No. 75 has been captured in section 33(2) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill. Throughout section 33(2) it is specified that the commission shall only disclose personal data where it considers that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes set out in its various paragraphs so, therefore, I do not accept the amendment. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive. Amendments No. 76 and 78 have the collective effect of preventing the commission from disclosing personal data to a broadcaster or a video on-demand service in respect of a complaint made against those services. I believe that would impact the functioning of the complaints mechanism set out in section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 11 of the Bill, which enables people to complain to the commission regarding a failure by services to comply with media service rules and codes. The complaints system is an important mechanism that has been operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and is applicable to broadcasters under the extent of the Broadcasting Act 2009. It has been extended to video on-demand services by the Bill. It is underpinned by the requirement that a broadcaster or a provider of a video on-demand service prepares and implements a code of practice for the handling of complaints, which is a requirement of section 47 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 10 of the Bill. Section 48(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 11 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may refer a complaint to the broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service in the first instance. This is a continuation of the existing provision applying to the complaints system operated by the BAI. It ensures that the broadcaster or video on-demand service should attempt to address a complaint, in the first instance, in accordance with its codes of practice for the handling of complaints. It is often not immediately clear to people unfamiliar with the complaints system operated by the BAI to whom a complaint should first be made and about what matters. This provision also ensures that an coimisiún, when it is established and comes to expand the BAI system to video on-demand services, can transfer a complaint to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service where those service providers are best placed to respond. If the complaint is not dealt with to the complainant's satisfaction then it can then be dealt with by an coimisiún. Amendment No. 77 would prevent the prescription of further bodies to whom the commission could disclose personal data. I believe that it is important that the Bill is future-proofed such that, and only after careful consideration in accordance with section 33(4), a Minister may prescribe further bodies as necessary. Amendment No. 79 would require an coimisiún to make best efforts to contact and seek the consent of a complainant prior to transferring a complaint to a broadcaster or a provider of a video on-demand service. I do not propose to accept this amendment for a number of reasons. The first reason is that the legal basis for data processing, relied upon by this section, is not consent but that the "processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller". This has been set down in the Article 6(e) of the general data protection regulation, which obliges member states when using this legal basis to set down the purpose of that processing in national law.This is what the section does with regard to the processing of personal data for the purpose of transferring complaints. The public policy rationale for using the public interest legal basis rather than the legal basis of consent was that requiring complainants to resubmit their complaints to the appropriate body is burdensome and especially onerous for vulnerable complainants. In this regard, I am conscious of the work of the expert group on an individual complaints mechanism. This section may need to be relied upon to transfer online safety complaints between public bodies if the group recommends to me, and I accept, the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. If there is concern about a lack of communication with complainants I think amendment No. 80 may address it. I will come back to this shortly. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 79. Amendment No. 81, which would require a data protection impact assessment to be undertaken prior to any such prescription, might be an important safeguard. For this reason I propose to return to further consider this on Report Stage if the Senator agrees. In a similar vein, amendment No. 80 could provide another important further safeguard in legislation. It provides that where disclosure of personal data is made by the commission to be broadcast on video-on-demand service or to a body prescribed by the Minister, all reasonable efforts shall be taken to inform the complainant of this disclosure. While I propose to reject the amendment now, I will consider it further and return to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I have outlined, I am willing to come back on Report Stage with regard to amendments Nos. 80 and 81. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 75 to 79, inclusive. With regard to the expert group, I hope to receive the report in the next week. I will then need to consider it. If we go by the amount of time the group was given to do its work, then its report is due shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for amendments Nos. 82 and 83. The amendments appear to have the same effect in preventing the commission from co-operating with groups in the establishments of standards or self-regulatory systems. I wish to point out that it will always remain open for people to complain to the commission under the relevant media service codes and rules. Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amendment by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the audiovisual media services directive and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms. Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments that would appear to contradict the directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The commission will have a strong role in regulating commercial communications, including advertisement, through the media service codes which will be binding on video-on-demand services and broadcasting services and through online safety codes which will be binding on designated online services. As I said, I cannot accept these amendments that would appear to contradict the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. That directive also requires member states to foster self-regulation. This section also covers, apart from advertisement, for example, co-operation with the Press Council. I cannot foresee any language there because I cannot contradict the directive. I am not accepting these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In the context of amendment No. 84, I would be concerned that as it is drafted it would have the unintended consequence of preventing an employee of an coimisiún from seeking to influence any considerations of an coimisiún regarding the contract of that employee. This would seem to prevent employees from representing their interests to their employer, namely, an coimisiún. The provision in the Bill, as currently drafted, was designed to prevent such scenarios from occurring. Accordingly I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 37 (2)(a) and (2)(b), which the Senator is seeking to delete, are about a person’s contract with an coimisiún; they are not about the requirements of disclosure regarding a person’s activities in terms of an employment contract. It is about a person’s contract; it is not about the requirements for disclosure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, they have a duty in the context of disclosure. This section is about a person's contract.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for bringing forward this amendment, which would have the effect of obliging all public bodies engaged in the distribution of State monies for the production, screening and broadcasting of audiovisual or sound content to ensure that funds are distributed equitably and proportionately throughout the whole island of Ireland, with particular regard to the need for regional balance in investment and representation in audiovisual, screen and sound content. For a number of reasons, I will not be accepting it. At its widest, and taking the specific bodies referenced in the amendment, a definition of "public bodies" could cover the Revenue Commissioners, in its role regarding the application of section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland, in regard to making development and production loans available, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, in the context of the Sound & Vision scheme, TG4, regarding its role in commissioning content, and RTÉ, in terms of funding for independent production through the independent production account established under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act. Each of the funds disbursed by those bodies may come from two sources. The first is the Exchequer, in the form of funding from section 481, Screen Ireland loans and TG4. The second is from the licence fee, in the form of funding from RTÉ, and the Sound & Vision scheme. While I appreciate the intent in regard to ensuring more balanced regional development and representation, the amendment contains a number of fundamental elements that would render it unworkable due to the nature of the audiovisual sector in the State and potential issues relating to EU Law. In the case of TG4, for example, as a publisher broadcaster, it commissions all of its content production from Gaeltacht-based companies, largely in Galway but also in Cork and Waterford. Obliging TG4 to distribute funding equitably and proportionately throughout the whole island of Ireland could undermine its current commissioning model and the range of independent production companies that support this. It is natural that production companies providing for TG4 would be concentrated in Gaeltacht areas because more fluent Irish speakers live there. I would be worried about the unintended consequences for TG4 if we are providing that funding should be spread evenly. This amendment would also impact on the operation of the section 481 film tax credit. The relief is distributed by the Revenue Commissioners and is technically open to any EU-based company that meets the qualifying criteria. As a result, restricting the application of this relief to the island of Ireland, as suggested in the amendment, would actually appear to be a contravention of EU law. I agree that seeking balanced regional development is important, and it is an objective of the Government. That is the objective behind the national planning framework, and it underpins the national development plan. However, I do not think it is appropriate to place such an objective in legislation as proposed by the Senators. The amendment actually appears to be contrary to EU law and could give rise to a number of unintended consequences.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I appreciate the intent but I just cannot accept the amendment as drafted because there are a few fundamental issues with it.If the Senator wants to have a discussion with my officials about what he is trying to achieve, that could be done because there are a number of complex issues - even about the role of the commission in this and what the Senator is trying to achieve. I am happy to ask my officials to engage with the Senator. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, I understand the intention behind this amendment and take the point that it can be very troubling for people living on the island of Ireland, be they Irish citizens or not, to watch their public service broadcasters and seeing their part of the island of Ireland effectively blacked out or removed. However, I would be concerned about accepting an amendment that would be so prescriptive as to what RTÉ and TG4 could or could not display. Under section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence as regards programming content. The purpose of this independence is to prevent political interference in the operation of RTÉ and TG4. Prescribing the format or content of any programming in such a detailed manner, including how data is presented, no matter how well-intentioned, would run contrary to the principle of editorial independence and I do not think it is appropriate for us as legislators to determine the type of content that should be displayed so specifically. While this amendment is clearly seeking to prevent the recurrence of something that offended and hurt many people, it could set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation. As that is something we should seek to avoid in principle, I cannot accept the amendment. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 46A(6) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by section 8, requires an coimisiún to publish the register of video-on-demand services established in Ireland on its own website. Amendment No. 90 would require the commission to furnish a copy of this register to the relevant Oireachtas committee annually. I am not sure I see the value in this amendment, given that the register will be made publicly available by the commission under section 46A(6) and through the European Commission under Article 2.5b of the audiovisual media service directive. I propose to reject the amendment as it would appear to require the provision of information that will actually be in the public domain.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendment. The figure of €2 million is derived from the definition of a media business set out in Part 3A of the Competition Act 2002, as amended, which provides for the media mergers framework. For reasons of consistency and proportionality, I believe that we should continue to use this figure and cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The media in different jurisdictions may be different. Section 46I of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as inserted by section 9 of the Bill provides for a definition of "relevant media service provider". This is important as some of the duties and aspects of the media service code set out in section 9 of the Bill, such as those related to objectivity and impartiality, apply to this category of provider rather than to all providers of audiovisual on-demand media services. I believe consistency is important in these matters, as is alignment between the Bill and the media mergers framework.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 would have the effect of changing a requirement for broadcast and video on-demand services not to broadcast or make available, "anything which may reasonably be regarded as causing harm or offence", to a requirement not to broadcast or make available"anything that may reasonably be regarded as causing harm to a group of persons, or a member of a group, based on any of the grounds referred to in Article 21 of the Charter [of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]". In terms of the reference to the charter in amendment No. 93, I note that section 46J(1)(d) which this amendment seeks to amend as section 46J(1)(a) already requires that service providers not broadcast or make available "anything which may reasonably be regarded as likely to incite to violence or hatred directed against a group of persons, or a member of a group, based on any of the grounds referred to in Article 21 of the Charter". This reference is to give effect to Article 6 of the revised audiovisual and media services directive. Going further than the directive in reference to the charter, without a firm basis in existing EU legislation, may give rise to unintended consequences. Given one of the grounds in Article 21 of the charter is a, "political or ... other opinion", the amendment may inadvertently prevent criticism of political groups. Accordingly, I propose to reject the amendment. In terms of the outright deletion proposed by amendment No. 92, I cannot accept this for two reasons. One of the reasons is that this requirement, in part, transposes the requirement in the revised audiovisual and media services directive for member states to ensure that media service providers do not make available programmes which may impair the mental, moral or physical development of children. The second reason is that I believe it is correct that media service providers are held to a high standard in terms of the programmes they, as editorial services, make available to the general public and as such, this provision has value and serves the public good.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is the value of debate in the House. I can see the point the Senator is raising. While the Senator's definition is too wide, I can see the issues she is raising and recognise there is an issue in the language. I propose not to accept amendment No. 93 but to ask my officials to look at the language of what is there, given the concerns that have been flagged in the House today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendment and contribution. She knows the exact background to this in respect of amendments Nos. 94 and 95. I agree on first examination that some of the wording in the Bill does look old-fashioned, particularly the language in section 46J(1) which requires: “A broadcaster [or] an audiovisual on-demand media service [not to broadcast or] make available … anything which may reasonably be regarded as tending to undermine the authority of the State". As the Senator has correctly pointed out, that language has been carried over from existing provisions set out in section 39(1)(d) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009 which, in turn, reflects previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution, which sets out that:The State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.I would note that while the understanding of the country of the meaning of this article has definitely changed over time, it does contain and imply a number of fundamental rights, including freedom of expression, while acknowledging that such rights may be limited in the public interest. This notion of fundamental rights needs to be balanced, depending on the facts on the ground, and that they are not absolute is something that we can all agree on. This article requires the State to limit freedom of expression in certain instances and the courts have since set a high bar as to when it is appropriate for the State to do so. It is right that this language and associated jurisprudence is carried forward through the Bill. As such, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 94 and 95 but I understand the Senator’s position.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did say the court has set that high bar. This is a tried and tested provision which reflects the safeguards contained in the Constitution. It has been operated in a balanced way in the years since it has been on the Statute Book. As a result, I will not be accepting amendments No. 94 and 95.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The ability of the media to freely and independently express opinion is both a core value and a cornerstone of democracy. Without free and independent media, a well-informed citizenry cannot exist and democracy cannot function in any meaningful sense of the word. That is what the Constitution provides for and what this Bill reflects. Within that framework, investigative journalism plays an important role. I absolutely understand the intention behind amendment No. 97, which seeks to mitigate a perceived risk that the Bill, as initiated, would undermine the ability of media service providers to carry news and current affairs content which is critical of the Government or public officials or would have an adverse effect on investigative journalism. I do not think, however, that section 46(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, needs to be qualified in the manner suggested by the amendment. The language used in the section reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act, which has not to date exercised a chilling effect on broadcast journalism. For the same reason, I do not accept amendment No. 97.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The functions of the commission safeguard liberty of expression and explicitly safeguard the democratic values in the Constitution. The text that is proposed to be deleted and-or replaced has been carried forward from the Broadcasting Act 2009. It has been on the Statute Book for more than a decade. To date, we are not aware of any adverse impact on public discourse or investigative journalism from those provisions. As a result, I will not accept amendment No. 97.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As Senators will be aware, an coimisiún will be responsible for issuing permanent and temporary sound broadcasting contracts following enactment of the Bill and dissolution of the BAI. The amendment requires an coimisiún to receive the approval of an Oireachtas joint committee before authorising a derogation from the requirement that a sound broadcasting service shall devote not less than 20% of the broadcasting time on the service to news and current affairs programmes. Granting such derogations is a matter that should be left to the commission to undertake as an independent regulatory authority and I, therefore, cannot accept the amendment. The BAI currently grants such derogations.I remind Senators that licences are for a finite period. It is a key principle that an coimisiún should be able to make regulatory decisions free from external interference, particularly from political bodies, as is required by the audiovisual media services directive. Requiring specific approval, as the Senator referred to in her question on the political side, by an Oireachtas committee may represent undue interference in the regulatory independence of an coimisiún, which would be likely to approve a number of temporary sound broadcasting contracts throughout the year, such as that for Christmas FM. There is also the practical consideration that Oireachtas committees fall on the dissolution of the Dáil and would therefore not be available to approve a derogation at certain stages. Consider how long it took the past two Governments to form. The committees were gone for some time. That could be an issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Acting Chairperson. I am not accepting the amendment for two reasons. There is the political interference and difficulties with the Oireachtas committee, which Senator Higgins accepted, but also the fact that the BAI already grants such derogations. That will be carried over by an coimisiún and licences are for a finite period, which has not caused an issue to this point.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the intent of amendments Nos. 102, 106, 127 and 148. I agree with the Senators that gambling addiction poses a major challenge to our society, particularly when it involves children and young people. This is why the establishment of a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being with the powers to regulate advertising gambling websites and apps was a commitment in the programme for Government. The Minister for Justice published the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill last October. That Bill will establish a new regulatory authority, namely, the gambling authority of Ireland. Specifically, head 109 of the general scheme sets out that the authority shall make codes concerning the advertising of gambling. These codes may include restrictions or prohibitions concerning such matters as the times of day that gambling may be advertised on broadcasters, video on demand and audiostreaming services; an option for a customer of a video on-demand service to opt out of receiving advertising and a requirement that a video-sharing platform service should not display gambling by default but should require an opt-in mechanism. The general scheme also requires the gambling regulator to engage with an coimisiún on such codes to facilitate joined-up thinking on the regulation of advertising.Given that the Gambling Authority of Ireland will issue codes in respect of advertising, I do not propose to accept these amendments. It would not be an effective use of resources or coherent policy to mandate two regulatory authorities to regulate the same matter. Senators have spoken about this. Given its remit, role and specialisation, the Gambling Authority of Ireland will be the best place to regulate the advertising of gambling. As regards speculative financial activities, the Central Bank of Ireland regulates the advertising of financial activities by financial services firms under its remit. The rules are set out in the consumer protection code published by the Central Bank. To make a general point, I recognise that crypto-assets pose a significant challenge for consumer protection. In that regard, I note the EU markets in crypto-assets regulation is currently under negotiation in Brussels. It will set out a licensing regime for crypto-assets. However, fundamentally, it will be for authorities other than an coimisiún with specific expertise to set out the primary rules for regulating the advertising of crypto-assets. While I do not accept these amendments, I recognise their intent and the points the Senators have made today. Gambling is a scourge for many families. On the broader issue raised by Senators Cassells and Byrne in amendment No. 28, which relates to the role of an coimisiún regarding gambling addiction, I have committed to speaking to my colleague the Minister for Justice on the matter in advance of returning to that amendment on Report Stage.
