CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome Mr. Hayes. I also acknowledge the work of his predecessor, Mr. Eamon Stack, and the important work he has done in the role. I am quite moved by the presentation, which was not typical of what we get. It is a breath of fresh air.It is what Mr. Hayes will lend to the role. I thank him for sharing his personal story of Eavan Kate and his whole family with us. It struck me when he said the singular mark of civilised society was to care for the most vulnerable, the voiceless and the disabled. At the very end Mr. Hayes said the most important person is the child, the adolescent and the adult recipient of the services, and they are at the heart and centre of everything the council does. If that is the case, I do not see how the NCSE can go wrong with Mr. Hayes at the helm. I thank Mr. Hayes for his invitation to the research conference and I am sure if members are free, the committee will send a representation. What are the two biggest challenges facing special needs education and how should they be addressed?
