CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the deputations for their presentations. We are all in agreement that we cannot continue with things as they are. Until something changes, the quality of education in Ireland - something we have always been proud of - will plummet. I have concerns similar to those raised by other members in respect of access. I taught in a DEIS school for 16 years and I have seen the joy when the first child in a family declares intent to go to third level. I have concerns that this move would diminish that incentive and that the loan would frighten the child, especially when they turn to parents who do not fit the typical support model to which the rest of us may be accustomed. They may not get the necessary support at home. Those are my thoughts on that point. I am keen to hear from all the deputations on the potential impact of loans on emigration. The statistics show that 20% of graduates emigrate and 10% emigrate on a permanent basis. If it is the case that a person who stays abroad would not have to pay back the loans - it appears that it might be - will this lead to a complete brain drain? Will our most wonderful and brilliant graduates stay abroad rather than repay? One impact is that the loans would not be paid back and we would suffer the loss of wonderful graduates. That needs to be explored. How does Dr. Day see Brexit impacting on our universities and institutes of technology? My final question is a general question for all three deputations. I am curious about the drop-out rates, including the drop-out rates from universities to institutes of technology and from institutes of technology to post leaving certificate courses. When students discover a lack of suitability and change around there is a loss of fees. Is there a broader issue? Do we need to explore something like the dual system in Germany? Would that help to address it? Is that something this country should explore?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is great to hear all three of the presenters today. While there may not be consensus here on how education should be funded, everyone would be in agreement that the three presenters are wonderful ambassadors for the youth of the country. I say, "Well done," on fantastic presentations and how they care for the future generations. The concerns I expressed earlier were particularly highlighted by Ms Hayes-Nally's presentation. When one thinks of a family of five ranging in age from 17 to ten, already Ms Hayes-Nally is worried about a burden of €100,000 being placed on her family. I note the love that her mother has given her for education and how obvious is the love that Ms Hayes-Nally has for her Mum, and that Ms Hayes-Nally is concerned that her mother may loose her daughter, as we expressed earlier the concern about emigration. How do all three presenters answer those who say this is not a loan as we know it? How do they answer the assertion that this is not a mortgage, it is not the typical debt and one will not be saddled with debt for life? How do they answer that? Ms Hoey rightly pointed out that when we talk about access it is getting in, staying in and beyond. Often I have mentioned here the deficit in resources in college. Ms Hoey mentioned the path to resources in keeping students in college that is lacking because of that deficit. Ms Hoey referred to the USI having done research on publicly funded models in other countries. Would Ms Hoey, or indeed, Mr. McNulty, elaborate on what the USI found out from that and the impact it has had on the countries in question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. Richard Kennedy for his presentation. As with my colleagues, I would like clarity on his position on income contingent loans. I have concerns, as I say every time we discuss the Cassells report, about equality of access to education and these income contingent loans. We could lose our most skilled graduates to emigration because if they emigrate they will probably not be chased to repay the loans. How much more will employers be willing to pay into the national training fund? At the moment, it raises €350 million but ICTU want it to be raised to €700 million. What say does ICTU currently have over how that €350 million is spent? If it was increased, what say would it like to have?
