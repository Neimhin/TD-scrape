CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Ireland is resolute in its solidarity and support for Ukraine and we are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. More than 63,000 people who have been forced to leave their homes in Ukraine have sought refuge in Ireland, and approximately 45,000 of these people are being provided with accommodation from the State. However, this war is causing ongoing challenges such as rising energy prices, scarcity of energy supply and supply chain issues including accommodation. This is by some distance the largest humanitarian operation undertaken by the Irish State, and tourism accommodation has played a vital part in this national response. However, I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry about how the amount of tourism bed stock taken out of the system for humanitarian reasons is likely to have a real impact on tourism's recovery in 2023 and beyond. In addition, hotel accommodation is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families, and this is why the Government is exploring a wide range of alternative options, including the rolling out of a rapid-build housing programme to provide accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. My officials have communicated these concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which is working urgently across government and with agencies, NGOs and local authorities to bring new accommodation on board so that the State's humanitarian responsibilities can be met. In addition, my Department is participating in the senior officials' group that is focusing on meeting the current humanitarian accommodation and other needs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster. As I said, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. More than 45,000 Ukrainian people have sought accommodation from the State in addition to more than 16,000 international protection applicants. This compares with 7,500 at the same time last year. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department has sourced accommodation for the equivalent of the population of Waterford city in the past six months. My officials have communicated concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, especially in respect of the peak period, which starts from around St. Patrick's Day onwards. I have communicated these concerns also to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. That is why I am glad my Department is represented on that senior officials' group that is focusing on meeting the current humanitarian accommodation and other needs and conveying the concerns of the tourism sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Hotel accommodation has been seen from the very beginning as a short term solution. It is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families. That is why the Government is exploring the wide range of alternative options, including the rolling out of a rapid-build housing programme. The use of tourist accommodation to meet humanitarian needs, while necessary in the short term, has obviously led to concerns for everyone involved in tourism, from what I have heard from engagement with the sector. My Department is represented on the senior officials' group on this issue. In addition, my Department has regular engagement with the sector representatives on a range of issues, including this. Department officials will next meet with the tourism agencies and tourism sector representatives on 6 December 2022. There is ongoing engagement with the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and between me and the Minister, and I have conveyed the concerns of the industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá sé ríthábhachtach domsa go dtugtar stádas comhionann don Ghaeilge i ngach réimse den saol, ach go háirithe i leith na craoltóireachta, a bhfuil ról ríthábhachtach aici i múnlú fhéiniúlacht agus chultúr na hÉireann. As the Deputy will recall, this issue of potential pay discrepancies between workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta and their English language counterparts, and the ongoing review by RTÉ of its grading structure, was raised during Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill on 26 October last. I know it is something of which Deputy Munster has been cognisant and has brought to the fore. At that time, if she remembers, I undertook to seek clarification from RTÉ on the issue and to respond to the committee. On foot of this, my officials wrote to RTÉ seeking such clarification, and in response RTÉ has provided further detail on the ongoing review process. I am informed that the review process involves a detailed and full evaluation of all staff roles and grades, including an assessment of the organisation's skills and requirements as a modern media organisation. I am aware that when the matter was raised with RTÉ by the Committee of Public Accounts earlier this year, at the meeting to which Deputy Munster referred, the director general confirmed that a comparison between Irish language workers and their English language counterparts was not specifically included in the terms of reference for the current process. However, it is designed to enable RTÉ to devise a simplified grading structure with fairness and transparency across all roles, including those in Raidió na Gaeltachta. The process is ongoing and is likely to be concluded in June of next year. The Deputy will be aware that, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009, RTÉ is independent in the pursuit of its objects, both in terms of editorial decisions and its day-to-day management and operational activities. However, parity of esteem for the Irish language is very important and, therefore, I share the Deputy's concerns to ensure there is no disparity in pay that is purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work. As such, I have written to RTÉ this week asking that it communicates directly with the joint committee to set out how this process could address the committee's concerns about the terms of employment of Irish language workers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I share the Deputy’s concern to make sure there is no disparity in pay. That is why, after Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I committed to the Oireachtas joint committee that we would have follow-up discussions with RTÉ, which my officials did. I have written to RTÉ, with regard to disparity in pay which is purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work, outlining that there must be equality. While those in RTÉ, through the engagement with officials, have provided further detail on the ongoing process, I have asked them to communicate directly with the committee to set out how the process will address the pay disparity. I think we are on the same page in keeping a focus on this.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Parity of esteem for the Irish language is very important. I have asked RTÉ in my communication with it this week that it communicates directly with the joint committee to set out this process, which I think will address what the Deputy is looking for, and set out how that process could address the committee's concerns about the terms of employment of Irish language workers. I do not wish to pre-empt what further clarity RTÉ might provide but I am more than happy to continue the engagement with RTÉ on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	.As I set out in my response to Deputy Munster on the issue of potential pay discrepancies between workers in Raidió na Gaeltachta and their English language counterparts, RTÉ is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of its staff grading structure. I am advised that this process involves a root-and-branch evaluation of all staff roles and grades, including an assessment of the skills needs and requirements of the organisation. It is designed to enable RTÉ to devise a streamlined grading structure with fairness and transparency across all roles, including those in Raidió na Gaeltachta. The review is ongoing and I understand it is likely to conclude in June next year. Deputy Munster asked for clarification in that regard. Tá sé ríthábhachtach domsa go dtugtar stádas comhionann don Ghaeilge i ngach réimse den saol, ach go háirithe i leith na craoltóireachta. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá ról ríthábhachtach aici i múnlú féiniúlacht agus chultúr na hÉireann. It is of critical importance to me that the Irish language is given equal status in all spheres of life, but particularly in respect of broadcasting, which serves such a crucial role in shaping Irish identity and culture. I would therefore share the Deputy's concerns with regard to ensuring there is no disparity in pay that is purely related to the language through which a person conducts his or her work. I am aware the Committee of Public Accounts has raised its concerns on this matter with RTÉ directly and that RTÉ has committed to providing an update to that committee in due course. As the Deputy will recall, the issue was also raised with me on Committee Stage of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. As I stated to the Deputy's colleague, issues relating to staffing and remuneration are operational matters for RTÉ and I am mindful of its statutory independence in these matters, as set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. Nevertheless, my officials have engaged with RTÉ to seek further clarity on the matter and will continue to monitor the progress and outcome of the review process in the context of the Department's corporate governance oversight of RTÉ. Notwithstanding this, I consider it necessary and important for RTÉ to address comprehensively the concerns raised by the committee in respect of the pay of Irish language workers, and I have written to RTÉ asking that it respond to the joint committee in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I outlined in my replies to the Deputy and to Deputy Munster, both of whom I thank for raising this important issue, parity of esteem between the Irish and English languages is vital and so I share the Deputy's concerns in respect of any disparity in pay purely related to the language through which a person conducts his or her work. Although we have been told the ongoing review is not specifically designed to address any disparity in the remuneration of Irish language workers at RTÉ compared with their English language counterparts, the current review process is examining all roles in the organisation. While RTÉ has provided further detail on the ongoing process, I have written to ask it to address the specific concerns of the committee, to communicate with the joint committee, and to set out how the process will address pay disparity. I do not wish to pre-empt any further clarity RTÉ might provide but I am happy to engage further with it on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I have to emphasise that this is a matter for RTÉ, given its statutory independence. My Department has no role in the day-to-day administrative or operational functions of RTÉ and, therefore, I cannot direct it in matters relating to staff remuneration. It is vital, however, that there is parity of esteem between both languages. There should also be transparency and clarity on the grading of and, by extension, remuneration for workers, regardless of the language through which their work is conducted. That is why I asked RTÉ to provide greater clarity and address Members' concerns regarding the remuneration of Irish-language staff and how this process will achieve this. On the Deputy's specific question, it would be more prudent to await the outcome of the review before I jump to any conclusions. I will assess where we are when I see that review.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My role and that of my departmental officials in tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy development and in securing resources to assist the tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in implementing that policy. With regard to specific expenditure by Fáilte Ireland from its Exchequer funding allocations, such decisions are an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland, as the national tourism development authority. Neither I, nor my Department, has any role in decisions by the authority regarding its operational funding priorities and related expenditure. On future funding, Fáilte Ireland is unable to commit to any funding at this time as there are currently no schemes open for application. Fáilte Ireland has, however, pledged its full support to the company that will be charged with steering the development of King John's Castle going forward. Indeed, a Fáilte Ireland representative will sit on the board of the newly-formed company. The Limerick City and County Council takeover of King John's Castle has been a big step forward for the success of the castle and the implications for the wider tourism economy will be far-reaching. As the council only took ownership in April, I am advised that the focus for the summer season was to steady the ship operationally first. King John's Castle had a very successful summer that was full of events, including high-profile concerts, encouraging visitor feedback, and high-profile media coverage nationally and internationally. Fáilte Ireland continues to support King John's Castle through a number of enterprise supports, including, but not limited to, saleable experience and digital that delivers. This is against the backdrop of continued investment in Limerick by Fáilte Ireland, including funding, which will develop a thematic city quarter cluster approach to introduce visitors to each distinctive area of the city and link existing visitor attractions to supporting experiences. From a wider perspective on tourism capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a tourism sector that is sustainable from environmental, social, and economic perspectives. Fáilte Ireland's priority areas for tourism capital investment include the development and enhancement of tourist attractions and activity-based tourism to provide the type and quality of experience that visitors are seeking. Our overall tourism product offering has led to Ireland being recognised internationally as a year-round, high-quality tourism destination in both urban and rural settings.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, Fáilte Ireland will have a representative sitting on the board of the newly-formed company. It has pledged full support to the company that will be charged with the development and steering of it. As the Deputy agreed, the company has had quite a successful summer in steadying the ship, with those wonderful events and concerts and high-profile media coverage, which is good, not just for King John's Castle but the wider area. I am quite happy to visit King John's Castle and undertake other engagements in Limerick; I can chat to the Deputy about that. I will link in with my officials to see where that can be arranged in the diary. I look forward to it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, the tourism offering in Limerick is vast and within the development of our new national tourism policy, where some consultation is now happening with stakeholders, there will be public consultation in the new year. We are looking to put sustainability at the heart of tourism. That includes all-year-round tourism and driving it out in order that visitors do not just arrive at the capital city for a few days but explore the regions. That is significant. Our greenways, as we have in Limerick, and blueways or waterways, are key to that. On Foynes, we have the Foynes Flying Boat & Maritime Museum, which has received €1.5 million from the rural regeneration development fund. We should also consider everything that has been done regarding outdoor dining facilities and funding for the Limerick greenway. As I said, there is significant potential there. On Adare, the Ryder Cup 2027 will be massive for Limerick. I look forward to that and to engaging on it. Fáilte Ireland sees the massive potential in that, as does Tourism Ireland. It is being talked about worldwide at every event members of those bodies attend.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together. The basic income for the arts, BIA, pilot was a key priority for me as Minister with responsibility for arts and culture. I see this scheme as an important intervention to support the arts sector recover after the devastation wreaked by the Covid pandemic. Covid clearly highlighted both the precarious nature of working in the arts but more so, it shone a light on the importance of the arts for us all. It is well established that artists suffer from precarious incomes. The scheme will research the impact of providing the security of a basic income on the creative practice of artists and creative arts workers. The pilot was also the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery taskforce, which I established in 2020 to examine ways in which to help the arts recover post-pandemic. I was very pleased to have been able to deliver on this recommendation with the first payments on the scheme being made to recipients two weeks ago. A total of 2,000 recipients are being paid €325 a week for three years while 1,000 control group members are being paid €650 per year to engage in the data collection. The scheme will cost €35 million per year and €105 million in total. A total of 1,992 recipients have received their payments to date. A small number of participants have decided not to accept their place on the scheme and these places will be reallocated shortly. It will be weighted in such a way that they will be treated in the same way as the 2,000 original applicants were selected. The research will examine over a three-year period the impact of a basic income-style payment on artists and creative arts workers. This research element is a hugely important part of the pilot scheme. The scheme recognises that there is a vast body of often unpaid or underpaid time that goes into the making of the creative work that we as a society enjoy. The ambition of the scheme is that by providing the security of a basic income, artists and creative arts workers can focus on artistic work and be in a position to increase their earnings from their creative practice as a self-employed artist or creative. I have established the scheme very firmly as a research project so that an evidence base can be developed around the impact of the policy. The scheme is a randomised control trial that consists of two groups of randomly selected people. The treatment group will receive the basic income while the control group will not receive it. Analysis of the results will involve a comparison of averages between the two groups. As the groups have the same characteristics at baseline and are large enough to be a statistically representative sample, any difference arising during the trial can be assumed to have been caused by the policy. I am very grateful to all the applicants who agreed to participate in the control group. Being able to compare and track their careers against those who will receive the BIA will be essential in demonstrating the impact of the payment on artists and their creative practices. Participants will be surveyed at least twice a year and will keep a journal so they are in a position to give accurate data. Focus groups, interviews and seminars will also happen to collect more qualitative data on how the scheme is impacting participants' lives. Baselining research information has been received from recipients who have accepted their place on the scheme so that research has already kicked off. Research findings on the impact of the pilot on the individuals and their practices, the sector and ecology of the arts in Ireland will form an important part of the pilot. Data on income and earnings, time use, work and job quality, well-being and mental health will be collected using a longitudinal survey every six months plus focus groups, interviews and art form specific research topics. The Government wants to give recognition to the value of the arts and the role of creative practice in Irish society. That is what this pilot scheme is all about. It is about addressing the earnings instability that can be associated with the intermittent, periodic and often project-based nature of work in the arts. I believe that the BIA pilot scheme is a once-in-a-generation, transformational measure in the funding of the arts in Ireland. It makes a strong statement at home and abroad about the value that Ireland as a nation places on artistic practice both for its intrinsic value and in terms of our personal and collective well-being and also in terms of its importance to our identity and cultural distinctiveness on the global stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A total of €25 million was allocated for this year because we knew we would not have a full year of basic income and that it would take time to get the randomised process up and running to do the engagement. I welcome and appreciate the Deputy's constructive engagement throughout this process. He has been very supportive of this scheme, which I think comes from his and his family's direct experience of the arts. All will get the full three years of payment. That is guaranteed regardless of when it started. It is a three-year project. It started on 29 August 2022 and will be a three-year project. My plan is for the savings in 2022 will be re-purposed and we will give further consideration to that but it is guaranteed to be €35 million per year and to be a full three-year project.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is my plan to re-purpose. The details will be available shortly. It will support artists, energy supports they need and the issues that affect the arts, like any other sector. In respect of 2025, the research piece is ongoing. We already have the baseline from the participants who received their payment. Something will be published every six months so we will see the benefits and impact of it as it is ongoing so it will not be the case that suddenly in August 2025 we will have the effect of this. We will have that continuous assessment from the control group and the 2,000 successful applicants.
