CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the report before the House. This report was created following a series of engagements we in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills had on the topic of relationships and sexuality education with stakeholders from a variety of different sectors of the education system - students, teachers, educational institutions and NGOs working in this area and on inclusion issues - over the course of four modules. It was clear from this engagement the change which has been occurring in Ireland's national mindset over the past number of years and which continues to occur in relation to relationships and sex education, and how essential it is that the education system reflect fully, in an informed and responsible way, that change. The current curriculum was introduced in 1999 and a considerable amount of changes across society have occurred since then. While I welcome and endorse all of the recommendations contained in the report, I wish to highlight what was for me the most important theme running through all of the presentations we heard, which was the need for inclusion and inclusivity. Although the national mindset may have shifted greatly over the last number of years, issues of inclusivity have always been present and the horrendous treatment of marginalised groups, such as those from the LGBTQI+ community, in the Ireland of the past must be recognised. In order to include everyone properly, proper respect for human rights, gender equality and diversity is essential in any curriculum. Being cognisant and respecting the great array of diversity in Irish relationships, sexualities and family structures is essential for every student to learn in supporting young people to understand and learn about themselves, as well as to learn about and understand their peers and to develop strong, healthy relationships with others. The recommendations in this report provide a roadmap for developing a modern, fair and respectful relationships and sexuality education programme and I call on the Minister and the State bodies tasked with reform in this area to engage properly and take on board the recommendations. I welcome the NCCA's review of RSE. I welcome much of the engagement made so far under this review, particularly the engagement with students whose views on curricula and teaching methods are too often not valued as importantly as they should be. Indeed, I commend the various student bodies which have had their voice heard throughout this process. I also welcome the finding that teachers need more in-depth and sustained training in the area of SPHE-RSE. It can no longer be that the teacher draws the short straw when the timetable is being drawn up at the end of the school year that he or she is "on". Although the teachers are willing and always ready, they need to be equipped, resourced and trained. That is what is fair on the teacher and that is what is ultimately fair on the student. It is essential in equipping teachers, both in-service for all teachers and providing a specialist postgraduate qualification in SPHE-RSE, to best support students in this aspect of their education. Training should also be provided for boards of management and other bodies within schools. Similarly, supports need to be provided for parents in the area of SPHE and RSE because it cannot be up to the schools alone and parents must have the support and encouragement they need to assist their child in their learning. Engaging all of the various groups — students, teachers, parents and communities — is vital in creating a comprehensive approach to this issue. The report before us acknowledges a need to move to a more nuanced and inclusive curriculum. The topics of relationships and sexuality are complex and students will come to the classroom with varying experiences and needs. Making sure that the programme is fully inclusive of the wide range of diverse human experiences is hugely important, not only in tackling discrimination and othering of non-heterosexual experiences, but also in helping students to understand their own feelings and those of their classmates. The report also presents a realistic understanding of what students require from RSE, which is hugely important in equipping young people for the challenges they face. Issues about sexual consent or the negative impact of pornography are ones that affect everyone and it is high time that we discussed them in an educational space. It is particularly important that consent is taught consistently throughout a student's school experience and in terms of positive sexual relations, delivered in an affirming context where positively framed sexual experiences are the focus. I strongly endorse the call in this report for strong oversight of external facilitators of RSE, either by the Department of Education and Skills or by the HSE. Ensuring that the programme is delivered at a consistent standard, with evidence-based teaching, is important for students. Like previous speakers, I also draw the Minister's attention to recommendations Nos. 14 and 15. The former states: "The Committee recommends that the Education Act 1998 be amended or at least reviewed, so that ethos can no longer be used as a barrier to the effective, objective and factual teaching of the RSE and SPHE curriculum to which every student is entitled." That is why the committee requests that clarity is given by the Department as soon as possible "regarding how schools and colleges, under religious patronage, should implement a comprehensive RSE programme so that all children and young people are treated equally." Throughout our work on this report, it was apparent that the level of RSE varied hugely between schools. No student should have to miss out on a comprehensive RSE simply because of where he or she goes to school. The curriculum must be delivered in a consistent and inclusive manner to all students and from an earlier age.
