CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Is mór on onóir dom a bheidh anseo inniu. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as cuireadh a thabhairt dom teacht chuig Seanad Éireann inniu. Tá sé go hiontach an deis a fháil léargas a thabhairt don Teach ar an gclár Sábháilte le Cruthú. I am very pleased that the Members of Seanad Éireann are engaging with this crucially important initiative, Safe to Create, which is a new programme for the arts and culture sector that I launched last month. Safe to Create is a dignity at work programme. It is the culmination of our work to date on dignity at work, led by programmes such as Speak Up and Call it Out, Speak Up: A Call for Change, and Minding Creative Minds. I emphasise that this is our work to date because although we are at the cutting edge of action in this area, we are really only getting started. The aim of the Safe to Create programme is to transform culture and practices in the arts, culture and creative sector through raising awareness and providing training, information, voluntary compliance and certification in order that we can provide safer working conditions for artists and arts workers as well as providing key support for victims and survivors in the areas of reporting, counselling and legal advice. My Department works in partnership with the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Minding Creative Minds to deliver the Safe to Create programme. I provide annual funding to the Irish Theatre Institute and to Minding Creative Minds to deliver their services to the creative sector. The Safe to Create platform provides an effective, user-friendly, online dignity at work toolkit for organisations and individuals in the creative sector, including "know your rights" information for artists and arts workers; free counselling, legal assistance and a 24-7 helpline for artists and arts workers; resources for organisations including legislation, codes, policies and sample HR procedures and templates; a code of behaviour and dignity at work trust statement; Sign the Code, which is an online register for organisations and individuals to formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to implement it; and training to address dignity at work issues.Safe to Create is available to all individuals and organisations in the Irish arts and creative sector. I encourage Senators to explore the website, www.safetocreate.ie, and view the range of information, training and resources. The website, like the programme itself, is evolving as additional information, services and resources are added. The Safe to Create programme emerged from the Irish Theatre Institute’s Speak Up initiative. In 2021, I engaged the Irish Theatre Institute to carry out an anonymous survey which attracted over 1,300 respondents. A year ago, the findings of the survey were published under the title Speak Up: A Call for Change, along with a set of recommendations. The report’s stark findings confirmed that there was a culture of harmful workplace behaviour throughout the Irish arts sector and a worrying lack of supports to tackle this issue. When I launched the Speak Up: A Call for Change report last year, I assured all of the respondents to the survey that their voices had been heard. The Safe to Create programme is built on and informed by the findings and recommendations in the Speak Up report, and particularly on the areas where artists and arts workers said they needed change and support. With the Safe to Create programme, we in the arts are leading the way in improving and transforming damaging norms for the benefit of all in the creative sector. Together we can ensure creative spaces are safe and that those working in the sector are treated with dignity and respect. I am pleased to have secured additional funding of up to €500,000 in budget 2023 for the Safe to Create programme. The planned supports will include the resource-rich website featuring practical information, guidance, toolkits and templates for artists, arts workers and organisations regarding dignity at work rights and responsibilities and the well-being and support service provided by Minding Creative Minds for victims of harmful behaviours, including one-on-one counselling, access to legal advice and a 24-hour trauma helpline. The supports also include the training programme that has been developed specifically for the arts and creative sectors on dignity at work issues. It includes the topics of tackling bullying and harassment, and addressing unconscious bias. The training programme also includes bystander training and intimacy training that has been created in partnership with Screen Ireland. The code of behaviour that organisations are asked to adopt is an important element of this programme. It has been developed to help enable arts and creative organisations to create workplaces free from bullying, harassment and intimidation of any kind and to reassure artists and arts workers that their employers are publicly adopting the code. The code is on the Safe to Create website, along with a register that organisations and individuals can formally sign. The aim is to embed this industry-wide code of behaviour in the sector to do the following: proactively encourage a zero-tolerance attitude to all of the negative behaviours; commit to investigate complaints in a timely fashion; raise awareness of what constitutes damaging behaviour; and encourage all workers to undertake training. There are workshop roadshows called "Code on the Road" currently happening throughout the country to provide information for individuals and support for organisations to utilise and implement the Safe to Create supports and code of behaviour. The first Code on the Road took place in Cork last week. Report to Support is an anonymous reporting system designed to provide a facility for those working in the arts and creative sectors to report incidents of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment without the need to identify themselves or disclose sensitive and personal details. Information collected via the Report to Support pilot will be aggregated twice annually and will be used to inform the development and delivery of additional dignity at work supports such as training, policies, legal supports and counselling. This information will also inform the new research planned for 2023 and beyond. The Safe to Create website has information on steps individuals can take to make a formal or informal complaint on individual experiences. A research programme of further study will examine the prevalence and impact of harmful behaviours in Ireland’s arts sector and measure the impact of the Safe to Create programme. The lead researcher is currently undergoing an analysis of methodologies to use that would be more inclusive of the intersectionality of ethnicity, disability, sexuality and how it influences harm within and across Ireland’s arts sector. Monitoring and compliance will be led by funding bodies, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, and by my Department. Organisations found not to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams. The Arts Council is introducing a condition that all funded organisations must adopt and implement the Safe to Create code of behaviour and undertake relevant online Safe to Create training. Screen Ireland similarly requires full legal compliance with all health and safety in the workplace and employment legislation. In addition, it requires funding recipients to maintain dignity at work policies that include appropriate action and grievance procedures to address employee complaints. In the coming months, my Department and the Irish Theatre Institute will be working in partnership to implement and promote these supports, to monitor the impact of measures taken and to collaborate with appropriate agencies to build effective monitoring, accountability and oversight mechanisms for harmful behaviour in the workplace in the arts sector in Ireland.  Since becoming Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I have recognised the importance of well-being for the creative sector. Minding Creative Minds is a free 24-7 mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and includes access to advice, counselling, legal advice, assistance, financial and budgeting advice, career guidance and life coaching and mediation. Minding Creative Minds has recently enhanced its services to include specialist trauma and abuse counselling care and support for victims of serious trauma and sexual abuse, in association with Spectrum Life. With additional funding provided by my Department, Minding Creative Minds also plans to provide access to new therapies in 2023 in addition to the mental health and ancillary supports it already offers. It also plans to develop and roll out a specific app for the creative sector that will readily enable users of the 24-7 well-being service to contact or chat with a qualified counsellor or psychotherapist. In addition, it aims to further expand its mentoring programme which has proved very successful, having provided 500 career mentoring hours to date. The Safe to Create programme is a step on the road to transforming workplace culture and practices and to providing safe and respectful working conditions for those working in the arts. However, we know that harmful behaviours are not confined to the arts sector. In order to enact real change, cross-governmental co-operation is required. That is why my Department has been working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice. The third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was launched on 28 June by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee. The strategy incorporates the implementation of the Safe to Create programme, which is listed in the implementation plan. This third national strategy will cost €363 million and is built on the four pillars of the Istanbul Convention framework. The accompanying implementation plan contains 144 detailed actions for implementation this year and next year. This implementation will be ensured by strong oversight and co-ordination at central government level. A key element of delivering on the goal of the strategy is the establishment of a statutory domestic, sexual and gender-based violence agency under the aegis of the Department of Justice. This agency, to be set up in law, will be tasked with co-ordinating all Government actions set out in this third national strategy. As Minister, I ask all parties in the arts, culture and creative sectors to engage with Safe to Create. Organisations sign the code and demonstrate the sector-wide desire to make our workplaces safer. I encourage everyone working in the sector at every level, including employees, the self-employed and those on boards, to undertake, and get certified as having completed, three free online training courses, specifically those on addressing unconscious bias, tackling bullying and harassment at work, and bystander training. Before I conclude, I will acknowledge the efforts of the stakeholders involved who worked closely with my Department to make the Safe to Create programme happen, namely, the Irish Theatre Institute, Minding Creative Minds, the Arts Council and Screen Ireland. There was also constructive engagement from FairPlé. Also of note is the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, entitled A Safe and Respectful Working Environment in the Arts. It is closely aligned with the Irish Theatre Institute's Speak Up report and most of its 11 recommendations are being, or will be, addressed by the Safe to Create programme. I sincerely thank the committee for its support and engagement on this important issue. I particularly thank the individuals who responded to the Speak Up survey.Their courage reminds me of the Jane Austen quote:There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me. Let me say to those who responded, it is their courage that has brought about positive change for the entire creative sector. From the outset, as Minister responsible for the arts, I wanted to send out a clear message that dignity in the workplace is the right of every artist and arts worker. While we know that these issues are not confined to the arts sector, through the Safe to Create programme we are working hard to change damaging behaviours. During this process I have heard first-hand that people have been suffering great trauma and harm. Inaction is inexcusable and I hope that this extensive programme of supports will encourage other sectors to follow suit.  As the old Irish proverb goes, anáil na beatha an t-athrú, that is, change is the breath of life. Tá sé tábhachtach go dtapóimid an deis seo anois le hathruithe a chur i bhfeidhm chun áit shábháilte oibre a chinntiú dóibh siúd ar fad atá ag obair in earnáil na n-ealaíon in Éirinn, anois agus sna blianta amach romhainn..
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I begin my concluding remarks by thanking Senators for raising this matter for discussion. I welcome the opportunity to speak to Members and to hear their contributions on this important issue. Since I became Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I have striven to bring about positive change. The arts is an area that has always held a special place in my heart. I am pleased that in my time in the Department I have managed to bring about change that I hope is of value to those who work in this area. In the case of the Safe to Create programme, it is not just of value as the changes are so badly needed. As Senator Black said, she was lucky. We are very proud to have her in the Seanad. She is such an accomplished singer, as are others in her family. It should not just be a case of being lucky, it should be the norm and the standard. If we are a country that is so proud of our artists, they should feel safe in their workplace. I hope this will help to deliver that safety. I will go through the contributions of Senators before I sum up. Senator Martin spoke first. I am glad that he placed emphasis on the signing of the code, because that is a key part of the delivery of the programme. The proposals for research in 2023 have already been received by my Department. As Senator Warfield said, the research must be ongoing. It is not just a case of doing it once, it must be a continuing process. I thank Senator Clonan for raising the important issue of disability. I am fully aware of the issue. His contribution was based on his lived experience and was very eloquent and heartfelt. I also have met Emilie Conway. She is an inspiring person. My Department and the Arts Council are engaging with officials in the Department of Social Protection and I have also made representations to the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, on foot of the meeting with Emilie. Although this issue is primarily one for the Minister for Social Protection, it is my goal to support all artists in every way possible. We will continue that engagement. I thank Senator Malcolm Byrne for the work he did on the committee to inform this important subject. When the report was launched, Members mentioned that Senator Warfield in particular drove it. I commend him on putting the issue centre stage. That was recognised by the members of the committee. I like the idea Senator Malcolm Byrne had about mentors and leaders in this area. I fully agree with what he said about organisations that do step up and adopt the code. He will find that any organisation will find cold comfort the next time it applies for funding if it has not signed up. I am delighted that Senator Kyne visited the Safe to Create website. I will pass his kind comments to the Irish Theatre Institute. The Code on the Road workshop is in Galway today. It will be in the Clarence Hotel in Dublin this Friday and Sligo next Monday. I can inform Senator Maria Byrne that it was in Cork last week so it has been to the south.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senator Kyne asked if it will continue. It is our intention that the Code on the Road workshops will continue next year. It will be expected that the boards of organisations would formally adopt the code. Next month we hope to be able to publish an initial tranche of early adoptees of the code. I reiterate Senator Warfield's thanks to the 1,300 brave people who responded to the survey that informs the actions outlined today and to the many people who have spoken out in recent years. They have been so courageous in speaking of their personal trauma in an effort to change it. The work of the committee, my officials, the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council and fantastic organisations such as Mise Fosta and Fair Plé, which have engaged, are changing the situation for the better. I acknowledge that it was difficult and brave for those individuals to speak up. In response to Senators Black and Warfield, the Speak Up report referred to the lack of accountability for organisations perpetrating or covering up harmful work behaviours, and the Senators asked what kind of accountability I am putting in place to ensure they do not receive State funding. The majority of funding to the arts sector is done through the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions. Both the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are leading on this by modifying their conditions of funding so that organisations that are found not to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will disqualify themselves from future funding streams. That is the key action that may make people stand to attention. All employers and organisations in the sector are being encouraged to adopt the code. My Department officials are also in discussion with colleagues in government, including the Department of Justice, particularly on the third national strategy. To return to the programme itself, as I have already outlined, the plan supports that Safe to Create platform. I encourage Senators to spread the word about it. The web address is safetocreate.ie. The well-being and support service provided by Minding Creative Minds is free and provides valuable advice, counselling, legal advice and a 24-hour trauma helpline. I urge Senators to tell everyone in the arts sector that this is here and it is free. It is a free and invaluable service. Based on our engagement with the sector, this is what they needed and wanted. On a training programme developed specifically for the arts and creative sectors on dignity at work issues, all the courses are free and online. On the code of behaviour I mentioned, the Code on the Road workshop roadshows, more research is key to keeping this up to date and to ensuring all the actions reflect what is needed as well as the monitoring and compliance. Since its launch on 5 October, the Safe to Create team has been working to embed dignity at work everywhere in the sector. For example, Ireland Music Week made the code of behaviour the pledge of its festival in October. This was valuable marketing to raise awareness of Safe to Create in the music sector. The Irish Theatre Institute was invited to speak about the Safe to Create programme at Theatre Forum's Tomorrow Together conference in Cork. The Arts Council has arranged an art form resource organisation meeting on 22 November, and the Irish Theatre Institute will present to that meeting about Safe to Create. The Arts Council is also looking at organising other Safe to Create meetings for its funded bodies in the first half of 2023. In the coming months, my Department and the Irish Theatre Institute will be working with its partners to implement and promote these supports to monitor the impact of measures taken and to collaborate with the appropriate agencies to build effective monitoring, accountability and oversight mechanisms for harmful behaviour in the workplace in the arts sector in Ireland. I thank Senators for their contributions. I return to the brave people who made this change happen, those who work in the sector. Those contributions have been the catalyst of change the arts sector very much needed. I remind organisations to sign the code and individuals to do the training courses. The three dignity at work courses take about an hour each. We have made great progress, but this is the start of a journey that was badly needed to be taken. There is a lot still to be done in the sector and in the programme, and I am absolutely committed to it.
