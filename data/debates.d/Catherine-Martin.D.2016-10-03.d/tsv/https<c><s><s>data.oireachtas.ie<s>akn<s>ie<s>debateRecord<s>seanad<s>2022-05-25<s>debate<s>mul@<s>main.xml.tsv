CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their proposed amendments. Amendments Nos. 123 and 125 would specifically insert references to substitutes for breast milk or milk-based formulae into section 46N(5). This would make explicit the power of coimisiún na meán to prohibit commercial communications relating to infant and follow-on formulae in the context of media service codes. I recognise the intention of the amendments and understand the concerns the Senators have regarding the advertisement of infant and follow-on formulae. The public health advice is clear that there is considerable evidence to demonstrate the importance of breastfeeding for the health of both mothers and infants. Data from the World Health Organization indicate that Ireland has lower breastfeeding rates than the global and European average. Members will be aware that the information requirements and advertising standards in respect of infant, meaning a child under 12 months, and follow-on formulae are currently set out in EU regulations. These regulations set out detailed composition and labelling requirements for infant and follow-on formulae intended for use by infants in good health and recognise the importance of the World Health Organization international code of marketing breastmilk substitutes. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is responsible for implementing these information requirements, while policy responsibility rests with the Department of Health. Under the extant Broadcasting Act 2009, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has issued the general commercial communications code, which provides that commercial communications for infant and follow-on formulae shall comply with all relevant Irish and European legislation and with rules, regulations and codes of practice issued from time to time by a relevant public health body. This is appropriate, as the BAI ultimately must rely on public health advice issued by the appropriate bodies as regards public health matters. Following the enactment of this Bill, it will be an coimisiún that will be tasked with making media service codes. The general commercial communications code will continue in force until superseded by any code that an coimisiún will make. I can see the merits in setting out explicitly in legislation that an coimisiún may prohibit commercial communications relating to infant or follow-on formulae through media service codes, subject to considering the appropriate health advice on the matter. As the marketing of infant formulae is the policy responsibility of the Minister for Health, I will ask my officials to consult with officials in the Department of Health in the first instance. While I do not accept these amendments today, I will return to the House on Report Stage to set out the next steps. I am not willing to accept amendment No. 103. It would appear to immediately ban the advertisement of breast milk substitutes on broadcasting and certain video on-demand services. As I said, primary policy responsibility lies with the Department of Health and other public health authorities, and rules providing for information and advertising standards are harmonised through the EU regulations. It is best to allow an coimisiún to consult with public health authorities before any decisions are made regarding the prohibition of commercial communications for infant or follow-on formulae. This both respects the regulatory independence of an coimisiún and allows for the advice of public health authorities to be considered. Amendment No. 124 would make explicit the power of an coimisiún to prohibit commercial communications relating to alcohol through a media service code. The advertisement of alcohol has primarily been addressed through the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018, which contains strong measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising. Sections 15 and 16 of the Act, which are in operation since November 2021, restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship promoting alcohol products and include a ban on alcohol advertising and sponsorship at events aimed particularly at children or at which the majority of participants or competitors are children. These measures help to ensure that children can grow up in circumstances where they are not regularly exposed to alcohol products and alcohol advertising. Section 19 of the Act provides for a broadcast watershed on radio and television stations. Prohibiting alcohol advertising during times when children might be in the audience will reduce children's exposure to such advertisements. The Department of Health is working with my Department, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and the environmental health service of the HSE with regard to the commencement of this provision. Policy responsibility for alcohol advertising rests with the Minister for Health within the framework of the public health legislation on this issue. The Public Health (Alcohol) Act contains a suite of measures specifically designed to protect children from exposure to alcohol advertisements. I am committed to engaging with the Minister for Health and his Department to facilitate the early commencement of the remaining sections of the Act. I expect that any media service codes issued by an coimisiún will set out the requirement on broadcasters and video on-demand services providers to fully comply with the Public Health (Alcohol) Act. This Bill already provides an coimisiún with sufficient power to do so, and I do not propose to accept the amendment. Regarding amendments Nos. 120 and 128, as a matter of principle I cannot accept amendments which would unduly limit the discretion of an coimisiún in the creation of regulatory codes. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for the points they have made. As set out in the Bill, I would expect that an coimisiún will have a strong role to play in providing for standards and practices to ensure that commercial communications protect the interests of the audience and, in particular, the interests of children. An coimisiún will do so through the making of binding media service codes. The existing general commercial communications code which applies to broadcasters will remain in force until amended or revoked by an coimisiún. In making media service codes related to commercial communications, it is important that an coimisiún takes advice from other public bodies with the appropriate expertise. In the case of infant and follow-on formula and alcohol, the appropriate experts would be relevant public health authorities. It is important that we do not through this Bill inadvertently introduce overlapping functions on the regulation of advertising, for example, between an coimisiún and public health authorities. I am confident that an coimisiún will take the best advice from the relevant public bodies and reflect them in the media service codes. I understand the intention of Senator Black's amendment on the advertising of alcohol because alcohol abuse inflicts terrible damage on individuals, their families and wider society. That is why the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 is such important legislation. It provides the appropriate base in law to regulate alcohol advertising. However, as I have said, I expect an coimisiún will require in any media service code it makes addressing commercial communications that broadcasters and video on-demand services online will fully comply with the Act and any other public health provisions that may be advised by the Department of Health.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Leader for requesting this opportunity. As she said, amendment No. 106 was not discussed in the Chamber. This amendment raises an important issue. Conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice and the programme for Government contains a commitment to legislate to ban that therapy. My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, has been leading on this issue. My intention was to reject the amendment today but consider the matter before Report Stage. I intend to speak to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in advance of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not intend to accept any of these amendments. Amendment No. 110 provides that the media service codes made under section 46N shall be subject to approval by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media. I cannot accept this amendment because it would represent undue interference in the regulatory independence of the commission. It is a key principle that the commission should be able to make regulatory decisions free from external interference, particularly from political bodies, as is required by the audiovisual media services directive. By compelling an coimisiún to make media service codes covering all matters within section 46N(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, amendments Nos 109 and 111 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisiún in when and how it exercises regulatory duties through the creation of media service codes.The purpose of establishing an independent regulatory body, an coimisiún, under this Bill is to delegate the exercise of powers from the Oireachtas to that body, in accordance with Article 15.2.2° of the Constitution. That a body delegated such powers has discretion in the exercise of such powers within the strictures of legislation is appropriate and in the spirit of the provisions on the independence of regulatory bodies in the revised audiovisual media services directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I still do not intend to accept the amendments. I am advised that amendments Nos. 109 and 111 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of the coimisiún in how and when it exercises its regulatory duties through the creation of media service codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for bringing this amendment forward. I very much welcome the intent behind it. The amendment sets out that an coimisiún may, through media service codes, set air play quotas in relation to music content composed or performed by women or persons living on the island of Ireland. In this regard, I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music on our broadcasting services, and in particular the promotion of Irish music composed or performed by women. Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world, and I am keen to ensure that appropriate supports are in place to further nurture and protect this sector. I recently announced an additional allocation of €10.5 million to the sound and vision scheme. That included €2 million to support live music projects. I have asked the BAI to ensure that the application criteria seek to ensure that 50% of both the performers and the creative team involved in these projects should be women. I have also asked that a similar requirement would be included in another forthcoming round of the scheme, which will provide €2 million for Irish language broadcasting projects. This will add to the BAI's existing strategy of ensuring funding decisions have regard to increasing diversity in programme content, including gender equality and inclusion, as well as the extent to which the creative team includes women in a leadership role. Moving from using supports to promote balance in programming to using legislative instruments presents challenges, in particular when airplay quotas are involved. I am conscious of the legal factors which must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing any kind of airplay quotas. Ultimately, the introduction of airplay quotas would need to be consistent with European Union law, in particular those provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services. I am advised that any quotas in respect of airplay imposed on the basis of nationality or residence would be considered to restrict the free movement of services by placing music that is performed by persons of a particular nationality or living in a particular member state in a more advantaged position. Airplay quotas on the basis of gender might be permissible under EU law if it could be demonstrated that such quotas could be justified by overriding reasons in the general interest. The question is whether setting binding gender quotas in legislation would have the desired effect. If airplay quotas based on gender are permissible under EU law, I would be open to further exploring this issue. However, all of us would want to be certain that any legislation would have its intended effect. The amendment also provides that an coimisiún may make media service codes in relation to broadcasters to provide for the appropriate representation of all groups within the community, on broadcast programme material and on equal representation on broadcast news and current affairs programmes. I am absolutely committed to supporting diversity, inclusion and the full and effective participation of women across the sectors for which my Department is responsible and across wider society. The question is whether media service codes, which are binding on broadcasters, are an appropriate mechanism to achieve this objective. While I do not propose to accept the amendment today, given the importance of the issue raised, I will ask my officials to consider it further with a view to resuming the discussion on this matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is why I am taking the time with the officials to see what can be done. As I outlined in my response, we want to make sure if we bring anything forward that it does not have unnecessary implications and that what it is intended to do would happen. We need time to consider it and then we will come back to the House on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, I was addressing amendment No. 112. Senator Warfield's amendment was ruled out of order, which was nothing to do with either me or my officials. It is the Bills Office that ruled it out of order. In my reply, I was addressing amendment No. 112. Everything I do is in good faith. We want to be certain that any legislation would have its intended effect, so we are taking the time to examine this issue. I thank Senator Higgins for raising it. It is something that I agree is of the utmost importance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 114 would remove the requirement for media service codes to provide for standards and practice to ensure that audiences are protected from anything harmful or offensive. I cannot accept this amendment as I am of the view that the principles and policies set out in section 46N must reflect the need to protect audiences from harmful or offensive content being broadcast. This is, in part, due to the requirement in the revised directive that member states shall take appropriate measures to ensure that audiovisual media services which may impair or harm the physical, mental or moral development of children are only made available in such a way as to ensure that children will not normally hear or see them. I understand the point the Senator is making. That is why I am examining this issue more generally in the context of amendments Nos. 92 and 93. They concern a proposal by the Senator to amend similar wording regarding the duties of broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services. My examination of amendments Nos. 92 and 93 will address her concerns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 115 would delete lines 16 and 17 which read with "due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience" and substitute it with the phrase "due sensitivity to the subject matter and the audience". It is noted that the text that is proposed to be deleted and-or replaced reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act which has not, to date, been flagged as an issue in any public or stakeholder consultations carried out by my officials. In my view, the proposed wording seems to broadly achieve the same effect as the original wording and, therefore, I propose to reject the amendment on that basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Similar language is in the Broadcasting Act but to date that has not been flagged in any engagement my officials have had with the public or stakeholders. In regard to the text of the amendment, the subject matter at hand in this provision is set out in section 46N(2)(c) which states "that in programme material audiences are protected from anything harmful or offensive, and in particular that programme material relating to gratuitous violence or sexual conduct is presented ... with due sensitivity to the convictions or feelings of the audience". I do not believe that a further reference to subject matter is necessary. Furthermore, I do not believe that the proposed changes from referencing the media service providers having "due sensitivity to the convictions and feelings of the audience" to just having "due sensitivity to the audience" would change much as what would having "due sensitivity to the audience" mean in practice other than considering their convictions and feelings? I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Higgins for raising her concerns in amendments Nos. 116, 117, 142 and 143 regarding the terminology used in the Bill. The term “physical, mental and moral development” is a transposition of the text of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive - for example, in Articles 6(B), 9, and 28(B). The use of that terminology is required to properly transpose the directive and therefore I cannot accept these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator. It is not the intention of the section, as drafted, to preclude the provision of programme material related to sexual conduct for educational purposes, particularly on important topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships. Instead the provision intends to protect audiences, and children in particular, from sexual content that may be considered offensive or harmful to their well-being. I can certainly see the merit in the proposed clarification and I have asked my officials to engage with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel with a view to returning to the House on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for tabling these amendments. Amendment No. 129 sets out several matters to which an coimisiún should have regard when making media service codes, while amendment No. 130 sets out that an coimisiún should have regard to section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 when making media service codes. The objective of media service codes is to provide for standards and practices that are binding on broadcasting and video-on-demand services. The Bill ensures that such standards and practices apply to commercial communications, including advertising, programming and the coverage of news and current affairs.It is important that any standards and practices set out are not overly prescriptive, to the point that they are perceived to direct what types of content should be covered or to impinge on editorial independence. I cannot accept the amendments, as they may contain the implication that media service codes may direct broadcasters or video on-demand services to prioritise particular types of content. However, I understand the intention of the Senator's amendment in seeking to draw attention to the matters set out in the amendments. A more appropriate place for some of those provisions would be section 7, which provides for powers, functions and duties of an coimisiún. Many of the subjects set out in the non-exhaustive list suggested in amendment No. 129 are adequately captured in section 7 in a way that ensures they inform the totality of the work of an coimisiún. For example, section 7(3)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, provides that an coimisiún shall promote and stimulate the development of programmes in the Irish language and programmes relating to climate change and sustainability. Section 7(4) provides that an coimisiún shall have regard to the policies of the Government in respect of climate change and sustainability. As regards the reference to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act, IHREC, 2014, in amendments Nos. 129 and 130, as I outlined previously in the debate, section 42 of the IHREC Act provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún will be subject to the provisions of that Act. I agree with the Senator's point that public bodies should comply with section 42 of the IHREC Act as a matter of course. I would expect that an coimisiún would not only simply comply with the Act but, as a public body, would show a culture of respect for human rights. As regards references to international legal instruments such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, I would expect that an coimisiún will, as a public body, have regard not only to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities but all international conventions, which have been ratified and entered into force here. I am not sure of the rationale for listing some international legal instruments and not others. Amendment No. 132 requires that an coimisiún should have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 when making media service rules. It is important that in making media service rules, the legislation is sufficiently precise as to the nature and content of the rules. The points I have made regarding amendments No. 129 and 130 would apply to this amendment. The requirement to have regard to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act is too broad for this provision and therefore I cannot accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 133 and 134 would have the effect of obliging the commission to prepare a report on the operation of the media service rules made under section 46O(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, on an annual basis. The requirement for review every three years, as proposed in the Bill, gives effect to Article 7.2 of the audiovisual media services directive. As the current timelines in the Bill reflect the requirements of the directive, I will not be accepting this amendment. Amendment No. 135 would have the effect of specifying that an coimisiún should make a draft media code or rule available both online and in a public place. I do not agree with inserting the proposed level of detail into the Bill and, accordingly, do not propose to accept the amendment. Amendments Nos. 136 and 137 both require that the period in which a person may make a submission to an coimisiún regarding a draft media service code or rule shall be a minimum of 30 days. The Bill, as initiated, provides that the period shall be as specified by an coimisiún. I do not think that circumstances would arise where an coimisiún would run a public consultation process with a very constrained time period for responses. Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 138 requires that a notice issued by an coimisiún setting out that availability of a draft media service code or rule for inspection and public consultation period shall be published at least four weeks prior to the public consultation period commencing. I do not see the merit in providing for a period of four weeks in legislation. It would be more usual for a public body to give notice that a public consultation was commencing, rather than that a public consultation would commence in a specified period. Accordingly, I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appreciate that the Senator sees the issue in terms of what is set out in the audiovisual media services directive. As regards the other amendments, as I stated, they are unnecessarily over-prescriptive for legislation and I will not, therefore, be accepting them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the three points, we have debated the first two in the last brief. The third point is an issue for the Bills Office, because I do not have any say over what is ruled out of order.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 11 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, primarily to extend the complaints process to video on-demand services. It is important that the complaints system operated by an coimisiún contains some provision to limit the time period to which complaints relate in order that an coimisiún is not receiving complaints relating to broadcasts that took place years prior to the complaints. That is why section 11 of the Bill maintains the existing provision in section 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 that a complaint must be made not more than 30 days after a broadcast in the first instance. I cannot accept amendment No. 140, as it would have the effect of enabling a complainant to complain about a broadcast for months or even years in the past, as long as the complainant groups the complaint with a complaint about a more recent broadcast. Addressing historical complaints about broadcasts from years gone by would not be the most effective use of the complaints procedure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, amendment No. 140 would open up the complaints process to complaints relating to any broadcast made in the State as long as the complainant could group his or her complaint with a complaint made not more than 30 days after a separate broadcast. That is too wide and would just not be an effective use of the complaints procedure. I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Similar to Senator Carrigy, I can see the merit of the amendment. However, I believe that the term “as soon as practicable” should be retained so as to avoid “30 days” becoming a standard time in which a complainant would be notified rather than an absolute limit. Although I do not accept the amendment today, I intend to return to the matter on Report Stage.
