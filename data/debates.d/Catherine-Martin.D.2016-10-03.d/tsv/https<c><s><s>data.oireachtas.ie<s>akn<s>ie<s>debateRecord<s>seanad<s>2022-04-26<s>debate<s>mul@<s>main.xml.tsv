CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for tabling the amendments. In respect of amendment No. 1, section 9D(1) of the Official Languages Act 2003 as amended provides that the name of a statutory body established on and from the commencement of section 4 of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 shall be in the Irish language. In advance of the commencement in section 4 of the 2021 Act, I decided that what was previously to be known as the media commission should be known as Coimisiún na Meán. This is given effect in section 6(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of this Bill and reflects Government policy regarding the title of new statutory bodies. That section of the Act also provides that throughout the Act coimisiún na meán is referred to as "the Commission". This is an interpretative provision rather than a substantive one.However, I absolutely understand the intention behind amendment No. 1, namely, to delete all references to "Commission" and substitute the term "Coimisiún". Given the amendment as drafted may not give effect to that intention, I do not intend to accept the amendment. However, I am willing to consider the intention further in the context of Report Stage. Similarly, amendment No. 6 would delete the term "Commissioner", as the Senator said, and replace it with the term "Coimisinéir" in section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 3 of this Bill. Again, I understand the intention of the amendment is to require a commissioner to be known as a coimisinéir but am not sure the amendment as drafted would achieve that intention and, therefore, will not accept the amendment. I am willing to consider the intention further in the context of Report Stage. The issue is fundamentally a technical drafting issue and I am willing to bring it back on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will make a general point first. I empathise with Senator Ruane on the groupings, which I also received quite late this afternoon. That is because of the interest in this groundbreaking legislation and how there are more than 200 amendments. If it is of any help, I will say that I was under the same stress as the Senator this afternoon when preparing for this debate because I was also waiting for the groupings. We were in it together. I will first speak to the Bill in general terms. The main aim of the legislation is to jump-start the modernisation of Ireland's approach to the regulation of content in traditional editorial media as well as in the landscape of newer online services fuelled by user-generated content. This is driven by the changes in the way we consume media and the growth of the online world. In terms of online safety, the Bill will ensure that we are all exposed to far less harmful online content and will require by law that online services respond to and robustly deal with complaints. While the Bill does not, and cannot, address every issue of concern arising from the online world, it creates a robust and adaptable framework for accountability that can be amended and expanded over time. This framework will be enforced by coimisiún na meán, which will include the online safety commissioner and have one of the most modern and robust suites of regulatory power in Irish law. It will be the starting point for the regulation of harmful online content. The establishment of coimisiún na meán is the most vital part of the Bill. Regarding broadcasters and streaming services, the Bill is fundamentally about modernising the regulatory environment and enabling an coimisiún to deal with the continuing changes in how we engage with and support our media. It has critical EU law dimensions, as it transposes the revised audiovisual and media services directive, AVMSD, which strongly informs an coimisiún's underpinnings. As Senators will be aware, given the complexity of this legislation, we have missed the deadline's transposition deadline. That is one of the reasons I am keen to see this Bill progress through the Houses to enactment as soon as possible. Reference was made to the EU's Digital Services Act. That Act and this Bill are complementary. One of the Bill's key drivers is the implementation of the revised AVMSD into law. That implementation in respect of online services, specifically video sharing platforms, is provided for under the Bill's regulatory framework on online safety. In this regard, the directive is explicitly recognised by the Digital Services Act as a distinct and complementary law to the proposed regulation. Regarding the regulation of other online services, the Bill provides for a regulatory framework for online safety that is designed to be adaptable and responsive to changes in Irish and EU law. Political agreement on the Digital Services Act was reached on 22 April. While the final text of the agreed legislation is not yet available, it is clear that legislation in addition to the Bill before us will be necessary to ensure appropriate alignment of our regulatory systems – coimisiún na meán and other regulators – with the proposed regulation. Ireland and other member states will have 15 months from when the regulation comes into effect – that will likely happen this summer – to ensure that its measures are provided for and supported by Irish law where necessary. In this regard, the Government has decided that coimisiún na meán, which is to be established by this Bill, will act as the primary regulator and digital services co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act. The Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the Act, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise in implementation and enforcement. It is important to note that the Digital Services Act is not sector-specific legislation, but a horizontal instrument that aims to set baseline regulatory standards across a wide range of issues, including legal liability, consumer protection in legal products, copyright, certain law enforcement matters etc. As such, it will overlap with a number of laws and activities of a number of regulatory bodies. These matters will need to be teased out during the implementation period. A programme of work in this regard already is under way between my officials and the officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Regarding the amendments, I thank the Senators for addressing the Bill's provisions on the prohibition of broadcasting or making available on the catalogues of video-on-demand services advertising that is directed towards a political end, has any relation to an industrial dispute or addresses the merits or otherwise of adhering to any religious faith or belief or of becoming a member of any religion or religious organisation. These provisions have been carried over from existing provisions set out in sections 41(3) and 41(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, which in turn carried over similar provisions from the Radio and Television Act 1988. This Bill extends those provisions to video-on-demand services. I thank Senators Ruane and Higgins for tabling amendments Nos. 2, 101 and 106. These amendments propose to replace the term "political end" with "political purposes" and set out a definition of "political purposes". I recognise the work that Senator Ruane has done on this matter, including by introducing the Electoral (Civil Society Freedom) (Amendment) Bill 2019. The effect of amendments Nos. 2, 101 and 106 would be to prohibit the broadcasting or making available of an advertisement towards political purposes rather than the current wording of an advertisement "towards a political end". The phrase "political end" was queried.That term, "an advertisement towards a political end", has been in defined in the 1998 High Court judgment, Colgan v. Independent Radio and Television Commission. This case involved an appeal against the decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC, to prohibit broadcasters from broadcasting an anti-abortion advertisement prepared by the organisation Youth Defence. The definition used in Colgan v. IRTC is currently used by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. I note that the definition of "political purposes" stems from the centre’s proposal to amend section 22(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997. Given that the Electoral Reform Bill 2022, which will regulate online political advertisements during electoral periods, uses the term "political purposes" to define such advertisements, I will need to consult with my colleagues and the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform. This substantive impact of the proposed impacts in opening up political advertisement on broadcasting or video on-demand services would need to be carefully considered, particularly as regard to any unintended effects it may have in terms of potentially allowing extremists to advertise.  On amendments Nos. 2, 101 and 106, I would like to have the opportunity to consider them further and consult with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for heritage and electoral reform, with a view to discussing the matter again on Report Stage, so the Senators may wish to raise the amendments then. Amendment No. 100, as proposed by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, would have the effect of deleting section 46(2) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which would appear to have the effect of allowing all political advertising or religious advertisements to be broadcast or shown on a video on-demand service. I would have concerns that this may have the inadvertent effect of allowing political parties to advertise outside of election periods on television and certain video on-demand services. As we have seen in other jurisdictions, allowing political parties to advertise freely can actually have the effect of handing the airwaves over to the political parties that have the most resources. At its most dangerous, this would have the potential to undermine the democratic process.  On lifting the ban on industrial disputes, the employer may have a higher level of resources to influence public opinion. Therefore, I would be inclined to agree with Senator Sherlock on the risks that she outlined. The amendment as proposed would remove the prohibition of broadcasting political advertisements, but not put the rules in place. Therefore, it would not be a level playing pitch. There would be rules for online advertising under the Electoral Reform Bill in the election period, but not for broadcasting. I would be afraid we are actually moving beyond the core function of the commission. Therefore, I cannot accept amendment No. 100.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 establishes the regulator, which the Government has decided will also enforce the DSA. I am advised that it is important to have that regulator in place at an early stage and that is why we are doing that now. The Bill also creates a regulatory framework for online safety, which is designed to be future-proofed and adaptable to EU law. This framework will help the implementation of the DSA, not hinder it. Senator Higgins mentioned the online safety commissioner. There are later amendments that will provide an opportunity to discuss that point. I wish to tell Senators Higgins and Ruane that I have given serious consideration to amendments Nos. 101 and 106 and to returning to them on Report Stage in consultation with the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. On amendment No. 100, I have concerns about the risks that there would be unintentional consequences to deleting section 46M(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended, and so I cannot accept it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the amendments brought by Senators Higgins and Ruane. The Senators have identified a potential ambiguity in the text of the Bill. Amendment No. 3 proposes to delete an existing definition and to insert a new definition stating that commercial communications shall be interpreted as including advertisements. Amendments Nos. 99, 119, 121, 122 and 172 seek to ensure that media service rules, media service codes and online safety codes address both advertisements and commercial communications. Section 2 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 3 of the Bill, already incorporates a definition of commercial communication. I can confirm that the term "commercial communication" used within the Bill is intended to be an encompassing one, including advertising, sponsorship, teleshopping and product placement. I do understand that the intention of the Senators' amendments is to ensure that the media service codes, the media service rules and the online safety codes address all commercial communications, including advertisements. That is also the intention of the Bill as initiated. I understand the concerns of Senators that this is not immediately clear in the draft of the Bill is initiated. I will not accept the amendments today but I will ask my officials to examine Bill, in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to returning to consider this on Report Stage. I again thank the Senators for their amendments. They have shown the value of parliamentary scrutiny and the importance of our legislative process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Just to say-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Senators have recognised I do not make the decision in regard to what is ruled out of order. I am happy for my officials to engage with Members between now and the next Stage of the Bill. I will also say that the Bill was written in a tech-neutral fashion, that was the advice we were given from the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in regard to helping to future-proof the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. Amendment No. 9 is intended to provide the power to an coimisiún to compel any technology company to produce data or reports when questioned. I note this amendment is drafted quite broadly without specifying any framework by which an coimisiún would compel technology companies to produce such reports. I believe the power to compel the provision of information from regulated entities is adequately assigned to an coimisiún through the Bill as published. An coimisiún has the power to compel information from video-on-demand services. Part 3A of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides for the establishment of a register of video-on-demand services established in the State, which is a requirement of the revised audiovisual media service directive. Section 46D of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may request further information from a media service provider where the provider notifies an coimisiún that it should be entered onto the register or where the provider is required to change its details on the register. Under section 46F of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, if the media service provider does not provide the information requested, an coimisiún may direct the media service provider to comply with the request. If the media service provider fails to comply with a direction, it shall be deemed guilty of an offence under the Broadcasting Act. An coimisiún has the power to require information from a relevant online service. Under the Bill, a relevant online service may be any information society service, which covers a vast array of technology companies, from Internet service providers to social media services. The regulatory structure for online safety in the Bill operates by providing an coimisiún the power to designate relevant online services and subject them to online safety codes. To facilitate an coimisiún making the decision to designate an online service, section 139F of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 44 of the Bill, provides an coimisiún with the power to require the provider of a relevant online service to provide an coimisiún with any information necessary to designate the provider for regulation. Where a provider fails to comply with such a requirement to provide information, it shall be deemed guilty of an offence under the Broadcasting Act. When a relevant online service is designated for regulation, it is known as a designated online service under the Bill. Section 139O of the Broadcasting Act 2009, inserted by section 44 of this Bill, allows the commission to require a provider of a designated online service to provide the commission with information relating to the provider's compliance with an online safety code. Under this section, the commission may require the information to be provided within seven days, rather than one calendar month, as the amendment suggests. Moreover, this section provides that it is an offence if the provider fails without reasonable excuse to comply or provides false information knowing that it is false or being reckless as to whether it is false. Section 139O provides that the commission may exercise this power following notification by a member of the super complaints scheme provided by section 139U of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 44 of the Bill. Accordingly, the provisions sought by this amendment are already covered in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. Amendment No. 10 amends section 7(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of this Bill, to insert specific reference to the role of an coimisiún in protecting rights to privacy and reputation. The purpose of section 7(2) is to set out the various matters an coimisiún shall seek to ensure in the performance of its functions. I have some concerns regarding a specific reference to the role of an coimisiún in upholding rights to privacy and reputation. These rights are protected through the Constitution in the form of the requirement of the State to protect the good name of every citizen in the form of judgments of our courts and the recognition that the right to privacy is inherent in the personal rights set out in the Constitution. These rights are also protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. I am somewhat wary of inserting language in the Bill that would imply that any of the specific personal rights contained in the Constitution, the charter or the convention on human rights were pre-eminent in some way on other personal rights provisions. I also note that protection and vindication of the right to privacy and reputation are set out in other legislative instruments, specifically the Data Protection Act 2018 and the general data protection regulation in respect of privacy, and the Defamation Act 2009 regarding reputation. A reference to the rights to privacy and reputation may give rise to the expectation that vindicating or protecting these rights is a specific function of the commission and that these rights should have a greater importance than other rights, including others set out in the Constitution, charter and convention. While I will not accept amendment No. 10, I commit to reflecting further on its intent, with a view to considering it further in the context of Report Stage. Amendment No. 11 proposes to amend section 7(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to provide that the interests of the public and, in particular, children would be promoted as well as protected. The question is whether amendment No. 11 would substantially affect the manner in which an coimisiún performs its duties. I absolutely understand the intent of the Senator in seeking to expand the language. However, I am advised that the term "protection", which is already provided for in the Bill in the context of the interests of the public and children, may also encompass the term "promotion" in this context. Again, I do not propose to accept the amendment today, but instead I commit to giving it further consideration in the context of Report Stage. Amendment No. 12 would also amend subsection 2 to provide for a separate paragraph on the protection of the interests and safety of children. The protection of the rights and interests of children is an objective that all of us in these Houses share. It will be a key component of the work of an coimisiún, particularly in the context of making online safety codes to tackle the prevalence of harmful online content. The key consideration is also whether the amendment would substantially affect the manner in which an coimisiún performs its duties, in particular with regard to the protection of children. Amendment No. 12 is another proposal that I wish to have more time to examine further with a view to returning to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have agreed to reflect seriously and further on these three amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator. I see the value of adding "inclusive" in there and ensuring broadcast and video-on-demand services are not only open and pluralistic but are open, inclusive and pluralistic. As the Minister with responsibility for culture as well as for media, I have always sought to open up participation in our cultural life to all our citizens in all their diversity. I am therefore happy to accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for his amendments. Amendment No. 14 to the new section 7(2)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 proposed in section 7 of the Bill deletes a reference to the languages and traditions of the people of the island and Ireland and replaces it with a reference to "the duty not only to satisfy existing demand but to stimulate increased demand for Irish language programming and content, in line with the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language nationwide". I am not sure that was the intended effect of the amendment. It may have been intended to amend the new section 7(2)(d), which provides that an coimisiún shall, in performing its functions, endeavour to ensure that regulatory arrangements address various matters. I am not in favour of deleting the reference to the languages and traditions of the people of the island of Ireland. That is an important provision in the new section 7(2)(c) as it is important that the policies of an coimisiún in relation to broadcasting and video on-demand services bear in mind all of the diverse languages and traditions on our island. I cannot accept amendment No. 14. Amendment No. 22 amends section 7(3)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill. This section currently provides that an coimisiún shall:promote and stimulate the development of—(i) programmes in the Irish language, and(ii) programmes relating to climate change and environmental sustainabilityThe amendment would change the words "promote and stimulate" to "ensure and increase the development and provision of" such programmes. I am strongly in favour of increasing the availability of Irish language programming. That is why I allocated additional funding to TG4. In budget 2021, I secured an additional €3.5 million and, in budget 2022, I secured an additional €4.2 million for TG4. As regards the role of an coimisiún, I am satisfied that the language of promoting and encouraging is sufficient to ensure the production of programming in the Irish language. I am worried that the replacing the term "promote and stimulate" with "ensure and increase" would imply that an coimisiún, as regulator, could impinge on the editorial independence of a broadcaster or video on-demand service in a manner not set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. I do not propose to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 23 amends section 7(3)(e) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to require an coimisiún to promote and encourage increased use of the Irish language in the policies and practices of broadcasting, video on-demand and relevant online services. I am conscious that the amendment would apply not only to broadcasting and video on-demand services, but also to relevant online services. As set out in section 3(2)(t) of the Bill, a relevant online service may be any information society service. This covers a vast array of technology companies from Internet service providers to social media services. Relevant online services are effectively the pool of services that, following an appropriate risk analysis, an coimisiún may designate for regulation and the application of online safety codes. I am concerned about the impact of this amendment on services whose content is primarily user-generated and on relevant online services that may be less likely to be designated for regulation, such as Internet service providers. I do not think the impact of this amendment is clear, although I understand its intention. I do not propose to accept it today but I will ask my officials to reflect further on it.  Amendment No. 30 has the effect of providing that an coimisiún may undertake strategic reviews of the sectors it regulates in respect of broadcasting in the Irish language. I again propose not to accept the amendment today but to consider it in the context of Report Stage. Amendment No. 228 proposes to amend the Title of the Bill to insert the words “to increase the visibility and use of Irish as a spoken language in media and public life and ensure a diversity of content for the Irish-speaking community;”.The amendment amends the Title, stating that an objective of the Bill is “to increase the visibility and use of Irish as a spoken language in media and public life and ensure a diversity of content for the Irish-speaking community;”. Any proposals to amend the Title of a Bill must be considered carefully. For that reason I do not propose to accept the amendment today but will return to it on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. I wish to bring to their attention, in terms of issues that I raised about these amendments and the previous group, that section 460 refers to media service rules that enable the media commission to make rules regarding accessibility, including regarding sign language service provision. It also gives effect to the provision of the AV media services to increase accessibility to media services for persons with disabilities. Amendment No. 15 would add linguistic diversity to other areas of the diversity of the people of the island of Ireland that is set out in the section. This is an important potential addition to the Bill as it recognises the role not only of Irish and English on the island but of all other languages that are spoken and written here, and which now form part of our cultural life. I have concerns about the second part of the amendment as it seeks to change the term to "their diversity of traditions and identities". While I recognise the intent of the amendment, it may have the opposite effect to that intended by restricting the term "diversity" to that of "diversity of traditions and identities" rather than all of the other forms of diversity of the people of the island of Ireland.For that reason, I will not accept the amendment today, but I propose to return to it on Report Stage. Amendment No. 16 seeks to amendment section 7(2)(c)(iii) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, by adding an additional form of diversity. In this case, it would add socioeconomic diversity to the forms of diversity. As the Senators will be aware, the programme for Government contains a commitment to examine the introduction of a new ground of discrimination based on socioeconomic disadvantaged status to the employment, equality and equal status legislation. My colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, launched a review of the Equality Acts on foot of this commitment. I propose not to accept the amendment today, but I believe it could be a valuable amendment to the Bill. To ensure consistency with the work of my colleague, the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I will ask my officials to engage with his officials with a view to allowing further examination on Report Stage. Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 both amendment section 7(2)(c)(iv) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill. Amendment No. 17 inserts a reference to the visible representative of people with disabilities in the broadcasting and on-demand services available in the State. Amendment No. 18 inserts a reference to the right to and importance of cultural participation of people with disabilities. Both amendments would form valuable additions to the Bill. I would like further time to consider the amendments. I propose not to accept them today, but to return to them on Report Stage. Amendment No. 19 requires that the commission shall endeavour to ensure the regulatory arrangements to support equality, human rights and participation in cultural life. I agree that these are important principles in guiding the work of the commission. I thank the Senators for their amendment. I will not make the amendment today, but I will take it away for further consideration and discussion on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have given that commitment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for tabling amendments Nos. 20 and 21, which would have the effect of requiring the commission to endeavour to ensure that regulators take account of societal and environmental matters. Addressing climate change and environmental degradation is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It will impact not only the media sector, but our entire society. It is important for the commission to consider these matters. That is why section 7(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, requires the commission to consider "policies of the Government and of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications in respect of climate change and environmental sustainability." Would amendments Nos. 20 and 21 have a similar effect to the existing provisions? I ask the Senator for more time to reflect on this. I will return to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. Section 7(3)(f) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, is designed to ensure that the commission will play a strong role in encouraging research and in promoting or endorsing education initiatives, including by co-operation for that purpose with education bodies and in promoting public awareness, knowledge and understanding to matters connected to its functions. This section is designed to ensure that an coimisiún and specifically the online safety commissioner will have a role in carrying out education initiatives such as public information campaigns and will also work with existing education bodies such as the Department of Education, Webwise.ie and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. The commissioner will also be able to endorse third-party providers for online safety education materials which will help schools to source appropriate and robust online safety materials. Amendment No. 24 seeks to amend section 7(3)(f) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, to extend the requirement of an coimisiún to encourage, promote and endorse education initiatives to cover the evaluation and approval of education initiatives and community awareness programmes and activities. While I understand the intention of the amendment, I have concerns about providing for any role for an coimisiún to evaluate or approve education initiatives, as that would imply a role for it in accreditation. It is not intended that an coimisiún would act as a professional accreditation body for educators similar to the Teaching Council or the Medical Council. I fear it would be an over-step into an area already led by existing educational bodies.  In considering any amendments that might expand or be seen to expand the functions of an coimisiún, I am conscious of not unduly expanding its scope into other areas of policy or other bodies or regulators with the effect that its core functions might suffer. The core functions are to enforce the new regulatory framework for online safety and the updated frameworks for video on-demand services. In that regard, it will play a very strong role in supporting education initiatives. The Bill as published sets out a very significant expansion of the role of an coimisiún in education as against the role fulfilled by the BAI. Therefore I do not intend to accept the amendment. I recognise the intention of amendment no. 25. I am of the view that the provisions of the Bill as initiated and as read at Second Stage already encompass the role envisaged by the amendment for the commission in respect of media literacy, I can see the merit in specifying the role. However, I do not think that it is appropriate to specify a role for digital literacy. That is primarily the responsibility of the Ministers for Education and Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. They are advancing strategies such as that on the ten-year adult literacy for life and through the early years in school system. I am happy to arrange for my officials to engage with the Departments so while I reject the amendment, I welcome further discussion on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I understand the intention but my fear, particularly in the context of the phrase "evaluate and approve", was that what is envisaged in the current wording would hugely expand the role of an coimisiún and take it away from its core functions. If the Senator is willing to withdraw the amendment, I am happy to see how she might rework the wording. As already stated, we will engage between with the officials between now and Report Stage. I am happy to arrange that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Carrigy for tabling amendment No. 26. We are all aware that sportspeople are being targeted from the side of the pitch, on the athletic ground and in the stadium or arena. The problem has been particularly abhorrent in certain sports. I am acutely conscious that social media has made it much easier to target abuse at our sportspeople. That is why it would be important for Coimisiún na Meán to be established as soon as possible to allow it to begin to make binding online safety codes to tackle the prevalence of harmful online content such as cyberbullying on social media platforms. I am aware, however, that the issuance of the codes is only one part of the solution to the abuse of sportspeople. As the Senator's amendment indicates, it will be vital that an coimisiún works with bodies across different sectors such as sports, education and culture to promote online safety. It is because of the wide array of bodies with which an coimisiún will be required to work that I would be cautious about specifying any one particular body with which it must engage. Section 7 of the Bill inserts section 32 into the Broadcast Act 2009, which provides that an coimisiún may enter into co-operation agreements with a body established in the State. This section will enable the commission to engage with bodies such as the Federation of Irish Sport and, indeed, a singular national governing body, NGV, such as the GAA, the FAI, the IRFU or the Camogie Association. It would also allow for engagement with Sport Ireland as the statutory body charged with developing sport in the country. I am aware that Sport Ireland is already carrying out work in this area and has produced a staying safe online resource. Ultimately, I am reluctant to specify a role for a specific body in the Bill. As a result, I cannot accept this amendment today. Rather, I would like to see an coimisiún in a position to exercise its capacity to co-operate with bodies across multiple sectors. I propose to reject this amendment for now but to return to the matter at Report Stage, if the Senator is agreeable, and we can liaise regarding an alternative and perhaps less specific form of wording.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 7(2) of the Act, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, states the commission shall ensure the interests are protected, although I do understand the intention of the Senators' amendment. While I will not accept it, I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth regarding the wording of the proposed amendment, with a view to returning to the matter on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Senators that addiction, and in particular gambling addiction, poses a major challenge to our society, not least when it involves young people and children. That is why the establishment of a gambling regulator, focused on public safety and well-being and with the power to regulate gambling advertising on websites and apps, was a commitment in the programme for Government. As Senators will be aware, my colleague, the Minister for Justice, published the general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill in October, which will establish a new gambling authority. The general scheme indicates the Bill will include a specific definition of "gambling", an exclusionary register by which persons may voluntarily exclude themselves from accessing gambling activities and provisions that will allow the gambling authority to make codes regulating the advertising of gambling. While I intend not to accept the amendment, I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Departments of Justice and Health with regard to its wording, with a view to returning to the matter on Report Stage.
