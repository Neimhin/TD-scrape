CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Circus has a long tradition in Ireland, incorporating classical or traditional circus and contemporary circus. Both strands are valued artistically, with classical circus having a long working history in Ireland, while contemporary circus practice is relatively new. The Arts Act 2003 cites circus as one of nine art forms. As an art form, circus attracts high audience numbers each year including many rural audiences and members of new communities. The live events sector has been impacted by Covid-19. I know there were some drive-in circuses last year, which shows once again the innovation of the arts sector. Government support for circus as an art form is channelled through the Arts Council. While there are enterprise supports available for businesses and individuals impacted by Covid-19, these are matters for my colleague, the Tánaiste, in his role as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the criteria for their eligibility.  Primary support for the arts, including circus, is delivered through the Arts Council which is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003. Funding for the Arts Council has increased steadily in recent years, reaching a record level of €130 million this year. It is important for me to point out that under the Arts Act 2003, the Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions.The strategic context for the council's support of circus and all other art forms is set out in Making Great Art Work: Arts Council Strategy 2016-2025.  The Arts Council supports both strands of circus and, through direct support and strategic intervention, engages with the sector to assist individuals and organisations to develop high-quality performance and participatory work. Circus is supported by the Arts Council by way of grants under a range of categories including bursary, strategic funding, project awards and touring and dissemination awards.  There were very significant increases in supports provided for the circus in 2020 and 2021, with over €2.2 million allocated to circus, street arts and spectacle in 2021. The council makes awards to circus organisations and to individual circus artists. In 2020, many circus artists also qualified for the council’s Covid-19 crisis response award.  Details of all grants are available on the Arts Council’s website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With respect, I have clarified about the money that the circuses have received.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There has been a steady increase in the budgetary allocation for circus, street art and spectacle over the past three years, with more than €2.2 million allocated for 2021, representing a 40% increase on the 2020 allocations. The €2.2 million expenditure in 2021 is made up of strategic funding of €1.107 million, project and programming funding of €690,000, which covers arts grants and project funding, as well as an artist support measure of €431,000, which covers bursaries and commissions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The specific circus the Deputy mentioned, Duffy's Circus, was awarded arts grant funding of €59,000 last year. Other circuses got more.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy stated categorically in this Chamber that no funding was going to circuses. I am saying that is incorrect. I have pointed out the exact money that has been given. I pointed out the exact money that the circus in question got too. If the Deputy wants, we can discuss this afterwards, but I am telling him that this is what I have. Some €2.2 million was given and the circus in question got funding of €59,000 last year.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am fully aware of the impact Covid-19 has had on tourism and hospitality nationwide and I also acknowledge that public health restrictions continue to be challenging for the tourism sector.  The national vaccination programme is critical and provides hope that in 2021 we will see the beginning of the recovery for the sector but this will not happen overnight.  For now, the focus remains on helping businesses and jobs in tourism to survive the pandemic and be ready for recovery. In line with the plan set out in The Path Ahead and after taking full account of the current status of Covid-19 in the community and the public health advice, the Government has been implementing a limited phased easing of some level 5 restrictions through the month of April.  The Government is due to make further decisions and announcements tomorrow regarding the position to apply for May and beyond, that will allow for the phased reopening of tourism and hospitality for the critical season, as the public health situation permits. While I will not pre-empt the Government's decision in this regard, I have been working closely with the sector, including meetings today, to ensure its voice is heard and perspectives understood. The tourism recovery plan was taken into consideration for budget 2021, where substantial measures were put in place to support and strengthen the tourism sector.  There was a record level of funding for tourism overall, of just under €221 million and there have been additional measures to support tourism, such as the VAT rate reduction to 9%, as well as the €55 million tourism business continuity scheme, the Covid-19 adaptation fund and other tourism sector-specific schemes. I am committed to continuing support for tourism through this difficult period and to working towards reopening and recovery. I am working on a survival, stabilisation and recovery programme for the sector.  As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government will outline how it will help people to return to work and further support sectors which have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.  Along with my colleagues in government, I will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors, such as tourism. I am also aware that Fáilte Ireland, at the appropriate time, will be launching its "Keep Discovering" campaign to inspire more people to take a break in Ireland this summer and in the shoulder season. The initial campaign will include promotions for each of the regional brand areas, including Dublin, the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, and will be supported by substantial marketing campaigns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The stay and spend scheme was set up late last summer to stimulate demand for accommodation and hospitality business during the off-season. It was set up by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. It was quite an innovative approach to incentivise spending. However, the public health conditions beyond our control have clearly prevented that incentivisation of spending because of the stop and start nature of the pandemic. The unpredictability and consequences of the pandemic have resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised. A review of the stay and spend scheme was one of the recent recommendations of the tourism recovery oversight group. I have urged Cabinet colleagues to give this and other recommendations of the report serious consideration to facilitate the reopening of the sector. It is anticipated that the Minister for Finance will then take stock and look at what additional measures might be appropriate. I am cognisant of the seasonal nature of the industry, financial challenges and the leaner shoulder and off-season months. I believe that supports will need to consider that impact on the off-season. I am open to all supports that can help the tourism sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the voucher scheme, I will work with my colleagues to consider all necessary targeted measures to help reboot tourism, which we agree will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. I reiterate that I am open to considering everything and anything that will help the tourism sector to reboot. On the outdoor dining grant, we had this conversation last week. It has been very well-received by the sector. I am not hearing this cry for help from the sector that the Deputy mentioned. The grant has been well received. The applications are open. Of course, if it all dried up then we would look at it again. However, I have not received any communication from anyone in this sector who feels there is not enough money. I just want to make that point clear to the Deputy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did indeed spend a lovely holiday in west Cork with my family, where I bumped into the Deputy. It is a beautiful part of the world. The tourism sector has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it. Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector’s survival and recovery. I appreciate fully the impact in an area as dependent on tourism as beautiful west Cork. A tourism recovery task force was appointed last year to prepare a tourism recovery plan, which includes a set of recommendations on how best the domestic tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the Covid-19 crisis. That task force presented its plan for 2020 to 2023 to me in September last year and it has been an important input for myself and my colleagues in government in considering the measures to assist the tourism sector. Together with horizontal measures implemented to support businesses across the economy, such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the sector-specific supports I have introduced have been key in helping tourism businesses to survive and employees to remain engaged in the sector.  The recovery oversight group I appointed last December is keeping me informed of progress on the implementation of the recovery plan and developments in the tourism sector more generally. As part of the national economic recovery plan, the Government will also outline how it will help people return to work and further support sectors such as tourism.  We will consider more targeted measures to help with the reboot in that sector. In line with our programme for Government commitments, the development of a new national tourism policy, which will have sustainability at its core, will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover from the Covid-19 crisis.  The advent of the Covid-19 crisis meant that the work of the sustainable tourism working group was temporarily suspended but it was re-established early this year to complete its work in identifying the steps that can be taken to promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented from 2021 to 2023.  Tourism has proven itself resilient before, and I am confident that with the key support of the Government it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The focus is on supporting tourism now to ensure the sector reopens safely and as soon as possible, as the vaccination roll-out continues. There is a €55 million tourism business continuity scheme and phase 1 was announced on 1 February. In Cork, we can look at some of the benefits in respect of the supports being put in place. A wide variety of businesses in west Cork will be eligible to apply for assistance from Fáilte Ireland's tourism business continuity scheme. In response to Covid-19 as well, Fáilte Ireland, in collaboration with local authorities, established a destination recovery task force. In respect of strategic tourism locations across the country, it will bring together stakeholders to form a co-ordinated and sustained collective response. Among those responses, I am sure the Deputy will be aware of the West Cork Calling tourism network, which oversees the implementation of two destination experience development plans that are being developed for west Cork for the long term. Those visitor experience plans are the west Cork coast, including Kinsale and Ballydehob, and The Three Peninsulas - West Cork and Kerry, and it will be ensured that the plans are aligned and that tourism and hospitality providers across both geographies work together.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	From my engagement with the sector, I am acutely aware of the retention of skills being an issue. That is why we have invested money from the budget in this endeavour and that is why Government work is going on in this area. The work being done in apprenticeships by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, is evident. Two such programmes launched recently in collaboration with the Irish Hotels Federation. Regarding the Deputy's concerns about approaching the winter season, that is why I am looking at more targeted approaches to support the industry during that off-peak season. We are entering the peak season for the domestic industry now, but I am concerned about that shoulder season. We should invite people to go to west Cork, like I did, in that shoulder season as well. Therefore, we are continuing the supports and we are very aware of the retention of skills issue and that is why we are investing in upskilling, training and the digitalisation of the industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and to the provision of quality and impartial information, particularly in the context of Covid-19. I recognise the essential role that the print media plays in this regard and the particular value of local and regional newspapers in bringing communities together and sharing reliable and relevant local news. In terms of specific supports for the local print sector, it is of particular importance regarding media organisations to avoid any perception of undue Government interference or influence and the funding of newspapers is therefore a complex issue. I am, however, cognisant of the importance of this sector, and the financial issues which it currently faces. This is a sector which has been in decline over the last number of years and is undergoing fundamental changes due to new patterns in the consumption of media and a shift to online advertising. In recognition of these longer term challenges, the programme for Government provided for the establishment of the Future of Media Commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media in a platform-agnostic fashion. While the commission is not a representative body, the Taoiseach and I were pleased to be in a position to appoint a member of the commission who has a strong background in local print and radio. In addition, at the commission’s invitation, the representative group, Local Ireland, has participated in two panel discussions with commission members and the public as part of the commission’s series of thematic dialogues. The commission has therefore been extensively briefed on issues facing the local print sector. I look forward to receiving the commission's report in the summer. The print sector has participated in the commission’s consultations and will be part of the recommendations. The sector has suffered losses from Covid-19 and is receiving Government supports such as the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the employment wage subsidy scheme. In the shorter term, the loss of advertising the sector has suffered from the impact of the restrictions has been helped by the public health advertising placed by the Government. I understand that in the region of €4.4 million has been expended on regional print advertising form March 2020 to date.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As to the comparison with the radio sector, the Covid-19 related measures put in place for the radio sector were provided through specific funding rounds of the existing sound and vision scheme. The current scheme in place to support radio is a statutory scheme provided for under Part 10 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 and largely funded by the television licence. It is limited by statute to audiovisual and sound media and is independently administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. There is no equivalent statutory framework for the print sector. The BAI has no function in funding the print sector. Given that the Future of Media Commission is due to report in the next few months, it is best to wait for its recommendations. My officials and I have had engagement with the sector and continue to do so. From the examinations undertaken by my officials, the sector is availing of horizontal supports to business put in place by the Government. As I have said, it has benefitted from public health advertising. I am aware that there will be more campaigns that will help the print sector. However, I want to look at what is appropriate for the long-term survival and development of the sector. I will give serious consideration to the recommendations from the future of media commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I saw a tweet recently showing the Deputy's cycling endeavours in cycling in from Clare. Fair play to him. It is the future of sustainable travel. The Government travel advisory currently in operation against all non-essential international travel, in addition to other public health restrictions, means that unfortunately there is virtually no inbound tourism at present. As a result, Tourism Ireland, the body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, has suspended the majority of its overseas marketing campaigns. Any recommencement of active marketing of Ireland overseas will be guided by the public health advice and decisions by Government on international travel.  Tourism Ireland is, however, undertaking an extensive, largely virtual, programme of activity to ensure that we are in the best possible place to immediately start converting business for tourism operators across the island of Ireland when the time is right. While we continue to face quite a bit of uncertainty, Tourism Ireland is actively planning for the restart of inbound tourism and in that regard, is developing a new business plan incorporating a three-phase approach to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand. The restart phase will involve the development of a range of immediate kick-start activities to drive demand for travel to Ireland, as soon as it is safe to do so. The rebuild phase will be rolled out as demand begins to return and will include highly visible activity in our overseas markets with the greatest potential to deliver value. Demand management will be introduced during the redesign phase, to ensure tourism has a sustainable future and meets the long-term aspirations of the industry and the country. Over the next number of years, it is likely that we will see an increase in demand for outdoor leisure experiences based on nature, such as walking, cycling and mountaineering. The Wild Atlantic Way has been a huge success to date and it will continue to be extensively promoted in Tourism Ireland’s future marketing campaigns. The EuroVelo 1 route overlaps with much of the Wild Atlantic Way and incorporates many of our most popular greenways. It is therefore very much aligned with some our key tourism policy objectives, such as the promotion of more outdoor leisure experiences and increasing tourism to the regions. Both Tourism Ireland and I are very much open to leveraging the EuroVelo 1 route to promote cycling tourism in Ireland, should a suitable opportunity arise. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Indeed, that fits in with our programme for Government commitment with the development of that new national tourism policy with sustainability at its very core, which will commence later this year when the sector begins to recover. Fáilte Ireland has collaborated with Sport Ireland to identify and signpost the full EuroVelo 1 route right along the western seaboard. This work is nearing completion, with just one county left to finalise its route and erect relevant signs.  The EuroVelo 1 cycling route is part of a much wider linear route which, as the Deputy stated, starts in Norway and finishes in Donegal. Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with Sport Ireland to ensure that the route is fully signposted and will promote it on the Discover Ireland website. Fáilte Ireland's programme teams will flag it as an element of the outdoor offering in the destination experience development plan areas and towns and villages through which it passes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not know whether the Deputy has sent something in writing on his proposal to me or my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. I will discuss all proposals that are brought my way. Fáilte Ireland is collaborating with Sport Ireland in ensuring EuroVelo 1 is signposted properly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Platforms for Growth is Fáilte Ireland’s strategic approach to large-scale capital investment in tourism product, which targets investment in line with specific platforms identified as a priority for tourists on the basis of research and insights.  I understand the Deputy is asking about a project that remains under consideration following Fáilte Ireland’s first call for applications, which focused on heritage and cultural attractions and invited proposals for large-scale projects of €2.5 million upwards. In terms of the likely timeframe for completing the current stage of assessments, I am informed that Fáilte Ireland is evaluating applications which made it through to stage 3 of the five-stage overall assessment process and that decisions are due by the end of May.  At that point, projects that have successfully passed stage 3 will progress into the development phase.  Accordingly, I expect that those involved with the project referenced by the Deputy are likely to be notified of Fáilte Ireland’s decision before June. In addition to funding provided under the platforms for growth approach to large grants schemes, it should be noted that Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences across Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments.  Following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, Fáilte Ireland also ran an adaptation fund grants scheme aimed at assisting tourism businesses make physical adaptations to mitigate the impacts of Covid-19. All capital investment in tourism is further supported by Fáilte Ireland's current investment in complementary programme supports, including festivals and events, business supports and training, aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the regional tourism experience brands.  The overall objective is to support sustainable growth in the Irish tourism sector and drive higher revenue and job creation around Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, it is currently being assessed. To receive the funding, the successful applicant must pass all five stages of the overall assessment process, three steps in the application phase and two steps in the delivery and development phase. Stages 1 and 2 have been completed and Fáilte Ireland is currently evaluating the business case submitted under stage 3 of the five-stage process. I expect the decision to be notified before the end of June. Fáilte Ireland has provided a wide range of supports to County Cavan. The county is served by two regional brands, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands in the west of the county, where the Shannon rises and through which the Shannon river and the Shannon-Erne waterway flow, and Ireland's Ancient East in Cavan's historical east. Tourism has always played a significant part in Cavan's economy. It has a great selection of tourism assets, which I am familiar with having grown up in the nearby county of Monaghan, ranging from natural assets, including lakes, rivers, mountains and woodlands, to built heritage. Tourism development in Cavan is critical for regional development, which, in turn, has a positive effect on employment, quality of life and the attractiveness of the area for inward investment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	During my term of office, I will be seeking to achieve that realisation for the wonderful natural beauty there. Fáilte Ireland provides a range of supports to ensure Cavan benefits as much as possible from tourism across the county. It has identified the natural assets and distinctive experiences that Cavan could leverage. The eastern side of Cavan is particularly rich in heritage and cultural experience, including Castle Saunderson and the Cavan County Museum. The western part, due to its proximity to the Shannon, fits into the hidden heartlands. The destination and experience development plans and the destination resilient plans are three- to five-year local tourism development plans which identify priorities for sustainable tourism destinations. Of relevance to County Cavan, several such plans have been identified or are under way in the region.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The impact of public health measures, both domestic and international, on live performance opportunities is monitored on an ongoing basis by my Department.  Due to its proximity and facilitated by the common travel area, the UK has always provided opportunities for Irish artists to expand their horizons and gain experience. If the UK's planned reopening of the music and entertainment sector proceeds as intended at present, Culture Ireland hopes to resume its support to artists to travel abroad to present their work in other countries, subject to public health considerations in Ireland.  It is expected that this activity may commence later in 2021, subject to the Covid-19 emerging position and in adherence to quarantine and all other safety protocols. In 2018, Culture Ireland programming had a special focus on the UK in its GB18 initiative.  A key aim of the Culture Ireland GB18 year-long programme was to renew the unique cultural relationship which exists between Ireland and Great Britain. Culture Ireland is keen to support the presentation of Irish arts in British institutions, venues and festivals and to expand the reach of Irish culture as soon as Covid-related restrictions allow. We all aspire to a safe resumption of live performance, which is so fundamental to the arts, culture and entertainment sectors, when public health considerations permit it.  In the interim, my Department operates a range of sector-specific supports.  These include the €25 million live performance support scheme.  Applications made under this scheme are currently being assessed. I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the importance of the UK market to Irish artists and look forward to them being in a position to avail of opportunities in the UK when it is safe to do so. The Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead plan committed to the development of sectoral guidance for very large purpose-built event facilities, for example, stadia, auditoria, conference or event centres. I established the live entertainment working group to facilitate stakeholder consultation and to develop Covid-19 guidelines for the live entertainment sector.  These guidelines will be critical in preparing for the ultimate reopening of the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand there is actually much uncertainty about activity in the live entertainment sector in the UK. The organisers of Glastonbury cancelled the 2020 event and have now cancelled for a second year. Other festivals have also been cancelled, for instance, the Boomtown Fair music festival. One of the key arts and culture summer events in the UK is the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. I understand that while it will proceed in August and will use bespoke temporary outdoor pavilions in easily accessibly places throughout the city, much of the festival will actually take place online. On the Deputy's other query about skills, I understand it is an absolute fear that highly-skilled individuals will leave Ireland and relocate to the UK if the opportunities there are seen to be more attractive. Recommendation No. 7 of Life Worth Living: The Report of the Arts and Culture Recovery Taskforce proposed the establishment of a capacity-building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers, aimed at recovery and renewal through professional development. The Arts Council is a statutory agency under the Arts Act 2003 and is the primary support for the arts in Ireland. The Arts Council has experience and expertise in training in the sector. Screen Skills Ireland is the training division of Screen Ireland and has significant experience and expertise in the provision of training. The Arts Council and Screen Ireland collaboration will, therefore, take responsibility for the implementation of this recommendation, with the Arts Council taking the lead. I have also established that live entertainment working group with the stakeholders. Using their expertise, the guidelines available will be critical in preparing for that ultimate reopening of the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Although the UK may be ahead of us in vaccinations, we have responded with many supports. Hopefully, it is not too long before we catch up with it in terms of reopening. Rest assured, my officials and I are in engagement with the sector. That is how I started as a Minister and it is how I will continue. I am acutely aware that the sector needs time to plan, rehearse and engage audiences in advance of reopening, the lead-in time about which the Deputy spoke. I will continue to advocate for the sector to ensure it has the supports and pathways needed as we emerge from the crisis. The €25 million live performance support scheme has built on the successful pilot of that scheme in 2020. Much work also went into the allocation of €14 million to be made available in the music and entertainment business assistance scheme to help those who had not received support up until now. That is €2,500 for businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover of €20,000 to €100,000, and €5,000 for businesses with a VAT exclusive turnover in excess of €100,000. I am also liaising with the Tánaiste to look at anyone else in the events sector who needs support and who has not been reached to date.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To date, there have been two calls for applications under Platforms for Growth, Fáilte Ireland’s strategic, platform-based approach to large-scale capital investment in tourism product, as referred to in the question submitted by the Deputy, which targets investment in line with specific platforms. Under this overall programme, Fáilte Ireland aims to invest up to €150 million between 2019 and 2022 in developing major new visitor attractions of scale and greatly enhancing existing attractions. Fáilte Ireland’s first call for applications under this programme in 2019 focused on heritage and cultural attractions, and invited proposals for large-scale projects of €2.5 million upwards. As I said earlier, I am informed that Fáilte Ireland is currently evaluating applications that made it through to stage 3 of the five-stage overall assessment process and that decisions are due by the end of May. As we discussed earlier, the projects that have successfully passed stage 3 will then move into the development phase.  Fáilte Ireland cannot provide any indicative funding figures for Platforms for Growth 1 allocations until the evaluation process has been completed. The results of a second targeted call for local authorities to develop activity facility centres at waterside locations across Ireland were announced on 15 April 2021.  The €19 million investment announced for this platform will be used to develop world-class facility centres at 22 locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction. Each centre will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points. With specific regard to Exchequer funding allocations, Fáilte Ireland's overall Exchequer capital allocation this year for tourism product development is €32.8 million. Allocations for subsequent years will be the subject of the annual Estimates discussion with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Rest assured, having grown up on the Border, it informs much of my thinking on that all-island approach. Of course, Tourism Ireland helps with that too. With regard to other capital investment priorities and capital funding schemes that are under way, funding provided under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 is targeted at helping support and grow tourism in rural communities, in line with the further redevelopment and promotion of regional tourism experience brands thereby developing the regions and rural Ireland. It is our natural asset as a tourist destination.Priority areas for tourism capital investment identified under the national development plan include the development and enhancement of tourism attractions, as well as of activity-based tourism, to provide the type and quality of experience visitors seek. There is that pent-up demand. When it is safe to do so, we will be ready to welcome visitors to our shores again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	All through that strategy is the protection of the environment and its sustainability. As we emerge from Covid, there is a huge opportunity to tap into that natural beauty we have, while protecting our environment and promoting joined-up thinking when it comes to tourism. We must tap into local attractions, cycling and walking routes, as well as local food products. That will be good for our regions and for having thriving rural communities with good employment. It makes sense to have joined-up thinking. Sustainability in tourism, as the Deputy said, is an example of that and is in that strategy. That is what we are aiming for.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Life Worth Living, the report of the arts and culture recovery task force was published in November 2020.  It made ten recommendations.  The introduction to the report suggested the establishment of a cross-sectorial implementation group to oversee and monitor the implementation of these recommendations. Several of the recommendations are in train or have already been implemented.  In particular, recommendation No. 4, securing the viability of the live events industry, recommendation No. 6, ensuring the well-being of Ireland’s creative and cultural community and recommendation No. 9, providing more outdoor public spaces for cultural events, are largely implemented. Meanwhile significant work is ongoing with recommendation No. 3, ensuring fair play for the makers of creative content; recommendation No. 7, building sectorial capacity through upskilling and professional development; recommendation No. 8, making space for arts and live entertainment to contribute to national recovery; and recommendation No. 10, addressing the environmental impact of arts, cultural and event activities. The recommendations included a proposal to pilot a universal basic income scheme for a three-year period in the arts, culture, audiovisual and live performance and events sectors. The task force was of the view that a pilot basic income would keep the sector intact, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to its gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits, social and economic, local and national. I believe the arts sector represents an appropriate area for a pilot basic income scheme for many reasons. It is characterised by low, precarious and often seasonal income. Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society. I have established an oversight group with the remit of addressing the recommendations of the Life Worth Living report, particularly those which are outstanding. The group's membership is drawn from Departments and agencies which have the ability and wherewithal to make appropriate progress on the outstanding recommendations. The oversight group is being chaired by my Department and includes representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Protection, Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Public Expenditure and Reform as well as Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The directors of the Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also members. They will be joined by a representative of the County and City Managers Association. I have asked the oversight group to prioritise the examination of recommendation No. 1, a basic income for artists. This is pushing an open door with me. I have engaged with relevant Ministers and colleagues on this matter who have indicated their support for developing this proposal.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On a personal level, I have spoken of my support for and have also written about a basic income for artists. Universal basic income is also core to Green Party policy. Work is being done on this matter. It has gained the support of my colleagues in the Cabinet and the relevant Departments in the oversight group. This work on a basic income for artists is independent of the work of the Low Pay Commission which has been tasked by my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to examine the programme for Government commitment to pilot a universal basic income within the Government's lifetime. I intend, therefore, to proceed with the development of proposals for a basic income for artists as a matter of priority. The sector is on its knees. People in it have heard too much talk about valuing our arts and culture and they need to see that we do. Our actions will show it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government's travel advisory currently in operation against all non-essential international travel, in addition to other public health restrictions, means that, unfortunately, there is virtually no inbound tourism at present. As a result, Tourism Ireland, the body responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas as a holiday destination, has suspended the majority of its overseas marketing campaigns. Any recommencement of active marketing of Ireland overseas will be guided by the public health advice and decisions by the Government on international travel. Tourism Ireland, however, is actively working behind the scenes to keep Ireland front and centre in the minds of potential travellers. At the appropriate time, it will launch an extensive global recovery kick-start programme. In 2021, I have sustained the tourism marketing fund at previous levels to ensure Tourism Ireland has the resources to do all it can to protect our hard won market share. It is undertaking an extensive, largely virtual programme of activity to ensure that we are in the best possible place to immediately start converting business for tourism operators across the island of Ireland when the time is right. For example, the agency has just recently completed a successful virtual St. Patrick's Day programme which reached out to potential visitors right across the world. Tourism Ireland is currently developing a new business plan to reflect the global economic changes brought about by Covid-19. This plan will draw from the work of the tourism recovery task force which Deputy Griffin helped to establish. This new business plan will incorporate a three-phase approach to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand. The restart phase will involve the development of a range of immediate kick-start activities to drive demand for travel to Ireland, as soon as it is safe to welcome tourists to our shores again. The rebuild phase will be rolled out as demand begins to return. It will include highly visible activity in our overseas markets with the greatest potential to deliver value. Demand management will be introduced during the redesign phase to ensure tourism has a sustainable future and meets the long-term aspirations of the industry and the country.When the time is right to actively promote Ireland abroad as a travel destination, Tourism Ireland will then enter a market that will be extremely competitive but I am confident the agency is well-positioned to meet that challenge.
