CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Chairman, I have a number of issues to raise but I can do so under the subheading rather than now. I concur with my colleagues on some of the issues they have raised.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Apologies, I should have come in on subhead A03. In general, I cannot let the opportunity go without raising the issue, as the Chair has referenced, of equal pay for equal work. Our young teachers play a vital role. They are highly skilled, specialised classroom practitioners with significant far-reaching responsibilities for our children on a daily basis. They are being devalued. The Minister spoke earlier about the recruitment in certain subjects. We will continue to shed teachers from urban areas due to extraordinary high rents. Their jobs simply are not allowing them continue teaching in the schools of their choice where they have permanent jobs. They are leaving, which is not good for the students. I would ask the Minister, not for the first time, to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work and set out a timeframe. I ask him to make that commitment and set out a timeframe. It cannot be done overnight but to give respect to these young teachers, I ask him to set out a timeframe for implementation. On the superannuation, the underestimation of those seeking to retire is worrying. On a breakdown, does the Minister know if teachers are retiring early? As a former teacher, I looked to the more senior members of staff. They play an extraordinarily important role in guiding a young teacher when he or she joins a staff. Are they retiring before their time? If so, has the Minister any idea why they are doing so? Is it a reflection of stress in the workplace? If that is the case, has any research been done on it? Does the Minister know whether any data has been gathered on that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	First, I want to acknowledge how willing the Minister of State always is to listen to and engage with Members when they raise individual constituency issues, and that has definitely been my experience. I thank him for that.  I have spoken to the Minister of State on an individual constituency issue so I will not deal with the ins and outs of it, although I may have to follow up with him after this meeting, if that is okay. There is some confusion over the application process and this has caused immense stress for some of the parents involved. As I said, I will raise that with the Minister of State after the meeting.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The second issue is in regard to schools that have temporary rather than permanent homes. There is a school in my constituency which has had a site identified in Ballinteer but there have been planning issues in regard to getting a permanent home, so the school has been temporarily housed in Churchtown. The students have been in Ballinteer and it has been a Ballinteer school for six years, but it is now in Churchtown. Some of the parents do not have cars. I am sure this is not the only place in Ireland where this has happened. Are there any plans to give some leniency in regard to providing school transport for students in this case?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a planning issue in Ballinteer. The school has been moved as the site could not hold it any longer, given the number of students. They are being temporarily housed in a school that had been closed down.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On a somewhat related point in regard to the minor works grant allocation, which I was delighted to see the Minister of State announce today, I notice that in 2015 it was announced on 5 November, last year it was announced on 17 November, this year it has been announced in December and it is indicated to be announced next in January 2019. This is very frustrating for schools and many schools have contacted me. One, a developing school, is delighted to have a brand new premises but it is spending 70% of its capitation on heating the school because, as a developing school, it gets the same funding as a small school in rural Ireland. The principal found the school was tapping into the money for books for next year to pay for salaries for cleaning and for heating. Are there any plans to announce the allocation sooner? I am a bit alarmed to see January 2019 has been indicated for the next announcement, which means the principal must face into next September still not knowing the allocation, which is quite difficult for a small developing school.
