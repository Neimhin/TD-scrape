CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill represents a crucial step forward in the journey of both the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st century concert hall. The legislation will support the concert hall's effort to return the orchestra to full strength and further empower it to deliver on the recommendations outlined in the Boaden report. The amendment to increase the limit of the State indemnity is a necessary measure that will support our cultural institutions to continue to present international quality exhibitions to the Irish public.Gabhaim buíochas leis na Comhaltaí as a mbreithniú ar an mBille seo. Tá mé ag tnúth le dul chun cinn trí na Tithe. I again thank all Deputies for their engagement and consideration of the Bill.
