CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have tabled amendments Nos. 89 and 104 in this group. Amendment No. 89 would require the Minister to provide guidelines for schools on how they should put in place age-appropriate alternatives for children who do not wish to attend classes in religious instruction, The Minister must set minimum standards for the nature of exemptions for students who do not want to attend classes in religious instruction. This would ensure freedom from discrimination and protection of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in schools. The Bill, in section 62(7)(n), already provides that a school should provide details of its policy on arrangements to meet parents' wishes or those of any student over 18 years who does not wish to attend classes in religious instruction. Government amendment No. 69 also ensures a student cannot miss a day of school if he or she does not attend classes in religious instruction. The next logical step is to ensure the Minister will set guidelines to ensure all students will be treated equally across schools when they opt out of classes in religious instruction. In February the Minister issued a circular to all ETB schools requiring them to provide alternative subject choices for students who wished to opt out of classes in religious instruction, but it only applies to ETB schools, the logic being they are multi-denominational. The amendment would compel the Minister to issue guidelines to all schools.  Amendment No. 104 would require the Minister in his regulations to set age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, for students who did not wish to attend classes in religious instruction in publicly funded schools.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On my amendment, if the Minister insists on religious instruction taking place during the school day, he will definitely need to set guidelines. I have worked in schools. I do not know how many the Minister has been in while religious instruction is happening. It happens on an ad hoc basis and is simply not good enough. It is not fair on students, teachers or parents. It is a timetable hazard and a nightmare for a principal. There are many scenarios. There are children who are not participating in religious instruction sitting at the back of the classroom. There are disciplinary nightmares for the teacher and children are listening to religious instruction as they try to study. There are schools which decide pupils can go to the library while religious instruction is taking place. Who supervises them? Sometimes they are not supervised. Who is the teacher who draws the short straw and has to do that duty instead of teaching his or her own subject? There is the situation where students study other subjects. This happens too in the case of Irish. Sometimes, in some schools, there are more students who are not taking Irish and there are no guidelines whatsoever for the schools on how to deal with the issue. It becomes a study class, which is completely unfair. Schools need guidelines. The Minister is leaving it up to schools, with some doing it right and some doing it wrong. If he insists on religious instruction taking place during the school day, guidelines are needed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would like to ask the Minister about amendment No. 49, which seeks to provide that a school will have to admit a student seeking admission to the school "including, where appropriate" a student seeking admission to a special class in the school. I wonder how that will work in practical terms. Will this provision not leave the door open to some discrimination? I ask the Minister to explain how this will work in practice to protect the child.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	How do we define what is "appropriate" in the context of admission to a special class?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 42:In page 15, line 21, after “school”, to insert “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 45:In page 15, line 29, to delete "school." and substitute the following:"school, and(c) a school which teaches through the medium of Irish, and which gives priority in its admission policy to students who speak Irish as a home language, the admission statement of the school shall include a statement that the school does not discriminate in relation to the admission of students where it admits a student who speaks Irish as a home language in preference to others whose home language is not Irish.".I and colleagues here, Deputies Funchion and Thomas Byrne, have been discussing amendment No. 75 with which, as the Minister will be aware, we have problems because we do not believe the Minister's amendment protects the child who is fluent and where Irish is the home language. We are willing, if the Minister would withdraw his amendment No. 75, to withdraw our amendments that deal with this until we have an opportunity to come together on a cross-party basis with relevant stakeholders and maybe Department officials.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for agreeing to do so.
Táim ag súil le bheith ag obair le chéile chun Gaeilge líofa a chothú agus a chaomhnú.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As my colleagues have said, we are certainly not seeking that discrimination of any sort would creep into the school system. We want to protect the rights of those who have a reasonable level of fluency at home, but we also want to make sure we protect the educational rights of those who speak Irish as a home language, especially children with special educational needs who have Irish as a home language. I thank the Minister for agreeing to withdraw his amendment No. 75 for the moment. The opportunity to work together seems quite complicated but maybe we can get there and strike a happy balance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 53:In page 17, line 1, after “school” to insert “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 89:In page 22, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:"(3) (a) In particular, the Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, make regulations governing the age-appropriate arrangements to be made for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.(b) Such regulations shall have regard to the rights of students under the Constitution to attend a school in receipt of public funds without attending religious instruction or classes at that school.".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 104:In page 24, line 11, to delete "concerned." and substitute the following:"concerned;(e) age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in relation to students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 105:In page 24, line 12, to delete "(4) In this section" and substitute "(5) In this section".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 110:In page 25, line 35, after "to" where it firstly occurs to insert "make all reasonable efforts to".
