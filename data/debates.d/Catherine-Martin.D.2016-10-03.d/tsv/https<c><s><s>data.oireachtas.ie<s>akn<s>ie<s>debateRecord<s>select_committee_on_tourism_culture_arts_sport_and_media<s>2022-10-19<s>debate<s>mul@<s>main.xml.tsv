CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas le baill an choiste as an gcuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. I thank committee members for the invitation to join them today. The purpose of the Bill is to put the necessary legal framework in place to complete the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall, NCH. It will cement the role of the NSO within the NCH, formalising and enhancing the relationship that has been in place since the establishment of the concert hall in 1981. Although largely technical in nature, the Bill marks an important step in the journey the orchestra, the concert hall, RTÉ, my colleagues and I have been on for the past number of years. It is divided into four parts with Part 1 dealing with general provisions, such as the Short Title and definitions of terms in the Bill. Part 2 provides for the transfer of functions, staff, property and liabilities relating to the orchestra and choirs from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall. These provisions date from the transfer day, 24 January 2022. It does so by amending the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015. Part 3 provides for the integration of the orchestra and choirs into the everyday operation of the NCH by adding a new function for the maintenance and operation of an orchestra and choir to the functions of the concert hall. It also provides for an increase in the membership of the board from eight to nine members. The legislation requires this additional board member to have experience of and expertise in the development of orchestras. The final Part replaces RTÉ’s previous function to manage orchestras and choirs with the function of managing a concert orchestra only. I look forward to going through these in more detail. The legislation builds on the commitment of everyone involved to build a stronger orchestra within a dedicated national cultural institution for music. Critically, the Bill provides a new function for the concert hall dedicated to the development and maintenance of the orchestra. It also places the orchestra at the centre of the concert hall’s corporate governance arrangements by providing for a new board member with orchestral expertise and experience. In some ways, the Bill represents the end of one journey – the transfer of the orchestra and choirs – but it is also the first step in a much more important journey as we now turn our minds to building and enhancing the symphony orchestra and concert hall to ensure they are fit for purpose in an evolving environment and are at the heart of music in Ireland for generations to come. The challenge of the past few years has shown us the immeasurable value of music and live performance. It has certainly cemented my view of the value of the orchestra and concert hall both at the heart of classical music in Ireland and as a place for people to come together and enjoy a shared musical experience. Mar a dúirt an tUachtarán ag Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann i mí Iúil:Lig dúinn ceiliúradh a dhéanamh ar cheol ... na hÉireann i ngach cruth a thagann sé, agus lig dúinn athcheangail a dhéanamh leis an gceol, agus an tábhacht atá ag baint le taispeántas beo agus muid ag ceiliúradh … le chéile. Music is just one part of the wider cultural offering of our national cultural institutions. In that context, I have tabled three amendments, the purpose of which is to raise the limit of the State’s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State, which is required for visiting exhibitions. These amendments are critical to ensuring our pre-eminent cultural institutions, such as the National Gallery and Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA, continue to be able to receive high-value, international loans and exhibitions. The success of the recent Freud exhibition at IMMA shows the value the public place on having works of such international importance shown here, as well as raising our profile internationally to stand with other national galleries and institutions. Under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity is limited to €190 million. This figure is no longer fit for purpose as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago. I, therefore, propose to increase this limit to €1.6 billion. With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors, thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions. This will increase the cultural offering available to the public. I thank members for their time, and I look forward to their consideration of the Bill and these three amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The administrative transfer took place in January 2022, and it will take effect once this Bill is enacted.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 5, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:“ “Act of 1997” means the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997;”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They are referred to in the 2015 Act, and this is just an additional definition for the purposes of the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is the names on the transfer day that are being referred to.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The advice from the Parliamentary Counsel is that it is provided for on transfer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is addressed by the new function and this changes that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is this concerning Part 4?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In section 2, amendment No. 2 is to insert:In page 9, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “PART 4AMENDMENT OF ACT OF 1997
Amendment of section 44 of Act of 1997
14. Section 44 of the Act of 1997 is amended in subsection (1) by the substitution of ‘€1,600,000,000’ for ‘£150,000,000’.”.The purpose of these amendments is to raise the limit of the State’s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State that is required for visiting exhibitions. As things currently stand, under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, the aggregate amount on liability undertakings with respect to State indemnity shall not exceed €190 million or IR£150 million. This figure is no longer fit for purpose, as I said in my opening statement, as it does not account for the significant appreciation in the monetary value of artworks and other cultural artefacts, nor for the increase in opportunities for significant arts and cultural exhibitions to visit Ireland, since the establishment of the Act 25 years ago. The indemnity ceiling was previously temporarily amended by means of statutory instrument. SI 86/2016 raised the limit to €1.5 billion for five years, primarily to accommodate the five-year loan of the Freud collection to IMMA and the overlap of significant exhibitions at the National Gallery of Ireland. However, that temporary increase expired on 31 October 2021 and the limit has since reverted to the original limit of €190 million set out in 1997. This constrained the planning of international exhibitions as the total value of indemnities on works from outside the State on loan to our institutions cannot exceed €190 million. Currently, the alternative for our cultural institutions is to arrange for commercial insurance, a significant additional overhead. Such insurance can cost hundreds of thousands of euro per exhibition. The provision of a general permanent increase in the statutory indemnity limit under the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997 is not merely a technical amendment but in accord with policy on risk management relating to the public finances. The approval of the Government was required and was granted at its meeting on 28 June 2022. I am, therefore, seeking to revise the ceiling to a limit of €1.6 billion. The increased figure has been calculated based on the increased values of artworks and artefacts, and the anticipated number of incoming international high value loans planned in the State over the next five years. The increased limit would apply to works from outside the State on loan to the national cultural institutions, the Hugh Lane Gallery, the Hunt Museum and the Royal Irish Academy. With the provision of State indemnity, our cultural institutions can meet the essential requirements of prominent international institutions and private collectors – thus making Ireland a more attractive candidate for high profile exhibitions. This will increase the cultural offering available to the Irish public.  Finally, it should be noted that the proposal to increase the ceiling to €1.6 billion has been sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I hope the committee will agree that this is a necessary intervention, which will ensure the continued success of programming at our cultural institutions and provide an even greater variety of cultural experiences for the Irish people. Amendment No. 3 to the Title is to insert the following:In page 5, between lines 12 and 13, to delete all words from and including “2015;” in line 12 down to and including “matter.” in line 13 and substitute the following:“2015; to increase the aggregate amount of liability in respect of undertakings given for cultural objects on loan from a person resident outside the State and, for that purpose to amend the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997; to make certain changes to the objects of RTÉ and, for that purpose to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.”.This amendment contains the changes required to the Long Title so that this title also reflects the amendments proposed, namely, amendments Nos. 1 and 2, to raise the limit of the State’s indemnity for loans of artworks and cultural objects from outside the State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That administrative transfer was done under sections 7 and 9 of the 2015 Act so it was not ultra vires. That should ease Deputy Munster's concerns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This section puts in place the appropriate safeguards for the transfer of staff from RTÉ to the concert hall. The staff are to be transferred with the terms and conditions they enjoyed at RTÉ. Under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations, or TUPE regulations, however, such terms and conditions do not include pensions. The Department engaged the services of a financial consultant in 2021 to advise on the implications of the transfer for transferring employees' pensions and remuneration. The consultant met with the transferring staff one to one. Consultation also took place through the oversight and working groups. Representatives from RTÉ, the concert hall, the National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, choirs and the unions were in attendance at the meetings to advance this process. All practical issues relating to the transfer, including terms and conditions and pension entitlements, were resolved following an extensive process of engagement with staff and staff representatives. A similar provision to subsections (1) and (2) is included in section 32 of the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) Act 2015, which established the concert hall as a national venue for performance, appreciation and enjoyment of music. All this was done on the basis of advice from the Attorney General and is essentially an avoidance-of-doubt measure. There is no impact on pensions. Very detailed work went into ensuring that none of the individuals' pensions would be affected.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a drafting issue. This section provides a statutory basis for National Concert Hall management of the NSO and choirs, so that is addressed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 9, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:“PART 4AMENDMENT OF ACT OF 1997
Amendment of section 44 of Act of 1997
14. Section 44 of the Act of 1997 is amended in subsection (1) by the substitution of “€1,600,000,000” for “£150,000,000”.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think that is really just to give flexibility to choose the concert hall. That is why those groups are not named. It just states "other".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 5, lines 12 and 13, to delete all words from and including “2015;” in line 12 down to and including “matters.” in line 13 and substitute the following:“2015; to increase the aggregate amount of liability in respect of undertakings given for cultural objects on loan from a person resident outside the State and, for that purpose to amend the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997; to make certain changes to the objects of RTÉ and, for that purpose to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009; and to provide for related matters.”.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputies again for their engagement. My officials have taken note of the matters raised, which the Department will consider. As I have outlined, this is a technical Bill that provides for the transfer of functions from RTÉ to the National Concert Hall and provides that legislative underpinning for the transfer of the NSO and choirs from RTÉ to the concert hall. As I think I said earlier, the Bill presents a important step forward in the journey of both the orchestra and the concert hall and a critical part of the concert hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st-century concert hall. I look forward to seeing the Bill make steady progress through the next Stages.
