CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have just left the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills where we had quite the discussion on an issue relevant to the Minister and to many junior cycle students and their parents as we near the end of the first term of the school year, which is the worry and uncertainty about the distinct possibility that because of the Government's ongoing dispute with the ASTI, thousands of students will automatically lose marks in their English examination next summer. Two weeks ago before the same committee, the Minister said he could not guarantee that students taught by ASTI teachers would not lose out on 10% of their English grade if the dispute affects their ability to participate in classroom-based assessments. As it stands, we have no confirmation from him that every junior certificate student will be assessed equally and awarded an equal grade for equal quality of work, regardless of the union to which their English teacher belongs, and this is simply not good enough. Alternative models are in operation, which could help solve this problem and provide a guarantee to students that they will not be adversely affected. For example, students who do not participate in oral examinations in junior cycle languages have their written examinations marked out of 100. This means students who do not take an oral component in a language examination do not automatically lose marks. This, or another model, may not be ideal but I ask the Minister to accept the urgent need to have a contingency plan in place. Such a plan requires a great deal of preparation. Will the Minister outline the steps he is taking to make sure these students do not suffer because of a dispute that does not involve them? The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred in his budget contribution to fairness and said we are on a pathway to a just and fair society. He said fairness is about investment in education and education is the bedrock of our society. He spoke about access to education and how it has transformed our society and he is right. As John F. Kennedy said, education should be the greatest equaliser of them all. However, for all the Minister's talk of fairness, it is essential that we realise that the most important investment is in our children and in our students and that fairness means we must, first and foremost, make sure they are all treated equally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In putting the question to the Minister, I was not asking him to defend the reform but to help the students and guarantee that they will not lose out on 10% of their marks in English. I hope the Minister can lead, prioritise, instil and inject a real sense of pressing urgency into the ongoing negotiations and that all involved will redouble their efforts to resolve the dispute but the possibility of negotiations failing necessitates having a plan B. The Government has a duty to the students and to the welfare of our young people to show foresight and see the consequences that might flow from its actions. It cannot flail from crisis to crisis without trying to anticipate the events it is putting in motion. The bottom line is that there is an ongoing dispute with the ASTI, which means junior certificate students are going to suffer. The Minister must find a way to level the playing field for these children. Next June, third year students will face their first State examination and no students should have to face that exam, to walk into the examination hall, knowing that before they put pen to paper, they are 10% down on their results through no fault of their own. The Minister for Education should not let that happen.
