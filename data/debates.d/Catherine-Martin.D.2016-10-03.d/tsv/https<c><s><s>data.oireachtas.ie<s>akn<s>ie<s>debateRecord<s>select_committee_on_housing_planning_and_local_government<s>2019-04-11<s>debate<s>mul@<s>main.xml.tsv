CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The need to extend tenants' rights to students has become clearer in recent years, as everyone will agree. Amendment No. 7 aims to include private purpose-built student accommodation within the coverage of the 2004 Act in order that students have access to the same protections as other renters. We are happy to withdraw this amendment because we welcome that the Government has put forward amendments to the Bill. The bipartisan, positive work that is being done in this committee in this regard is great. I reserve the right to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“Amendment of sections 3 and 4 of Act of 2004 – inclusion of student accommodation3. (1) Section 3(1) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the insertion of “including private purpose built student accommodation” after “dwelling,”.(2) Section 4(1) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the deletion of paragraph (g).”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No. I am withdrawing it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“Amendment of section 5 of Act of 2004 – definition of deposit3. Section 5 of the Act of 2004 is amended in subsection (1) by the insertion of the following definitions—“ ‘deposit’ means a sum of money held (whether by the landlord or otherwise) as security for the performance of the tenant’s obligations arising under or in connection with a lease or tenancy agreement;‘key money’ means any sum of money demanded by way of fine, premium, foregift, reimbursement of expenses, administration charges, or otherwise as consideration for the grant, continuance, extension, variation, or renewal of a tenancy agreement, or for consent to the surrender or disposition of the tenant’s interest under a tenancy agreement or to a subletting by the tenant; but does not include any sum payable or paid by way of rent or deposit;”.”.Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 have been recommended by Threshold to address the fact that there are no protections for deposits in legislation. Amendment No. 8 seeks to insert a definition of "deposit" in the Residential Tenancies Act. While the Act mentions deposits and imposes some obligations regarding them, it does not contain a definition. This has allowed a lacuna to develop in regulation. Amendment No. 9 on the regulation of deposits restricts the growing practice of landlords seeking two months in rent as a deposit along with the first month's rent. I am sure the Minister is aware of this. It is a sizable amount for any tenant to produce, and vulnerable, low-income tenants in particular. The Irish Times and many other newspapers have reported that some of the country's largest private landlords are seeking two months' rent in deposit. The common practice regarding deposits is that they be the equivalent of one month's rent. This practice would be placed on a legislative basis by this amendment. Amendment No. 9 would also prohibit the requirement of "key money", which we have defined in amendment No. 8. Key money is the money that prospective tenants are required to pay before they get the key to the property. It is also known as viewing fees or non-refundable booking fees for the viewing of properties. While those who can afford these extra costs might just find them tedious or an annoyance or inconvenience, key money is a real concern, poses a material obstacle to accessing housing and introduces further discrimination on the basis of wealth into the already stressful process of searching for housing. In effect, it is locking people out of even viewing accommodation that they badly need.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister is not accepting amendment No. 8 despite there being no definition of deposit. That is regrettable. There is a housing crisis so should address anything that is locking anyone out of even the possibility of viewing a home. There is also the issue of a two or three month's rent being requested as a deposit. I am hearing about those issues in my constituency in Dublin-Rathdown. I am being contacted by people who cannot even view a home because of the "key money" fee and by people who cannot afford the deposit because it is two or three month's rent. I appeal to the Minister to examine this again before the Bill goes on to Report Stage rather than give an outright refusal now. "Key money" fees and two or three month's rent being required for a deposit is essentially facilitating discrimination on the grounds of wealth. There should be no discrimination and there should be equality when accessing houses. Allowing a landlord to state it is necessary to have a deposit of two or three month's rent or to have key money to even see a home is locking people out of housing when we are in the midst of a housing crisis. I appeal to the Minister to revisit this before Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Chairman.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will speak on amendments Nos. 36 and 44 together, then Nos. 45 and 46 together and then on amendment No. 28 separately. Amendments Nos. 36 and 44 deal with an anomaly in the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 which allows for what is called the no reason eviction at the end of a four or six-year Part 4 tenancy. Currently, all Part 4 tenancies in Ireland, which are most private tenancies, must be renewed after six years or four years if one is in the property before 2016. Part 4 tenancies generally automatically continue and are considered rolling tenancies in terms of the amount of notice the landlord must give the tenant to vacate the property. However, when a Part 4 period comes to an end there is a window for the landlord to evict a tenant for no reason under section 34(b), a power which amendment No. 44 deletes. Rebuilding Ireland contains a commitment to move towards indefinite tenancies and our amendment simply places that in legislation. The time for doing so is long past. Amendments Nos. 45 and 46 refer to eviction due to sale of buy-to-let or investment properties. It is simply unnecessary to allow eviction on the grounds of sale. It should not be happening. In European countries with established private rental sectors with strong security of tenure sale is not permitted as a ground to evict. The same is even true in the UK, which has a similar private rented sector legislative structure to ours. However, I am willing to withdraw those amendments and to table something similar on Report Stage. Amendment No. 28 is not in this group.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Minister willing to give it some consideration before Report Stage?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I also have concerns about the BER because of the lack of a high minimum grade. That allows scope for abuse. It is very easy to fluctuate by two grades. What measures has the Minister developed to ensure changing grades are monitored correctly and certified? Will certification be overseen by the RTB alongside the SEAI? I will discuss it later since amendment No. 28 addresses it but I ask the Minister to give further consideration to that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 28 seeks to improve how the Bill addresses BER by requiring it to be improved by at least three grades, bringing the dwelling to a minimum of a C1 rating. I am aware of what the Minister is proposing in amendment No. 25. Requiring a minimum of two grades would not involve extensive change and a landlord could fluke an increase like that with very little change. BER can even improve on its own since grading was different 12 years ago due to the intensity of fossil fuels in our energy system. I ask the Minister to give it further consideration and strengthen it. I think it is open to abuse. I know amendment No. 25 is tied in with others. I hope to get this right and am looking for this to be increased by at least three grades, to bring the dwelling to a minimum of a C1 rating.
