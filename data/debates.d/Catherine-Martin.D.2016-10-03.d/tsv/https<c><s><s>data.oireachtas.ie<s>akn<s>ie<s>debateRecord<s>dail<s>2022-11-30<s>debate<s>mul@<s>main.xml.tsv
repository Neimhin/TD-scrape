CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 7, line 27, to delete “sound”.Amendments Nos. 1, 92, 94, 95, 97, 100, 101 and 103 collectively provide for the inclusion of providers of community television as bodies that may apply for funding under the scheme for professional journalistic practices. This matter was raised on Dáil Committee Stage and, having examined the issue, I will bring these providers into the scope of the scheme. As the Government amendments address the substance of the related amendments tabled by Deputies today, amendments Nos. 93, 96, 98 and 99, I will not be accepting those related amendments.  Amendment No. 102 seeks to require that, in developing a scheme, coimisiún na meán shall have regard to developing impartial journalism through the medium of Irish. In the context of this particular scheme, which is directed towards training in respect of good journalistic practices, I do not believe it necessary to make reference to the language in which that journalism is provided to the public. However, while I do not accept the amendment, I do agree with the objective of developing journalism through the medium of Irish. The purpose of amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, is to clarify that the definition of "programme schedule" in the Bill encompasses both audiovisual programmes and sound programmes and that references to "programmes" in the definition of “sound broadcasting service” are references to sound programmes. Amendment No. 7 corrects a typo in the definition of "video-sharing platform service". These amendments are being proposed as a result of engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9, 16, 18 to 27, inclusive, 30, 31 and 33 is to align the wording in the Bill regarding the roles of the Minister with responsibility for coimisiún na meán and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of certain financial and staffing matters with the wording in the public spending code. As such, they are technical amendments and do not have any substantive effect on the Bill. Amendments Nos. 51, 74, 79, 128 and 129 fix a number of typos and clarify punctuation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster for her engagement on Committee Stage with regard to that amendment. On Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point, I am advised that it is not necessary to make reference to any language medium in which journalism would be provided to the public. It is about the journalism.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Ó Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe. During the course of Committee Stage, I undertook to come back to Deputy Ó Snodaigh on the proposal to substitute "Coimisiún" and "Coimisinéir" for "Commission" and "Commissioner" wherever mentioned in the Bill. As the Deputy referred to, I wrote to him in this regard on 16 November. As he has said himself, I understand and agree with the underlying intention of the proposed amendment but, at this stage, it would require more than 500 individual amendments to be read, moved and voted on, which would be onerous and burdensome. However, I will seek Government approval to bring forward a single amending provision to affect the necessary changes for inclusion in future legislation as soon as is practicable.This would be an efficient and effective way to achieve the intended aim. As I set out in the letter, the current approach in the Bill fulfils the requirement of section 9D(1) of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, once sections 4 and 5 of that Act are commenced, because it provides that the legal name of the new regulator is to be coimisiún na meán. The reference to commission and commissioner is for interpretive purposes for the English language version of the Bill. Is í fírinne an scéil ná gur féidir an cuspóir atá taobh thiar de na leasuithe a moladh a bhaint amach trí leasú amháin ar an mBille nuair a achtófar é. Ag an bpointe seo, bheadh os cionn 500 leasú ag teastáil chun an leasú mar a bhí beartaithe. This is the reason, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh has said, that once this becomes an Act it can be done with one amendment in the future.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 9:In page 18, line 23, to delete “approval” and substitute “consent”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I set out on Committee Stage with regard to amendment No. 10, I am advised that it is not appropriate to give a public body this type of general power. It should be explicitly linked to its functions. This is why the Bill provides for these powers in relation to designated online services and their compliance with online safety codes. Under the Bill it will be an offence for them not to do so. On amendment No. 35, the Digital Services Act sets out a detailed process by which this may be done. The Digital Services Act came into force on 16 November. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, leads on the implementation of the Digital Services Act in our national law. Dealing with this in the Bill would duplicate and pre-empt that work. Therefore, I do not accept these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as ucht a gcuid leasuithe. As I set out on Committee Stage, I believe the intention of amendments Nos. 11 and 12 is already provided for in paragraphs (c) and (e) of section 7(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Bill. Mar sin, ní mholaim glacadh leis na leasuithe seo. I will not accept amendment No. 13 because an coimisiún will undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system on foot of a recommendation of the Future of Media Commission.  I thank the Deputies for proposing amendments Nos. 28 and 29. Section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 8 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may establish committees to assist and to advise it on matters relating to its functions or on such other matters as it may determine. The effect of the amendment would be to mandate an coimisiún to establish a committee that would monitor and report on compliance with obligations and propose recommendations on the use of the Irish language across the media. While I appreciate the intentions behind this amendment, I cannot accept it. I have some worries about mandating the establishment of multiple committees in legislation as, notwithstanding the language used, that tends to fix the subject matter of the committee to a moment in time. Accordingly, I am advised that it is more appropriate to allow an coimisiún the flexibility to define the terms of reference of any committee established pursuant to section 19. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 34 because, as I said on Committee Stage, it may imply there is a hierarchy of objectives of an coimisiún. It is intended that an coimisiún fulfil all its statutory functions, from online safety to the promotion of programming in the Irish language, and set them out in its statement of strategy accordingly. Amendment No. 53 would infringe on the editorial freedom of both advertisers and media service providers and, in any case, we are addressing this through section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, which will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media. Amendment No. 36 seeks to make statutory provision for a consultation on the provision of a dedicated Irish language youth radio service. As I have previously noted during this Bill's passage through the House, I will not accept this amendment because the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisiún na meán undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. The results of the review will inform the development of any actions necessary in this area. Amendments Nos. 43, 48 and 50 are similar in intent to amendments proposed in the Seanad on gender and nationality quotas in respect of musical works. I carefully considered those proposals and, on foot of legal advice from the Attorney General, decided not to introduce any provision for them on Committee Stage but, instead, sought and obtained Government approval to draft amendments to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. The issue of quotas raises complex legal questions. There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports. For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from €37.2 million in 2020 to €52.2 million in 2023. That is the basis for my rationale for not accepting these amendments. I thank the Deputies for amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive. These amendments would have the effect of requiring media service rules relating to accessibility to reflect the needs of Irish speakers. While I fully welcome the intent behind the amendments, I am of the view that it would be appropriate to defer the introduction of such a measure until coimisiún na meán, on foot of a recommendation of the Future of Media Commission, undertakes a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. This would allow coimisiún na meán to assess fully the capacity of the broadcasting sector in respect of the accessibility of Irish language content. This review could then inform future updates to the rules coimisiún na meán makes in respect of accessibility. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, ba é ceann de na moltaí a rinne an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán ná go ndéanfaí athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar sheirbhísí agus ábhar Gaeilge ar fud chóras na meán. Ghlac an Rialtas leis an moladh sin. Déanfaidh coimisiún na meán an t-athbhreithniú seo, agus táthar ag súíl go dtógfaidh sé 18 mí chun é a chríochnú. Leag Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán roinnt ceisteanna amach ina thuarascáil ar ceart don athbhreithniú díriú orthu, lena n-áirítear ról RTÉ, TG4, Raidió na Gaeltachta agus soláithrithe ábhair. Ina theannta sin, moladh go scrúdódh an t-athbhreithniú deiseanna do chomhoibriú agus do chomhpháirtíocht amach anseo, straitéisí le haghaidh rannpháirtíochta óige, cláir óige agus oideachas. Cé nár mhian liom talamh slán a dhéanamh de mhionsonraí athbhreithniú neamhspleách an choimisiúin, bheinn ag súil go mbeadh an próiseas leathan go leor chun na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an Teachta a chlúdú. Táim ag súil freisin go ndéanfaidh an coimisiún, go háirithe an coimisinéir um fhormhaoirsiú na meán, agus an coiste Oireachtais plé ar an ábhar seo. I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Munster and Mythen for amendment No. 81. As I set out on Committee Stage, I cannot accept the amendment because it would be inappropriate to pick out only two EU languages in the context of this Bill transposing the audiovisual and media services directive. As important, though, the amendment would appear not to reflect the fact that Irish and English are separate languages and that a word or phrase which may be functionally equivalent in one language may carry entirely different implicit meanings or connotations in the other, which may cause either or both to fall within a particular category of harmful online content. I therefore cannot accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sílim go raibh mé soiléir go leor. Caithfimid fanacht go dtí go bhfaighfear na moltaí a rinne an Coimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán agus go ndéanfar athbhreithniú cuimsitheach ar sheirbhísí agus ar ábhair Gaeilge ar fud chóras na meán mar atá. We should wait for that. The commission set out in this report a number of issues that the review should focus on which I named earlier and which we should wait for. Tá sé sin leathan go leor chun na ceisteanna a d'ardaigh an Teachta a chlúdach.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment seeks to require coimisiún na meán to meet with the gambling regulatory authority biannually and to produce reports on online gambling annually. As I set out on Dáil Committee Stage, the Bill already addresses the issue, which is essentially about the co-operation of regulatory bodies on the issue of gambling, by setting out that coimisiún na meán must co-operate in relation to the regulation of gambling with any public body concerned with that matter and this will enable an coimisiún and the gambling regulatory authority when established with the flexibility to determine as independent regulators their necessary level of co-operation and engagement. This means that on establishment, an coimisiún will co-operate with the existing public bodies responsible for gambling and will also co-operate with the gambling regulatory authority when it is established.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as a gcuid leasuithe. Ní ghlacaim le leasuithe Uimh. 15, 17 nó 69, toisc, mar a luaigh mé ar Céim an Choiste, go ndéanann siad macasamhail d’fhorálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla, 2003, mar a leasaíodh é, nó, i gcás leasú Uimh. 17, go bhfuil sé sriantach gan ghá. Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 69 all seek to require a minimum number of members of staff or commissioners in coimisiún na meán to be competent in the Irish language. It is important to set out the overarching legislative background that has been in place since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 last December.  Section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, now provides that the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee established under the Act shall have regard to the objective of increasing, by 31 December 2030 at the latest, the number of staff of public bodies who are competent in the Irish language such that at least 20% of staff recruited are competent. As I have previously indicated, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is specified as a public body in the First Schedule to the Act and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions of the Bill, coimisiún na meán will be considered a public body under the Act. On that basis I cannot accept amendment No. 15, which seeks to replicate the provisions of section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act within this Bill.  Similarly, I cannot accept amendment No. 17, which would require that no fewer than 30% of commissioners and 20% of staff of coimisiún na meán would be proficient in Irish. The Official Languages Act provides the basis for an objective which applies across public bodies. I do not see the merit in seeking to apply a specific requirement to coimisiún na meán.  As the Irish language services advisory committee continues its work over the coming years, consideration could be given to requiring competency in the Irish language for one of the commissioner posts. However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisiún na meán. Accordingly, the best way for providing for that recruitment is through the recruitment process for commissioners, rather than in legislation. Amendment No. 69 would require that no fewer than 50% of the board members of RTÉ be proficient in the Irish language. As I noted on Dáil Committee Stage, a provision of this kind would be at odds with provisions for membership of State boards more generally.  With regard to the criteria necessary for consideration as a member of the board of RTÉ, section 82 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 already provides that candidates must have “experience of or shown capacity in”, among others, “matters pertaining to the development of the Irish language”.  I do not believe that specific provision as contemplated by the amendment, over and above that already provided for, or in addition to the provisions for membership of State boards more generally is necessary.  As Deputy Ó Snodaigh noted, the new chair of RTÉ who was appointed yesterday, Siún Ní Raghallaigh, is a former chair of TG4 and a fluent Irish speaker which I think will stand to her in her new role.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As a proud Monaghan woman, I fully agree with the Deputies on the public service value of the independent radio sector, particularly at local and regional level. I am sure Deputy Munster and I, living near each other as we do, listen to and value the same local and regional radio. Local radio stations are the very essence of public service broadcasting and, as Deputy Cannon and others said, they have proved a lifeline for many, particularly at the height of the Covid crisis, by providing critical local information and a vital sense of community when it was most needed. Regarding the calls for the broadcasting levy to be suspended or reduced, we must keep in mind the regulatory principle that a regulated service should only contribute to the cost of functions related to that service. That is the intention of subsection 21(5) of the Bill. It is an important principle based on legal advice. Therefore, it is not possible for the levy on designated online services to be used to fund a reduction in a levy on broadcasters. This is an argument that was also made to me in a submission. Exchequer funding for 2023 for an coimisiún is an interim measure to enable it to get started quickly on its new functions. One of its priorities will be the preparation and making of a levy order to ensure it becomes self-funding as soon as possible in respect of its full range of functions and to ensure online platforms pay a levy to fund the regulation of those entities and their activities. The amendment proposes that, "The Minister shall within 180 days of the passage of this Act lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on provision for a reduction in the levy in recognition of the public information service provided by independent radio stations." I am very conscious of the challenges facing the independent radio sector. While I do not believe this legislation is the appropriate vehicle to address immediate economic pressure facing the sector, I am cognisant of the concerns expressed by Members and the sector itself. Although I do not propose to accept the amendment, I acknowledge Deputy Cannon's request that I look at all options. To that end, I intend to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, this week to engage with the sector with a view to understanding the dynamics of the current economic environment and its impacts on the sector. I am conscious that the temporary business energy support scheme has only recently opened for applications and its benefits have not even been felt. I will ask the BAI to examine the extent to which these horizontal support measures will assist in alleviating current financial pressures. I am not ruling anything in or out at this juncture but it is important that we have robust and independent data to support any decision that might be taken. Rather than producing a report on a reduction in the levy within 180 days, as proposed in the amendment, I will ask the BAI to report back to me within 100 days, which would bring us into the first quarter of next year. Furthermore, when the executive chairperson of an coimisiún is formally appointed, I will meet that person and ask that he or she take into account Members' concerns when it comes to putting in place a new broadcasting levy order under an coimisiún na meán, which will take effect in 2024. I am looking at a report to me in the first quarter of 2023 and I am also looking to 2024 and a meeting with the executive chairperson. Of course, there also will be an in-depth engagement with the sector by an coimisiún na meán. Reducing the broadcasting levy is not the only way to support the sector. The Bill provides for a scheme to enable local broadcasters to avail of grant funding to provide training or professional development for persons employed by or providing services to the broadcaster in regard to promoting good professional journalistic practices. As Minister, I have supported the independent radio sector. In budget 2023, I secured €6 million for the establishment of the media fund, which will facilitate a local democracy reporting scheme and a court reporting scheme.They will be administered by coimisiún na meán and I would expect that local radio and newspapers would be well placed to benefit. My intention is that these would be in play and in a position to distribute before the end of 2023. The sound and vision scheme operated by the BAI provides significant support to the broadcasting sector and since taking office, I have allocated an additional €17.4 million in Exchequer funding to the scheme, within which €5 million has been ring-fenced for independent commercial radio and €1.2 million has been ring-fenced for community radio. The sectors also benefit under some of the other schemes. I understand that the sound and vision scheme does not include news and current affairs but it has promoted and supported the long-term sustainability of the sector and it has been strongly welcomed by the sector for doing so. The sound and vision scheme has supported the provision of important public service content for the Irish public, as well as making a real and significant contribution to meeting the costs of producing content for the radio sector. That is why I am announcing that I have decided to provide funding of €2.5 million before the end of this year for another specific round of the sound and vision scheme for commercial radio, which will be rolled out through the BAI in 2023. The value of this funding is greater than the full-year cost of the levy for the commercial radio sector. Those are my proposals in recognition of the concerns expressed by Deputies. I understand the concerns that Deputies Canney, Munster and Naughten have expressed and I am grateful to them for the amendments they put forward. I cannot accept the amendment but I have brought forward strong proposals to support the radio sector. Deputy Cannon asked me to explore all options and I hope he is in a position to accept that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are all in agreement on the real value of the independent radio sector. I appreciate the responses from Deputies. I will make that report available when it comes and as I said I am asking for it to be brought to me within 100 days. I will bring Deputy Cannon's concerns on the sound and vision application process to the BAI too. Although I am not accepting the amendment, I am committing to writing to the BAI this week so that I have robust and independent data in advance of any decisions that might be made on this. I will get that within 100 days, the Deputies will get to see the report and I will communicate the complexities of the process and the Deputies' concerns around that. As I have announced, I am also providing funding of €2.5 billion before year end for another specific round of the sound and vision scheme for commercial radio.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Similar to Deputy Cannon's point, it is about the process. The Deputy is saying it is about the length of time but it is about that scheme overall so I will bring those concerns to the BAI.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 33:In page 34, lines 12 and 13, to delete “publish, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform,” and substitute the following:“, with the approval of the Minister, given with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, publish”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 38 would have the effect of preventing an coimisiún from co-operating with groups in the establishment of standards or self-regulatory systems as they relate to commercial communications. As I stated on Committee Stage of the Bill going through the Dáil, I cannot accept this amendment as it would appear to contradict the audiovisual media services directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive, and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms. Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. I cannot accept the amendment as it appears to contradict the audiovisual media services directive. The Bill will not be providing for, nor will an coimisiún be overseeing, the entire advertising regulatory framework in the State, which is distributed across a range of authorities. For example, Members will be aware that the forthcoming gambling regulation Bill will establish a gambling regulator to oversee the regulation of gambling, while the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018 sets out provisions relating to the advertisement of alcohol. The commission will have a strong role in regulating commercial communications, including advertising, through media service codes, which will be binding on video-on-demand services and broadcasting services, and through online safety codes, which will be binding on designated online services. The main concern is that it would appear to contradict the audiovisual media services directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 39 would require an coimisiún to make a report setting out concrete steps for how media services providers established in Ireland, including RTÉ and TG4, can make their services widely available on an all-island basis. It should be noted that RTÉ and TG4 are currently obliged, insofar as possible, to provide their services to the whole of the island. As identified in the amendment, key to the goal would be all media service providers obtaining or retaining the rights to programmes in two jurisdictions, in Ireland and in the United Kingdom. Given the country-by-country nature of how rights related to media production are bought and sold, including the important part this plays in pre-financing productions in Ireland, this would lead to a significant increase in cost in providing, or loss of funding for, many different kinds of programmes. Accordingly, while I am sympathetic to the aim, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I noted when the issue was raised previously during this Bill's passage through the Houses, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it would be troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching their public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps. That goes to the core of the issue raised by Deputy Daly. However, I do not think we should prescribe in legislation in this level of detail what maps or geographical areas RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show on television. As I suggested on Committee Stage, this might be a matter that could more appropriately be raised with RTÉ by the joint committee. I acknowledge that this amendment seeks to address a number of previous instances which offended many people. However, I cannot accept the amendment as it would set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would have the effect of obliging Coimisiún na Meán to make a report and recommendations on how the State could make available broadcasts of sports events both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State. It would also have the effect of introducing conditionality on the availability of grants from Sport Ireland to sporting bodies linked to the availability of any broadcast, whether live or not, of their events on an all-island basis. The rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between the rights holders and broadcasters and, as such, it is not one Coimisiún na Meán can have a role in or one that can be legislated for. It is also not appropriate that conditions for grants that may be awarded by Sport Ireland would be linked to the negotiation of rights for any given event. Similarly, the running of competitions is an operational and commercial matter for the broadcasters and, again, it is not an area where Coimisiún na Meán can have a role or one that should be legislated for. As such, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would oblige Coimisiún na Meán to make reports and recommendations on how public bodies engaged in the distribution of State moneys for the production, screening and broadcast of audiovisual or sound content to ensure funds are distributed equitably and proportionally throughout the island of Ireland, with regard to the need for regional balance in investment and representation in audiovisual content, screen and sound. For a number of reasons, I will not accept the amendment. At its widest and taking account of the specific bodies referenced in the amendment, a definition of "public bodies" could cover the Revenue Commissioners in their role regarding the application of the section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland as regards making development and production loans available, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as regards the sound and vision scheme, TG4 as regards its role in commissioning content and RTÉ as regards its funding for independent productions through the independent production account established under section 116 of the Broadcasting Act. Each of the funds disbursed by those bodies may come from two sources, namely, from the Exchequer, in the form of funding for section 481, Screen Ireland loans and TG4, and from the licence fee, in the form of funding for RTÉ and the sound and vision scheme. While I appreciate the intent of the amendment to ensure more balanced regional development and representation, it touches on a number of fundamental issues that would render it unworkable due to the nature of the audiovisual sector in the State and potential issues regarding EU law. For example, TG4, as a publisher-broadcaster, commissions all its content production from Gaeltacht-based companies, largely in Galway but also in Cork and Waterford. Obliging TG4 to distribute funding equitably and proportionally throughout the island of Ireland could undermine its current commissioning model and the range of independent production companies that support this. It is natural that production companies providing for TG4 would be concentrated in Gaeltacht areas given a greater number of fluent Irish speakers live there. I would be worried about the unintended consequences of providing that funding by TG4 be spread regionally. The amendment would also impact on the operation of the section 481 film tax credit. The relief is distributed by the Revenue Commissioners and is technically open to any EU-based company that meets the qualifying criteria. Therefore, restricting the application of this relief to the island of Ireland, as suggested by the amendment, would appear to a contravention of EU law. I agree that seeking balanced regional development is important and it is an objective of Government, both within the national planning framework and underpinning the national development plan. However, I do not think it would be appropriate to place such an objective in legislation, as proposed by the Deputies. The amendment, as drafted, would appear to give rise to a number of unintended consequences.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to amendments Nos. 44, 52 and 57, as I outlined at Committee Stage, the main reason for the language in this section is that it is in line with the standard of “harm or undue offence” applied to material by the BAI through its code of programme standards, ensuring that the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition. In addition, freedom of expression is not absolute and like all other rights, it is subject to balancing in law to ensure that the rights of others, for example, the right to safety and security, are not unduly infringed. This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR. I am confident that the Bill sits comfortably within those traditions. For this reason, I am not accepting those amendments. With reference to amendments Nos. 45 and 46, the language used reflects existing provisions in section 39(1)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Section 7 requires an coimisiún to uphold the democratic values set out in the Constitution, including freedom of expression. Article 40.6 requires the State to limit freedom of expression in certain instances. The courts have since set a high bar for when it is appropriate for the State to do so and it is right that this language and associated jurisprudence should be carried forward through this Bill. I do not believe additional clarification needs to be added to the provision, as suggested in amendment No. 46. As such, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 45 and 46. I understand the Deputy’s position, however.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is what the BAI does currently on a case-by-case basis. That language has been carried over from the existing provision set out in section 39(1)(d) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009 which, in turn, reflects previous legislation and, ultimately, Article 40.6 of the Constitution.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I set out at Committee Stage, the amendment would represent a significant policy initiative and, as such, requires extensive analysis and consideration with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed. For example, it does not appear to have any basis in European law. There are also issues to be addressed regarding the rate and nature of the levy, notwithstanding that the amendment now specifies “post tax revenue”. Finally, it appears to apply to services only established under the jurisdiction of the State which, in essence, could mean services looking to relocate away from Ireland arising from the imposition of such a levy. For these reasons, I will not accept this amendment.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 54:In page 54, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:“(4) Media service codes may provide for standards and practices to promote the following:(a) balanced gender representation of participants in news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters or made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services;(b) the broadcast in programmes broadcast on sound broadcasting services of music composed or performed by women.”.This group of amendments are intended to allow Coimisiún na Meán make media service codes which promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes on radio, television and video-on-demand services and to promote the broadcasting of musical works composed or performed by women on radio services. A key goal of mine as Minister is to further gender equality within every sector under my remit, and to collaborate closely with my Government colleagues to drive change across other key Departments. Young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see or hear. There needs to be a significant improvement in the ratio of women to men on radio and television so that both genders feel represented in public discourse as well as better representation of women in music on our airwaves. Following careful consideration of the compatibility of gender balance measures with the right to freedom of expression and with competition law, it is considered that the most appropriate approach to further this goal is to empower Coimisiún na Meán to make codes setting out standards and practices in the promotion of greater representation for women in music and news broadcasting.  Such codes would be binding on providers of radio, television and video-on-demand services and, where breaches occur, could be subject to enforcement action by Coimisiún na Meán. This approach will allow Coimisiún na Meán the flexibility to identify appropriate measures to promote gender equality that are consistent with our legal framework.

This change was agreed in consultation with our public service broadcasters and is considered important to allow progression from outdated technologies with very little viewership.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for the amendment. The amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay of RTÉ employees. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá sé fíorthábhachtach go mbeadh cothromaíocht ann idir an Ghaeilge agus an Béarla. Bheadh imní orm faoi aon difríocht pá a bhaineann go hiomlán leis an teanga ina ndéanann duine a chuid oibre. Parity of esteem between Irish and English is vital. I share concerns about any disparity in pay being purely related to the language through which someone conducts their work. RTÉ is undertaking a root-and-branch review of grading structures and examining all roles in the organisation, including Raidió na Gaeltachta. The Deputies are aware I have written to RTÉ asking it to address the concerns of the members of the committee and set out exactly how the process will address pay disparity. The independence of RTÉ, however, in operational matters is already provided for in legislation and I am advised it is not appropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I share the Deputies' concern in relation to parity of esteem between Irish and English and I have written to RTÉ asking it to address their concerns. If the Deputies do not receive a reply shortly, I will write to RTÉ again. I see an opportunity given that the chair of RTÉ who was appointed to the position yesterday is a fluent Irish speaker. I will meet the new chair, arising from her appointment, and will raise the matter with her.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The Bill provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industry. Section 24(1) gives me, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) sets out the amount that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming that the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of this year, so no further voted capital funding can be then advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I put the Bill before the Dáil to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. I thank the Deputies for their engagement. As I have outlined, this as a technical enabling Bill. It has an important outcome in that it allows for the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland’s work in the area of tourism product developments. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Comhaltaí as a mbreithniú ar an mBille seo.
