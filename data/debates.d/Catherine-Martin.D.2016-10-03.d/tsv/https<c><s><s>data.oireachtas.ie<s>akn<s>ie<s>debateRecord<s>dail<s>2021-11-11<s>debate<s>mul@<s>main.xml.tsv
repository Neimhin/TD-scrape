CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	In its decision of 19 October 2021, the Government agreed that the remaining aspects of the hospitality, entertainment and night-time economy sector could reopen with a full range of protective measures in place and the wide and robust implementation of the Covid-19 pass. My officials and I have been engaging with the various sectors to address some of the challenges faced throughout the past 20 months in the run-up to the Government's decision and also following that decision. This extensive stakeholder engagement has resulted in the production of an updated set of guidelines for nightlife and entertainment to provide for the safe operation of the sector, as Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities. The guidance contains a range of advice, including on ventilation, hygiene, management structures, face coverings and so forth. In light of the epidemiological situation that has emerged over the last number of weeks, it is imperative that we carefully manage reopening. The Government's aim has been to allow as many businesses as possible to reopen in the safest possible way. This is why we need regulations and robust guidance to assist businesses to reopen safely and, importantly, to stay open. Central to these guidelines is a commitment to adhering to best practice in infection prevention control measures which are necessary to protect individuals and society, as well as supporting our continued progress towards a full return to the operation of various sectors. Compliance with these measures should not be considered best practice but rather the minimum standard required to protect our communities. Individual businesses must proactively risk assess their premises to calibrate mitigation measures in a bespoke way for the business. Covid-19 infection rates have been increasing, along with hospitalisation and ICU admissions, but thanks to the exceptional levels of engagement with the vaccination programme we were in a position to continue our careful and gradual approach to reopening. However, we must redouble our efforts to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. The night-time economy sector, which includes so many businesses, has been patient and was one of the last sectors to return. The sector has worked very constructively with my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and other Departments in developing and implementing the relevant guidelines and regulations. This engagement is continuing with a view to safeguarding public health while ensuring we continue to move forward with reopening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy knows, the HSE and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, are the relevant bodies under the indoor dining regulations which came into force on 26 July 2021. Since the reopening of the night-time economy from 22 October 2021, compliance officers from the HSE have been undertaking checks, with an initial emphasis on the nightclubs and late bars. This included 123 inspections undertaken between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. on the initial bank holiday weekend, where overall compliance was generally found to be good. A further 50 inspections took place on the weekend of 29 to 31 October covering retail, cinema and related areas. As for the night-time economy, compliance officers from the HSE have been engaged in compliance checks in the night-time sector since 22 October and over the initial bank holiday week over 40 teams of compliance officers undertook checks focusing on the hospitality service sectors, particularly pubs, restaurants and late night venues. Nightclubs in Dublin, Cork and Galway received particular attention. In the engagement this week with the hospitality and nightclub sectors and in further engagement with the arts and culture sector, I believe leadership is being shown by the industry on this. The sectors realise the real risk. Everybody needs to be on board on this in order to keep their livelihoods safe, to keep business reopened and to protect public health.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the calls for a hotline, where a person has a concern that the requirements of the regulations are not being complied with, he or she may communicate this via the HSE live helpline on 1800 700700. It should be noted that anybody doing so would have to press number 3, which is the other issues category. It might be useful to tailor the helpline to allow members of the public to report specific instances in a more targeted manner. This is something we will communicate to the Department of Health, as the HSE is under the remit of that Department. It will a subject of discussion between officials in the Department of Health, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and my Department. Regarding what happens when there is non-compliance, the fines have been set out but, ultimately, there is the threat of closure. We are appealing to businesses that are not checking for certificates, because it is not fair to the other businesses and it is not fair for public health. For both reasons, to protect public health and to help the businesses that have been through such a tough time to keep their businesses open, everybody should abide by the rules.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I note the Deputy's question, as submitted, was to make my views known on the recent sale of a studio to a large real estate corporation, particularly given that the State had only recently disposed of its share of the studios and that the studios have received large amounts of public funding over many years and my further views on whether it is time to take the studios into public ownership. I understand that the sale of this studio is to the world leader in studio infrastructure and as such, this development will inject further essential investment into Ireland's network of studio infrastructure. It is a positive indication of the increasing sophistication of the development of the screen sector in recent years and a vote of confidence in the future of Ireland’s audiovisual industry. The inward investment will assist in establishing Ireland as a primary location for strategic investment in film and TV drama. I understand that the studio will shortly see an expansion of its studio and support spaces with an additional 21,000 sq. ft. of sound stages and 21,000 sq. ft. of support space added. This sale was conducted between two private sector entities. The grounds for any investigation into the circumstances of the sale are not immediately apparent. In any case, queries about the conduct of the sale would be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government’s ambition as stated in the audiovisual action plan is to establish Ireland as a global hub for the production of film, TV drama and animation. Ireland competes internationally to attract inward productions that brings valuable investment to Ireland and this company with its global reach will assist the growth of our audiovisual industry. This development will underpin that ambition. With the growth in streaming services, the demand for high-end TV series is almost limitless. The audiovisual industry is transforming at an exponential rate and I would not favour taking studio infrastructure into State ownership. The circumstances of the sale is a private matter for the studio’s commercial owners. The studio is and was, before its sale, in full commercial ownership and the State has no stake in ownership. It did not receive public funding in the past decade. From an EU perspective, studios are subject to state-aid rules and any state intervention would require EU approval, which would not ordinarily be forthcoming. The Government recognises the very significant success of our audiovisual industry in recent years. This success has been underpinned by the Government’s investment in Screen Ireland, the agency responsible for the development of the screen industry. The studio provides world-class production facilities for both indigenous and incoming productions alike. This sale has the potential to bring new investment which will allow ongoing expansion and secure the future of this iconic studio.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Film studios are privately owned commercial entities, of which there are a number in Ireland with several new studios in various stages of development and planning. There is no rationale for public intervention in the provision of film studios as the private sector is doing so effectively. There is no evidence that the public sector would be more successful than the private sector in running a film studio. Taking one film studio into public ownership would be seen as anti-competitive by other film studio owners. Public funding of film studios is a state-aid matter and the agreement of the European Commission is not likely to be forthcoming if we were to attempt to take this studio into public ownership. There is a well-known case, involving Ciudad de la Luz film studio in Alicante in Spain. In 2012 the European Commission ruled that public subsidies of €260 million had to be repaid to the regional government as the subsidies violated European competition law and the studio closed as a result.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can tell the Deputy what the new investor will bring. As a long-term substantial investor in Ireland's creative sector, it has pledged to support job-train initiatives to ensure that the local workforce grows to meet the increasing demands of domestic and international content producers. It has already pledged a substantial financial commitment towards such job programmes and is looking to partner with stakeholders including Screen Skills Ireland. Its global change endowment has committed more than €10 million to date and focuses primarily on screen-sector employment opportunities for disadvantaged and under-represented communities whether dealing with gender diversity or regionalisation. In the press release announcing the sale, Joe Devine, the chairman of both Troy and Ardmore studios, said on behalf of the shareholders in both Troy and Ardmore that when they were approached, they realised that this investment could really transform-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----the outlook, not just for the two studios but for the wider industry in Ireland. It will help the development of this indigenous industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was delighted, as part of the national economic recovery plan, to secure the commitment from the Government to prioritise the development of a basic income guarantee pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sectors. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value this sector brings to all Irish citizens. It is something we really felt during the Covid-19 pandemic when they were taken from us. The importance of Irish culture, art and productions as a whole cannot be understated and it contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society was particularly evident during the pandemic, as I mentioned. Against this backdrop and my own experience of the arts, funding for the basic income guarantee pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for the budget and I secured €25 million to realise the pilot scheme next year. With regard to the timeline for the launch of the pilot, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise. This work is ongoing and my ambition is to open the scheme for applications during the first quarter of 2022. The oversight group continues to meet regularly and met yesterday with a representative from SIPTU. My Department will hold a stakeholder consultation forum on 8 December on the basic income guarantee pilot scheme, in particular to tease out the eligibility criteria for the scheme. It is really important we develop the scheme in close consultation with the sector. We will be using a professional facilitator to run a world café method event to ensure the arts sector and resource bodies and representative organisations are given the opportunity to feed into the policy development for the scheme. The selection process for recipients of the basic income will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement early next month. However, I can confirm that participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test and it will be a non-competitive process, so once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, that person will be included in a randomised selection process. A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post
facto appraisal of the pilot in due course. Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. It is my intention that the pilot scheme will be open to eligible artists and creative arts sector workers. The process for recipients will be finalised through the stakeholder engagement I mentioned, which should happen next month. I can confirm it will be a non-competitive process and people will be chosen randomly. My intention is to have a number of streams, such as professional artists, emerging and developing artists and arts workers.This will be subject to two further stakeholder engagements in the coming weeks. This consultation is key in that regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Department of Rural and Community Development is working with us and other Departments in order to map out all digital hubs throughout the country, and Údarás na Gaeltachta is also developing digital hubs in Gaeltacht areas. I refer to the Deputy's proposal for the use of digital hubs for arts purposes. I would be interested in any proposal that allows digital hubs to be adapted for arts purposes and I will engage with the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and with Údarás na Gaeltachta on this matter. I understand the Minister may have mentioned the concept of adapting digital hubs for arts purposes in her discussions with the Arts Council recently.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Since I was appointed the Minister, there has been an incredible focus on the supports needed for this sector. We have had many discussions here about the value of this sector. For years, people have talked about its value while not placing an actual value on it.I have also focused on the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery task force, which related to this pilot scheme, because I saw an opportunity post Covid to place that value on those sectors and to support them. We know that uncertainty about how they can live can prevent musicians and actors from creating. That is why I was delighted to secure that commitment in the national economic recovery plan, which emphasises my commitment to the intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society, which we really saw during the pandemic. These people were deprived of opportunities to perform and earn a living. The next step was to secure that €25 million in the budget for this three-year pilot.  As I said to Deputy Berry earlier, while stakeholder engagement in general is ongoing, facilitated stakeholder engagement will take place next month. I want to cover the disciplines the Deputy mentioned, but with the engagement of the sector. I have mentioned emerging artists, arts workers and everything the Deputy has referred to. This will all have to be teased out in close consultation with the sector. Everything I have done with regard to the sector has been done in close consultation with it. This is a very important issue. What we are doing is groundbreaking and we need to do it properly. That is why I want that consultation with the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am in agreement with the Deputy about that underfunding but things have changed. I secured an unprecedented and record level of funding for the Arts Council this year on foot of last year. I held onto that €130 million. I secured funding of €25 million for this income guarantee pilot. It is to be a three-year pilot so I will obviously seek to secure that funding for three years, and I will secure it because I have a commitment from Government. The intention of the pilot scheme is to study whether such a measure will contribute to ensuring those in the arts sector have that security blanket of knowing that money will come in to help them to do what they do best, to create. It aims to ensure the arts sector remains intact and to provide the artists and creatives with the opportunity to increase their practices, thereby minimising the loss of skills and contributing to the sector's gradual regrowth. It is a no-brainer. I can see why it was the number one recommendation, which is why I am absolutely delighted to have been able to secure that commitment from Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assure the Deputy that it did not take a pandemic for me to appreciate the arts. I am looking around the Chamber and there are many Deputies here who grew up surrounded and enriched by the arts. I do not think I am alone in that. I am looking at Deputy Boyd Barrett and it certainly did not take a pandemic for him to appreciate the arts either. I am in a position where I can make a difference. That is why I am delighted to have been able to secure this commitment. With regard to the three-year pilot, this duration was specified in the number one recommendation of the stakeholders' group. I can go through the detail. It is on page 42 of the arts and culture recovery task force's report. I am taking guidance from, and being steered by, the sector itself. We will tease that out in our engagement with the sector, especially in the world café-style engagement to be held in December. That is where that detail came from.
