CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	This amends section 7(5)(d) of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill. It provides that the commission may undertake strategic reviews of the sectors regulated by the commission in respect of the protection of workers' rights. I cannot accept the amendment for the following reasons: in the first instance, policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation. The amendment is also straying into matters that may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. In particular, section 11(1) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides the WRC shall conduct reviews and monitor developments as respects workplace relations. I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the commission. I understand the intention of the amendment. The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors regulated by the Bill. I acknowledge the concerns raised by the Senator regarding working conditions in the technology sector. Last May, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade union experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions. The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms. In particular, one of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved and the types of distressing content she was required to view as part of the role. The Tánaiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment. The Tánaiste also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again. It is important to stress the protection of workers' rights is not a core function of the Department or its agencies. It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy. Moving responsibility for workers' rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors. In this regard, the role will of an coimisiún as an independent regulatory body is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video on demand and designated online services. It is not intended to regulate employment relations or to assess working conditions. As a general principle in considering any amendment that might expand the functions of an coimisiún, I am conscious of not unduly expanding its scope to other areas of policy with the effect that its core functions might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have addressed these issues. I have said I cannot accept the amendment because I believe the policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I also stated I believe the amendment is straying into matters that may be more appropriate to the functions of the WRC. I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating its work. The idea of moving responsibility for workers' rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors. I will not accept the amendment today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not my intention to come back to this on Report Stage because of the reasons I have outlined. Perhaps I said "today" but I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for proposing these important amendments. The coverage by broadcasters of our democratic process, particularly during electoral periods, can have a profound impact on the outcome of the process. That is why broadcasting legislation has for many years sought to ensure fairness, objectivity and impartiality in both news coverage and the coverage of elections. This Bill will extend those provisions to the video-on-demand services, reflecting the changing way in which citizens access new media. As regards amendment No. 104, the party-political broadcast has played an important role in the democratic process by allowing political parties uncontested airtime to carry their message to the public. For that reason, these broadcasts have been exempted from the general prohibition against the broadcasting or making available of advertisements directed towards a political end. It is the intention of the Bill to continue this exemption in respect of party-political broadcasts. However, I acknowledge that the use of the term “party political programmes” in section 9 of the Bill – inserting section 46M(4) into the Broadcasting Act 2009 – rather than “party political broadcasts” may give rise to some interpretive confusion if it is not clarified. The term “party political programmes” was used in lieu of “party political broadcasts” to ensure the section covered both broadcasting services and video-on-demand services that would not be considered to make broadcasts. I have asked my officials to examine this issue with a view to returning to this House on Report Stage. I cannot promise Senators that I will introduce an amendment on Report Stage but I will certainly seek to set out any plans I have to address this issue. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 104 at this time but acknowledge the matter needs to be scrutinised closely. Amendments Nos. 31 and 96 also address an issue that goes to the heart of our democratic process, namely, the coverage by broadcasters of political parties and the methodology for determining the allocation of that coverage. Given that the allocation of coverage may play a role in determining the outcome of an election, I acknowledge that this is a contentious and controversial issue. As amendment No. 31 recognises, the BAI, under section 42 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, has issued a code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs – rule 27 – which deals with the coverage of elections by broadcasters. Under the Bill, this code will continue in force upon the dissolution of the BAI and the establishment of the coimisiún until such time as it is replaced by a media service code, which will apply not only to broadcasters but also to certain video-on-demand services. At present, rule 27 places responsibility on broadcasters to develop mechanisms to fairly allocate coverage during elections rather than being prescriptive. This is in contrast with the current situation in Britain, where Ofcom, as the audiovisual service regulator, issues prescriptive rules to broadcasters. We have seen a transformation in the political landscape in this country over the past 12 years. I recognise that this is posing a challenge for broadcasters, particularly RTÉ in its role as our largest public service broadcaster, especially regarding the allocation of coverage during elections. Given the complexity of this issue and the difficulty in arriving at a consensus, it is preferable that any common set of requirements for broadcasters in respect of party-political broadcasts or the editorial coverage of elections and referendums be made by the coimisiún through media-service codes rather than through prescription by legislation, as suggested in amendment No. 31, which covers the election period, and amendment No. 96, which focuses on coverage across the board. On that basis, I have asked my officials to further scrutinise the provisions of section 9 of the Bill, with which we insert subsections 46L(1) to (3) and the relevant measure in 46N into the Broadcasting Act to be sure that nothing in the text of the Bill would prevent the coimisiún from setting such a common set of requirements through the media service codes. I intend to request that an coimisiún review the code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality governing news and current affairs with a view to addressing the issue of fairly allocating coverage of political parties in broadcasts and video-on-demand services, particularly during elections. In doing so, I emphasise that under this legislation an coimisiún will make any decisions concerning such codes independently of the Oireachtas and myself as Minister. Similar to the situation with amendment No. 31, although I cannot accept these amendments, I will return to the House on Report Stage to allow us to discuss this matter further.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On those two amendments just mentioned, and starting with Senator Ruane's amendment No. 107, it is similar to amendment No. 2, so I am happy to come back to that on Report Stage. I reject it today, but I am happy to come back to it on Report Stage. Regarding Senator Sherlock’s amendment No. 105, it is similar to what amendment No. 104 is seeking to do in a slightly different approach. I reject the amendment today, but we will come back to it on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I recognise that amendments Nos. 32 and 33 aim to achieve gender equality within the commission and I thank the Senators for those amendments. One of my key goals since becoming a member of Government has been to further gender equality within every sector under my remit. I am absolutely committed to empowering women and using my position to help raise women's voices and drive greater gender equality. Of particular relevance to these benefits have been my actions to ensure gender equality in the appointment to the State boards of bodies under the aegis of my Department. Senators will appreciate that I understand the objectives that the amendments seek to achieve. However, there is a difference between ensuring a gender balance in sports bodies where typically a number of board positions are filled at the same time as opposed to advertising individual commissioner posts for full-time employment where the provisions of employment law apply. There would be some risks there. Before considering the amendments further, I wish to seek legal advice as to the compatibility of the proposed amendments with the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 and 2015, particularly the provisions of the Acts that prohibit the treatment of people less favourably if one is a woman and one is a man. I do not want to insert anything in the Bill that would be contrary to employment law and, therefore, I would like to get legal advice. While I do not accept these amendments, I hope to return to this issue on Report Stage following that consultation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators. I am feeling the love in the Chamber today, among Senators themselves anyway. Taken together, I can see that the proposed amendments seek to provide a legislative underpinning for the position of an online safety commissioner with responsibility for the functions of an comisiúin relating to online safety. That, as Senators have said today, is the core point being addressed in these amendments. Section 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides for the delegation of the performance of some of the functions of an coimisiún to an individual commissioner. As such, there is nothing in the Bill to preclude an coimisiún from delegating the functions relating to online safety set out in Part 8A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to a commissioner who shall be responsible for online safety. Indeed, the delegation of the online safety functions to a dedicated online safety commissioner has actually always been the intention.  As Senators have stated, it was one of the key recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media. That report recommended an explicit legislative provision for an online safety commissioner within the Bill. This provision was not included in the Bill as initiated in this House but I do intend to provide for it by way of a Government amendment as the Bill passes through the Houses. I am pleased to advise this House that good progress has been made on the drafting of such an amendment in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. I am conscious of the feeling in the House that a Government amendment addressing this issue should, if time permits, be introduced in the Seanad. Therefore, I propose to introduce a Government amendment on Report Stage in this House explicitly providing for the position of online safety commissioner within the Bill. This would provide the Seanad with sufficient opportunity to debate and scrutinise said amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators for their amendments. It is important to note that these are not board positions but full-time regulators who will go through a rigorous process to ensure their suitability similar to the Data Protection Commissioner or ComReg. Amendment No. 37 amends section 11 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, to provide that I, as Minister, would agree the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy on the commission. I believe this amendment might duplicate provisions set out in the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, in particular section 34, which sets out the functions of the Public Appointments Service. Section 11(3) of the Broadcasting Acting 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, provides that the chairperson and commissioners shall be appointed by me, as Minister, on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service. One of the reasons for specifying this in the Bill is to ensure that the codes and practices, set out under the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004, applied to the recruitment process. The recruitment and selection processes will be closely guided by the code of practice on appointments to positions in the Civil and Public Service, which set out the application of the principles of probity, merit, best practice, fairness and transparency to the recruitment of public servants. This will ensure that the process is open, transparent and fair. My officials are working with the Public Appointments Service to develop the selection criteria for the appointment of the commissioners. I anticipate that this will involve an executive search process given the specific skillset and expertise required, which Senators have mentioned, that commissioners and particularly the online safety commissioner may require. I, as Minister, will ultimately agree the selection criteria for the post as set out in the recruitment booklet that will contain the job description and selection criteria for the role of commissioner. Given that I believe the intention set out in the amendment is already provided for in legislation, and in practice, I do not propose to accept it. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 describe some areas of knowledge, expertise and experience that both I, as Minister, and the Public Appointments Service shall seek to ensure that an coimisiún has. I agree that it would be desirable that commissioners would have collectively, or individually, some or all of the knowledge and expertise described in the amendments. However, while I recognise the intention of these amendments, I would be concerned that there is a danger in being overly prescriptive as to the knowledge and experience that members of the commission should have. So I am not persuaded of the merits of amendments Nos. 38 and 39 and, therefore, cannot accept them. Amendment No. 40 would appear to duplicate provisions already in law. I understand that section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún will already be subject to the provisions of that Act. I expect that an coimisiún would not only comply with section 42 of the Act but also, in accordance with the spirit of the Act, demonstrate a culture and practice of respect of human rights. I understand that the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by the State and entered into force in 2018. I will ask my officials to consult officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth about the status of the convention. So while I do not propose to accept amendment No. 40 today I propose to return to the matter on Report Stage. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will return to amendment No. 40. As I stated in my contribution,I know that the convention has been ratified by the State. I do, however, want to have that engagement with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 37, 38 or 39.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe the provisions in amendments Nos. 42 and 45 are largely addressed by the Bill as published. Section 37 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, requires that a commissioner or other relevant person should not be party to a consideration of matter by an coimisiún where they, or a connected person such as a family member, may derive a benefit from that consideration or where they have an interest in a business or organisation which might also derive a benefit from that consideration. Section 37 also requires them to disclose to the commission that they may benefit from the consideration. The provisions of section 37 are designed to prevent any conflicts of interest that may arise in the course of the work of an coimisiún and to ensure the independence of an coimisiún in its consideration of matters particularly those pertaining to its regulatory functions. Amendment No. 42 would provide that a commissioner may be removed from office by the Government if he or she failed to comply with the requirements of section 37. Amendment No. 45 would provide that a commissioner would cease to hold office, were he or she to breach section 37. As I said, I believe the Bill already addresses the intentions of the amendments. Section 12(5)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, provides that the Government may remove a commissioner where he or she has a conflict of interest of such significance that he or she should cease to hold that office. Such a conflict of interest might include, for example, failure to disclose a relevant interest, such as acquiring shares in a provider of communications media with a value greater than €5,000 under section 37. If the Government does not seek to remove a commissioner for a breach of section 37, there is also provision for ministerial measures to be taken.Section 37(3) provides that where a commissioner fails to comply with section 37 by, for example, failing to disclose a relevant interest in an organisation that may benefit from a decision of an coimisiún in which the commissioner is involved then I, as Minister, shall decide the appropriate action to take. I believe that the Bill as published addresses the issues raised by the amendments. Accordingly, I do not accept amendments Nos. 42 and 45.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I have indicated already, I will not be accepting amendments Nos. 42 and 45 because I believe the Bill, as published, addresses the issues raised in the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendment. Section 12 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, sets out the conditions of office of a commissioner. The section also provides, as we discussed in relation to the preceding amendments, that the Government may remove a commissioner in very specific circumstances. Given the gravity of such a decision and to meet the requirements of natural justice, this section sets out very clear steps for removing a commissioner.The Government must give a notice in writing of a statement proposing to remove a commissioner to that commissioner, setting out very clearly the reasons for the proposed removal and providing an opportunity for the commissioner to make representations to the Government. Section 12(10) provides that should the Government decide to remove a commissioner following the issuance of a notice, the Government must lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the decision and the reasons for it. Amendment No. 43 would require the Government to also provide the relevant Oireachtas committee with a statement. Given section 12(10) already provides that a statement should be laid before the Oireachtas, I am advised that this would fundamentally be a duplicate provision and I do not propose to accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the intentions that underpin amendments Nos. 44 and 52, which would have the effect of allowing a commissioner or member of staff of an coimisiún to also hold office as a member of local authority. As general principle, I do not wish to put any obstacles in the path of those who are seeking election to local authorities. As a former councillor - I served with Senator Ward, as he mentioned - I know the important work undertaken by local authorities and the vital role councillors play in holding local authority executives to account and in making and influencing policy, particularly planning policy. However, it is a long-standing principle that holders of positions in the civil and public service are prohibited from taking up political appointments. This is the consistent approach taken across legislation underpinning regulatory bodies, such as the Data Protection Commission, ComReg, and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission. The purpose of the prohibition on local authority membership is to ensure that a commissioner does not do anything that could give rise even to a perception that his or her official actions are in any way influenced, or are capable of being influenced, by political or party-political motives. This is particularly important in the context of the role of the Coimisiún na Meán, as the independent regulator of the media. I am conscious of the requirements of Article 30 of the audiovisual media service directive, which provides that member states shall ensure that national regulatory authorities are legally distinct from the government and are functionally independent of the respective government and any other public or private bodies. The European Commission will, therefore, closely observe the transposition of the directive. In any case, I would not wish to do anything that would not be in compliance with the directive. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, I understand the intentions underpinning amendments Nos. 44 and 52 but, as I said, in light of the role of Coimisiún na Meán as the independent regulator of the media and in relation to the requirements of Article 30 audiovisual media service directive, I will not accept this amendment. Holding political office is different from other political conflicts. It is not just a matter of stepping outside the room. It would be seen as party political. Staff will also play important roles in investigations. I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senators for their amendments but I do not propose to accept them.As regards amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48, section 12(13) of the Broadcasting 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, sets out what constitutes a relevant interest for the purpose of determining whether a commissioner should cease to hold office by virtue of him or her, or a connected person, which includes a family member, holding a relevant interest in a provider of communications media. Section 12(11)(i) provides that a person shall cease to hold office as commissioner if he or she acquires a relevant interest in a provider of communications media. The term "provider of communications media", as set out in section 3(2)(s) of the Bill, is a broad one. It includes not only those services that will be subject to regulation by the coimisiún but also newspapers or periodicals consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs. A person is considered to have a relevant interest if he or she, or a connected person, holds equity with a value greater than €5,000 or debt with a value greater than €13,000 in a provider of communications media. The person may also hold a relevant interest if he or she receives gifts or benefits with a value greater than €650 from the provider or hold a directorship or shadow directorship in a provider. A relevant interest may arise if a person or connected relative is party to an arrangement regarding land with the provider. The values for the maximum debt and equity that may be held and the benefit that may be received were arrived at in consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I believe the balance we have arrived at is correct. It fulfils the public policy purpose of ensuring a commissioner does not inadvertently cause a cessation of office by virtue of him or her, or a connected person, acquiring a small interest or deriving a small benefit while also protecting against any conflict of interest that may arise. I understand the intention of amendments Nos. 46, 47 and 48 in seeking to go even further than the Bill in addressing conflicts of interest. The thresholds also apply to connected persons, including family. However, the proposed amendments could have unintended effects. In particular, prohibiting the holding of debt or equity in providers of communications media by connected relatives could cause commissioners to cease office if a family member acquired any debt or equity whatsoever in a provider of communications media. In this regard, I am thinking of pension products that involve investments in passive or active pension funds, which may give rise to small debt or equity holdings in respect of providers of communications media. This may be wholly outside the control of the connected relative but would nonetheless require the commissioner to cease office if these amendments were accepted. As I have said, I believe we have the balance right in the Bill in tackling any conflict of interest that may arise, while also recognising that small interests in providers of communications media may be held. I understand the intention behind amendment No. 49 in seeking to broaden the definition of "relevant interest" to encompass social media accounts. However, regarding the core principle of ensuring commissioners or connected persons do not derive benefits from the providers of communications media, I believe section 12(13)(d) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, achieves this by limiting the value of any benefits that may be received by a commissioner, connected person or staff member of the coimisiún from a provider of communications media to €650. This would also apply to income derived from the monetisation of a social media account, for example. Although the Senator said amendment No. 49 was really raised for debate, I worry it could give rise to unintended consequences whereby a commissioner could be removed from office through no fault of his or her own as a result of this provision. For example, an ill-intentioned person or entity could purchase a large quantity of fake followers in respect of a commissioner or connected person with the intention of causing a commissioner to exceed the threshold of 20,000 followers. Regarding amendment No. 49, as we discussed regarding amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 41, the Bill will be amended to provide for an online safety commissioner who will be appointed to oversee the making of online safety codes and applying them to designated online services. I am conscious that this will be a demanding role and one that is likely to be controversial. I am worried that the amendment would pose a particular risk for the online safety commissioner given the role at the forefront of regulating designated online services. Amendment No. 50, which I will not be accepting, has the same effect as amendments Nos. 44 and 52, which we have discussed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Under section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, the coimisiún may establish advisory committees to assist and advise it in matters relating to its functions. Amendment No. 53 would have the effect of requiring that members of any advisory committee of the coimisiún be subject to the same requirements to disclose interests under section 37 of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, as a commissioner, member of staff at the commission, consultant or adviser. This is a broad obligation that requires the person in question to disclose interests relating to any organisation that may derive a benefit from any matter being considered by the coimisiún and to recuse himself or herself from any discussions or decisions regarding the matter in question. This is a proportionate obligation for a commissioner, member of staff of the commission or consultant or adviser, but it may not be so for members of advisory committees. Advisory committees may be established by the coimisiún for many purposes, and the membership of such committees may comprise experts, industry representatives or representatives of particular groups, such as children, persons with disabilities and racialised communities. One of the purposes for which a committee may be established would be to provide advice to the coimisiún on its regulatory functions, though I would not wish to prejudge how many or what types of committees may be established. An example could be a committee set up to advise the coimisiún on regulatory matters relating to sound broadcasting services. In that case, it would be appropriate to include representatives of the regulated entities, such as the public service broadcasters and independent radio sector. Similarly, the coimisiún could set up a committee comprising representatives of organisations promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. Amendment No. 53 would have the effect of precluding these representatives from effectively participating in such advisory committees that the coimisiún may establish as those representatives would have an interest within the meaning of section 37 in the outcome of any discussions at the meetings of those committees and any advice they may provide to the coimisiún. Given the above, I propose to reject the amendment.
