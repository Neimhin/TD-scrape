CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Fáiltím roimh an deis labhairt leis an Roghchoiste um Thurasóireacht, Cultúr, Ealaíona, Spórt agus Meáin agus Meastacháin Athbhreithnithe 2023 dar luach €1.066 billiún san iomlán do Vóta 33 do Réimsí Clár A, B, D agus E á mbreithniú. Tá áthas orm sonraí a sholáthar maidir leis na bearta suntasacha chun tacú leis na hearnálacha a bhfuil mé freagrach astu agus chun iad a neartú, agus iad éascaithe ag an maoiniú seo. Táim an-sásta deis a fháil labhairt leis an gcoiste maidir le príomhthosaíochtaí mo Roinne agus an fhís a leagan amach do na hearnálacha luachmhara fairsinge seo. Cuireann na hearnálacha seo go mór le geilleagar na tíre, agus tacaíonn siad le folláine an duine aonair agus an phobail ar fud na hÉireann chomh maith. Almost one year after pandemic restrictions ended, these sectors now face challenging economic conditions with high inflation and energy costs putting pressure on businesses. They must tackle the urgency of climate action so we can safeguard our planet for future generations. And of course they must play our part in Ireland’s response to the war in the Ukraine. As we have so often done in hard times, these sectors continue to reinforce our resilience, solidarity, and understanding; and support society’s cohesion and well-being. Total funding for 2023 for the sectors supported by my Department is as follows. In relation to tourism: Funding for Fáilte Ireland for 2023 amounts to €94.7, this is to help drive the sustainability of our tourism sector, boost industry recruitment and retention and facilitate the establishment of a register of short-term letting properties; continued additional funding of €15 million for the tourism marketing fund, giving a total allocation of €63.2 million for overseas marketing of Ireland and the development of The Invitation project; Tourism Ireland funding of €20.8 million; €36.5 million for tourism product development; €4.5 million for Ireland-EU just transition tourism funding to support ambitious climate action through the promotion of sustainable tourism; and €7.75 million for the Brexit adjustment reserve fund to grow tourist numbers and associated revenues from Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Minister of State will brief the committee in more detail on the position in respect of sport. Prior to the onset of Covid-19, the tourism industry generated revenue of almost €6 billion supporting over 260,000 livelihoods equating to one in ten of all Irish jobs. Post pandemic, Irish tourism had a strong year in 2022,. Continued rebuilding lies ahead, however. Our primary focus now is on the sustainable development of this important economic and social sector, and marketing the island of Ireland as a desirable and competitive destination for both overseas visitors and domestic tourists. We must remind ourselves that 2021 was an unprecedented year for arts and culture against the backdrop of the pandemic and the extensive restrictions that were still in place.Venues were closed or restricted to very limited audiences. Survival was the primary focus. Thankfully, this has all changed since early 2022. Against this backdrop significant levels of funding have been maintained with total funding for the arts and culture sector in 2023 amounting to €356.982 million. The budget provides for: retention of the record €130 million funding for the Arts Council in recognition of the transformational impact of this funding and to support the sector; €35 million for the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, supporting 2,000 artists and creative arts workers; funding of €30.2 million for cultural infrastructure and development including €7 million for artists’ spaces and climate adaptation measures, which will allow for progress in the ongoing programme of investment in our capital institutions including at the National Library of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and the Crawford Art Gallery; €11.5 million for the newly extended Creative Ireland programme, including a new shared island dimension; €6.6 million in funding for Culture Ireland for the promotion of Irish arts worldwide, an increase of €2 million on the 2022 allocation; €72.1 million for the national cultural institutions to ensure the continuation of their high-quality services to the public; additional funding of €1 million for Screen Ireland giving a total record allocation of €37.9 million for the continued implementation of the Government’s ten-year audiovisual action plan. I should mention the wonderful success of Irish film at the Oscars this year, with a record number of nominations for "The Banshees of Inisherin" and with "An Cailín Ciúin" making history for the Irish language on screen. This is a testament to the levels of investment, support and continued development of the screen industry in Ireland. The budget also provides: a €3 million allocation towards the cost of developing a new archive and exhibition space as part of the overall national centre for research and remembrance; and €500,000 for supports for artists and arts workers as part of the Safe to Create programme, co-ordinated by Irish Theatre Institute, in collaboration with Minding Creative Minds. Funding for the media and broadcasting sector in 2023 will total €306.64 million and represents an innovative package which supports the sector from grassroots community radio and local newspapers to audiovisual media services and online regulation. The budget provides in particular for €7.8 million for the establishment of coimisiún na meán, the media commission, which will oversee effective regulation of online safety, support the provision of high-quality public service broadcasting, and put in place an expanded development and support framework for the wider media sector. I recently announced the appointment of new commissioners, including the Online Safety Commissioner, and they will take up their positions on an administrative basis next week. I intend to commence key provisions of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act and formally establish an coimisiún next month. An increased allocation of €7.3 million to TG4, will enable the launch of a new dedicated children’s channel, Cúla4, in September. This will be a totally new channel, operating from morning until the evening. It will include a children’s news service, entertainment and education content, drama and Irish animation. It will reflect the diverse backgrounds of children living in all parts of Ireland, but particularly in Gaeltacht and Irish-speaking communities. Its development will also support new jobs through the commissioning of additional content. A total of €6 million has been allocated to establish a local democracy reporting scheme and a courts reporting scheme which will support local, regional and national media on a platform-neutral basis. These schemes will be the first of six new schemes recommended by the Future of Media Commission. Separately the technical group examining television licence reform will deliver its recommendations to me next month. That report will be brought to Government in due course. Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe Rialtais as a dtiomantas leanúnach do na hearnálacha a ndéanann mo Roinn ionadaíocht orthu, ar chodanna ríthábhachtacha dár ngeilleagar iad. Go deimhin, tá ár bhféiniúlacht, comhtháthú sóisialta, agus folláine fhisiciúil agus mheabhrach bunaithe ar na hearnálacha seo. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will address measures in the area for sport for 2023. I officially congratulate him on his appointment and I am looking forward to working with him.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It should be noted that budget 2022 was cast in a time when the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the sectors my Department supports was still all-encompassing. The 2022 budget contained funding aimed at supporting those sectors through the worst of the pandemic when many of them were in complete shutdown. The total allocation for 2022 was €1.276 billion, with €1.074 billion in current expenditure and €202 million in capital expenditure. Of the €1.074 billion in current funding, €290 million was provided on a once-off basis for Covid-support measures for initiatives including supports for live entertainment, sport and business-continuity funding in the tourism sector.This was all aimed at ensuring these sectors were sustained through the pandemic and would then emerge in a healthy position. The scale of that intervention in 2022 was hugely significant for the sectors. My Department’s demonstrated support underlines the commitment of the Government to supporting these sectors and how much we valued these sectors through the pandemic. As we emerged from the pandemic, in budget 2023, thankfully, there was no longer a need for the scale of intervention in respect of Covid-19 that was required in 2022 because the restrictions had been lifted. However, the sectors supported by my Department are not completely recovered from the impact of the pandemic and therefore there is an ongoing need to support the sectors as they seek to fully recover. Accordingly, the 2023 budget for my Department contains some once-off funding of approximately €98 million, not as much as was required in 2022 for the reasons I have outlined, but still quite a significant amount. Hence, there is an overall fall in the total budget for 2023 compared with 2022 caused by the reduction in overall once-off funding of €121 million. Overall, the reduction year on year on the face of the budget is due mainly to the reduction in once-off funding from €219 million to €98 million.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would point out that even though it has reduced from 2022 to 2023, before I was Minister the Revised Estimate, REV, gross total for the Department was €802 million, whereas even given the reduction in the last 12 months, the 2023 gross Revised Estimate is €1.166 billion, so it is still a significant increase in the last three years of this Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Some €15 million in additional funding has been secured for overseas marketing of Ireland. The budget always contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including investments in skills development and retention of €3 million, and a €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have also secured additional long-term funding for the hosting of the American college football classic every August out to 2026. This will provide a strong boost to the sector in 2023 and we would expect 40,000 overseas visitors for this years Notre Dame versus Navy game. There is also additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Of course, there are other allocations of €36.5 million for tourism product development. We have the basic income for the arts and that €35 million is secured to support 2,000 artists in that pilot scheme. We have €30.2 million for culture infrastructure and development, €11.5 million for the newly extended Creative Ireland programme, €7 million for artists’ spaces and climate adaptation measures and, of course, €6.6 million in funding for Culture Ireland, which is an increase of €2 million on the 2022 allocation. The list is quite extensive and I can get the Deputy more detail if he wishes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The 2022 budget was cast at a time when the impact of Covid was devastating for the sector. On the face of it, as I noted earlier, the budget for tourism has fallen from €290 million to €231 million, a drop of €59 million. Of course, there was the €50 million for business continuity supports which Fáilte Ireland distributed but they were not needed because, thankfully, the Covid pandemic restrictions were lifted.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Deputy mean delivery of actual projects in 2022?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We might come back to the Deputy on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Those water-based Platforms for Growth initiatives that were announced will be going to planning now. Mount Congreve Gardens will open in March and I hope to be down there for that. I was at Knowth and Brú na Bóinne, which opened in 2022, the Blasket Islands centre opened in 2022, the Céide Fields opened in 2022, and the National Famine Museum was another that I opened last year. That amazing treetop walk at Avondale House and Forest Park opened in July 2022 and the Patrick Kavanagh Centre experience is another one that I opened in 2022, and the Chair, Deputy Niamh Smyth, was at that. Johnstown Castle, Kilkenny Riverside Gardens and the Shackleton Gardens were in 2021, but we can see there is quite a list for 2022, and I was quite busy opening various places around the country. That is good for tourism. There is one in the Deputy’s constituency, the Mary Robinson Centre and presidential library in Ballina. In 2016, my Department awarded a grant of €2 million towards the cost of construction and fit-out of the Mary Robinson Centre. Mayo County Council is the project promoter and procured development funding of over €5 million for that project. Mayo County Council has advised my Department that the project is on track for opening to the public in the summer of this year.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Between now and the end of March, I believe 224 contracts will come up for review, but it is the Department of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, that will be dealing with this matter. We do not yet have a line of sight on this issue but we keep in close contact with that Department for obvious reasons. My Department officials are on the senior officials group which deals with these issues.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Between now and the end of March, 224 contracts will come up for review.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We also have to consider that much of our tourism is outside the capital. Much of that industry supports 260,000 jobs. It is one of the most important and significant employers of indigenous industry in the country. I have sought the extension of the lower VAT rate for tourism but, ultimately, that is a decision for the Minister for Finance. As the Deputy knows, all supports needed for the cost-of-living crisis, which was possibly not as significant a feature for this industry last summer as it is now, are currently being reviewed. Any decision made on that will be in the context of the wider supports needed for society. Decisions will be made on that in the coming weeks. I sit on the Cabinet sub-committee that will be briefed on that in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My main concern and priority as Minister is that last year cannot be seen as a true reflection. It was a very successful year for tourism. It was much better than we imagined but it cannot be seen as the baseline. I am conscious, having met with industry representatives, including the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation and from co-chairing a meeting of the hospitality and tourism forum last week, that there are concerns about what 2023 will look like and the reality of the immense cost of living and cost of maintaining businesses for hotels. As regards the VAT rate, we have to remain competitive to attract tourists from other EU countries. That is why I seek that VAT rate. However, as I said, this will be a whole-of-government approach. It may be something I am seeking but we have to look at the wider supports.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The VAT rate is for us to remain competitive. If we went back up to-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I said during our previous discussion on this issue that in my engagement with the sector I always stressed that the emphasis must be on value for money in order that tourists will return. The vast majority of hotels did not charge excessively. Sometimes, there is an awful lot of emphasis on cities, and not on rural Ireland and the value of the industry in supporting employment there. I have a broader focus on supporting a sector that, as I said, supports more than 250,000 jobs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The €11.5 million carryover is for sports capital and the €6.5 million carryover is for cultural infrastructure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----is for cultural infrastructure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is taking time to progress them. It is to aid the progress of those projects.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is for national cultural institution projects. There is a range of projects under national cultural institutions capital development.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Under just transition funding, the tourism end of the plan includes allocations of €38 million under the regenerative tourism business supports and €30 million for the tourism trails network. Under strand 1, the midlands trails network will receive €30 million funding. That is a strategic network of trails to interconnect with the existing arterial greenway network. This is infrastructure for walking, cycling and water-based trails. Strand 2 covers amenity supports for businesses. This is a fund of €25 million. It is to support public, private and community based tourism enterprises to support and expand existing regenerative and sustainable tourism infrastructure. This will help local economies. Strand 3 covers alternative low-carbon accommodation and amounts to €3 million. This is for carbon-neutral and low-carbon small-scale developments at key strategic locations aligned to the trails network in strand 1.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. Strand 4 covers smart solution development which has funding of €10 million. This is a programme of hard and soft supports to help deliver smart technology and digital solutions. It is for commercial digital experiences for visitors, prioritising the potential to be green. With regard to Fáilte Ireland Deputy Dillon asked what are the key indicators. They are what we see in delivery. Deputy Munster is probably familiar with Knowth, which opened last year, as did the Blasket Island centre, the Céide Fields, the National Famine Museum in Strokestown, the treetop walk at Avondale House and the Patrick Kavanagh visitor centre experience, which is located not too far from Deputy Munster. I had the pleasure of returning home to open that. Looking at what was delivered is the best way to assess it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The proposed registration of short-term tourist letting Bill will not change existing planning permission requirements regarding short-term lets. The planning permission side is the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I know this is an issue that was raised with officials from that Department by members of this committee. The main issue seemed to be around the need for clear planning guidance to ensure that the short-term lets are dealt with sensibly, in particular in rural areas. That is what Deputy O'Sullivan is indicating in what he has shared with me. That is also what the Department of the Minister for Housing Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, is cognisant of. The Department gave a commitment that it would issue new planning guidelines to planning authorities to assist them in adopting a sensible approach. I am very cognisant of what the Deputy says about rural areas. On engagement, when the general scheme of the registration of short-term tourist letting Bill was published before Christmas, briefings were held with the key tourism stakeholders and major online platforms. Since then, Fáilte Ireland has arranged more than 30 briefings. My Department met with the Irish Self Catering Federation last week. The focus of that meeting was the federation's concerns regarding the planning regulations for short-term letting. It is something that was also raised with me and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, when we co-chaired the tourism and hospitality forum last week. My Department is committed to convening a round-table meeting with key stakeholders next week, which will include the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.
