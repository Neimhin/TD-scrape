CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is not a problem. I welcome the witnesses, a few of whom I have met already. It is appalling that they are being left in limbo. I think it was John F. Kennedy who said that education should be the greatest equaliser of all. There is no level playing field in this situation at all, and I am a firm believer in equal access. I was particularly struck by Mr. Byrne's contribution when he said that he lost his grant when he crossed the road. Following on from Deputy Byrne's question, will the witnesses clarify they are only seeking the maintenance grants? I submitted a parliamentary question on this matter and got quite a convoluted answer, at the end of which the Minister stated, "It is open to private higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to students that they consider to be in financial difficulty." I am curious to know whether that happens. Is there any sort of support being offered in any of these colleges? Finally, I agree with the other members about the lack of clarity. I think it was Ms Houlihan who, when I met her, said she was excited to get the course she wanted only to find out she would not get the necessary support. We need to tackle that obstacle as a committee for the witnesses.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ms Houlihan mentioned in her presentation that she met the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and she seems to be aware of the Cassells report. Did the Minister indicate any opinion on this or will he leave it to the committee?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome Mr. Horgan and thank him for his presentation. The previous chief executive, Mr. Tom Boland, retired in July. I believe his replacement announced that she would only be staying on for a few months. It is a key position. Is Mr. Horgan aware of plans to fill it? The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, appeared before the committee a few weeks ago to brief us on the mid-year expenditure review. The reference to the early payment of grants to universities and institutes of technology is worrying. Were grants paid earlier because they were under water? Were they paid early because the institutions were running out of money and reaching insolvency? Does Mr. Horgan have a handle on the overall scale of problem with their cash flows? I believe the last real benchmark report on third level institutions was produced in 2013 and indicated a significant decline. I know that we have had some quantitative and qualitative data since. When will the HEA produce the next benchmark report to measure accurately the impacts on third level education in the past few years? I raise the question of gender. When I was preparing for this meeting, I learned on the HEA's website that in Ireland 81% of professional positions were held by men. While women comprised 62% of non-academic staff, men comprised 72% of the highest paid. While there are four female presidents of institutes of technology, there has never been a female president of a university in the Republic. Recent media reports indicate that some institutes are struggling in meeting the challenge of gender equality. I welcome the strides made in some colleges. DCU recently renamed a significant number of buildings after accomplished women. Because of initiatives such as Athena and Swan, 50% of candidates who are short-listed must be female. What has the HEA learned to date in this regard and is there more that could be done?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Has Mr. Horgan a contingency plan in place in case there is a holding period?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I might pursue that with Mr. Horgan at a later stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Institutions flagged as borderline and their future are of concern to me, particularly if they are underwater.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Institutional and sectoral progress.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Good.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move:That the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills asks the Minister for Education and Skills to move quickly to put in place a plan B to protect those students who might lose out on 10% of their grade in English due to the ongoing dispute between the ASTI and the Government.Recently, the Minister for Education and Skills appeared before the committee and said that he could not guarantee that junior cycle students sitting the English course would not lose out on 10% of their grades next year. This is causing them and their parents considerable worry and uncertainty. Talks are continuing, but a plan B is needed. Since we do not know what the end result of the talks will be, the Minister must put a plan B in place for the students. It should not be the case that thousands of junior cycle English students will enter exam halls next June knowing that they are down 10% before they even put pen to paper. That would be unacceptable. The Minister has a duty to put a contingency plan in place. The results of the ballot will be revealed tomorrow and, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, the ASTI is protesting outside Leinster House today, but we need to put our children front and centre. I appeal to the Minister to address this issue. The aim of my motion is to put a plan B in place in order that no students are worried as they face their first State examinations. They are already worried. I am a former English teacher. I know how stressed out students get. There is so much talk about the stresses upon students these days. Given that the first State exam places them under extreme stress, can we not soothe their worries and their parents' worries by showing that, if the dispute continues into June, the Department and the Minister will take action and put a plan in place?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have moved my motion. I will not be supporting the amendment because it seeks to remove the action which I believe is needed to protect the children and to signal to the Minister that he needs to ensure they do not lose the 10%. I am aware that the talks are ongoing but I believe the Minister needs to put a contingency plan in place. On the point regarding undermining the integrity of the examination, I do not believe that is the case. There are already alternative models in operation which could help resolve this problem and provide a guarantee to students that they will not be adversely affected. For example, students who do not participate in the oral component of examinations at junior cycle have their written examinations marked out of 100%. This means that students who do not take the oral component of a language examination do not automatically lose marks. This model, or an alternative, may not be ideal but we have to accept the urgent need to have a contingency plan in place. It must be acknowledged that putting in place such planning requires a great deal of preparation and as such the process needs to start now.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In terms of procedure, when does one withdraw an amendment?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not want the motion, as amended, being sent to the Dáil.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What is before us now is a completely different animal to the motion I put forward.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that down to me?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to put on the record that I will withdraw it but the reason being the amendment has completely turned the motion on its head and would put the dispute front and centre, which is not needed. My motion was about putting the child, that is, the children suffering as a result of the dispute, front and centre. For the record, I am withdrawing the motion because the nature of it has completely changed.
