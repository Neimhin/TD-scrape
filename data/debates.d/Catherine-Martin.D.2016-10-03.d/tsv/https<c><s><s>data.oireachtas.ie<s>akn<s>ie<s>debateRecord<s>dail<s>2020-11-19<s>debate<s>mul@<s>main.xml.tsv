CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The 2021 total gross funding allocated to my Department, as per the budget Estimates, amounts to €1.082 billion. This represents an increase of €79 million, or 8%, on the 2020 allocation as published in the further Revised Estimates for my Department. Those Revised Estimates included additional funding of €183 million, secured during 2020, to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 and to ensure the survival and recovery of businesses and operations in the sectors for which I have ministerial responsibility. The revised 2020 figures represented an increase of some 25% on the total comparable figure for the relevant programme areas in 2019. In broad terms, the 2021 funding for these sectors will represent an increase of 35% on what was available to them in 2019 prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our cultural institutions, theatres, tourist destinations, pubs, restaurants, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have been severely impacted since the beginning of the pandemic in March. The increased funding secured as part of budget 2021 is a testament to my commitment and that of the Government to ensure a range of robust funding streams and targeted measures are available to support resilience and recovery across these sectors, including a new €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses, €50 million in support for the live entertainment industry, record funding of €130 million for the Arts Council, €8 million to provide for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra to the National Concert Hall, more than €78 million allocated to the Gaeltacht and Irish language sector, €31.8 million for Údarás na Gaeltachta, €104.5 million for Sport Ireland, increased funding of €40.7 million for TG4, and additional funding for Irish language broadcasting to meet New Decade, New Approach commitments. As Minister, I am satisfied that the increase in funding to €1.082 billion secured as part of budget 2021 will support resilience and recovery across the diverse sectors for which I have responsibility and allow them to thrive once more on the global stage in the fields of tourism, culture, sport, language and public service media.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The 2021 total gross funding allocation to my Department, as per the Estimates, is €1.082 billion. This represents an increase of €79 million, or 8%, on the 2020 allocation, as per the Revised Estimates voted for the Department on 8 October 2020. The 2020 figures published as part of those further Revised Estimates included additional funding of €183 million, which was secured during 2020 to deal with the impacts of Covid-19 and to ensure the survival and recovery of businesses and operations in sectors for which I have responsibility. In broad terms, the 2021 funding for those sectors represents an increase of 35% on the 2019 levels. Some of the funding increases, such as the €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and the €50 million for the live entertainment industry, are exclusively directed at interventions to mitigate the impact of Covid-19. Other measures, such as the €8 million for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra and funding to support the Irish language, are not Covid related but relate to the development of sectors generally and, in the case of Údarás na Gaeltachta, recognise the Brexit-related challenges faced by its client companies.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The budget 2021 supports that we announced last month have been welcomed by all of the sectors that I represent. The Deputy has raised the question of what is Covid spending and what is in the budget on a number of occasions. A suite of funding measures, such as increased funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland and Sport Ireland, represent an acknowledgement of the important role these organisations play generally in supporting the sector. I know the Deputy has focused on what is Covid or non-Covid funding, but my focus is on giving support to the sectors that are struggling. There is no precise Covid-19 allocation. Rather, there is an increase in budget 2021 to reflect a mixture of supports for range of sectors which are impacted by Covid and Brexit or for which increased funding was deemed appropriate more generally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the report of the arts and culture recovery task force, which was a commitment in the programme for Government, was published this week. The report included a recommendation that a universal basic income be piloted for a three-year period in the arts sector. I very much welcome this report and thank the task force members for their time, expertise and commitment. The task force has made ten recommendations to aid the survival of the sector during Covid-19 and beyond under three themes: ensuring recovery; building resilience; and facing forward. The ten recommendations seek to protect livelihoods, which is what the universal basic income pilot involves; mitigate income loss; ensure fair play for the makers of creative content; secure the viability of the live events industry; sustain local authority capacity to support arts and culture; ensure well-being; build sectoral capacity; make space for arts and live entertainment; provide more outdoor public spaces for cultural events; and address the environmental impact of arts, culture and event activities. The task force report is extremely beneficial to the Government as we examine ways to help the arts and culture sector to emerge from this unprecedented position. I will shortly establish an oversight committee for the appraisal of the task force's recommendations.  On a broader level, the Government has already responded to the challenges facing the sector through a number of recent measures. Some €25 million was provided in June, including €20 million for the Arts Council, as well as additional supports for regional museums. A further €29 million was announced in the July stimulus, including funding for the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, our national cultural institutions, a music stimulus and supports for live performance. Significant additional funding was announced in budget 2021, with €130 million allocated to the Arts Council for 2021 and €50 million for supports for life performance. Tens of millions of euro in supports have been provided to those impacted in the arts, culture, performance and events sector through the pandemic unemployment scheme and various wage subsidy schemes. Some people in those sectors have also availed of the commercial rates waivers and may avail of the Covid restrictions support scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can speak to the recommendations as they came from this task force, which comprised a broad range of people involved in the screen sector, the artistic community, our cultural institutions and the live event industry. They identified ten key recommendations. The Deputy said the universal basic income was a well-established proposal, long before the pandemic, and would involve a tax-free payment to residents of the State without reference to their means or availability for employment. This would be a game changer for the community which is, as the Deputy rightly said, in dire straits. We have to be prudent and do things properly. Those who have artistic or creative work as their chief occupation often experience income insecurity and cash flow problems. As the Deputy will know, financial stress can impede creativity. The creation of art, whether that is music, live events or literature, requires practitioners to have the freedom to create. I have asked my Cabinet colleagues to assess all ten recommendations. As the Deputy is aware, I led the Green Party negotiations and negotiated the commitment to the universal basic income in the programme for Government. This report will feed into the national economic plan, which is also a commitment in the programme for Government. I have started those conversations around universal basic income with my Cabinet colleagues. I welcome this report because it accelerates the commitment to a universal basic income. As the Deputy knows, a three-year pilot scheme has been sought.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. In the interim, I hope he would know that I announced the successful applicants from the €5 million pilot programme in the July stimulus package. I will roll out €50 million in the new year to help the sector. The amount was increased to €50 million because the €5 million programme received €16.5 million worth of applications. This money will support artists and those working in the live event industry. There is also unprecedented funding of €130 million for the Arts Council. We have assessed the pilot programme. I met representatives of the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland and the Event Production Industry Covid Working Group in recent weeks to assess the €5 million pilot programme and examine what more we can do to support them and whether improvements can be made. I have secured funding in budget 2021 to do that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, I established the arts and culture recovery task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the view of stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid-19 recovery and beyond. The negative impact of the crisis on the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors has been well established and quantified over recent months in research undertaken by the Arts Council and my Department. As an artist himself and from our numerous conversations about these matters, I know that Deputy Duffy is keenly aware of the devastating impact of the Covid-19 crisis on many of his friends and colleagues working in the sector. The task force has issued its report and I have brought it to the attention of my Government colleagues and arranged for its publication. Under the chairmanship of Ms Clare Duignan, the members of the task force brought together a depth of knowledge and experience. They produced their report in a matter of weeks and I am grateful to all of the members for their energy, commitment and insights. The Deputy referred to two specific recommendations in the report. The proposal for a UBI scheme is the key recommendation. There is a commitment in the programme for Government, as the Deputy noted, to request the Low Pay Commission, informed by a review of previous international pilot schemes, to examine the introduction of a pilot scheme in the lifetime of the Government. While this is a matter for the commission, once requested by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to examine the matter, I am personally very supportive of the proposal, which reflects the commitment set out in the programme for Government. I want to see the matter thoroughly examined in the context of the national economic plan. It will ultimately be a decision for the Low Pay Commission, but there are clear reasons that the arts and culture sectors are the right sectors for such a pilot scheme. There have been numerous trials of UBI in other countries, notably Finland, and even a recent call from 500 MPs, lords and local councillors for a trial in the UK. France has had a scheme in place since 1936 that supports artists. The second recommendation the Deputy referred to is the sectoral capacity building and upskilling scheme for artists and creative workers aimed at recovery and renewal through professional development. This is a measure around learning and development. The task force recommended that a dedicated bespoke scheme of supports is required. It is another proposal that I am anxious for the oversight group to examine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Under the heading Ensuring the Wellbeing of Ireland's Creative and Cultural Community, the task force report recommends the establishment of a programme to provide well-being supports to the creative sector. This is based on programmes such as Minding Creative Minds, an organisation established to offer a free 24-7 well-being and support programme for the Irish music sector. It provides access to an experienced team of trained counsellors and psychotherapists who can offer short-term intervention and advice covering practical, day-to-day issues that cause anxiety and stress. Covid-19 is bringing a lot of stress into all of our lives. Many of us rely on arts and culture to provide some relief, but those who make the art also need support. I am very supportive of this proposal and I have asked my officials to seek to progress it as soon as possible. This issue needs to be addressed promptly. Just as we miss attending live music gigs and going to theatres, our artists are really missing performing in front of audiences. The interaction between musician and audience is a key part of maintaining positive mental health for artists. They need that support and I will look to address it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The case for a UBI was well established long before Covid. As I said earlier, those who create artistic or creative work where it is their chief occupation often experience income insecurity and cash flow problems. That was the case pre-Covid and it will be so post Covid. That financial stress can impede creativity. A 2018 review of pay and conditions in the performing arts by Theatre Forum found that 30% of artists and practitioners earn less than the national minimum wage and the circumstances in 2020, of course, are worse. The Deputy referred to the programme for Government commitment to request the Low Pay Commission to examine that. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government. The task force has suggested that a UBI pilot scheme would cost an additional €2.5 million per annum over and above the current pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, cost per 1,000 participants. We will need to look at other UBI models, such as those in Finland, the Netherlands, Germany and California. The recommendation to undertake a pilot UBI scheme for the arts and culture community brings this debate forward. I really welcome that, as it needs to be treated with the urgency it deserves. I have started those conversations around UBI with my Cabinet colleagues. Workers in the cultural sector need ongoing support if it is to avoid depletion of talent by migration away towards other sources of income.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster for bringing forward this issue. I am acutely aware of the valuable source of reliable and trustworthy news that local radio offers in a time of uncertainty and with much disinformation in circulation. Local radio also plays an important role in bringing communities together, strengthening their bonds of solidarity and mutual support. I recognise the challenges faced by the sector due to Covid-19 and I am pleased the supports in 2020 have provided a valuable source of funding at this challenging time. During 2020, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, which is statutorily independent, held two closed rounds for radio targeted at the independent commercial and community radio sectors, respectively. In June 2020, the BAI awarded €2.5 million sound and vision funding to 32 independent commercial radio stations across the country supporting public awareness and understanding of Covid-19. This was in addition to a waiver of the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for the first and second quarters of 2020, which saved the sector €1 million. I secured €839,000 in budget 2021 to compensate the BAI for this levy waiver. LMFM, which the Deputy and I are familiar with, was awarded €95,000 under round 35 and a community radio station, Dundalk FM, was awarded €16,945 under round 36. In addition, the BAI distributed €750,000 in a special round for community radio that Dundalk FM benefited from. The purpose of the sound and vision scheme is to support eligible content across the broadcasting sector as a whole, ensuring a balanced and fair approach. In light of the ongoing challenge faced by the sector, I secured an additional €2 million in Exchequer funding for the sound and vision scheme under the July stimulus package. This has greatly enhanced the funding available for the final round for the scheme this year, round 37, bringing it to a value of €4.5 million. The BAI continues to report to me quarterly on the impact of Covid-19 on the commercial radio sector. For the Deputy's information, local radio has been included in the Government's current advertising campaign on resilience. The BAI is currently finalising the most recent round and no decisions regarding 2021 rounds have yet been made. However, the BAI will be meeting with representatives of the commercial radio sector to discuss the approach to sound and vision in the new year. I very much welcome that. That engagement needs to happen. I will continue to work closely with the BAI to see how best we can support this sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am engaging closely and directly with the stakeholders in this sector. I met with representatives of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland on Monday last, 16 November. We had a productive discussion on the value of the supports the sector has received during 2020 and a follow-up meeting was held yesterday at official level. I also met with the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, on Tuesday, and my officials will continue the engagement with the NUJ. On the Deputy's question, local radio stations are in a position to avail of this round. The funding of €2 million which was secured was allocated to the fund for the latest round, round 37. This round was opened for applications on 8 September 2020, with a closing date of 7 October 2020. The BAI will make decisions on the successful applicants over the coming weeks and thereafter it will be a matter for those awarded funding under the scheme to produce the programmes being supported. The BAI will enter into contracts with successful applicants which will determine the manner in which the funds are drawn down and set out the timeline for same. If there is anything specifically that the Deputy needs information on, I can ask the BAI to engage directly with her too if that would be helpful.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In relation to the levy waiver, the BAI is statutorily independent in its functions, including the levy waiver. The Deputy indicated, and I am keenly aware from my engagement with them and the ongoing direct engagement of my officials with them, that they are in dire straits. As far as I am concerned, I am looking at all the options to support them. I have committed to that. That is why I am having that direct engagement with them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. The Deputy can let me know if she wants me to get the BAI to engage with her, if that helps. I can arrange that too.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sorry, has the Deputy changed the question? The question I have before me relates to providing grants and supports to the self-employed and sole traders. I have no problem answering questions about the task force. I only want to know whether the Deputy wants that information as well.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On supporting, what is the exact question the Deputy wants me to answer today?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a wide range of supports available to the individuals and businesses whose financial circumstances have been negatively impacted by Covid-19. The particular support depends on the institutional arrangements of the individual or organisation and whether it is a sole trader or an incorporated entity.Detailed information on all supports is provided on gov.ie and a guide to business supports booklet giving details of the key supports and resources available to help businesses is available also. Businesses may qualify for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, which I launched earlier this month together with the Minister for Finance. It is a targeted support for businesses significantly impacted by the level 3 or higher restrictions introduced by Government. Qualifying businesses can apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a cash payment in respect of an advanced credit for trading expenses for the period of the restrictions. The scheme will operate until 31 March 2021. In budget 2021 the Government announced the provision of a support of €50 million for the live entertainment sector after a period of engagement between it and officials from my Department. It is the first time this sector has received direct support and that tells us a lot about the impact of Covid-19. The 2021 supports for the live entertainment sector will be the subject of further consultation with stakeholders as a follow up to the €5 million pilot scheme and I have significantly increased funding to the Arts Council in 2021 from €80 million at the beginning of the year to €130 million in 2021. Since the onset of Covid-19, the Arts Council has extended its reach and in 2020 has provided grants to many individuals and organisations. On the exact proposal or recommendation with the live events and the supports needed in the task force, I am engaging with it already on the €50 million for the live entertainment sector to see how we can improve the €5 million pilot to reach out more and support more.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am very aware there are those in the sector who cannot apply for the CRSS. We met with the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, last week and we have met with representatives from EPIC. We have asked them to consider what changes could be made to the €5 million pilot scheme. That is not just a scheme, we have seen it up and running. Last weekend saw the first events from that €5 million and there will be many more over the coming weeks and covering the Christmas period. These include pantomimes, live performances and musicians performing all across the State. I watched David Kitt play Mike the Pies on Tuesday and there are upcoming performances, including by Lisa Hannigan, Lantern events and the 4 of Us at the Spirit Store. There is a list of instances where we can see this money actually being used and providing a much-needed platform for performers. I am continuing the consultation with the sector to give careful consideration to how we can improve that €50 million on foot of the €5 million to help it, especially those who cannot access the CRSS. On the UBI, I launched that report this week, only 48 hours ago. I am going to move with the oversight committee as a matter of priority. I cannot provide a timeline immediately. I want to do this properly. We have one shot at this and I want to do it the right way. I am hoping the €50 million will provide the lifeline, as will the other supports I have given throughout the year.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Many Deputies feel passionately about the arts, as Deputy Boyd Barrett does. To clarify, it is not my report nor the Department's; this report belongs to those who work in the community, from screen producers to the live events industry to the artists and the cultural institutions. It is their report. These are their recommendations which they have brought to me. It was part of the programme for Government commitment to set up that task force, which I very quickly did, and to get the report in a very quick timeline of six weeks. The task force is to be commended on bringing it down to ten key proposals. What have I done in a number of months? I brought in the €29 million in the July stimulus, €130 million for the Arts Council in 2021 and €50 million for a live event entertainment consultation. The community this impacts welcomed this report. It can trust, given my track record in four months in this position, that I am serious about giving the support to this community which I, like many in this House, feel is an essential part of our identity as a nation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 61 together. While absolutely necessary to protect us all, the impact of the public health guidelines has been extremely challenging for the sectors supported by my Department. These sectors are integral to our society; supporting economic activity; and enhancing physical and societal well-being. The public-facing and audience-driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation in the level applicable under the Plan for Living with Covid-19, these sectors are often the hardest hit. My officials and I are acutely aware of the need to support our sectors through these challenging times and have been in regular and sustained contact with a broad range of stakeholders over the past weeks and months. In addition to bilateral engagements with a wide range of stakeholders and agencies under the aegis of the Department, a number of task forces and consultative forums have been established in relation to the particular difficulties facing these sectors. This includes the Tourism Recovery Task Force, the Tourism Hospitality Forum, the Arts and Culture Recovery Task Force, and the Sports Monitoring Group. These involve a broad range of stakeholders with experience and insight to develop sustainable road maps for the recovery of these sectors. This engagement led to the very favourable outcomes achieved for these sectors in the context of the July stimulus and budget 2021. I will continue this positive engagement with the sectors and consider the views and recommendations of these task forces and consultative forums in regard to any further necessary measures or supports required as a consequence of Covid-19. That engagement is key to informing our decisions so we do the right things. The Deputy will be aware that I put in place substantial measures in budget 2021 to support and strengthen the sectors. This engagement with stakeholders has been key in providing a comprehensive response to the impact of Covid-19. In tandem with these support measures, consultative groups were established in both the sport and culture sectors to ensure the necessary guidance and supports are in place to comply with the requirements of the Government’s Plan for Living with Covid-19, including the Expert Group on the Return to Sport and the National Cultural Institutions Consultative Forum. I am also engaging with the stakeholders across the broadcasting and media sector and the Deputy would have heard me describing some of the meetings that have happened this week earlier in the debate. I note particularly the important advocacy role played by agencies under the aegis of my Department. Agencies, including the Arts Council, Screen Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Sport Ireland, have worked diligently with my officials to raise awareness of the challenges facing our sectors and to identify ways to support them through this pandemic. The need for important public health measures such as social distancing has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect public health. Some of the key measures that have been introduced in 2020 to help the sectors within my Department's remit include and additional €25 million for the Arts Council, a €5 million live events pilot scheme, €5 million to support the national cultural institutions, NCIs, and nationwide arts infrastructure.There is also a €5 million company stabilisation support for Gaeltacht companies, the stay and spend tax credit initiative, a €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector, a €10 million grant for coach tourism, €40 million for the three main field sport bodies, namely, the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, and a €15 million fund for sport governing bodies and clubs. The universal income supports of the pandemic unemployment payment and the wage subsidy scheme have been key to supporting all sectors throughout the crisis. The extension of both of these schemes has provided some much needed certainty.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I continue to monitor it through the ongoing engagement. It is absolutely critical to provide the correct supports, for example, the €50 million live events scheme, from which I hope some in the Deputy's constituency will benefit. We are tweaking what happened with the €5 million pilot scheme to find ways to reach those we did not reach.. We are looking to see how best we can implement the tourism recovery task force but the Deputy can already see that we have brought in a fund in the budget to provide support for strategic tourism businesses. The supports and engagement will change with the ever-changing nature of Covid and all Ministers in every Department will have to be cognisant of finding the right supports and we will continue with this engagement to inform it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely, and as a Minister I am keenly aware that we have to be ready if alarm bells ring. We are watching the situation and closely monitoring it. The officials are engaged, there is cross-departmental engagement and we will be ready to react if needs be. Hopefully this will not arise but we have to be ready.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The management of Shannon Heritage sites, including their opening arrangements, is an operational matter for Shannon Heritage and Shannon Group plc, which is a commercial State body under the aegis of the Department of Transport. As Shannon Group operates in both the aviation and tourism sectors, it has been severely impacted by Covid-19. With regard to tourism, budget 2021 included a number of substantial measures to support and strengthen the tourism sector and they are supplemented by the economy-wide business supports and social welfare measures. The total funding for the tourism sector will increase in 2021 by more than €59 million, or 36%, over the initial 2020 allocation in budget 2020 to €220.9 million. Combined with other measures such as the Covid resilience support scheme, CRSS, and the rates waiver, the Government is helping to sustain businesses that have been most severely affected by the necessary public health restrictions. As part of the budget package of measures, €55 million has been provided for business continuity schemes for strategic tourism businesses to help them survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery. This funding will be administered by Fáilte Ireland and focused on those strategic businesses. Fáilte Ireland is currently engaging with those tourism sectors in the design of funding schemes, taking into account the effect of other horizontal funding measures, such as CRSS. The VAT rate for the sector is reduced to 9%, which will improve the competitiveness and viability of businesses. Funding of €5 million has also been provided for focused upskilling training to support business survival and recovery in the sector, and for the improvement of the digital presence and e-commerce capability of tourism businesses. Investment in the tourism marketing fund has been maintained to ensure that Ireland is in a position to recover quickly, when it is safe for tourists to return from our key markets. In response to the impacts of Covid-19, the Government has put in place a range of supports to help business and our citizens face the challenges presented by this global pandemic. I would encourage the entity responsible for the management of the sites concerned to liaise with Fáilte Ireland on what State supports might be available. Horizontal supports include the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the rates waiver, VAT warehousing and CRSS.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The tourism recovery task force undertook a comprehensive analysis of the impact of Covid-19 on the sector and drew up a recovery plan containing more than 30 recommendations across a number of areas, designed to help the sector to survive and recover from the crisis out to 2023. Its short-term recommendations informed the sector-specific measures adopted in the budget. To help inform my ongoing response to the pandemic, I will shortly appoint an oversight group which will monitor the implementation of the recovery plan, as well as the recovery of the tourism sector in general.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to Shannon Heritage specifically, a commitment was made by the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to provide funding to ensure that Bunratty Castle and Folk Park and King John's Castle, which were due to close at the end of August, could remain open until the end of 2020, subject to public health measures. It is open to Shannon Heritage to explore further the various support mechanisms now available to it, and I would encourage it to liaise with Fáilte Ireland on what State supports might be available. I know this is something the Deputy raised with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, earlier this week. If there is funding available from his Department, that is a matter for him, and I know he has spoken on this issue and is aware of the challenges the company faces. As part of the budget package of measures for various strategic tourism businesses, €55 million has been provided for the business continuity scheme to help businesses survive through the pandemic and be there to help drive the recovery. I would encourage Shannon Heritage to explore further the various support mechanisms now available to it from Fáilte Ireland. However, it should be noted that as a subsidiary of a State company, this may impact on its eligibility.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I point out the management of Shannon Heritage sites, including their opening arrangements, is an operational matter for Shannon Heritage and the Shannon Group, which is a commercial State body under the aegis of the Department of Transport, not the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Within my remit, I can point to the extensive supports that have been introduced economy-wide and specifically within the tourism sector to support businesses, and which Shannon Heritage can avail of. This is a very difficult time for Shannon Heritage and I am very aware of that. I will liaise with my Cabinet colleagues to see how best they will continue the engagement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputy Munster for her question. The Government is critically aware of the importance of a vibrant, diverse and independent media, which is essential to our democracy and to our cultural development. The sector is undergoing fundamental change which extends well beyond the current Covid difficulties and there are significant and complex challenges to be faced to ensure a sustainable future for our local, regional and national media. That is why the programme for Government committed to a Future of Media Commission and brought policy responsibility for media functions under the remit of my Department.  The Government has moved quickly to establish the Future of Media Commission under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith. The commission has already commenced its work and will examine all of these issues and consult widely with the sector.  I look forward to receiving the commission's report next year. In parallel to this development, I have been meeting the sector to discuss the longer-term issues impacting on its sustainability, as well as the more immediate challenges relating to Covid-19. A number of measures have already been put in place to support the sector. In addition to the general Covid supports available to all businesses such as the employment wage subsidy scheme, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, waived the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector for quarters 1 and 2 of 2020 saving the sector €1 million, and I secured funding in budget 2021 to recoup the BAI for this waiver.  A special sound and vision funding round of €2.5 million was provided to the commercial sector over the summer months.  There was also a special sound and vision round of €750,000 for the community radio sector.  I have also provided  an additional €2 million for sound and vision under the July stimulus package.   The BAI is reporting to me quarterly on the impacts on the commercial radio sector and these reviews will help to inform what, if any, additional measures may need to be taken in that sector.  I am currently considering what further measures might be appropriate to support the sector through the Covid-19 pandemic and while task forces have been used across sectors such as tourism and culture, this would not necessarily be the most effective means to address the media sector, particularly when the Future of Media Commission has already commenced its work and is due to report within nine months.  I intend, however, to continue to engage closely with the sector to ensure that it is sustained through this challenging period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Future of Media Commission has already been established. It has met twice since its establishment. It has a strategic role in regard to the future vision, structuring and funding of media. On when it will report, it is due to report within nine months. That was announced on the date the commission was established. That is an ambitious timescale given the complexity of the issues relating to the future of media but I have full confidence in the commission under the chairmanship of Professor Brian MacCraith. My approach to this sector is to engage directly with its representatives in bodies across the sector. I met the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland representatives on Monday. We had a productive discussion on the value of the supports to the sector received through 2020 and they outlined their proposals for additional supports for the sector. I asked for the engagement to continue in recognition of the urgency of the situation and a follow-up meeting was held yesterday at official level. I met also the National Union of Journalists on Tuesday of this week and my officials will also have a follow-up meeting with them. I am undertaking to continue this close engagement to ensure the appropriate measures are put in place to support the sector through the crisis.
