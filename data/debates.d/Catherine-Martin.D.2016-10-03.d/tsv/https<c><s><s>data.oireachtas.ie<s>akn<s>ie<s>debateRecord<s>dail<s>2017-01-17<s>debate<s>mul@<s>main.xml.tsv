CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In light of the recent High Court judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Barrett in AIB v. Counihan on 21 December 2016 as well as in the light of the serious concerns expressed recently by the Master of the High Court, what assurances can the Minister for Justice and Equality give to families facing the repossession of their homes that she has done all in her power to protect them properly? Can she assure people unambiguously that all persons with decision-making responsibility of such magnitude are fully informed of the very latest legal developments and properly trained in respect of their legal obligations under EU law? Will she assure the many hard-pressed borrowers who are often referred to as the forgotten, the so-called squeezed middle who never got any bailout, that the terms of the directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts will be applied in repossession proceedings for family homes in every appropriate case? In light of the expressed concerns of the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, about what is reportedly and unlawfully happening, will the Minister consider taking appropriate steps to place a moratorium on all such proceedings until she is satisfied that EU law is being applied consistently throughout the State? Is the Minister confident that all county registrars have the necessary legal training to apply EU law in home repossession cases? The Court of Justice of the European Union has held that where a consumer contract comes before a court, the court must satisfy itself that none of its terms is unfair, even when the consumer has not called upon it to do so. As a mortgage contract is a consumer contract where the property is a home, it is vital that county registrars, who in reality deal with the majority of repossession applications, are fully aware of the implications of these decisions. The Master of the High Court is of the opinion, however, that county registrars should not be dealing with these repossession cases at all. There is a real and justifiable concern that many repossession orders granted in the Circuit Court may be open to challenge as EU law was not applied. In such a scenario and leaving aside the lenders, it is the State that could conceivably be found liable. There is a potential financial risk for the State. Considering the inequality of arms between the thousands of ordinary, hard-working and decent borrowers on one side and lenders on the other side with bottomless funds, will the Minister assure families that the full range of protections available to persons are being implemented? When homeowners are summonsed to appear before the courts, however reluctant or daunting that may be, they must at the very least be assured that decision-makers are fully resourced, updated and upskilled in all aspects of protections, including the very latest, available to those facing home repossession. For the administration of justice to operate most effectively in our country, it must enjoy the complete confidence of all the people. It is of concern that the Master of the High Court does not have that confidence.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am glad to hear that this matter is under consideration, but justice delayed is justice denied. In some cases, delays are fatally dangerous because it is already too late and the clock can never be put back. For many others, time is of the essence. I have asked a specific question, namely, whether the Government is satisfied that family homeowners who are doing their utmost to simply survive from day-to-day and week-to-week and are now facing a legal process and the prospect of potentially losing their homes will be given as much protection as is feasibly possible. If the answer is "Yes", can the Minister of State explain how he came to that conclusion? The master of the High Court has expressed his concern that the Government is failing to properly protect people facing home repossessions, claiming that current procedures do not ensure EU consumer legislation is being applied. At least one county registrar has stopped processing such cases. Is the master, Mr. Honohan, right or wrong? The Green Party and many others believe the Government needs to address his genuine and serious concerns. County registrars are effectively agents of the European Union. There is an obligation on them to examine contracts to determine whether they are fair. Does the Minister of State agree with the master of the High Court that the rules and procedures of these courts need to be updated to facilitate a hearing in every single repossession case with regard to EU legislation and unfair contract terms? The law provides that a term which allows the commercial party to unilaterally change the contract is defined as unfair. What about the banks that arbitrarily increased interest rates, beggaring those with variable rate mortgages? What about those who were falsely sold interest-only mortgages and then had their loans switched to capital and interest loans just as the recession began to bite? The Government should introduce a moratorium on all home repossessions until assurances can be given that adequate resources are in place to fulfil the legal obligations under EU law and legal clarity is restored in order that the Government can give assurances to all home owners facing home repossessions that the full range of protections available to them are being applied.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíor-shásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille seo. Caithfear gníomhú láithreach chun a chinntiú nach rachaidh fadhb na ndaoine gan dídean in olcas agus chun a chinntiú nach mbeidh ar aon chlann eile a teach a fhágail. The Green Party welcomes the Bill and will be supporting it. We have all seen the pain and misery caused by such family upheaval as a result of people having to leave their homes due to rent increases, the property owner wishing to turn over the property or, in some cases, the sale of the property as a distressed asset and the vulture fund owners, to use their own parlance, sweating that asset. The Bill largely follows recommendations made by Threshold when it addressed the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness in May 2016. Threshold recommended increasing security of tenure for tenants, providing for rent certainty, establishing legal safeguards to allow tenants to remain after the sale of a property, amending the legal definition of a landlord to include receivers and lenders in possession, and introducing a code of conduct on buy-to-let mortgage arrears. The Bill provides for this. According to Focus Ireland, repossessions are resulting in between 60 and 80 families a month becoming homeless. The latest Central Bank statistics indicate that approximately 80,000 private home mortgages are in arrears. Of these, almost 35,000 are in arrears more than 720 days. These statistics indicate that the unprecedented crisis of homelessness in the country could get much worse. The Bill plans ahead by putting in place measures to protect families at risk of being made homeless. The Bill seeks security of tenure. We are often told that there are rules governing the operation of an economy that cannot be tampered with and that consequences will ensue. This is not true. The rules are changed all the time. In our economy and society the rule seems to be that humans are expendable. We now need to start to rewrite the rules and the first and overarching rule is that people matter.
