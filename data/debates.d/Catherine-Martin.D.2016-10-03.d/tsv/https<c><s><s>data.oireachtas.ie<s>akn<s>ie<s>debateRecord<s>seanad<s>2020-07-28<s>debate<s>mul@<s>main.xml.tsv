CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus fáiltím roimh an deis seo labhairt leis an Seanad inniu faoi earnáil na turasóireachta agus faoi na dúshláin atá roimpi faoi láthair mar thoradh ar phaindéim Covid-19. I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad today to speak about the tourism sector and the challenges it is facing as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is right and proper that the primary focus of the Government is on the public health crisis response. Nevertheless, we must ensure that we do our utmost to help our economy to recover from the worst short-term economic shock in the history of the State. The tourism sector has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years and played a leading role in driving the recovery from the last economic downturn. Tourism plays a pivotal role, particularly in rural and regional Ireland, with most earnings retained within the country. Heretofore, as a labour-intensive sector directly contributing to over 11% of employment, tourism has been a leading job creator, supporting 260,000 jobs in 2019 - Ireland's largest indigenous sector. In normal circumstances, tourism provides diverse employment opportunities, including for those unable to work full-time. Tourism also provides employment in rural communities and other economically disadvantaged locations where alternative opportunities can be limited. Approximately 70% of tourism jobs are located in regional and rural areas outside of Dublin. Tourism is a significant exporting sector, with the majority of tourism spending being generated by overseas tourists. In 2019, international tourists spent more than €5 billion in Ireland compared with approximately €2.4 billion spent by residents of Ireland, North and South. Tourism is one of the most directly affected sectors in this current crisis. The impact of Covid-19 on tourism globally has been overwhelming and immediate, with unprecedented consequences for Ireland's tourism industry. Over the past four months, the Irish tourism industry has been decimated. The devastation being experienced in the sector is unprecedented, and I sincerely empathise with those who have lost their jobs or livelihood as a result. Both international and domestic tourism has been very severely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. International tourism has collapsed, and the OECD estimates that the impact of the crisis on the tourism industry could result in a 60% to 80% decline in international tourism in 2020, depending on the duration of the crisis and the speed with which travel and tourism rebounds. Ireland's tourism sector is deeply dependent on overseas visitors, who account for 75% of overall tourism revenue. While increased domestic tourism will undoubtedly help make up for some of this, only a proportion of this activity could be expected to be offset by domestic tourism. Fáilte Ireland estimates that a write-down of 2020 overseas tourism business would mean an overall loss to the economy of €2.1 billion this year, with associated job losses of up to 180,000. The July stimulus measures agreed at Cabinet last Thursday are a significant part of our response to the Covid-19 crisis and will help ensure Ireland's businesses get back on their feet and that as many people as possible can return to work when it is safe to do so. The Government is working on a longer-term national economic plan to be finalised in October, but the new supports are critical for the sustainability of the tourism sector and for the Irish economy as a whole over the coming months. They provide vital supports for businesses to retain existing jobs and to create new jobs, and they will help build confidence in consumers and communities throughout Ireland. I worked very closely with my ministerial colleagues in Cabinet, and the measures announced provide much-needed supports to the tourism sector. The new employment wage support scheme will greatly benefit tourism enterprises, especially due to the labour-intensive nature of the sector. Both the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the new employment wage support scheme will run in parallel from 31 July until the temporary wage subsidy scheme concludes at the end of August. This will provide additional flexibility for employers with new hires and seasonal workers who were not previously eligible. The inclusion of seasonal staff and new employees is particularly welcome for the sector, which provides employment to thousands of seasonal staff, especially in rural areas. To help businesses stabilise, reopen and redeploy their staff, enhanced direct grants will be provided from a revised restart grant. This grant was increased and extended, with an additional €300 million in funding being provided. These changes mean that a grant of up to €25,000 is available to more enterprises in the tourism sector. A number of businesses, such as bed and breakfast premises not previously included in the scheme, are also now eligible.I am pleased that the Government found a way to assist the hard-hit bed and breakfast sector. Combined with Fáilte Ireland's adaptation fund, the restart grant will now greatly assist many more tourism businesses. Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on tourism demand. The stay and spend initiative will help stimulate demand in the very challenging shoulder and off-peak seasons. This incentive, which will run for the period from 1 October 2020 to 30 April 2021, will incentivise taxpayers to support domestic providers of accommodation, food or both during the off-season, providing much-needed support to a particularly impacted sector. Revenue will provide an income tax credit of up to €125 per taxpayer, or up to €250 for a jointly-assessed married couple for spending on accommodation, food, and non-alcoholic drinks. The tourism and hospitality sector depends on high footfall and businesses are highly aware of the importance of implementing public health measures in preventing the spread of Covid-19. However, the social nature of the businesses means that adapting premises is another expense in a sector that has already suffered more than most. I was therefore very pleased to announce an adaptation fund of €26 million to help tourism and hospitality businesses to cover the costs of adapting their premises to meet public health requirements and make them safer for customers. I am aware of how badly the coach tourism sector has been impacted by the crisis. These businesses are a vital part of Irish tourism and we will need them when our overseas visitors return. That is why I have asked Fáilte Ireland to develop a business continuity scheme to help these businesses through this very difficult period. Fáilte Ireland will now engage with the sector to develop this scheme, which has been allocated €10 million in funding. Further measures which will benefit the tourism sector include the €2 billion Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, the package of liquidity and enterprise investment measures to support small companies and microenterprises, the corporation tax refund, the income tax relief for the self-employed, the warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension of the waiver of commercial rates for a further three months. These measures will supplement the other supports already in place and the excellent work being undertaken by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland in supporting the tourism sector in its time of greatest need. The overall package of direct employment supports, cash grants, demand stimulation measures and tax reliefs will make a real difference to the bottom line of tourism businesses right now. I know that the tourism industry has called for other longer-term supports such as a change in the VAT rate. These will be considered as part of the work on the national economic plan in October.  As Senators are aware, the tourism recovery task force is preparing a tourism recovery plan which will include a set of recommendations on how the Irish tourism sector can best adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment. The plan will identify priority aims, key enablers and market opportunities for the sector for the period from 2020 to 2023. Since it first met at the end of May, the task force has undertaken a widespread stakeholder consultation process whereby any sectors and parties with an interest in tourism have been able to provide constructive inputs and innovative ideas on how this economically vital sector can adapt and recover in a meaningful and sustainable way. Furthermore, the task force has heard directly from several stakeholders in the past two weeks with a view to informing its deliberations as it works towards a final report. I expect the final report from the task force in the autumn and will carefully consider its recommendations at that time. Fáilte Ireland recently unveiled its new national domestic marketing campaign, Ireland, make a break for it, to the tourism and hospitality industry and it has since gone live across all media. This is a major drive to encourage people to take domestic breaks this summer. I will be taking my family holiday in Ireland in the coming weeks and I encourage anyone who can to take the opportunity to enjoy our excellent tourism offerings. Fáilte Ireland research shows almost nine in ten people want to ensure that the appropriate safety measures are in place if they are to consider taking a domestic break in Ireland this year. Responding to these insights on safety, Fáilte Ireland recently launched a new Covid-19 safety charter, designed to stimulate demand and boost public confidence in the safety of tourism businesses. The charter, which is based on operational guidelines for tourism businesses, is now available to applicants on the Fáilte Ireland website. More than 1,000 businesses have signed up to it so far.According to Fáilte Ireland's research, 60% of people are now planning breaks in Ireland in the next six months. Many intend to extend their short breaks from two or three nights to four nights, and 40% of those who intend to take short breaks booked them in the past two weeks, which is a significant increase on previous numbers. Tourism Ireland is undertaking an extensive Covid-19 programme of research in our major markets to identify when consumers are ready to consider holidaying again and which of our markets offer us the best short-term prospects. This research is considering potential source markets and will then analyse when promotion of the island of Ireland should begin and where marketing should be targeted. The insights gained will ensure that Tourism Ireland's promotional plan is as targeted and motivational as it possibly can be in order to drive a strong recovery for tourism to the island of Ireland as quickly as it is possible to realise it. With regard to international tourism into Ireland, the tourism agencies are guided in all their decisions by public health advice. In line with the advice on non-essential travel, there are currently no paid advertising campaigns by Tourism Ireland in overseas markets about coming on holiday to Ireland. The incidence of Covid-19 has been rising in Ireland over the past two to three weeks. This is aligned with the experience internationally. It is difficult to keep the virus suppressed while also easing restrictions. Overseas travel increases the risk of importing a higher incidence of the virus into the country. In order not to lose the gains we have worked so hard to make, now more than ever we need to stay vigilant and follow public health advice. Everything we are asking people to do is aimed at protecting the vulnerable and ensuring we can get to a point where schools can reopen and vital health services can be resumed. We cannot completely ban overseas travel because we are a small open economy and many people depend on trade for their livelihood. Many people need to travel to and from Ireland to carry out essential functions. There are also essential supply chains from overseas relying on these routes and connectivity to bring food, medicines and other products to Ireland that are critical to our health and for economic activity. Travel is also necessary to allow people to perform essential work, care for family members overseas and return to the country. For that reason, international travel must continue. The agreement reached recently on the €750 billion European Union recovery package represents a very positive step. The package will consist of €390 billion in grants, with €360 billion to be distributed as loans to member states. The eligibility criteria for these funds include objectives that will provide supports for small businesses, tourism, culture and natural heritage, among a range of other areas. I am under no illusions as to the difficulty of the task ahead, particularly with so many competing priorities. At the same time, given the importance of the sector, especially in regional and rural locations, I realise it is critical that we save as many of these jobs and businesses as we can. The July jobs stimulus measures agreed at Cabinet last week, the other supports already in place, together with the assistance being provided by Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland will, I have no doubt, save many tourism and hospitality jobs and businesses all around the country. Together with the industry, the tourism agencies and the Department, I look forward to building on our natural advantages and working to ensure the sustainable development of tourism in the coming years.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Seanad Members for allowing me an opportunity to speak today on such an important matter. I thank them for their contributions. I will follow up on as many of the questions raised as is possible. If I do not manage to get back to every query, I will ask my officials to write to the Senators. As I said earlier, the tourism industry in its entirety has been decimated by the Covid-19 crisis. The sector will take the longest to recover. Senator Keogan raised that issue. I am aware of the difficulties being experienced by Ireland's tourism industry. I am mindful of its complete loss of earnings, jobs and businesses. I assure Senator Keogan that I am taking this matter seriously. Senator Cassells asked about ancillary job losses. Approximately 260,000 people are employed in the tourism and hospitality sector. I do not have exact figures on the indirect impact of their spending on other jobs. I certainly know that many regions are very dependent on that income. As sports Minister, I understand the desire for larger crowds and attendances at GAA and other grounds. The Government must put health first with everything that comes with Covid-19. If we are ever to reach a point where we can open everything up, then we must act with caution at all times. We have to adhere to the current public advice.If it is at all possible to mitigate the risk to life with bigger crowds, then I am sure NPHET will consider that. My Department will assist NPHET and co-operate with it in that process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senators Gavan, Dooley, Garvey and Conway raised the Shannon Heritage issue. Like many tourism attractions, I am aware of the massive challenges it faces. As it is a subsidiary of Shannon Airport, it is under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I will work closely with him on this. He is looking at financial issues with Shannon Airport and will bring recommendations to the Government with regard to these in due course. Fáilte Ireland will be assisting tourism attractions through the adaptation grant. I am aware of the impact this is having on the entire region, as well as how critical it is to it. I will do what I can under my remit to assist with the reopening of these sites. Senator McGreehan spoke about beautiful Louth. She was like an advertisement for the county. I am a frequent visitor to Slieve Gullion and Carlingford Lough. I will be there in the next few weeks, as I often am with my family and friends. Border tourism has already been threatened by Brexit and was a focus for Fáilte Ireland before the Covid crisis. I grew up on the Border. I will be attending the North-South Ministerial Council and liaising with the Minister, Diane Dodds. I will be collaborating and co-ordinating every which way possible. It is a priority. Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are working on joining up initiatives such as the Causeway Coast and the Wild Atlantic Way. I would like to see much more of this. On the Gaeltacht areas to which Senator Ó Donnghaile referred, I have a grá for Gaeilge myself. Last week, I provided €8 million in capital funding to Údarás na Gaeltachta. I want see factories and buildings repurposed and supported to encourage people to stay and work in Gaeltacht areas, helping to build them up. I provided funding under arts to Ealaín na Gaeltachta. I will do whatever I can to support our beautiful language, our native tongue and the Gaeltacht areas. Many Senators brought up the issue of VAT and the voucher scheme. We saw stay-and-spend as the quickest way to get a scheme up and running. It is also more efficient and less costly for a business to administer compared with a redeeming voucher. It has a wide application with up to 2.8 million people being able to avail of it. It is about encouraging demand. The reason that specific timeframe from October to April was targeted was because it is off-season. When I engaged with stakeholders, they said that was when they really needed the support to get them through Christmas. The scheme will not be administratively cumbersome. Some Senators referred to the filing of paperwork involved in the scheme. It will actually be operated through a downloadable Revenue mobile phone app. We envisage one goes to a restaurant or a hotel and one takes a photograph there and then. That is how easy it will be. It was about making it as easy as possible to support our restaurants, coffee shops and hotels. At the level of individual taxpayer, the relief on accommodation and food, including soft drinks but not alcohol, it is a minimum spend of €25 per person per time with a maximum spend limit of €625 over the lifetime of the scheme. The taxpayer will take the photograph. One will get 20% of the voucher costs through the income tax maximum credit of €125 per person. The tax credit may be set against a claimant's USC liability where he or she does not have a sufficient income tax liability to fully absorb the tax credit in the year of assessment.Senators Garvey and Conway spoke of the lights of the Banner county. I can let Senator Garvey know that my family will be going there in the next few weeks. We will go to Clare and are looking forward to it. We intend to spend a lot of time there, we are walkers and my husband and I look forward to exploring the Burren with our three children. I look forward to meeting the Senator in person when I am there.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senators Martin, Wall and O'Loughlin mentioned Kildare. With family there, I am a frequent visitor to Kildare. I have friends and colleagues there also. I enjoyed working closely with Senator O'Loughlin and I look forward to a tour of Kildare. On the bogs and stud farms and if they should be opened up, Fáilte Ireland has a tourism capital fund that has developed many similar attractions, for example, in the Lough Boora park in the midlands. Senator Boyhan commented on Carrickmacross. I am happy to meet him for a coffee and recommend the sights and thrills of my native home town. Senator Blaney referred to North-South tourism. The national maritime park is part of the brief of my colleague in transport, but I will bring that to his attention. Senators Conway, Dolan, O'Reilly and D'Arcy referred to greenways. An investment of €23 million has been allocated this year for tourism-focused greenways. Senator D'Arcy spoke on a specific project. Anything we can do to encourage cycling and to make cycling safe in this regard, is of course a priority for the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Senator Wall referred to coach tourism. I have asked Fáilte Ireland to develop a business continuity scheme to help these businesses through this difficult period and €10 million has been made available under the July stimulus programme for this purpose.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to VAT, all options were considered for the July stimulus package but we were trying to focus really quickly - we had three weeks - on the jobs and getting people safe and secure, such as with the wage subsidy scheme, and making sure that seasonal workers were brought in. We did that. All options were considered with regard to VAT and all options will be reviewed as we come into the October package. If there are any other issues I have not addressed here, as a lot were raised, my officials will get back to the Senators. With the tourism-specific and wider economic measures announced in the July stimulus programme I really hope I worked hard with my ministerial colleagues to prioritise this sector. I understand the concerns of those who want more longer-term measures, and that is what I will focus on now. This is just the start. Last week's July stimulus package and the longer-term national economic plan will be launched in October. I will work on ensuring the tourism sector's voice is heard loudly and clearly in the deliberations on that plan. Working together with Government and the industry I am confident in our ability to overcome the difficult challenges that lie ahead.
