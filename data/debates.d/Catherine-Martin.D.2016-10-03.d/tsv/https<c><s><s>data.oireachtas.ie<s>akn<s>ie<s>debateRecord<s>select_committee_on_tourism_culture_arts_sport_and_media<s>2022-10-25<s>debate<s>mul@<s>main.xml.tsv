CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá mé sásta a bheith ag labhairt leis na comhaltaí inniu. Go dtí seo, má bhí rialachán ar bith i gceist, bhí sé déanta ag na comhlachtaí nó na meáin shóisialta iad féin. Ar bhealach tá sé thar am go ndéanfaimid a leithéid. The members all know how important this Bill is in a range of ways. It is important to our economy in promising to deliver on a modern regulatory system for a crucial business sector. It is important for our society in providing safety and security for people as they seek to benefit from the considerable opportunities provided by the Internet. It is most important, however, for our children. We can all acknowledge how important it is to be able to protect our children from online harm and empower them to deal with the challenges of an online society. I propose a range of amendments in three categories. The first is on foot of issues raised in Seanad Éireann and on which I committed to act. The second is amendments to provide for the individual complaints mechanism and the third is amendments required for technical reasons. The Government approved the amendments on 18 October. The expert group report on the individual complaints mechanism was published on 20 September. The group ultimately concluded that the complaints mechanism was feasible and, on foot of that, the appropriate amendments have been drafted. The amendments ensure that coimisiún na meán has a legal basis to begin phasing in a robust individual complaints mechanism in the coming years which will initially focus on children and a number of non-offence-specific categories of harmful online content such as cyberbullying. Another amendment is designed to provide for the inclusion of further forms of offence-specific harmful online content under Schedule 3 of the Bill. This further content relates to the criminal offence of flashing under the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. The amendments will allow the online safety commissioner to appropriately deal with online content related to the offence of flashing through systemic regulations. Other important changes are amendments to ensure the inclusion of local broadcasters in the scheme to support professional journalistic practices and to provide clarity on when coimisiún na meán may dismiss certain complaints. I know that members of the committee have proposed a range of amendments on a range of issues and I look forward to the debate. I intend to bring a number of amendments to the Bill on Report Stage. The first group of amendments will be to section 53, specifically those provisions that relate to the content production scheme. I am conscious that Deputies have proposed their own Committee Stage amendments to section 53, some of which relate to matters that I have been considering for some time. I look forward to discussing them in detail with Deputies and indicating how I will seek to address those issues on Report Stage. I intend to bring an amendment to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services and promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. I intend to bring a number of technical amendments to remove references to the obligation of RTÉ and TG4 to maintain the teletext service. There is a sense of urgency to this debate, not least in the form of infringement proceedings pending at EU level, because we are very motivated to formally establish coimisiún na meán and empower and resource it to start its important work. Our debates and discussions since the publication of the Bill in January are really only the beginning. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as a gcuid oibre agus an Bille ag déanamh a bhealaigh trí na Dála.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Ó Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe. As the Deputy said, amendment No. 1 seeks to change all references to the commission in the Bill to coimisiún and amendment No. 5 seeks to change all references in the Bill from commissioner to coimisinéir. As Deputies will be aware, section 9D(1) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, provides that the name of a statutory body established on and from the commencement of section 4 of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021, shall be in the Irish language. I can come back to the Deputy regarding the commencement. He has raised some valid concerns. Ní mholaim glacadh leis na leasuithe inniu ach tuigim na pointí a rinneadh. Toisc gur ceist chasta í seo maidir le dréachtú reachtaíochta, lorgóidh mé tuilleadh comhairle dlí agus tiocfaidh mé ar ais chuig an ábhar seo ar Chéim na Tuarascála. An bhfuil sé sin ceart go leor?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 9, line 32, to delete “section 139ZZ(1)” and substitute “section 139ZZH(1)”.The purpose of this group of amendments is to make provision in the Bill for an individual complaints mechanism, as recommended by the online safety expert group in its comprehensive report. When I established the expert group earlier this year I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, I would provide for it in the Bill. That is what I am proposing to do with these amendments. The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism, including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian e-safety commissioner. The expert group’s report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism, focused on operationalising the mechanism on a phased basis and firstly for children. These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group’s report and they hew closely to the expert group’s recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. In this regard, amendment No. 118 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how an coimisiún can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content; the threshold that must be met before an coimisiún will handle a complaint; the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to an coimisiún; a requirement for an coimisiún to set out a plan for operationalising these provisions; and a requirement for an coimisiún to prioritise operationalising the individual complaints mechanism for children in the first instance. The remainder of the amendments in this grouping - amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, 43, 82, 108, 118 to 120, inclusive, 124 to 128, inclusive, 130 to 136, inclusive, 146, 148 to 256, inclusive, 258 to 264, inclusive, 266 to 269, inclusive, 272 to 292, inclusive, 317 and 318 - are consequential to amendment No. 118 and relate to the necessary renumbering of sections throughout the Bill to account for the insertion of amendment No. 118.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 9, line 34, to delete “section 139ZZ(2)” and substitute “section 139ZZH(2)”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 9, line 36, to delete “section 139ZZ(3)” and substitute “section 139ZZH(3)”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 6: In page 10, line 30, to delete “definition” where it firstly occurs and substitute “definitions”.These are purely technical amendments inserting a definition of the e-commerce directive into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions. This is being proposed to avoid repeating the title of the directive where it is referenced in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 10, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:“ ‘E-Commerce Directive’ means Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market;”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Munster and Mythen for their amendment, which seeks to add the word “impacts” to the phrase “the nature and characteristics of published material” within the definition of media literacy in the Bill so that it reads as “the nature, characteristics and impacts of published material.” While I am sympathetic to the proposed amendment, I am confident that its intentions are covered by the definition of media literacy as a whole, which refers to the “public understanding of material published in print, broadcast, online or other media.” It is also in line with the meaning of media literacy used by the Media Literacy Ireland network in practice. The line the amendment seeks to change is contained within a non-exhaustive list of things which this public understanding may comprise.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 9:In page 16, line 19, to delete “meaning given by” and substitute “same meaning as in”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 10:In page 16, lines 19 to 22, to delete all words from and including “Directive” in line 19 down to and including “Market” in line 22 and substitute “the E-Commerce Directive”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 16, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:
“Meaning of “under the jurisdiction of the State”: providers of other services that may be relevant online services 
6. The Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following section after section 2B:“2C. (1) For the purposes of this Act, the provider of an information society service, other than a provider to whom section 2A or 2B applies, is under the jurisdiction of the State if the provider of the service is established in the State within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the E-Commerce Directive.(2) In this section ‘information society service’ has the same meaning as in Article 1(1)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015.”.”.The amendments in this group seek to clarify that the jurisdictional test for when a relevant online service which is not a video sharing platform service is established in Ireland is set out in Article 3 of the e-commerce directive. Amendment No. 11 contains the substantive section, a new section 2C to be inserted into the 2009 Act, while amendments Nos. 12 and 13 involve consequential renumbering. These amendments are purely to give greater legal clarity as to how jurisdiction for such services is determined under the Bill and do not in substance alter the legal framework set out in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 12:In page 16, line 32, to delete “section 2B” and substitute “section 2C”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 16, line 33, to delete “2C.” and substitute “2D.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 14 seeks to provide an coimisiún with the power to compel online services to provide any data requested that pertains to public interest research or any data that the commissioner deems to be relevant in protection of the common good. I do not believe it is appropriate to give a regulatory body a general power to compel the disclosure of information based on what would be its own definition of the public good. My advice is that any such power must be explicitly linked to the functions envisaged for that body. An coimisiún already has the power to compel designated online services to provide it with information regarding their compliance with their obligations under online safety codes and the Bill sets out that it is an offence for them not to do so. Regarding access to data for the purposes of public interest research, the Digital Services Act sets out a detailed process by which this may be done. That Act is expected to enter into force by the end of November 2022, following which EU member states will have 15 months to implement its provisions in their national law. This process is being led in Ireland by my colleague the Tánaiste. Including this amendment would therefore pre-empt or duplicate those provisions which would, on both counts, be inappropriate. For these three reasons, I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas arís leis na Teachtaí as a gcuid leasuithe. In Uimh. 15 agus 16, iarrtar leasú a dhéanamh ar fhoráil sa Bhille go ndéanfaidh coimisiún na meán a dhícheall lena chinntiú go bhfreastalóidh a bheartais maidir le seirbhísí craolacháin agus físe ar éileamh ar an bhealach is fearr ar riachtanais mhuintir oileán na hÉireann, ag cur a dtraidisiúin agus a dteanga san áireamh trí thagairt shonrach a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge. Ceapadh an fhoráil seo den Bhille lena chinntiú go gcuirfidh coimisiún na meán le traidisiúin agus le teangacha éagsúla ar fad ar ár n-oileán san áireamh ina chuid oibre. Tá sé i gceist go gcuirfidh an tagairt do theanga, ní hamháin don Ghaeilge, don Bhéarla agus don Ultais ach don iliomad teangacha eile a labhraíonn daoine atá ina gcónaí ar ár n-oileán san áireamh. I understand that the intention of amendments Nos. 15 and 16 are to specify a particular role for coimisiún na meán in supporting and promoting the Irish language and Irish language programming. I consider that the intention of the amendments is already provided for in the specific references to the role of an coimisiún in paragraphs (c) and (e) of subsection (3) of section 7 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Bill. I, therefore, cannot accept the amendments. I leasú Uimh. 18 d’athrófaí an dualgas atá ar an choimisiún cláir Gaeilge agus cláir a bhaineanna le hathrú aeráide agus inbhuanaitheacht chomhshaoil a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh go dualgas chun forbairt agus soláthar na gclár sin a chinntiú agus a mhéadú. The committee will know that I am strongly in favour of increasing the availability of Irish language programming. I have secured increased allocations to TG4 over the past three budgets. When I took up the post as Minister, the Exchequer allocation for TG4 was €37.2 million. In 2023, that allocation will be €52.2 million, which is an increase of just over 40% over a three-year period. I also approved TG4's proposal to establish a new dedicated Irish language children's channel, Cúla4, and made a specific €3.3 million provision in budget 2023 to support the new channel. The language in the Bill is sufficient to ensure support by an coimisiún for the production of programming in the Irish language with regard to climate action. Replacing the term "promote and stimulate" with "ensure and increase" would imply that an coimisiún, as a media regulator, could direct the editorial content of a broadcaster or video-on-demand service towards a particular outcome. As an coimisiún will not have that power, I do not propose to accept the amendment. Aontaím le cuspóir leasú Uimh. 21. Mhol na Seanadóirí Warfield, Ó Donnghaile, Gavan agus Boylan leasú ar Chéim an Choiste sa Seanad. Ar Chéim na Tuarascála sa Seanad thug mé ar aghaidh leasú ar an Bhille ina bhforáiltear in alt 7(3)(c) den Acht Craolacháin 2009, a dtagann an Bille ina áit, go ndéanfaidh an coimisiún úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh sna meáin cumarsáide a fheidhmítear sa Stát. This is a broader duty than proposed by the Deputies given that it encompasses the print media in addition to broadcasters, video-on-demand services and online services. I, therefore, do not accept amendment No. 21.
I leasú Uimh. 20, d’fhorálfaí go bhféadfadh an coimisiún athbhreithnithe straitéiseacha a dhéanamh ar na hearnálacha a rialaíonn an coimisiún maidir le craolachán i nGaeilge. The committee will be aware that the Report of the Future of Media Commission recommends that coimisiún na meán should conduct a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system, with a focus on institutional structures and opportunities for innovation and collaboration as well as strategies for youth engagement and Irish language education. Amendment No. 20 would confine the strategic review to broadcasting in the Irish language whereas the comprehensive review to be undertaken by an coimisiún will be broader in scope and include digital media. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept it.
I leasú Uimh. 33 cheanglófaí go gcuirfí sonraí faoi leith maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge mar theanga labhartha sna meáin san áireamh sa ráiteas straitéise a ullmhaíonn an coimisiún. Níl an fhoráil sa Bhille maidir le hábhar an ráitis straitéise saintreorach maidir leis na torthaí nó cuspóirí ar cheart a chur san áireamh in aon ráiteas. Tá sé sin toisc go leagtar amach dualgais agus feidhmeanna an choimisiúin go soiléir in alt 7 den Acht Craolacháin 2009, a dtagann an Bille ina áit. Bheadh aon ráiteas straitéise bunaithe ar na dualgais agus na feidhmeanna sin agus leagfaí amach ann na cuspóirí agus aschuir a bhaineann lena chomhlíonadh. Ní bheadh sé iomchuí díriú ar fheidhm ar leith de chuid an choimisiúin maidir leis an ráiteas straitéise ó tharla go bhféadfadh sé a thabhairt le tuiscint go bhfuil ordlathas cuspóirí ann don choimisiún. Tá sé i gceist go gcomhlíonfaidh an coimisiún a fheidhmeanna reachtúla go léir, ó shábháilteacht ar líne go cur chun cinn na gclár Gaeilge. Ní ghlacaim leis an leasú. I cannot accept amendment No. 66. The proposed amendment would infringe on the editorial freedom of both advertisers and media service providers. However, we are taking action to increase the quantity of Irish language advertising. As the committee will be aware, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, recently brought the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 through the Oireachtas. As a consequence, section 10A of the Official Languages Act, as amended, will, when commenced, require public bodies to spend at least 20% of their advertising budgets on Irish language advertisements, with at least 5% to be placed through Irish language media. Amendment No. 320 would amend the Long Title of the Bill to reference specifically the role of coimisiún na meán regarding the use and visibility of the Irish language. The Long Title of the Bill is not intended to capture or reference comprehensively every duty of coimisiún na meán nor to reference one in particular. Rather, it is intended to set out the broad contents of the Bill. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar a dúirt mé cheana, cuireadh leasú ar Cheim na Tuarascála sa Seanad go ndéanfadh an coimisiún úsáid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a spreagadh sna meáin chumarsáide a fheidhmíonn sa Stát. Rinneadh déileáil leis an leasú sin sa Seanad. On hearing and seeing more Irish language programming, I point to the media fund. As Deputies know, the sound and vision fund was restricted to radio but now we will have print and radio and there is €6 million of immediate funding there that will start with local democracy and court reporting. Irish language content was included in the most recent round of sound and vision funding, so I see much more scope with the media fund of €6 million that I have asked the BAI to start looking at already. As I said, that includes print as well as broadcasting on air and on TV.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill already addresses the issue, which is essentially about the co-operation between regulatory bodies on the issue of gambling, by setting out that coimisiún na meán must co-operate, in relation to the regulation of gambling, with any public body concerned with that matter. This means that on establishment, an coimisiún will co-operate with the existing public bodies responsible for gambling and will also co-operate with the gambling regulatory authority when it is established. At a technical level, I cannot accept the amendment because the Bill cannot require an coimisiún to meet a body that does not yet exist or produce a report on a sector for which it has no remit. However, I am satisfied the strategic issue the amendment seeks to address is already adequately dealt with in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 23:In page 22, line 1, to delete “section 48(3), (4) or (5)” and substitute “subsection (3), (4) or (5) of section 48”.This is a grouping of purely technical amendments. Amendment Nos. 23 and 24 clarify references in the Bill to the functions an coimisiún may delegate to an individual commissioner. These amendments do not change the legal position regarding what can be delegated but simply fix some technical discrepancies. Amendment No. 26 changes the phrase "a nominee of the person" to "a person acting on behalf of the person". The wording to be inserted is considered more suitable for this section, which relates to the disclosure of interests, as it is more encompassing than the word "nominee". The purpose of amendment No. 31 is to replace a reference to "monies" in the Bill with a reference to "moneys".I have been advised that "moneys" is the more constitutional spelling. The purpose of amendment No. 32 is to replace a reference to "Central Fund" in the Bill with a reference to "Exchequer". This reflects the general usage in legislation to provide that receipts are to be paid into the Exchequer and that payments are charged or paid out of the Central Fund. The purpose of amendment No. 49 is to fix the section title of section 46I. This is being done on the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. The purpose of amendment No. 50 is to replace a comma with a dash at the beginning of section 46I. Again, this is being done on the advice of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. Amendment No. 60 is intended to clarify the meaning of a phrase on not giving unfair preference to any political party in terms of the allocation of broadcasting time or the positioning of content in a catalogue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment does not refer to a person. It simply substitutes "an unfair preference is not given" for "they do not give an unfair preference". Is the Deputy wondering whether this only applies to political parties?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Bill does read "political party", so perhaps that is something we need to examine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy’s point is well made. We will examine it and revert on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 22, line 4, to delete “section 139W(6) or (8)” and substitute “subsection (6) or (8) of section 139ZE”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Ó Snodaigh, Munster agus Mythen as a gcuid leasuithe. I leasuithe Uimh. 25, 27 agus 28, iarrtar inniúlacht sa Ghaeilge a bheith ag bunlíon de bhaill fhoirne nó coimisinéirí i gcoimisiún na meán. It is important to set out the overarching legislative background that has been in place since the enactment of the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 last December. Section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended, now provides that the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee established under the 2021 Act shall have regard to the objective of increasing, by 31 December 2030 at the latest, the number of staff of public bodies who are competent in the Irish language such that at least 20% of staff recruited are competent. As I have previously indicated, the BAI is specified as a public body in the First Schedule of the Act and so, by virtue of the transitional provisions of the Bill, coimisiún na meán will be considered a public body under the Act. On that basis, I cannot accept amendment No. 28, which seeks to replicate the provisions of section 18C(3)(b) of the Official Languages Act within this Bill. Mar an gcéanna, ní ghlacaim le leasú Uimh. 27, a d’éileodh go mbeadh inniúlacht sa Ghaeilge ag 30% nó níos mó de na coimisinéirí agus 20% nó níos mó de bhaill fhoirne choimisiún na meán. Soláthraíonn Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla an bonn do chuspóir a bhaineann le comhlachtaí poiblí. Ní fheicim go bhfuil fiúntas i gceanglas sonrach a chur i bhfeidhm ar choimisiún na meán. I cannot accept amendment No. 25, which would require the executive chairperson and one other commissioner to be competent in the use of the Irish language. I am advised that this provision is unnecessarily restrictive. I would note that the recruitment booklet for the role of media development commissioner advertised in July identified competency in the Irish language as a desirable quality. As the Irish Language Services Advisory Committee continues its work over the coming years, consideration could be given to requiring competency in the Irish language for one of the commissioner posts. However, it is important that we retain flexibility in this regard to ensure the widest array of candidates are available on establishment of coimisiún na meán. Accordingly, the best way to provide for that recruitment is through the recruitment process for commissioners rather than in legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 26:In page 25, line 36, to delete “a nominee of the person” and substitute “a person acting on behalf of the person”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies who tabled the amendment and those who contributed on it. As they said, the Bill already provides that community broadcasters will not be liable for the industry levy, so this is focused on commercial radio broadcasters. I value the service being provided by local radio. I grew up not too far from Deputy Munster and I relied on LMFM and Northern Sound. I know the value of local radio in rural Ireland. The industry levy contained in section 21 of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, is based on the principle that each category of service pays for the cost of activities related to that service so that there is no cross-subsidisation of one sector by another. This is an important general regulatory principle and one I do not think we should depart from. However, it is important to note that the Bill already provides that up to 50% of the cost of regulating broadcasting can be met through the TV licence. This was carried over from the Broadcasting Bill, which Deputy Naughten in particular progressed. However, the Deputies will also be aware that a technical working has been established to look at reforms to the TV licence and we must let that group complete its work. Members will also be aware of the additional funding I mentioned earlier that has been put in place for radio through the sound and vision fund. These supports will also be available at an increased level through the media fund. I am committed to radio and I believe these measures will help.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the Bill provides for up to 50%. I understand the Deputy's concerns about the word "can", but that technical group is looking at how that could be applied. Deputy Canney knows his target audience. He went for the soft spot when he mentioned music with me. He got there before Deputy Cannon. The Department has provided funding in the sound and vision fund for musicians. I appreciate that value. There is no disputing it. I am not sure if we can go further but I will commit to examining it and coming back on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 31: In page 32, line 33, to delete “monies” and substitute “moneys”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 32:In page 33, lines 12 and 13, to delete “Central Fund” and substitute “Exchequer”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his amendments. Before turning to matters of language, I must note that it is not usual practice to lay documents before specified Oireachtas committees which are already being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. On that basis, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 35 and 38. Amendments Nos. 34, 36 and 37 require the annual report and statement of strategy to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in both official languages. These amendments appear to replicate the requirements of section 10 of the Official Languages Act 2003, as amended. Given that the BAI is listed as a public body under the Official Languages Act, coimisiún na meán will be covered by that Act by virtue of the transitional provisions set out in the Bill. Mar sin ní bheidh mé ag glacadh leis na leasuithe seo.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will come back to the Deputy on that. I understand the concern he as raised earlier as well. I can see the need for certainty.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment seeks to make statutory provision for consultation on the provision of a dedicated Irish-language youth radio service. I will not accept this amendment because the Future of Media Commission recommended that coimisiún na meán undertake a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system and the results of that review will inform developing any actions necessary in this area. Tá sé tábhachtach a thabhairt faoi deara freisin go gcaithfí aon mholadh do sheirbhís raidió nua a chur ar aghaidh tríd an gcreat rialála atá ann cheana féin. D’ainneoin ár dtiomantas do thacaíocht leanúnach na Gaeilge agus d'fhorbairt na Gaeilge, ní hé foráil reachtúil a dhéanamh an bealach is oiriúnaí chun tuilleadh seirbhísí Gaeilge a bhaint amach.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Aithním an spéis ar leith atá ag an Teachta san ábhar seo. Tá an spéis chéanna agam ann. Aithním an frustrachas freisin. I will give some further information on this. The BAI, through its Irish language services advisory committee, which includes representatives from broadcasters and Irish language organisations, is carrying out a research project to ascertain the potential demand for such a service, the kind of content which such a service would provide, and the implications for the FM spectrum. I expect its report before the end of the year. If it can be done, I want it to be done. I hope the report will be helpful on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 42 would have the effect of preventing an coimisiún from co-operating with groups in the establishment of standards or self-regulatory systems as they relate to commercial communications. Section 34 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, is drafted in line with the revised audiovisual media services directive and allows the commission to co-operate with self-regulatory mechanisms. Articles 9(3) and 9(4) of the directive set out the requirements on member states to encourage self-regulation in respect of commercial communications, including advertising. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments that would appear to contradict the directive.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 43:In page 44, line 29, to delete “section 139ZK” and substitute “section 139ZS”
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the Deputy's first point, the online safety codes deal with the rules on complaints handling. If companies do not abide by the codes that they have signed up to, they will be fined or sanctioned as set out in the provisions. An coimisiún will also have the power to demand that platforms remove particular content. That is how that will be dealt with. In relation to the right to be forgotten, it is a data protection matter. It is not for coimisiún na meán to deal with; it is more for the Minister for Justice. It is a matter for the Data Protection Commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I noted when this issue was raised in the Seanad, I understand the intention of the amendment and why it is troubling for people living on the island of Ireland watching the public service broadcasters to see their part of the island of Ireland removed from maps. I just do not think we should prescribe in legislation what RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show. Under section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence as regards programming content.The purpose of that independence is to prevent political interference in the operation of RTÉ and TG4. Prescribing the format or content of programming in such a detailed manner, no matter how well-intentioned, would run contrary to the principle of editorial independence and, as legislators, I do not think we should make law regarding the types of content that may be shown on our public broadcasters to this degree of granularity. I acknowledge the amendment seeks to address a number of incidents that offended many people, but I cannot accept it because it would set a wider precedent for the regulation in primary legislation of specific types of content.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I again refer to section 29 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, whereby both public service broadcasters are required to be independent in their day-to-day operations, which includes editorial independence, a concept I believe the Deputy accepts. Of course, as I said, I understand how it is upsetting for people living on the island of Ireland to see part of their island removed from maps depicted by a public service broadcaster, but I do not think we should prescribe in legislation what RTÉ and TG4 can or cannot display or show. It would set a wider precedent for the regulation of very specific types of content in primary legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the points being made, as someone who grew up in a Border town, but my advice suggests primary legislation is not the place to address this. I think these concerns should perhaps be communicated to the national broadcasters and the committee might wish to communicate them as a follow-on to this discussion. I do not believe primary legislation is where it should be addressed because there is a concern as to the precedent that would set regarding content.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It goes back to the original point, regarding section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, at the heart of which is editorial independence-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----so it would be an instruction.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 48, 62, 64 and 84 would have the effect of setting quotas for the provision of broadcast content and the proportion of advertisements that must be in the Irish language. Deputies may be aware that a number of amendments were proposed on Seanad Committee and Report Stages regarding gender- and nationality-based quotas in respect of musical works on sound broadcasting services and a quota for participation on news and current affairs programmes. I indicated to Senators at the time that I would carefully consider those proposals. On foot of legal advice from the Attorney General on the proposed quotas considered on foot of the Seanad Stages of the Bill, I decided not to introduce any provision for them here on Committee Stage. Instead, the Government agreed that an amendment should be drafted to provide that coimisiún na meán may make media service codes to promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes broadcast by broadcasters and made available by providers of audiovisual on-demand media services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works that are composed or performed by women in programmes broadcast by providers of sound broadcasting services. I intend to introduce these amendments on Report Stage. I raise this now in this context because the advice of the Attorney General has a bearing on my approach to the issue of placing binding quotas for certain types of content in primary legislation.
Amendment No. 48
seeks to impose a general duty on audiovisual media service providers and sound broadcasters in the State to promote the Irish language and requires coimisiún na meán to examine the feasibility and merit of setting out minimum requirements for the provision of content in the Irish language through television programme service and sound broadcasting contracts. As Deputies will be aware, the duties placed on broadcasters through Chapter 2 of Part 3B of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by section 9, are intended to protect the rights of audiences and individuals rather than to compel broadcasters to take a particular action. On quotas, as the advice received from the Attorney General in respect of gender-based quotas I referred to earlier indicates, there are a series of complex legal questions associated with quotas relating to competition law and freedom of expression. There are already clear avenues for us to take action to support Irish language programming through increased funding and supports. For example, I have increased funding for TG4 by 40% since I entered office, from €37.2 million in 2020 to €52.2 million in 2023. I agree that we should explore what further steps should be taken to promote the Irish language. These could include making express provision through media service codes, as I intend to do on Report Stage, regarding the promotion of gender balance and musical works composed by or performed by women. However, I do not agree that an amendment requiring a report to be prepared is appropriate, given that coimisiún na meán will be undertaking a comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system. I believe that we should await the results of the review and accordingly cannot accept the amendment.
Amendment No. 62 would set a quota on sound broadcasting services regarding time dedicated to music containing lyrics, mostly in the Irish language, from 5% from 2026 rising to 10% from 2031. The amendment would also provide that 40% of music broadcast in the English language should be reserved for musical works composed by at least one Irish or European Economic Area national. I am strongly supportive of the promotion of Irish music and compositions performed in Irish on our broadcasting services. Ireland has a strong and vibrant music sector, which is recognised across the world. As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am keen to ensure appropriate supports are in place to nurture and protect this sector further. However, following the advice of the Attorney General received regarding gender-based quotas, I am acutely conscious of the legal and other factors that must be taken into account when considering the feasibility of introducing airplay quotas. I understand the Deputies have drafted the amendment to seek to ensure compliance with EU law, as a language-based airplay quota has been successfully introduced by the French authorities, for example. From a policy perspective, the potential benefit to music production in Ireland must be balanced with the rights of broadcasters, subject to their contractual or regulatory obligations, to determine the type of content they wish to broadcast and to ensure commercial revenue, particularly in the context of the current media climate. I do not think the legal or policy complexities can be resolved in the timeframe of this Bill and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. However, this is a matter that can be considered in the context of the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system.
Amendment No. 64
would require audiovisual media service providers, including broadcasters, to ensure that at least 20% of advertisements made available on the service would be in the Irish language from 2026. As I indicated earlier, we have already placed a duty on public bodies to ensure that at least 20% of advertising placed is in the Irish language. In addition to concerns regarding the legal complexities of any quotas, this amendment may have a number of unintended effects that would require careful consideration. First, the measure could reduce the revenues that broadcasters could earn if there is not a sufficient supply of Irish language advertising from advertisers to produce content in the Irish language. For example, if a broadcaster currently broadcasts 95% of advertisements in English, a 20% quota could lead to a significant drop in advertising revenue, if advertisers do not first correspondingly increase their production of Irish language advertising and price it accordingly. There is also a risk that there comes to be, in effect, two advertising pricing structures, one for English language advertising and one for Irish language advertising. Second, given the country-of-origin principle that underpins the audiovisual media services directive, this requirement could only apply to audiovisual media service providers registered or licensed here in Ireland. Accordingly, services regulated in other member states that target Irish audiences would not be bound by the quota, potentially increasing their share of revenue earned from advertising vis-à-vis Irish services. As the broadcasting sector in particular already faces significant challenges to advertising revenues due to the change in ways that content is consumed, I am of the view significant analysis and consultation with stakeholders would be required before considering such a change. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
Amendment No. 84
would require that sound broadcasting service contracts and television programme service contracts include a provision requiring broadcasters to provide at least 30 minutes of programming in Irish between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. I will not accept this amendment today. As with the Deputies' other proposed amendments, this is a matter that could be considered by the comprehensive review of the provision of Irish language services across the media system that will be undertaken by coimisiún na meán.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 51:In page 49, line 34, after “Part,” to insert the following:“ ‘party political programme’ means a programme broadcast, or made available in a catalogue of an audiovisual on-demand media service, by or on behalf of a political party for the purpose of promoting the political party;‘political party’ means a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties;”. Section 46M(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill as passed by the Seanad, retains the prohibition on advertisements of a political nature and the derogation from that prohibition in the case of "party political programmes", previously known as "party political broadcasts". In that, the Bill is intended to reflect long-standing policy.  During the debate in the Seanad, I signalled that "party political programme" was intended to have the same meaning as "party political broadcast", namely, the short programmes carried on our public service broadcaster during electoral periods for the purpose of promoting a registered political party. The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure that it encompassed both broadcasts by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider, in other words, to ensure that it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player. Senators and a number of stakeholders, including RTÉ and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, sought clarity in the Bill that "party political programme" had essentially the same meaning as "party political broadcast". Given the importance of providing clarity in this matter I am introducing amendments Nos. 51 to 58, inclusive, to provide for a definition of "party political programme" in the Bill.  Amendment No. 67, when read with consequential amendments Nos. 68 to 76, inclusive, provides that media service codes, which will apply to broadcasting and video-on-demand services, may provide that party political programmes may only be made available at specified times. Currently, party political broadcasts are only made available during electoral periods. This provision is intended to make coimisiún na meán's authority to specify the timing of party political programmes explicit. The intention is that these times shall continue to be during electoral periods. However, to provide flexibility, the provision refers to specified times rather than electoral periods to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure that it encompassed both broadcasts by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider, in other words, to ensure that it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 59:In page 50, line 32, after “or” to insert “undue”. During the Seanad debates on Committee and Report Stages on the Bill, a number of Senators indicated that they considered the provision that prohibits broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services making available programmes which may reasonably be considered to cause “harm or offence” as being potentially contrary to the principles of freedom of expression. I committed to examining the matter. Having examined and considered the matter, I am proposing amendment No. 59 to qualify the standard applied to broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services from “offence” to one of “undue offence”. This will align the language in the Bill with the standard of “harm or undue offence” to material applied by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland through its code of programme standards, ensuring that the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition. In qualifying the term "offence" the amendment recognises what the BAI recognises in practice, which is that there is no guarantee that programme material will be free from offence, given that the definition of "offence" varies from person to person. However, the amendment will still guard audiences against undue offence which shall continue to be enforced by coimisiún na meán through media service codes. In this context I also note that the Bill contains numerous safeguards in respect of fundamental rights, not least that one of the primary functions of coimisiún na meán is to uphold the democratic values in the Constitution, including freedom of expression. However, it must be stated that the right to freedom of expression is not absolute and, like all other rights, is subject to balancing the law to ensure that the rights of others, for example the right to safety and security, are not unduly infringed. This principle of rights balancing is recognised in Irish law, EU law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. I am confident that this Bill sits comfortably within those traditions. Amendment No. 65 is a consequential amendment to amendment No. 59.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The codes will set out that detail. This is what the BAI currently uses in broadcasting codes already. What we are trying to do here is align that language with what is there and applied by the BAI through its code of programming standards. It is what is used by the BAI currently in its broadcasting codes, so we are just ensuring the statutory provision is in line with the practical implementations of the prohibition.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The codes will set out in practice what it should mean. This arose during the Seanad debate. In qualifying the term "offence", the amendment recognises what the BAI recognises in practice and currently uses, which is that there is no guarantee that programme material will be free from offence, given the definition of "offence" varies from person to person. However, this amendment will still guard audiences against undue offence, which will continue to be enforced by coimisiún na meán through media service codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not something we can define in legislation. As I said, it is something-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----that will vary from person to person. The media service codes are to be abided by, by whosoever has signed up to them and if there is a complaint made, it is for the commissioner to decide.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That will be for the commissioner to decide. I am saying there are some there that are currently used by the BAI. It will be for the commissioner to decide.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 60:In page 52, lines 3 and 4, to delete “they do not give an unfair preference” and substitute “an unfair preference is not given”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his amendment. Section 46L(5) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, seeks to reflect the current policy regarding the requirement for sound broadcasting services to devote a set amount of broadcast time to news and current affairs programmes. This is subject to a derogation that may be issued by coimisiún na meán to a licensed radio service. This derogation is currently exercised by the BAI with radio stations such as Christmas FM. The amendment brought by Deputies Naughten and Canney would remove section 46L(7), which provides that the various radio services provided by RTÉ are covered as one radio service for the purposes of the news and current affairs requirement. As Deputies are aware, RTÉ radio services are not licensed by the BAI, nor will they be licensed by coimisiún na meán. Instead, RTÉ services are subject to extensive statutory duties set out in Part 7 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. Accordingly, it is not possible for the BAI, and will not be possible for coimisiún na meán, to offer a derogation to RTÉ from the requirement to set aside a minimum amount of time to news and current affairs programming. For that reason, the Bill provides that RTÉ services may be considered as one service for the purposes of the minimum requirements. If the Bill did not have this provision, Lyric FM would be subject to the minimum requirement as much as Radio 1, with no recourse for a derogation, unlike all other radio services. This would have negative implications for both RTÉ and audiences, who currently have considerable choice across RTÉ services, while being well served by news and current affairs programming. That is why I cannot accept this amendment. The practical effect of the amendment would be to require more news bulletins on, for example, Lyric FM. In the longer term that would create a disproportionate requirement on RTÉ which, unlike licensed broadcasters, would be unable to avail of this derogation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is recognising that different stations have different target audiences.It would unduly restrictive to require RTÉ to have a particular percentage of news content on all its stations. We are not changing anything here. This subsection reflects the current Broadcasting Act. We are not changing anything but rather carrying it over to the commission. RTÉ is obliged to provide news and current affairs extensively on a nationwide basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are not changing anything. The Deputy seems to think we are changing something. We are not changing anything. We are replicating what is in the Broadcast Act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We can engage on this with officials after this. This was brought in in 2009. It is hard to access it now to show it to the Deputy but we can engage with him. The intention is not to change anything. I will ask my officials to engage with the Deputy after this meeting, if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendments. As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment is, first, to allow coimisiún na meán to identify and designate providers of what are referred to as sound streaming media and music sharing platform services; second, to provide for coimisiún na meán to impose a levy of 20% on the revenues of those providers earned in the State; and third, for the proceeds of the levy to be granted to the Arts Council for the purposes of making schemes to support the production of Irish music. As the committee knows, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting Irish art and artists, including musicians, across all practices. That is why I brought forward the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will provide €325 per week to support 2,000 artists, including 584 musicians over three years, and allocated an additional €2 million to the sound and vision scheme to support the live music-related programming this year. I understand the intention of the amendment is to raise further funds to support the Irish artists. I also understand the concerns that have been raised by musicians and artists regarding their remuneration for content consumed through music streaming services. This is a complex area and, in the first instance, I would emphasise that copyright law is a matter for Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The committee will understand why I cannot accept this amendment. It represents a major policy departure requiring extensive analysis and consideration, with a number of complex legal and policy questions that need to be addressed. I would have a number of specific concerns regarding the amendment being proposed here. First, I note there is no explicit legal basis in EU law for such as levy. As Deputies are aware, the revised audiovisual media services directive applies to audiovisual broadcasters, video on demand services and video sharing platform services. The provisions in Article 13(2) of the directive, which provide the legal basis for the content production levy contained in this Bill, are directed at audiovisual broadcasters and video on demand services. In particular, the innovation of Article 13(2) of the directive is explicitly to permit the levying of video on demand services targeting audiences in the State. Second, it is unclear whether net revenue is intended to be analogous to taxable profit under the tax code or refers to post-tax revenue. In either case, what is being proposed appears to be similar to the current corporation tax, albeit that it seeks to tax revenue that is earned by a service. I would note, in that context, that the rate proposed is considerably higher than the current rate of corporation tax. It would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to consider a levy on net revenue in the first instance. Finally, the proposal would appear to target only those sound streaming services that are under the jurisdiction of the State, which I take to mean are established here. Accordingly, the levy would not appear to apply to the major services located outside the State. There is a risk then that those services currently established here would simply seek to relocate to another member state to avoid the levy.
