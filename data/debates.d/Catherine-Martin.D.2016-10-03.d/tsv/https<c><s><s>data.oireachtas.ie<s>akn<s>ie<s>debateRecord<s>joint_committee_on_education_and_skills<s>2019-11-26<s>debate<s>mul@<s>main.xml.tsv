CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	We are now in public session. I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones as they interfere with the sound system, make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and adversely affect television coverage and web streaming. The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with stakeholders on the provisions of the Retention of Records Bill 2019. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne; Ms Eileen Molloy; Ms Mary Harney; Dr. Mary Lodato; Ms Catriona Crowe; Dr. Fred Logue of FP Logue Solicitors; Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, lecturer in human rights law at NUI Galway; and Dr. Sarah-Anne Buckley, lecturer in history at NUI Galway. I will invite witnesses to make brief opening statements - a maximum of three minutes - that will be followed by an engagement with members. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise witnesses that any opening statements they make to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Ms Carmel McDonnell Byrne to make her opening statement. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the survivors for the honesty, courage and strength with which they speak for everyone for whom they speak. We have all been very moved, in particular, by Ms Harney's contribution when she said that their memories have been wiped and when she asked for them back. It was incredible. I cannot begin to understand what they have been through in terms of the abuse in residential institutions. At the beginning of the contributions, Dr. Lodato stated how she was proud to be a survivor. She spoke of the journey that she travelled to be proud to be a survivor and stated that she wants her full story in the National Archives. We must listen to survivors on that journey to healing. We have a role as a State to help them on that journey to healing. Ms McDonnell Byrne stated that it is important on their healing journey that they are empowered to make decisions and choices because that is something they were all denied as children. It is obvious that openness and transparency are essential parts of that healing. My question for Dr. Buckley is an expansion on what Senator Gallagher was asking. In some way, is this Bill about the Department of Education and Skills protecting itself? Will Dr. O'Rourke and Dr. Buckley expand or give us some details on how other jurisdictions that Dr. O'Rourke mentioned have dealt with this sensitive issue? Will Dr. Buckley take us through how it would be possible to categorise different types of records appropriately or how they could be appropriately anonymised or redacted, if that was needed?
