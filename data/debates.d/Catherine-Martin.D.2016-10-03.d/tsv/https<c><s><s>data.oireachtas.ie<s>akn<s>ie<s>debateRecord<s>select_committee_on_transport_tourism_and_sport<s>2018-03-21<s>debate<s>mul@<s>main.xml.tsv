CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 4 and 6 which have been grouped are about addressing the situation where a school is being provided in a new development but the roads leading to it have not been taken in charge. That leads to the problem that school traffic wardens cannot be provided to ensure the safety of students. This issue came up in Belmayne where a child was recently knocked down. The amendment would address that issue by adding roads which it is intended to take in charge. That is what I am trying to do. Amendment No. 5 would allow local authorities to provide school traffic wardens to ensure the safety of children at Luas and other railway line crossings. The Minister is aware of the situation for the constituents we share in Rathdown. There is a huge safety issue at Windy Arbour Luas stop which is near Our Lady's of Clonskeagh. Recently a national school child ran out onto the line. The local authority cannot provide a school traffic warden there because it is not on its land. The amendment would address the issue simply by adding to "places where schoolchildren cross public roads" the words "or railways". It is my intention to move the amendments again on Report Stage. Is the Minister willing to reconsider them?
