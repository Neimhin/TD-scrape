CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The housing capital budget under Rebuilding Ireland for 2017 was last week increased by the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, by €100 million to €1.4 billion. However, an answer to a recent parliamentary question confirmed that the total spend on additional social homes from all sources since 1 July 2016, in the form of acquisitions, Part V, local authority builds and approved housing body builds, was €583 million. This would indicate that only approximately €500 million has been spent out of €1.4 billion for building and acquiring new units in 2017. Can the Tánaiste tell the House where the remaining almost €1 billion is going? In June this year, in a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister, Deputy Murphy, pledged that 2,284 units would be delivered in 2017. I have gone through the quarterly report for Rebuilding Ireland, which was published last week, to identify every single unit which was completed or site-finished in the first three quarters of 2017 and it is clear that only 809 units of the 2,284 have been completed. In the UK the quantity spent on rental assistance is about five times that of the housing capital budget. As the Government here is clearly not building enough houses, is it the Government's intention to move further towards the UK model? If it is, there are serious health warnings. There is no point drifting towards an entirely rental-oriented approach to housing when, at present, fixity of tenure is completely inadequate and when a lack of inspection or an enforceable standards regime results in the horrific living conditions we saw on "Prime Time" last month. The fact that one in three tenancies in the State is financially rent assisted is just adding pressure to further rent increases for all, making Dublin simply an unattainable place to buy or rent. I am concerned about the inept governmental policy response to date. The incoherence of all this policy implies that what may have happened is that Rebuilding Ireland, launched last year, was rapidly abandoned as a plan by departmental officials without them telling the Tánaiste or the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy. The Tánaiste is now defending a plan which is not there or, if it is, is certainly not working. Where is the €1 billion going? Given the new numbers, why can the Tánaiste not accept that Rebuilding Ireland is not succeeding and will not succeed in effectively tackling the housing crisis?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is hard to believe the figures the Tánaiste is giving for next year when the figures the Government has given for this year show that, of a target of 2,284 houses, only 809 were delivered. There is a huge disconnect between the narrative and reality. The harsh reality is that 8,000 people are homeless. The tragic reality is that 3,000 of them are children and the stark objective reality is that Rebuilding Ireland simply is not working. There were only 809 builds in 2017, of which 303 were direct local authority builds in 18 different authorities, meaning 13 local authorities did not complete a single house in 2017. Of the 98 completions in Dublin, 76 were rapid builds for families on the increasing homeless list, which leaves a grand total of 22 units in the greater Dublin area for a waiting list of 40,000 people. How is the capital housing budget being adequately spent if the greater Dublin area only saw 22 units built in the first nine months of this year? It is time to think outside the box and for the Government to accept that Rebuilding Ireland is not working. This is an emergency and a crisis. Surely an objective analysis of the Government's response should be results-driven. The results speak for themselves and they are appalling. It is time for a new direction and a new plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not working.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There were 22 completions. That is a fact.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 9, to delete lines 26 to 28 and substitute the following:" "student union", in relation to an institute or technological university, means an independent body established by students, with a written constitution ratified by students in a referendum to promote the general interests of students of an institute or technological university and which represents students, both individually and collectively, in respect of academic, disciplinary and other matters arising within the university;".This amendment provides a definition of a student union as an independent body democratically elected by students for students. The Bill's current definition of student union bizarrely allows the technological university to define any student representative body whether it is democratically elected or not. Obviously there are huge concerns and I have met numerous students' unions about this. The Bill also requires the union to be recognised by the technological university before it can be defined as a student union. My proposed amendment defines a student union as an independent body democratically elected by the students for the students. It requires that a representative group for students should not have to rely on a TU to recognise it, but on the students who recognise it by voting for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I reiterate what my colleagues said and thank them for speaking in support of my amendment. As it stands, the Bill would lead to the oxymoronic situation where a group would be defined as representing students because the technological university states that and recognises it but an independent body established by students and whose members are democratically elected by students would not be considered representative. We need to strive to protect the students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not accept that. The amendment is needed to protect the students' union as an independent body democratically elected by the students. We cannot allow a situation in which it depends on the technological university to recognise it and have no regard to the fact it can be democratically elected by the students for the students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 13: "In page 13, line 9, to delete "where practicable" and substitute "in so far as possible".Amendment No. 13 seeks to delete "where practicable" and insert "in so far as possible" in its place when it comes to critical thinking and diversity in technological university education. I believe this would strengthen the commitment of the university to contribute to the promotion of the economic, cultural and social development of the State, to respect diversity of value, beliefs, traditions and all other aims listed in subsection 1(K)(iii). It seeks to bring the language of section 9(1)(k)(iii) into line with the language in section 9(1)(h)(ii). I raised this issue at Committee Stage and I would like to thank the Minister. She gave a commitment to engage with me and she did, as did her officials, and I thank her for doing that so constructively. Our amendment simply seeks to ensure that life-enhancing skills, such as analytical, critical thinking and diverse views, are protected and promoted as part of the university experience have a role in wider society. Amendment No. 15, by deleting "or" and substituting "and" in line three of page 14, will ensure that in the formulation of procedures for dispute resolution the technological university must consult with every trade union and staff association recognised by the university.This just tightens up the current language which leaves open the possibility that the technological university could consult with a trade union without consulting the staff association.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 14, line 3, to delete “or” and substitute “and”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 16 will ensure that both students and staff will have their academic freedom protected. This is especially important for doctoral students, who are working on the cutting edge of scientific, cultural, social and technological development and who should feel free from discrimination or pressure to conform. Universities are about more than jobs. They are also about creating hubs for the development of innovative ideas and concepts which advance our world and culture as a whole. International recognition is also more likely to come to a university if it does not put a brain freeze on its students and academics.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá an Comhaontas Glas fíorshásta tacaíocht a thabhairt don Bhille tábhachtach seo. Ar dtús, I acknowledge and welcome the members of the Irish deaf community to the Gallery, including their interpreters and supporters who have campaigned so long for the recognition of Irish Sign Language. I commend Senator Mark Daly, who is with us this evening, on introducing the Bill in the Seanad. He took the initiative, ran with it and secured the support necessary to bring it before the Dáil. This is an important Bill and today is an important day on which we take a crucial step to recognise the basic right to communicate of more than 5,000 members of the Irish deaf community. As a councillor in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown in 2015, I received a letter from a constituent called Wendy Murray who was then the chairperson of the Irish Deaf Society. She asked me to table a motion before the council and I was delighted to do so. It received unanimous support. As has happened here today, each councillor spoke loudly and clearly in turn in support of the motion. It is a privilege to stand in the House and speak to the Bill which seeks to make that recognition a reality. The Irish Deaf Society has stated that the failure to recognise Irish Sign Language by the State puts the health and well-being of deaf people at risk as they often struggle to avail of vital health and educational services. Many of the private and public services so many of us take for granted are inaccessible to deaf people. It is essential that public bodies be required to provide the necessary interpretive services for deaf people. I cannot even begin to contemplate how frustrating it must be for a person who is deaf to engage with a public body. I refer to simple, daily acts I take for granted like contacting a local authority or departmental office which becomes increasingly frustrating for those who are deaf because there is no one on the other side of the counter who can interpret or communicate with them. Irish Sign Language gives thousands of Irish people the invaluable gift of communication. The Irish Deaf Society has campaigned for more than 30 years to have Irish Sign Language officially recognised to ensure equality for deaf people. All those people want is to secure the right to full participation as citizens. The availability of services and information, as guaranteed by law, is the only means to ensure that deaf people have the opportunity to access and participate fully in society. I welcome the Bill, which seeks to ensure that members of the deaf community can participate fully as citizens by legally guaranteeing the right to access information in what is their first, and for so many, only language. The Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, is happy to support the Bill.
