CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	My Department is leading on the programme for Government's key commitment to establish a night-time economy task force. The aim of the proposed task force will be to look at innovative approaches to supporting and developing a vibrant, diverse night-time culture and economy in Ireland, and it is intended that the key Departments, agencies and relevant groups will be represented on this task force at senior level. The task force will build on the work carried out already in the Department in this area, which included a symposium to investigate the possibility of creative nightlife and cultural activity after hours and the establishment of pilot projects in both Cork and Dublin, which intended to provide a more detailed insight into the specific issues facing the development of a night-time culture and to seek wider public views. The task force will examine progress on these measures to date and examine more complex issues, including issues around licensing laws and regulations governing our night-time culture at national and local level. Part of the role of the task force will also be to examine the establishment of night-time culture mayors in Cork and Dublin, a role that some other European cities have already established. We know that many businesses and creative practitioners which depend on the night-time economy are suffering huge losses due to the necessary restrictions caused by Covid-19, and the work of this task force is even more important in this context. The support and co-operation of key Departments, agencies and local authorities will be vital to the success of this initiative, and my Department is writing to them to seek nominations to the task force. As the Deputy said, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish this task force within the first 30 days, and I am happy to confirm that I will be announcing the establishment of this task force next week. The task force will consult and inform the various interested groups who have been involved in the development of this initiative as the work progresses.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To address the issue that the Deputy has raised, the membership of the task force is under consideration, but it is likely to include some key Departments, for example, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Departments responsible for climate action and transport, and for housing, local government and heritage. On licensing, I anticipate that a wide range of public bodies will have a strong role to play in this but the licensing issue will be under the Department of Justice and Equality. That is why I hope we will have An Garda Síochána on the task force. To address transport issues, we will have the Department responsible for climate action and transport represented there. The idea is that the task force will engage with all relevant groups to bring the necessary knowledge in to make it effective.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to say also that I will be recommending that someone from Give Us The Night, who made a detailed submission to us, will be part of that task force. It is my intention to invite them. One of the recommendations in their submission was the expansion of the 24-hour night transport services etc. which the Deputy mentioned. We will be looking at all of those issues. They are complex but we intend to address them and have someone from Give Us The Night on the task force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree that the entire arts community and those who work in it have taken a massive hit. They were the first impacted, and due to the very nature of their activities, they may be the last to return. We need our arts now more than ever. They defines us as a people. Since the advent of the crisis, officials from my Department have been actively engaging with the sector and continuing to engage with the agencies under its remit and other sectoral stakeholders to ensure that there is the greatest level of awareness of the available supports and to ensure that optimal use is made of available resources to best support this sector at this challenging time. On businesses involved in the entertainment industry, such as SMEs and sole traders, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has put in place a comprehensive suite of supports for firms of all sizes, which includes grants, low-cost loans, commercial rates write-offs and deferred tax liabilities. These supports are designed to build confidence, to further assist businesses in the management of their companies, and to allow them to begin to look into the future and start charting a path forward for the weeks and months ahead. The Government has also extended its two universal income support measures for all sectors, and further measures will also be set out in the forthcoming July stimulus, which will build on the existing suite of supports introduced since the pandemic began and will aim to help sustain incomes, boost business and kick-start the various sectors. Furthermore, the Government has committed to bringing forward a national economic plan, to be published alongside the budget in October, which will outline the Government's plans to support the long-term sustainability of the economy. Details of the July stimulus will be announced shortly, but I can assure the Deputy that I am on the Cabinet subcommittee for economic recovery, and I am acutely aware of the pressure facing the sector in light of the public health guidance. They have a voice at Cabinet and a voice on that Cabinet subcommittee. As I said, I am acutely aware of their needs and am pushing for everything in the July stimulus package.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am examining a whole suite of measures because that is what is needed to support this sector. As I have said, my Department has met with a wide range of stakeholders from across the arts and culture sector in recent months. The programme for Government commits to establishing a cross-departmental task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the views of all stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector throughout the Covid recovery and beyond, which in turn will inform the national economic plan.Officials from my Department have met with the live entertainment sector which has sought a range of supports, including an extension of the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, a waiver of business rates and establishment of that cross-departmental task force. I am considering a whole suite of supports for them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I am fighting for a whole range of supports. That specific matter is one for my colleagues in the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Finance. I am seeking all measures to support the community. With regard to online content, it is not enough for people to say we value our artists or they are invaluable to our economy and well-being. We have to pay them for the content, and I am working on a whole range of solutions and have been engaging to see how we can do that. We must, in this context of Covid-19, explore, develop and pay our artists for new platforms to enjoy what they bring to society. As I said, it is crucial our artists are paid for what they provide us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Galway 2020, like so many cultural and artistic organisations around Ireland and, indeed, the world, has been deeply impacted, with a significant number of events cancelled or postponed. On 29 April last, Galway 2020 received approval from my predecessor to re-engage with the cultural partners from the original winning bid for the European Capital of Culture to explore the options for project delivery in the context of the evolving public health situation. On 10 July, following consideration and review, I approved a reimagined cultural programme for Galway 2020. While the reimagined programme is scaled down compared with that originally planned, it will still see more than 350 Irish artists work on the delivery of a range of projects covering the broad spectrum of art forms and addressing the varied sectors of society, including children, youth and older people, the Traveller community, people with intellectual and sensory disabilities and hospital patients. As part of the approval I have made it a requirement that all projects comply fully with public health advice and that all stakeholders remain informed on the evolving public health situation and employ appropriate contingency measures with regard to project delivery. There will also be close monitoring by both Galway 2020 and my Department of the progress on all projects. As the Deputy can appreciate, Galway 2020 has incurred significant reductions in its staffing levels over recent months due to the pandemic, with only seven full-time equivalent staff members remaining. Notwithstanding this, the Irish language remains one of the three central themes of Galway 2020, and seven of the 28 approved projects are either solely in the Irish language or fully bilingual. While I understand it was not possible to retain an Irish language officer, Galway 2020 will be engaging with Irish language organisations on a plan it will devise for the community as part of its delivery of the programme. The Government commitment of €15 million to Galway 2020 remains in place with an allocation of €7.1 million in 2020, of which €2.819 million has been paid to date. As per the terms of the performance delivery agreement between the Department and Galway 2020, funding has been spent on cultural programming, programme production staffing costs and costs associated with the operation of the Galway 2020 volunteer programme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government has committed €15 million to the project. Of this, €6.9 million was paid in 2017 and 2019. A total of €7.1 million is committed for 2020, of which, €2.82 million has been drawn to date. The €1 million balance from the commitment is due for payment in 2021. Galway City Council has committed €6 million in total to the project. A total of €2.2 million of this was expanded during the bid phase, resulting in a commitment of €3.848 million for the delivery phase. A total of €3.117 million of this commitment has been paid to date. As a result of the severe impact on revenue streams of the city council, the future funding situation is uncertain. Galway County Council has committed €3.5 million with an additional €500,000 earmarked for legacy initiatives in the county. Galway 2020 has cash-sponsored commitments of €968,000, with €398,000 paid to date. Having received approval to resume the programme, Galway 2020 will re-engage with all sponsors to establish if they wish to continue with sponsorship in light of the changed environment. Galway 2020 has sold €83,000 in ticketing prior to the Covid-19 crisis. A total of €55,000 has been refunded for cancelled or postponed events. Should the programme resume, tickets will be sold again. Otherwise, further refunds will be issued. It is time-limited but I will get my officials to write to the Deputy on that issue and on the conditions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the Irish language officer, I did not get an opportunity in the previous time I had to address it, and I am very aware that the Gaeltacht is under my remit. I am sure the Deputy is aware that I am genuinely committed to the promotion and use of our native tongue. It is so unfortunate that the Irish language officer, Ms Freda Nic Giolla Chatháin, who was fantastic, has been made redundant due to the financial and operational constraints. I am conscious of that strong Irish language theme and will re-engage with Galway 2020 and discuss this further with the board, because I am genuinely committed to the promotion of Galway. As Deputy Connolly said, it is a bilingual city and I will see what I can do on that.I will get back to the Deputy with further details regarding the two other questions. I will get my officials to write to Deputy Connolly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On 19 June the then Government, having considered the expert public health advice provided by the national public health emergency team, approved the rephasing of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. Apart from some exceptions, most sectors were brought forward to phase 3, which began on Monday, 29 June. Museums, galleries, theatres, concert halls and other cultural outlets could reopen from that date but the current restrictions on a maximum of 50 people at indoor gatherings and 200 people at outdoor gatherings have been extended to 10 August. There is no denying that due to social distancing and public confidence issues, the reopening of live performance and entertainment venues will prove challenging. The Government is committed, in the context of budget 2021, to bring forward a national economic plan setting out our long-term approach to restore employment, and detailing how we will secure our public finances in a world where we must live with Covid-19 while driving our efforts to decarbonise the economy and prepare for the next phases of technological transformation. The programme for Government also commits to establishing a cross-departmental task force to develop a clear approach, informed by the views of all stakeholders, to protect and sustain the arts and culture sector through the Covid-19 recovery and beyond, which in turn will inform the national economic plan. This task force will be established shortly. It will build on additional supports already provided in the form of the increase in Arts Council funding to €100 million this year. The additional €20 million was in line with the recommendations of the expert advisory group to the Arts Council, and of the National Campaign for the Arts' 13 point national arts recovery plan. The additional measures to be announced in the context of the July stimulus will further support employment-intensive activities within the sector. In all of these actions, the Government remains focused on sustaining the arts and culture sector through the challenges posed by Covid-19.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. In the few weeks since I was appointed, I have been concentrating on the July stimulus package to see what supports I can give immediately to the sector, which has been devastated by Covid. In answer to Deputy Duncan Smith's earlier question, I mentioned the commitment in the programme for Government on the night-time economy task force, which will be announced next week. I am working on the art sector task force. In recent months, we have been engaging with a range of stakeholders from throughout the arts and culture sector. Of the €25 million funding, €20 million went to the Arts Council. This is leading to new bursaries and commissions, including supports for freelance artists and those seeking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. I will establish this task force and it is a priority. We have to do it right and engage properly. As I said, the immediate short-term priority for me was the July stimulus package and those supports. I am on the Cabinet sub-committee and I am fighting for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As he pointed out, this is a matter for my colleagues at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Finance. As I have said, I am examining a suite of measures to support the arts sector. We have been particularly focused on the very challenging issue of how live performances can be delivered in the context of public health restrictions. Such opportunities will be important for collective well-being but also from an employment perspective. The contribution the arts and culture make to our society has an economic value and also has a value to our well-being as a nation, so it is a priority. As stated, I am examining a suite of measures. This specific measure is a matter for my colleagues at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and the Department of Finance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes and look forward to working with him and all other Deputies in the House. My Department runs a small-scale local festivals and summer school scheme. Funding available under the scheme is typically capped at €5,000. Full details of the scheme are available from my Department's website. Applications for 2020 closed on 24 April and details of allocations may also be found on the website.There were no applications from County Clare to my Department's 2020 small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme. The Arts Council funds a number of festivals in County Clare under its festival investment scheme. All funding decisions can be viewed on the Arts Council website. The list of festivals that the Arts Council funded in County Clare in 2019, under its programme festival scheme, included funding of €3,000 for the Feakle International Traditional Musical Festival. Also under the scheme, Consairtín 2019, the National Concertina Convention, received €5,000, Ennis Book Club Festival received €25,500, Iniscealtra Arts Festival received €9,500, Killaloe Chamber Music Festival received €16,000, Oidhreacht an Chlair received €3,467 for the Seventh Annual Concertina Cruinniú and Sixmilebridge Folk Club received €5,000 for the Shannonside Winter Music Festival. It is important to note that, under the Arts Act, the Arts Council is statutorily independent in its funding decisions. Therefore, neither my officials nor I have any input into the disbursement of funding. Fáilte Ireland provides support to large-scale festivals and participative events through its national programme. At the start of the Covid-19 crisis, Fáilte Ireland immediately paid 50% of the festivals' agreed funding within the programme. Fáilte Ireland is working with these festivals to establish whether they will go ahead and, where appropriate, helping to develop revised programming. The remainder of the funding will be provided based on these revised programmes. Fáilte Ireland also administers a regional festivals programme and funding has been paid in full to the local authorities. It also runs an innovation programme for new festivals but this programme has been temporarily suspended and no new applications are being considered at present.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the value of local festivals, their links to the community from a cultural perspective and how they can boost the tourism sector and local economies. As I said, many festivals have had to cancel this year's events and we must look at how we can support those types of events in the future. That issue will be examined by the task force. We must reimagine how we do these things. I will ask my officials to engage with the Deputy on the Shannon Heritage sites and answer his question in writing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Deputy that these festivals are part of the unique fabric of rural Ireland. The Arts Council is currently accepting applications for funding under round 1 of the festivals investment scheme for festivals taking place between January and June of next year. There are three bands of funding available: band A provides funding up to €7,000; band B provides funding of between €7,000 and €20,000; and band C provides funding of between €20,000 and €35,000. The closing date for applications for further supports is 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, 23 July. I bring that to the Deputy's attention. The festivals and events industry, and the broader tourism sector, are facing severe limitations and challenges in these exceptional times. Therefore, Fáilte Ireland is working to redefine the scope of the festivals innovation programme into the future. For that reason, the programme has been temporarily suspended and no applications are being considered but that is because we are trying to reinvent how it can be done and improve the scope of the programme.
