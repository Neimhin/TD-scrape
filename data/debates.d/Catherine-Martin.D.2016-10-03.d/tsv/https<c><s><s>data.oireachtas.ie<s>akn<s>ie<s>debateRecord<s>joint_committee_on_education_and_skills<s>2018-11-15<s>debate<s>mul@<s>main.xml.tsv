CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I remind members to turn their mobile phones off when attending committee meetings. It is proposed to defer the private session until the end of the meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode because they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting. Television coverage and web-streaming can also be adversely affected. The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have an engagement with a number of stakeholders on the uptake of apprenticeships and traineeships. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Jim Murray, director of academic affairs and deputy CEO of the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, Mr. Brendan McGinty, chairperson of Skillnet Ireland, Dr. Mary-Liz Trant, executive director of SOLAS and Mr. Phil O'Flaherty, principal officer, further education and training section of the Department of Education and Skills. I will invite witnesses to make a brief opening statement, a maximum of three minutes each, which will be followed by engagement with members of the committee. I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Dr. Jim Murray to make his opening statement. 
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I ask Mr. McGinty to conclude as he has exceeded his time.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	There will be an opportunity to engage further with members.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. O'Flaherty.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take one more set of questions from Deputy Funchion, go back to the panel of witnesses and then come back for another group of three.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Mr. O'Flaherty. He can send any additional information to the other witnesses through the committee.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for the presentations. I note that Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board, WWETB, is developing a nearly zero energy building, NZEB, centre of excellence and Limerick Institute of Technology is working with it to develop the training content for the programme. This will upskill electricians, plumbers, blocklayers and others. It is terrible that WWETB has to fight for money despite the work that it is doing. This is the wave of the future and funding will be necessary if we are to address fuel poverty and improve our energy security.While SOLAS has started new apprenticeships in auctioneering and property services, what actions is it taking to create them in services that improve the quality of the houses being auctioned, rented or sold? Building standards are still under-regulated and inspected, although there is self-certification, while there is a severe lack of trained professionals to do the work required. I know that many of the people who work in the areas of renovation, retrofitting and energy efficiency - the new green areas of the economy - have not been trained in Ireland and must travel elsewhere to acquire that expertise. What is SOLAS doing at regional level to upskill in and support the retrofit sector? What is its policy in that area? Has it started to build on the pioneering work of Waterford and Wexford ETB in the area of retrofitting, especially considering the requirement to meet current and incoming EU energy efficiency and NZ targets? I note that the action plan to expand apprenticeship and traineeship in Ireland 2016 to 2020 includes a target to have 67 apprenticeship programmes in place by the end of 2020 in new industry areas. There is a clear upward trend, but are we preparing the apprentices for the reality of our changing economy and where we need to go? Regarding the €120 million allocated for apprenticeships in 2018 and the €34.6 million allocated for traineeships to 2020, what is the breakdown in terms of how much has been invested in climate mitigation or adaptation measures, including energy efficiency measures, as compared to the level of investment in fossil fuel employment? I believe there is talk of the European Social Fund which funds the new apprenticeship and traineeship fund being used to upskill fossil fuel workers in Germany and the Czech Republic. Has the Department approached anyone at EU level or prepared any draft plan for the midlands to avail of such funding opportunities? I am glad to see moves in the right direction towards gender balance, but SOLAS's submission does state the proportion of apprentices who are women is still 1%. I am glad to hear that there is a move to encourage them to move beyond certain areas such as beauty therapy and hairdressing which quite clearly are saturated markets that are vulnerable to cyclical dips in the economy. Care work is also an industry in which there are very poor pay levels and conditions. Is there, for example, an Athena SWAN award equivalent for institutions and businesses in this area? In addition, what departmental actions are being taken in the light of the fact that just 2.75% of apprentices declare a disability? Furthermore, is there an apprenticeship expo? Could this become a compulsory part of the transition year school programme?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I asked for a breakdown to see how much of the €120 million allocated for apprenticeships and the €34.6 million allocated for traineeships in 2018 has been invested in climate mitigation or adaptation measures to achieve energy efficiency. What is the exact policy on the retrofit sector? I refer to the work done by Waterford Wexford ETB in that regard. Is it something that will be addressed many years into the future? That is not where we need to be; rather, we need to deal with it in the here and now. Is there a timeframe for building on the pioneering work done by Waterford Wexford ETB? What is the plan and when will it be implemented? The Irish Green Building Council stated people were not being trained in Ireland in retrofitting, which is appalling. It is the new green economy. Many employees, particularly in the midlands, will need to be retrained and upskilled. What is the plan in that regard?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses very much for coming in today. I was struck by something in Mr. Costello's opening statement which said "The Department is, of course, aware that there is a degree of dissatisfaction with the quality of the service provided by Caranua." There is much more than a degree of dissatisfaction. It was said in a meeting of this committee earlier this year, and I will repeat it, that the State has failed. Worse still, it continues to fail and that is to our shame as a State. Before I ask my questions, I commend and refer to all of those who have advocated and who continue to advocate so courageously for the survivors. They have never given up and they have been so resilient against all the odds. What has been done by the survivors for the survivors has been incredible. My questions centre around the issue of the appeal process. What are the Department's concerns regarding the very different number of appeals granted by the former appeals officers, of which only 8% were successful, and granted by the two appeals officers appointed in April 2017? Under these officers 43% of appeals were successful. How have the officials satisfied themselves that the former appeals officer was not overly harsh, looking at the difference in those statistics? How does the Department explain the very low number of appeals submitted by applicants to the fund? There were 399 over three years. Is the number low because of Caranua's failure to tell applicants they could appeal, which is again a symptom of poor communication? Considering the very high number of appeals won by applicants since 2017, how has the Department ensured that Caranua's refusals are fair and in line with the Act, particularly as we have reports of this not being the case?  Similarly there have been allegations of abuse of the appeals process on the part of Caranua, for example the introduction of new reasons for refusal once the appeals process has commenced and refusals on grounds not contained in the Act or in the criteria. Is the Department aware of these allegations? If yes, what has it done to look into them? Has the Department ever seen a list of the reasons given by Caranua in the determination letters or further reasons for refusal only being given after the appeals process commenced? If the Department has not seen the letters, perhaps it would like to ask to do so and to consider that information.  We have also heard of several applications for services made in 2015 by applicants who have serious disabilities, who urgently need help, and who are still waiting. In these cases we believe Caranua initially refused to issue a determination letter and then only agreed to issue the letter 12 months later, after investigation by the appeals officer. The applicants were then refused the services. The applicants successfully appealed in 2017, having waited 18 months for the appeal decision, or still have not been provided with the service. Is the Department aware of these particular applications? Does it have any information on them? Is that the case? I believe some applicants who were recently interviewed on radio are now considering legal action. It is estimated that the cost of these cases could exceed €500,000 and that this money might well come out of the fund. Has the Department received reports of this? If the cost was to come out of the fund, at what stage would the Department step in to prevent the fund suffering such losses? What does the Department think of such cases and what do they tell us about the operation of the fund by Caranua? What can we, as a committee, and the Department do to improve matters for survivors in the time the fund has left? The service really has failed to provide survivors with a service.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I want clarification on a matter. It was said that the Department had no details on the survey that showed 90% positive feedback and that we had to contact Caranua for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It strikes us as quite unusual that there was 90% positive feedback, considering the fact that this is not what we hear. Has it not struck the Department as a little bit strange? The Department has a role in oversight and accountability in matters relating to governance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the freefone number available from a landline and is it free from the UK? I believe 40% of the survivors are in the UK. Is it free from a mobile or just from a landline?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is something we need to establish.
