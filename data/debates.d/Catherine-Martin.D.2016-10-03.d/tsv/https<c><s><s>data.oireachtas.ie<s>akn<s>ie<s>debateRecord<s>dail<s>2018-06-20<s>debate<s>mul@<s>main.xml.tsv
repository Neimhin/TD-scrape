CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Due to President Donald Trump’s Administration’s zero tolerance border policy, all people crossing the US-Mexico border illegally, even those seeking asylum, face criminal prosecution. The US Department of Homeland Security claims that between mid-April and May of this year it has separated nearly 2,000 children from their parents after they crossed the Mexico border into the US. That equates to 65 children being split from their parents each day for the past six weeks. More than 100 of these children were under the age of four. Parents were told that their children were being taken for a bath or being taken away briefly for questioning. It took hours for parents to realise their children had been taken away indefinitely. One father died by suicide in a detention cell the night after his three year old child was physically ripped out of his arms. One mother had her child taken from her while she was nursing and she was placed in handcuffs when she tried to protest. Children are being held for weeks and months in cages and there are reports that parents who choose to return across the border cannot find their children. None of these children in Trump’s America will have a parent with them to protect them from the sickening reality of being caged en masse, alone and terrified, sleeping under foil blankets in a foreign land for months, if not years, on end. The only crime their parents committed was to try to escape from persecution and poverty and make a better life for their children. We have all heard the audio clip of children in a US Customs and Border Protection facility obtained by ProPublica. We have heard the children crying, in terrible distress, calling out for their parents and we have heard border patrol agents joking and laughing at them. The cries I heard on that clip, the young cries of "Mama" and "Papa", will haunt me as they will haunt us all. As a mother, it is haunting and truly frightening to hear these cries, the cries of frightened children, some no more than four years old, calling for their parents, aunts or relatives, alone, abandoned, surrounded by unfriendly faces in an unfriendly country and treated without dignity, respect, compassion or the most basic forms of human decency. There are no words strong enough to condemn the despicable actions of an Administration that would be willing to do this. This is coming from an Administration whose defence of these actions has been one of wild and fanciful evasion. President Trump has declared that the US is withdrawing from the UN Human Rights Council, calling it a “hypocritical and self-serving” body that “makes a mockery of human rights”and “a cesspool of political bias”. There is absolutely no remorse from this President and no regret for the pain inflicted. The most basic and fundamental aspects of what we term human rights are being eroded in word and deed by an Administration full of hate, bile and vicious anger towards the most vulnerable of human beings. The EU is not blameless or innocent either. We cannot pretend that the EU does not have its own deterrence policies. The EU, including Ireland, is spending €180 million in Libya to deter migrants from making a journey that has drowned thousands in the Mediterranean Sea, including 784 people so far this year alone. The US treats people like cattle, while we in Europe treat them like cargo. Let the US be a warning to us. Let us end direct provision and use our influence here in Ireland to prevent the EU from following further the same poisonous route which comes only to one known end - children in cages and sinking boats labelled as “infestation” by demagogues like Trump.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I watched the summer economic statement of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, with interest yesterday and the soundbites were "prudence" and "realism". We agree that the budgetary process should be both prudent and realistic but when I contrast the priorities outlined in his statement with the Government's approach to a number of pressing issues facing Ireland, talk of prudence rings slightly hollow. The priority for this budget must be to address the crisis in housing, in the rental sector, homelessness, in mental health services, the waiting lists, people on trolleys and the Government's abysmal performance on climate change. If we are to tackle these issues in a prudent manner, the Government needs to accept reality and change course. In housing, how prudent is it to continue to outsource social housing to private landlords instead of implementing a significant public housing programme? It will be €23.8 million more expensive than building houses over 30 years, according to research by Maynooth university released last year. Cost-rental housing would be more affordable for our citizens and could be funded off-balance sheet but the Government continues with an expensive, wasteful, ineffective developer-led housing model and that is not prudent. On the health service or education, how prudent is it to pay for our young people to be trained as nurses, doctors or teachers only for them to emigrate in search of better terms and conditions of work, or for a better quality of life? We then have to spend huge money trying to fill staff positions in the health and education sectors from abroad. That is not prudent. Measures that appear to Government to be prudent in the short term might not be prudent in the long term. On the question of the long term, there is just one mention of climate change in the summer economic statement document. The Government is looking for plaudits for putting €500 million away for a rainy day when our abysmal performance on emissions reductions and climate change means we will be paying that exact same amount in fines for missing our climate change targets, according to a report from Climate Action Network, released earlier this week. That is not prudent. The Government has given up on our 2020 targets but there has been no acceptance of, or planning for, the fact that we are facing enormous fines for non-compliance. Facing up to this fact is a very necessary part of any economic realism and is the prudent thing to do. The Minister needs to provide a comprehensive plan as to how he will account for the money for the significant fines we will face for not meeting these targets. In the report from Climate Action Network, Ireland was ranked second worst in Europe at tackling climate change, ahead only of Poland. Everyone is aware that we are failing in climate change and failing terribly so why will the Government not face up to that reality? We are facing annual non-compliance fines of €500 million if we do not change course. What could we do with that €500 million? We could cut all public transport fares in half for all services on Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann. The money could build one new Luas line every year and we could have a Luas in Galway, Cork and Limerick with three years' worth of climate fines. Some 20,000 homes could be retrofitted every year with €500 million, the western rail corridor could be reopened, or 125,000 hectares of our degraded bogs could be restored or rewetted. Those projects are huge but they illustrate the scale of the fines we face unless the Government changes tack on climate. I do not doubt the Minister's commitment to prudence and realistic budgeting but perhaps his Government colleagues have not got the message yet. There is an enormous contrast between his statement yesterday and the actions of the Government. If he is preaching prudence, the Government needs to change tack in a range of areas. I hope to see that change of approach as soon as possible.
