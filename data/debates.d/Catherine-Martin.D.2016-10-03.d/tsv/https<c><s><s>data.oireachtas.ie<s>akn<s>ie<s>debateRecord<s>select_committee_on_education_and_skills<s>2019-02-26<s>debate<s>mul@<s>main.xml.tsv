CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I nominate Deputy Thomas Byrne.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is the first time we have done it that way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In fairness, it is the first time we have ever done it that way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was waiting for the Minister to finish.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have not agreed with it. The Acting Chairman is completely changing the way in which the Select Committee on Education and Skills is run.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We might discuss this issue in private session, but I raised my hand at the exact same time as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan and as high as she did-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assumed the Acting Chairman would see me doing so.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will leave the matter of the way the meeting is being run and others until we go into private session, but I request that we be given time to discuss them. I thank the Minister for his statement. As we are dealing with the programme that covers salaries, I will call out the elephant in the room - pay inequality. I am aware of the ruling of the European Court of Justice in recent weeks. I would say the Government was pleased with it. On the issue of age discrimination, it indicated that it was based more on the date of entry into a position, but that is a technicality when we all know that the vast majority of new entrants are young people. It is young teachers who are continually being sold out. The arrangement worked out by the Government in September which will take effect soon does not address the fundamental underlying issue, that is, the concept of equal pay for equal work. Unlike his predecessor, I ask the Minister to recognise that principle. Yesterday I read with interest the news of the job-sharing scheme for teachers. Perhaps it is a necessary move, but it fundamentally misses the point as to why over 90% of schools are struggling to recruit teachers. The reason is pay discrimination. One cannot have partial equality, which is what seems to be envisioned by the Government's approach. One cannot have a situation where everyone is equal but some are more equal than others. That is how young teachers feel. Therefore, I really urge the Minister to commit to recognising the principle of equal pay for equal work. Recruitment and retention are issues because of the cost facing graduates of pursuing a two-year professional master's in education degree.They are also a problem because of the working conditions, the initiative overload, with document after document and change after change coming in, the quality of resources, the facilities in the schools, the need for a supplementary panel and, needless to say, the class sizes. Another point is the superannuation section under this heading. In recent years we have approved substantial Supplementary Estimates every year to deal with unexpected expenditure and every year we bring this up. Has the Minister managed to sort out this anomaly? I would be grateful if he would provide an update on plans to develop a sustainable superannuation forecasting and funding model and a timeline for its completion. Deputies Jan O'Sullivan and Thomas Byrne brought up the issue of PE halls. I know the Minister said he was conscious of the fact that there is weak infrastructure. I would like a little more light shed on this because since my election to the Dáil, I have asked for an audit of all schools so we can establish exactly how many schools do not have PE halls. However, every time I table this question there is a refusal to answer it. Yes, there is one in my constituency but there are others. I just do not understand how PE can be rolled out fairly and equally when there are students without PE halls, so I ask again for that audit. I welcome the funding being allocated to well-being, following our own report on positive mental health in schools, including the funding for ten additional education psychologists. Does the Minister have plans to increase these numbers in the future? Finally, while the Minister is here, I wish to bring up the recent call for geography to be restored as a core subject in the junior cycle curriculum. I welcome that he is reviewing the dropping of history. I really plead with him to review the decision to remove geography as a core subject too. We have students outside Leinster House every Friday. We have a movement for climate strike across the world led by Greta Thunberg on 15 March. Our students get it. Geography is crucial in educating our students on one of the most urgent issues facing humankind, and it is shocking that this Government would move to remove geography as a core subject. I ask the Minister to reconsider, as he did with history, the removal of geography and to please restore it as a core subject.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Towards equality.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	How many second level schools in Ireland do not have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Minister want to close the door on a review?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister is not shutting the door on it. I would appreciate if he would say that he is not shutting the door on it. It is very important for our students. The Minister spoke about the people he met on the street talking about history and 2016. In view of everything that has happened around the world, and apart from climate change, where we situate ourselves as a country and the context of everything that is happening around us, it is essential. The Minister will hear those conversations as well. If he hears them, is he open to a review?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister should listen to the conversations that are happening every Friday on Kildare Street outside Leinster House among our students. They have had the opportunity to study geography as a core subject and they are very well informed on what is happening around the world. I ask the Minister to listen to our students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In November 2018, the number of female apprentices surpassed the 2018 target, which was 300. It stood at 323. This is good news and very welcome. I would be grateful if the Minister will comment on how this came about. What plans does he have to reach the ambitious target for 2019 to double this and bring the number of female apprentices up to 600? The increase in the national training fund levy is maintaining a substantial surplus that will go to the human capital initiative from next year until 2024. I appreciate that this is still a year away, and Brexit will occur between now and then, but does the Minister have information on how exactly the initiative will operate?On subhead 5, SOLAS and further education grants, the number of apprentices and trainees has doubled since 2016 from 6,000 to over 12,000, yet the combined allocation has only increased by 9%. Can the Minister elaborate on this?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We see a scenario where the amount spent on higher level education is not enough to sustain the sector and it is reaching crisis point. The State currently spends just over half of what it spent in 2008 on each full-time student equivalent. We are only two years away from the Cassells report's first major benchmark in 2021, which is the requirement to provide an additional €600 million in annual spending from 2015 to 2021 to bring the overall spending up to €2.4 billion. We still await an economic analysis on the report. How does the Minister plan to deal with the impending funding gap? Many institutions are already experiencing the consequences, which will only get worse until action is taken. Subhead C16 refers to capital expenditure. The increase of more than 200% in the funding allocation over the past year is welcome. To which projects will this funding be allocated? I ask the Minister to elaborate on the allocation. On the equality budgeting objectives for the Athena SWAN award, what percentage of all State funded third level institutes are involved? How many or what percentage of them applied? What measures are being taken to promote the award? What percentage of school leavers have disabilities? Is there a disparity in the percentage leaving school and those going on to third level? What is the current percentage of women in senior academic roles?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Did we not deal with the issue as part of subhead B?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to Athena SWAN, there is reference to eight State-run institutions. What is the percentage of this of all State-funded institutions?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What is being done to promote it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister. I meant to thank him as I received the answers to the questions he did not get to answer on his previous appearance before the committee. I appreciate him following through on that.
