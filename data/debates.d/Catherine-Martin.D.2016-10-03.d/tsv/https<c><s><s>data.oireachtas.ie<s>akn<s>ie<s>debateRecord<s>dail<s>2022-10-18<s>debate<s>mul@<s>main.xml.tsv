CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move:That it be an instruction to the Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media on the National Cultural Institutions (National Concert Hall) (Amendment) Bill 2022, that pursuant to Standing Order 187, the Committee has power to make amendments to the Bill which are outside the scope of the existing provisions of the Bill in order to increase the aggregate amount of liability from £150,000,000 to €1,600,000,000 in respect of undertakings of cultural objects on loan from outside the State; and to change the consequential amendment of the long title to reflect the content of the Bill, and make other consequential amendments required to take account of the changes above.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a second time." The National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industry. Section 24(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003 gives me, as Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) sets out the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming that the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of 2022. No further voted capital funding can then be advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I put the Bill before the Dáil to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. Before speaking on the further details of the Bill, I would like to outline the significant contribution and importance of the tourism sector to Ireland's overall economic performance and the progress made in recent times. As the House will be aware, this country has been extremely successful in turning the warmth of the Irish welcome and the beauty of the Irish countryside into a success story that we can all celebrate and be proud of. Tourism is Ireland's most important indigenous labour-intensive sector, generating substantial export earnings and tax revenues. It is woven into the fabric of Irish cultural and social life and is of critical importance to regional economies, in particular.  The contribution of tourism is not confined to directly generated employment, economic activity and exports. The sector has an important multiplier effect on other employment sectors, such as agriculture, transport, retail, food and beverage, which are particularly important to regional economies. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad, generating a positive impression of Irish people and our landscape and culture for our visitors. The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on the tourism industry. As we rebuild this vital sector, we must build it back in a way that ensures the contribution of the tourism sector to our economic recovery and provides sustainable employment across Ireland in a way that protects our unique environment. Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges remain, from geopolitical to economic. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for the remainder of 2022 and 2023. Budget 2023 has secured continued additional funding of €15 million for overseas marketing of Ireland as a leading holiday destination and the development of the invitation project. Domestically, continued additional funding of €15 million will deliver a range of measures to support the sector. The Government also announced a temporary business energy support scheme which will support businesses, including those in the tourism sector. In budget 2022, the tourism budget included a large capital allocation of €35 million to Fáilte Ireland for tourism product development. This level of capital investment will continue in 2023 as budget 2023 has also provided for funding of €36.5 billion. Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise our ambition to be among the world leaders in sustainable tourism. My Department has initiated the development of a new national tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to set out a path for the coming years which will support a sustainable recovery in the sector. This new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable development in communities throughout the country, while protecting our environment and natural resources and with a greater spread of demand across the year. As a significant proportion of tourists are drawn to attractions and participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland offers a range of support to help tourism providers across the country to maximise their individual and collective offering in a way that attracts and engages tourists and enhances their overall experience. Accordingly, Fáilte Ireland's capital investment in tourism product development is further enhanced by complimentary programme supports, including for festivals and events, business supports and training, and marketing and promotions aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the overall tourism offering. Ultimately, in addition to enhancing the overall visitor experience for the benefit of visitors, the intention is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable development through increasing the geographic spread of visitors, promoting season extension and supporting sustainable growth management. A highlight this year has been the redevelopment of Avondale House and Forest Park. This €16 million project, in partnership with Fáilte Ireland, Coillte and EAK, has transformed Avondale into a unique family attraction and a key new destination in Ireland's Ancient East. It opened this summer and will be a vibrant destination for domestic and international tourists. Avondale Forest Park is also open to visitors to explore and enjoy the established walking and cycling trails, orienteering courses and recreation area. Beyond the Trees Avondale won the tourism and hospitality project of the year award at the Irish Building and Design Awards last week.  In addition to funding provided under the Platforms for Growth approach to large grants schemes, Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences in Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments. The strategic partnerships include entities such as Waterways Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Rural and Community Development.The regional strategies are currently undergoing a public consultation and they will set out a ten-year vision and five-year action plan for each region. At a more local level, these four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans, DEDPs, developed by Fáilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders including local authorities, local development companies, relevant State agencies and local community groups and tourism industry representatives. Fáilte Ireland plans to have a total of 27 DEDPs live by the end of this year. By 2025, every part of the country will have a destination development plan that is appropriate to its level of tourism maturity. There are four regional tourism experience brands in total covering the entire country and these are as follows: the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Dublin and Ireland's Hidden Heartlands. One of the guiding principles of my Department is to deliver high-quality tourism experiences that exceed our visitors' expectations but in a manner that minimises any negative environmental or community impacts. As custodians of our natural landscape, waterways and oceans and of our historic and cultural assets, we will protect them for the next generation. I look forward to these future generations enjoying all that Ireland has to offer. The Government is committed to continuing to support and strengthen the tourism sector which plays such a vital role in our locality and wider society. I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill in detail. The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord Fáilte Éireann and the Council for Education, Recruitment and Training, CERT, and establish the national tourism development authority, Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(1) of that Act gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine. Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises. However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process. This limit on total capital funding was originally set at €65 million but was later increased to €150 million and then €300 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Acts 2011 and 2016. Taking into account the 2022 capital allocation to Fáilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital projects is now approaching that limit. Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to Fáilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects. Accordingly, it is now prudent to legislate for an increase in the limit. I am introducing this Bill to make the necessary legislative change. I commend the Bill to the House.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Name the towns.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabhail leis na Teachtaí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht seo agus a chuir a dtuairimí faoi fhorbairt fhoriomlán thurasóireacht na hÉireann in iúl. I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate and offered their views on the overall development of Irish tourism. It is proof of the importance of the industry, which reaches into all parts of the country, both rural and urban. Many of them have been named in the last 30 minutes in particular. Tourism is a valuable source of employment for many thousands of people. I have no issue with towns, communities and regions. If there was ever an appropriate moment to name our areas, it is during a debate on tourism, so it is to be welcomed. There is no time for me to name all the places in Dublin Rathdown and County Monaghan so I will not elaborate.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the last two years have been most challenging for the tourism sector and we are facing into another demanding year with cost inflation and rising energy prices. Many issues have been raised during this debate. I do not know if ten minutes will suffice to address them but I will attempt to do so. If I do not respond to any Deputy, I will ask my officials to follow up.  Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and Nolan raised regional development, which is at the heart of Fáilte Ireland's remit. The organisation has created four regional brands, namely, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands, Dublin, Ireland's Ancient East and the Wild Atlantic Way. To guide medium to longer range development, I understand Fáilte Ireland aims to deliver four new regional tourism strategies in 2022. These will set out a ten-year vision and five-year action plan for each region. At a more local level, these four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans developed by Fáilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. Fáilte Ireland's focus on promoting the regions has included significant investment into brand-building through individual Keep Discovering campaigns for each of the four regional experience brands as well as media, publicity, digital channels and online sales platforms, and that will continue. Looking forward to 2023, Fáilte Ireland will continue to focus on building the regional brand. It will encourage domestic visitors to visit destinations across the country and through online booking and sales and marketing supports, it will work with the local industry. Deputy Gannon spoke about the development of Dublin as a brand. The Dublin Regional Tourism Development Strategy 2023-27 is the roadmap for the tourism industry and all stakeholders involved in tourism in the region to navigate the current challenges and steer a course towards sustainable recovery and continued success. Over the course of this strategy, in addition to the activation of the Dublin coastal trail and the ongoing implementation of the docklands destination experience development plan, two other DEDPs will be developed, namely, the Dublin City DEDP starting in 2022 and the mountains DEDP commencing in 2023. The night-time economy was also raised by Deputy Gannon and also Deputy Shanahan. It will continue to be supported and developed. That change is coming. Deputy Gannon asked when we will dance again and my answer is we will be dancing more often and much later into the night. That is the plan but the sector needs to be supported and that is why we got €6 million in the budget for the night-time economy and also €7 million in additional capital funding for artists' spaces and climate adaptation. Deputy Gannon also spoke about joined-up thinking. The Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I hosted a meeting before the summer recess attended by officials from my Department, the Departments of Transport and Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as well as representatives from the Garda, vintners' organisations, Give Us the Night and residents' associations. There is, therefore, joined-up thinking on the development of the night-time economy. Deputy Gould referred to the flooding in Cork. I will raise that issue with my Government colleagues and refer his suggestions on Shandon and Cork city to Fáilte Ireland for further consideration. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputies Griffin and Dillon on the value of our greenways. Other Deputies referred to them as well. Deputies Carey and McNamara spoke about Shannon Heritage. I am aware of the proposed transfer of properties, including Bunratty Castle, from Shannon Heritage to Clare County Council. My officials are participating in an independent group, chaired by the Department of Transport, which is examining the issue. While I am of course supportive of any initiative to enhance tourism options in the area, this is ultimately a matter for the Minister for Transport. I will be happy, as requested, to speak to the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Deputy Carey raised the Gathering, which made me think of the other programme for Government commitment. While the tourism sector continues to emerge from the impact of Covid, we will help with further recovery and rebuilding. The programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a new tourism initiative to aid recovery in the sector. This initiative will seek to promote and build on the warmth of our welcome, the beauty of our landscape and the richness of our culture. I secured a €5 million allocation in the most recent budget to continue the development of the invitation initiative which provides an excellent opportunity to advance the recovery in multiple sectors that have been significantly impacted by Covid. I hope to bring proposals to the Government in the near future outlining my full ambition for the project and providing further detail on the work under way. Deputies Nolan and Kelly raised Ireland's Hidden Heartlands. Since its launch in 2018, Fáilte Ireland has been working with the local authorities, other State agencies such as Tourism Ireland and the tourism industry to raise awareness of the new Hidden Heartlands brand and to grow the visitor economy. Tourism Ireland promotes the Hidden Heartlands directly to overseas visitors and the region now features prominently on the Ireland.com website. The local authorities are key partners and Fáilte Ireland has been building partnerships with Waterways Ireland, Coillte, Bord na Móna and the Office of Public Works to optimise the tourism potential of their natural and heritage assets in a sustainable manner. Recent highlights included the launch of the tourism master plan for the Shannon, which saw €2.3 million invested by Fáilte Ireland in two new projects last year alone.Some €3.9 million was invested in the revamped National Famine Museum in Strokestown Park, which I had the honour to open last week. Deputy Shanahan raised issues regarding docking. I think that is a matter for the Minister for Transport and his officials. In response to Deputy Dillon, I know Fáilte Ireland is very active in Mayo. The Deputy referred to a number of projects. Fáilte Ireland will continue to focus on their continued development. Deputy Paul Donnelly raised a specific issue which I will ask my officials to raise with Fáilte Ireland. That might be under the remit of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Deputy Tóibín raised Moore Street, which is also a matter for the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, since these are heritage functions. I will raise the issues Deputy Tóibín brought up during this debate with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. In response to Deputy Shanahan, two sites, Ardmore and Tramore, have been selected under Platforms for Growth 2. I will ask my officials to raise any issues regarding accessibility and inclusivity with Fáilte Ireland. I will ask my officials to discuss with Fáilte Ireland the issues that Deputy Mattie McGrath raised during the debate. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae did fine promotion of the Killorglin area, Killarney and the entire region of Kerry. He was followed by Deputies Michael Collins, Christopher O'Sullivan, Danny Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Carol Nolan. A plethora of fantastic promotion of Ireland was captured in the debate. Well done to the Deputies. The sentiment, as mentioned by Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, is that once visitors see what we have to offer, eat our food, meet the people, hear the music and see us dance, they will come back. That is why marketing is important. I am pleased to inform Deputy Munster that support of almost €500,000 was awarded to Louth County Council for the Drogheda destination town plan to implement an access and orientation plan. Regarding the Drogheda attraction of scale, the Ancient Destination Experience Development Plan identifies Drogheda as a key urban gateway to the ancient story of the Boyne Valley with the potential to be a tourism destination of scale. The project addresses the need for a sustainable world class visitor attraction to act as a catalyst to increase visitor footfall. Deputy Tóibín, as well as maybe Deputies Ó Murchú and Munster, talked about the Boyne Valley too and the reimagined Boyne Valley drive. That is a catalyst project in the implementation of the Ancient Destination Experience Development Plan. It involves reviewing and reimagining the Boyne Valley drive. That project roadmap is completed and includes an action plan for delivery. Its key output is the reimagined Boyne Valley drive. I told the Leas-Cheann Comhairle I would not get through all of the issues raised. I have noted them and we will get back to all Deputies about the numerous issues. Numerous Deputies mentioned the VAT rate. I am conscious that the reduced VAT rate has been an important element of the business supports secured for the tourism and hospitality sector in the last two years. The Government will continue to monitor tourism recovery and keep all supports, including the VAT rate, under review in that context. I am acutely aware of the incredible pressure that these businesses face.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move:That the Bill be referred to the Select Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media pursuant to Standing Orders 95(3)(a) and 181(1).
