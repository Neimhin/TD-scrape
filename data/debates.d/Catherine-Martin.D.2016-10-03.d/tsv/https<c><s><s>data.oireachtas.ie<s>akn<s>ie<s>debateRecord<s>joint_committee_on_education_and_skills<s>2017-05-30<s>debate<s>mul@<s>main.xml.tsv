CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all the witnesses for their presentations today. I agree with those who said that "service provider" is not a way to describe schools. It is a huge disservice to what happens in schools across the country. Is áthas liom go bhfuil áiseanna aistriúcháin againn inniu agus gur féidir le Mr. Ó hEagra a chur i láthair a dhéanamh i nGaeilge. Cinnte, aontaím leis nach bhfuil go leor acmhainní sna scoileanna agus go bhfuil a lán príomhoidí ag obair gan lár-bhainistíocht chun tacú leo. An gcreideann Mr. Ó hEagra gur chóir do dháltaí suí ar na boird bainstíochta sna scoileanna? Ms Salmon of the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, ACCS, recommended inserting a new paragraph which would say that "Parents will co-operate with the Parent and Student Charter and recognise their responsibilities to be active and involved in their child’s education." How does she envisage schools dealing with parents in scenarios where, unfortunately, parents are either unwilling or uninterested in getting involved? How can parents be made to co-operate without their lack of co-operation having an adverse effect on their child?  I note Ms Salmon is not in favour of having students on boards of management. Surely it is possible for student members to be recused from certain areas, such as issues of discipline and so on, while at the same time having a valuable contribution. I am aware that there are student councils and active student voices within our schools but unfortunately, due to the squeeze on middle management, many schools do not have a student council staff liaison officer. It is a very important role. That essential staff member, who holds the hand of the student council at the very beginning, is absent. Indeed, even in some of Ms Salmon's own schools the principal is acting as that co-ordinator. Therefore the student councils are suffering and their voice might not be heard with the strength it could be.  Does Ms Salmon believe it is time to review how boards of management are formed? I am aware that in many schools after local elections, for example, there is a scramble for whatever political party that got the majority to get onto the boards of management. Does that necessarily put the right people on the boards of management, when they do not have experience in the field of education or in services for children? They are chairing interview panels for teachers when they have absolutely no educational experience. The student teacher who has just qualified sometimes has more experience than the person who is chairing the panel, who is sometimes just there because he or she is from the right political party at the right time. That same question applies to all witnesses across the board. Where that is happening, do we need to review our boards of management to make sure they are working properly for our students and for our schools? As Deputy Jim Daly said, some parents feel some schools in certain places are closed shops and parents who want to get on boards, cannot.  In respect of the boards of management again, I see that Educate Together has second level students on the boards. Will Mr. Rowe expand on how this works and what he feels is most effective about it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I was playing devil's advocate.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that the recipe for the best person? Undoubtedly some great people make it onto the boards but it comes down to politics, which is what I was querying. The board of management has to deal with who it gets. Sometimes they are brilliant. I was wondering if that has to be reviewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I acknowledge that. The work that schools do to encourage parents is never acknowledged. It is under the radar but I am aware that it happens.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I apologise for having to leave after I ask my questions but I will look at the answers later. It states in the submission that the processes for which Caranua has time standards are met at an average of 90% of the time. Can Ms Higgins give us an idea of which processes these are and how Caranua comes up with these time standards? It also states that the number of complaints received was small compared to the volume of interactions relating to applications. In an article in The Irish Times in March, Ms Higgins was quoted as saying that "some applicants will never be happy" and "You can't control people's experience of what we do for them". She went on to say, "It's never going to be enough to satisfy them and make them feel cared for, loved, honoured or whatever else". Does she accept that the language she used is highly regrettable? These are survivors in their twilight years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The language is of huge concern, considering Ms Higgins's role. The survivors are in their twilight years and have already been appallingly treated by the State. Such language does a huge disservice to them. I find it hard to believe the contention in the submission that Caranua is unaware of the reports of dissatisfaction on the part of many people in their dealings with the organisation, when these reports have been made available to the general public. Caranua means "new friend" but survivors feel there is no friendship in the organisation. Why did the management implement the prioritisation policy and how did it believe it could be justified under the legislation? What was the rationale for a general policy which put all reapplicants, whether they have been awarded small or large sums, into the same deprioritisation category? Surely the board's primary function is to accept process and to determine applications. Caranua sent out 2,500 letters on foot of this policy from November 2015. Do the people involved have a right to appeal? Did the organisation inform them of a right to appeal? In September 2016, Caranua accepted that this was an oversight on its part but it has done nothing to deal with the issues. How many of the 2,500 people involved has Caranua written to? Does it intend to contact all of them to clarify their rights? How exactly did Caranua come to the figure of €15,000 as a limit?
