CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá áthas orm a bheith anseo inniu chun moladh maidir le meastachán forlíontach do mo Roinnse a chur i láthair. D’úsáidfí an maoiniú seo go príomha chun fóirdheontas a thabhairt do chostais mhéadaithe fóntais agus mhaireachtála d’eagraíochtaí nach féidir leo leas a bhaint as tacaíochtaí cothrománacha eile atá á dtairiscint ag an Rialtas faoi láthair. Luaigh an tAire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe, An Teachta Michael McGrath, na hábhair bhreise seo agus é ag labhairt ar Lá an Bhuiséid. Ó shin i leith, tá m’oifigigh agus mé féin ag obair leis an Roinn sin chun bailchríoch a chur ar ghnéithe teicniúla na tacaíochta breise. The proposed 2022 Supplementary Estimate totals €53.61 million, resulting in a 2022 Revised Estimate total for my Department of €1.27603 billion. This comprises €35 million for the sports programme area, about which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will address the committee in detail. It also provides €15 million for RTÉ in line with the recommendations of the Future of Media Commission report. The proposed additional allocation of €15 million to RTÉ is to give effect to the Commission's recommendation, which was informed by the Commission's detailed examination of RTÉ’s financial situation and interim funding requirements. In terms of the culture and arts area, it is a well-established principle of public finance that, where possible, the requirement for additional support be first met within a Department's existing allocation, before seeking further funding to the Vote. Accordingly, I have reallocated savings within the Culture and Arts programme area to address the current operational pressures for the national cultural institutions, Screen Ireland, other cultural bodies supported by the Department and bodies supported through the Arts Council. This will be achieved by technical supplementary, details of which are contained in the committee's brief today. In summary, €15.54 million will be reallocated from savings in the basic income for the arts and live entertainment support areas. These savings arise in the basic income for the arts as it was rolled out later than anticipated due to the high volume of applications, with over 9,000 applications requiring review and assessment.I am happy to report that payments began in October and it is expected that up to €12 million will be paid to artists under this scheme by year-end. In the live entertainment area, savings arise due to the full reopening of the live entertainment sector on 22 January, sooner than anticipated, which allowed for 100% capacity for live events, with a removal of the requirement for vaccination or recovery certificates for access to venues and the reopening of nightclubs. This significantly changed context and provided the sector with an opportunity to generate box-office income. Accordingly, many grantees submitted revised and adjusted drawdown requests yielding savings under certain schemes. It should be noted that the measures put in place to support stakeholders in the live entertainment sector this year followed extensive consultation on the supports required and all eligible demands under those schemes was met in 2022. Additional funding will be provided to address increased utility costs in the cultural area as follows: €8.76 million in respect of cultural bodies under the aegis of the Department, spread across the various relevant subheads; €5 million in respect of arts and culture organisations to be administered by the Arts Council; and €1.78 million in respect of cultural organisations, including a number of regional museums, which are supported directly by the Department such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, the National Print Museum, the Cork Butter Museum, and the Hunt Museum. This additional funding will be provided from savings within the culture and arts programme in 2022 from subheads B16, €12 million, and B17, €3.54 million. As I mentioned earlier, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will address the committee on the additional allocation for sport. The remaining €3.61 million is accounted for in the context of increased pay across my Department and agencies arising from the Building Momentum public sector pay agreement. There is no direct request for additional funding in this Supplementary Estimate request in respect of the tourism programme in my Vote as it is anticipated that the universal supports to be provided under the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, will address the needs of this sector. The world has been impacted by global challenges, including the invasion of Ukraine, global inflation, and climate change. The Government has recognised the impact of the current situation through a number of horizontal measures designed specifically to protect the most vulnerable in our society as we face into the winter. There are also increased measures to support business and industry. Bodies supported under the cultural and sporting programme areas of my Department cannot avail of most of these supports, but given their direct and ancillary benefits to employment and the economy, physical and mental health and well-being, societal development and cohesion, it is appropriate for Government to support organisations in these areas. Let us not forget that during the worst of the pandemic, culture, sport, and media played a particular vital role in helping us find joy in the darker times. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as éisteacht linn agus labhróidh mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, anois maidir leis an maoiniú breise don spórt.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I outlined earlier, the repurposing of those savings of €12 million is a result of enormous demand and our determination to ensure the scheme will work and will be accepted by the sector. The savings from the scheme will benefit artists. Among the purposes for which the savings are being applied is the payment of €5 million to the Arts Council, which will offer supports to organisations that received support under strategic funding, arts grant funding or arts centre funding in 2022. The operation of these organisations is a critical support for artists and this funding will mean that resources which would otherwise have been diverted into meeting increased energy costs will now be available to support artists to make work and to present that work to audiences. Further savings will be applied to meet the needs of national cultural institutions to support regional museums and organisations such as Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann which play such an important role in nurturing and promoting our traditional arts. Subhead B17 refers to live entertainment supports. In 2021, almost €54 million was awarded in grants to support the live entertainment sector as a targeted response to the Covid-19 restrictions which had obvious impact of stopping performers from performing. A further €50 million was provided for the live performance sector in 2022. That funding, along with a suite of measures, was designed to support the recovery of the sector as it fully reopened for live performance. These supports benefit from a specific state aid derogation for measures to deal with the pandemic which ended earlier this year. As with the other pandemic-related supports, these schemes will conclude this year as the crisis period has passed. Support for the arts and culture sector will continue to be provided by the Arts Council, the statutory body responsible for supporting the arts. That funding remains at a record level of €130 million for 2023. We will continue to engage, as we have done, with a broad range of stakeholders across the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors, including those represented on the live entertainment stakeholder forum, to understand the issues facing the industry. We are committed to continuing engagement with artists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I may have said this to the Deputy before on the basic income, but although the full €25 million for it was not spent this year, it is absolutely guaranteed that it is a €105 million programme over three years. It is therefore absolutely ring-fenced. To reassure the Deputy and members, the savings in relation to live entertainment were as a result of the recovery and did not arise as part of an attempt to reduce funding for the sector under any circumstances whatsoever. All applicants eligible under the requirements of each scheme were offered grants in 2022. The return to normal operating conditions allowed the sector an opportunity to generate box office income that in turn reduced the need for State supports. The State aid exemption due to Covid ended in June of this year and I referred to that earlier. I reassure the Deputy the savings were a result of recovery and not an attempt to reduce the funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify in case there is confusion, there is €3.61 million for Building Momentum and that is completely separate from the €15 million for RTÉ.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The €15 million figure arises from a direct recommendation for interim funding from the report of the Future of Media Commission. It is completely separate from Building Momentum. On the Deputy's other query, we spoke on this in the Dáil last week and, as the Deputy knows, I have followed up with another letter because I share his concerns about the pay disparity. I am awaiting a reply on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is €325.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his kind words on the basic income. This was about changing how we value the arts and I hope it is a game-changer in that. Deputy Mythen has been very supportive of it, as have Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Munster and Senator Warfield, and I thank them for that. It is €325 per week and the figure came from artists and their engagement with it. It was the number one recommendation of the report of the arts and culture recovery task force. It suggested the figure of €325 per week and so I held firm to that to deliver what was sought. That came from the engagement with the group. I share the Deputy's hopes. I hope this is a three-year research project as well as the money aspect of it. I am hoping the research will really prove it should be rolled out to all artists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the research element is the key part of this. Maybe the issues the Deputy raises is something that will come out of the research, but I wanted to adhere to the direct, number one recommendation from the artists themselves because they spent a lot of time putting that report together. Let us see what comes out of the research. We will have annual reports on this. There are journals being kept. We already have baseline survey done and we also have the control group of 1,000 too.Let us see what the research demonstrates at the end of the three years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are 500 musicians in the scheme. It is right across the board across the arts sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Two thousand artists are in receipt of the basic income, and 1,000 artists are in the control group. For each year the control group receives two weeks of basic income for participation in the research part of the scheme, and it is important to have that group as well.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas le baill an choiste as an gcuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. I thank the committee members for the invitation to join them. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide the statutory basis to allow the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to increase the aggregate level of funding that may be allocated to Fáilte Ireland out of capital moneys provided by the Oireachtas for tourism product development. The limit on capital funding will shortly be reached and legislation is required to increase that limit. This Bill amends section 24(2) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, to increase the limit on capital funding from €300 million to €500 million, and sanction has been granted by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This limit was increased on two previous occasions, 2011 and 2016, in similar Acts. Tourism is Ireland's most important indigenous and labour-intensive sector, generating substantial export earnings and tax revenues. It is woven into the fabric of Irish cultural and social life and is of critical importance to regional economies in particular. As potential visitors start to think about their next holiday, international destinations are vying for attention in an ultra-competitive market. It is vitally important therefore, that we keep Ireland top of mind for potential visitors and that they know that brilliant visitor experiences, attractions and activities are available to them. That is as important for domestic visitors. Ireland's tourism sector provides a wealth of opportunities for great tourism offerings, and Fáilte Ireland uses this capital funding to support the development and cultivation of those visitor experiences. This year alone, projects in the Céide Fields in Mayo, the Blasket Islands in Kerry, Knowth in Meath, Beyond the Trees in Avondale, and the National Famine Museum in Strokestown have opened. From a strategic perspective, Fáilte Ireland has four main funding channels for its capital investment in tourism product development to support the development and enhancement of tourism attractions and experiences. These include large grant schemes provided under the Platforms for Growth approach; small grant schemes, which are targeted and usually aligned with tourism experience brands; strategic partnerships and other collaborations; and direct investment in experience brand infrastructure. Fáilte Ireland has used Platforms for Growth to drive development in specific areas. For example, using funding provided by Government, Fáilte Ireland has provided €19 million to 20 locations throughout the country for water-based activities, which are a key visitor attraction. Is ceannscríbe é turasóireachta d'ardchaighdeán a chur ar fáil in Éirinn ó cheann ceann na bliana mar gheall air seo go léir. Gabhaim buíochas leis na baill as a gcuid ama agus as an mBille a bhreithniú, rud a bhfuil mé ag súil go mór leis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is something we should look at. The increase to €500 million will satisfy demand for the next few years. Perhaps we should be looking at a different way of doing this. It is something we will examine.
