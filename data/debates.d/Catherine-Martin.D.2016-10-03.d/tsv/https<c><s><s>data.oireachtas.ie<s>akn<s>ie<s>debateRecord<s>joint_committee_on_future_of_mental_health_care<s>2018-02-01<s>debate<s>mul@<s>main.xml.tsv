CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are all aware of the difficulties in recruiting people into the public services. However, the facts and figures presented by Mr. Hughes are of extreme concern. We could hear a pin drop we were all so taken aback. The word demoralising has been used but I would suspect it is heartbreaking for health professionals to work in a situation where they are reduced to saying that a chair is a bed. They are highly trained professionals. If we look at 34% being eligible for retirement in five years, we are facing a mental health time bomb. I refer to 500 vacancies in psychiatric nursing and 1,343 trained nurses and midwives having sought certificates of current professional status because they are going to go overseas. It is incredible. However, if people are working in a system with low pay, appalling working conditions and they are undervalued, why would they stay? They are so valued abroad.  It is obvious that the issue of pay and conditions needs to be addressed and quickly. Do the members of the PNA reference any other barriers or disincentives? I refer to people in Waterford being told that parental or annual leave may have to be suspended. Are career progression, cost of living and work life balance issues that come up? What can be done to address those issues? What services and supports are in place for our mental health professionals? I refer to the stress they face in their working conditions and the burnout they may feel.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is it that they are supposed to get it and do not get it or is it that they are not even assigned that time?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	GPs are the first port of call for patients. The ICGP was before us prior to Christmas and it said the crisis in the Irish mental health care service is also a crisis in general practice. Do the witnesses agree with that? There is constant talk of the need to build up our primary care services but I do not understand how our GPs are going to have the capacity to protect or care for patients who present with mental health difficulties. It was said that GPs aged over 60 now accounted for 30% of the workforce and we do not know if these will be replaced. Before Christmas, we were told there were only 37 GPs in Kilkenny, 38 in Longford and 41 in Kildare and that last year was the first year ever that ten places on the GP training scheme were not filled. We need them but we cannot recruit them, never mind retain them, so what is the solution?
