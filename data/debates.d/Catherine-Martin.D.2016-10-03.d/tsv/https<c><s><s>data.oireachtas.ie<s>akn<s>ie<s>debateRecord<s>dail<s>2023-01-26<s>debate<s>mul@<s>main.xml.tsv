CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The war in Ukraine, combined with the high number of international protection applicants, continues to put real pressure on the Government's ability to offer humanitarian accommodation and has resulted in the largest humanitarian effort in the State's history. The Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth is availing of the wide range of offers of accommodation made to it, including the use of office buildings and sports facilities, to address the accommodation shortfall. These options are necessary to provide shelter to international protection arrivals, to meet basic needs and to prevent homelessness. The Government is focused on how to continue the sustained support for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, including those already here as well as those likely to be further displaced by the ongoing conflict. As part of this, the Government agreed that a move from an emergency response to a more mainstreamed approach, including a reduced reliance on serviced accommodation, is appropriate. This includes an increased focus on rapid-build housing and a new call for vacant homes led by local authorities. I can confirm that the Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid-build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. The rapid-build homes will be constructed on State-owned land. The Office of Public Works, OPW, is leading the development of this accommodation in conjunction with the Department of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. The objective is to install 500 units by March-April 2023. My Department, at the senior officials group on Ukraine, has communicated the potential challenges arising for the tourism ecosystem, particularly in those parts of the country where high proportions of the tourism accommodation stock are directed to humanitarian purposes. The recent report from the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, which called for a reduced dependence on tourism accommodation and a geographically balanced spreading of such usage across the country, is relevant in this context. My officials are engaging with a range of Departments, with input from colleagues in Fáilte Ireland, on how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of long-term use of tourism accommodation. Analysis is being done on those towns or areas most impacted in this regard, with a focus on the sectoral skills at risk and the businesses suffering most from the lack of tourism accommodation. My Department will engage further on that analysis in the period ahead.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have regular interaction with my colleagues in the Government on this issue and have communicated the industry's concerns about the long-term effect this issue could potentially have on our tourism sector, especially, as the Deputy said, with the tourism season really kicking off in March.I meet the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, every week and have discussed the impact of the humanitarian response on tourism with him and other Cabinet colleagues. The Government has approved the construction of rapid-build homes, with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals and family units. These will be built on State-owned land. After a programme of engagement with public representatives and local authorities, work has begun on the first phase of sites in Cork, Cavan, Claremorris, Mallow and Thurles. Following further engagement and the completion of suitability assessment work, further sites will come on stream in the coming weeks. I met the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, in December following the publication of its report on the impact of the Ukrainian conflict. Officials in my Department and Fáilte Ireland meet representatives of the tourism sector monthly. These meetings are hosted by Fáilte Ireland. The hospitality and tourism forum that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, and I will co-chair will meet next week to hear and address concerns.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, there will be 700 rapid-build homes. There will be up to 6,000 beds available in the coming months through the combination of rapid-build homes, the work on vacant homes that is being led by local authorities and the refurbishment work led by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I am in regular engagement with the tourism sector and am fully cognisant of its concerns. I will meet it again through the tourism and hospitality forum with the Minister, Deputy Coveney. We are also concerned about the impact on ancillary businesses. We will consider supports for tourism and hospitality in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for raising the film industry in the week that is in it. This is an opportunity to congratulate Irish people on their Oscar nominations. The annual global spotlight on the Oscars is now shining on Ireland's culture, our beautiful scenery and, most particularly, our creative talent. The House will join me in congratulating the casts and crews of "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin", including Colm Bairéad and the team, Kerry Condon, Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan and Martin McDonagh. I also congratulate other Irish nominees - Paul Mescal, Richard Baneham and Jonathan Redmond - on their nominations. It is a pleasure to be able to name so many Irish people who are making their mark on a global stage. Success breeds success and Ireland is a more attractive location for film-making as a result. I understand that the Deputy is referring to matters raised at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight's examination of section 481. I am aware that the committee has taken evidence from many witnesses and organisations as well as from officials from my Department. As I understand it, many different views were expressed to the committee, with most witnesses underlining the importance of section 481 to the audiovisual industry and to Ireland. I respect and am passionate about the rights of workers, but as I have stated previously, this matter does not fall to my Department. Employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the mechanisms for dealing with disputes - the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. These are the appropriate avenues for complaints relating to employment law. I ask that, if the Deputy is aware of wrongdoing, he please bring that information to the WRC. I understand that the intellectual property issue raised by Equity focuses on the question of whether residuals are paid. This is a matter for consideration by the members of Equity in conjunction with SIPTU. If they so decide, they can enter into negotiation with the organisations and companies that engage them. I wish to bring to the attention of the House that our Oscar-nominated films were made during Covid. They should be applauded for this. Every one of the cast and crew of the films worked under difficult restrictive protocols at all times during production. I am so proud of our film industry today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am just stating a fact that employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as are the mechanisms for dealing with disputes. Regarding the protection of workers, significant changes were made in 2019 to section 481 and how it operated. There is an increased emphasis on upskilling and life-long learning as well as much greater scrutiny. I hope that these changes will ensure that any alleged malpractice prior to 2019 is not repeated in today's audiovisual industry. In addition to those changes, the "Safe to Create" programme that I launched in October provides for a dignity at work framework whereby all workers should have the right to expect a workplace that is free from bullying, harassment, humiliation, intimidation, victimisation and any other negative behaviour. Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, would strongly refute any claim of blacklisting in the Irish film industry. SPI can demonstrate its commitment to its relationship with the unions and is doing additional work in the areas of skills development and training. We are doing whatever we can to protect workers' rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I only have a minute to respond, but I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards if he wishes to bring further issues to my attention.In the application process for the certification under section 481, a producer company and a qualifying company, as defined by the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, are required to sign an undertaking in respect of quality employment and must, as a condition of certification, provide details of any Workplace Relations Commission decisions in relation to a qualifying company, the producer company or other companies in the film group, and, where those decisions are finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed. In relation to the copyright, I repeat that the buyout of contracts relating to intellectual property rights as well as copyright issues in general falls under the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I am aware some witnesses in that committee expressed a view that there should be an agreement between employers and workers in Ireland on whether and when residual payment could or should be paid, but any general agreement on the payment arranged for actors and whether it includes residuals is first and foremost a matter for the trade unions and their members and thereafter dependent on its members' preference as a matter for engagement with employer representatives. I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The latest research by Fáilte Ireland shows that while recruitment is still a significant challenge for tourism businesses, the situation is improving and employers are making positive strides. The number of vacancies across the industry has fallen, from 40,000 at the start of 2022 to 22,000 today. Overall, positions have become less difficult to fill while staff retention has become less difficult too. For employees, hourly rates of pay have improved, compensation for working unsocial hours has become more common and job security among workers has grown. My Department participates in the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Departments and the education sector. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are also working with industry and across government to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.For example, in 2022, my Department and Fáilte Ireland worked closely with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure processing times for work permits were significantly reduced. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have also worked with that Department to increase work permit application success rates by providing information sessions to the industry. In 2023 and the years ahead, my Department and Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with industry and recruitment experts to share best practice guidance on retention and building capability. With regard to working conditions in the sector, Fáilte Ireland's research indicates that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. Around 70% of businesses surveyed indicated they are increasing their pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other benefits. Fáilte Ireland has also launched a new employer excellence programme to help participating businesses to improve their employer practices and enhance their reputation as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of their workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across their businesses. Further initiatives undertaken include a transition year work placement programme to give transition year students a high-quality work placement and a major recruitment awareness campaign called "works for me" to encourage people of all ages to consider a career in the industry. When we look at the wider economy and the particular set of challenges facing the industry, it is clear that a collective and concerted multi-stakeholder approach to tackling these challenges is required, and that is the approach my Department and I will continue to pursue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I co-chair the hospitality and tourism forum. We are convening a meeting next week with all the stakeholders. I suspect the 9% VAT rate will be one of the issues that arises in that meeting. I have made it clear that I am in favour of the extension of the lower rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector. The decision ultimately lies with the Minister for Finance, but I have made clear my position on it. I am acutely conscious of the challenges the sector is facing, including cost inflation and economic uncertainty in key tourism markets. I am also aware our necessary humanitarian response to the war in Ukraine has impacted on the availability of tourism accommodation. I will continue to work with the Minister for Finance and Cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy referred to Duncannon Fort. In December 2022, the Department of Rural and Community Development announced significant funding for Duncannon Fort under the town and village renewal scheme. That is in recognition of the amazing attraction it is. I am acutely aware that the tourism industry supports 250,000 jobs and the vast majority of those are in the regions, outside the capital city. I grew up outside the capital. It is a vital industry in my remit and I am acutely aware of the need to help our towns and village to thrive. I am co-chairing the hospitality and tourism forum with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who, as someone from outside the capital, is aware of the immense value of tourism and the concerns of the wider tourism ecosystem. That is absolutely on our radar and we will do our best to support it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges remain, from geopolitical to economic. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry here in Ireland this year. Though the strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year is very welcome, significant headwinds face the sector in 2023. To assist businesses, including hotels, the Government introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, in budget 2023. The TBESS is designed to support businesses, including hotels, with their energy costs over the winter months and will run until 28 February 2023. The TBESS is administered by the Revenue Commissioners who have designed a special online platform for businesses to register for, and claim under, the scheme. From a tourism perspective, I am continuing to direct significant resources to supporting the sustainable recovery of the sector. I secured €15 million in additional funding for overseas marketing of Ireland. This budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million in continuation of the investment in skills development and retention. This provision will facilitate the continuation of work by Fáilte Ireland to address the employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. My Department and Fáilte Ireland will continue to work with the industry and across Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles. A €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing was also secured to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have secured additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. While the hotel sector faces many challenges, I am confident the supports the Government has put in place will ensure Ireland's hotels are well positioned to maintain current levels of recovery and to grow sustainably in the coming years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy will be aware that I am familiar with the beauty of west Cork. I met him there when my family and I were on holidays. I am conscious of the impact on the wider tourism ecosystem, including the businesses he referred to. As regards the TBESS finishing on 28 February, the Government is discussing what will happen next, the supports that are needed and looking at detailed analysis.We in Ireland are absolutely resolute in our solidarity with and support for Ukraine and we are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war. We have never seen so many people arrive in such a short timeframe as we welcomed the population size of Galway city in under a year. It is time to remember that Irish people have, over generations, sought shelter and opportunities abroad. Ireland has a long history of supporting other nations in times of trouble and this is the right thing to do. My officials are engaging with several Departments, with input from colleagues from Fáilte Ireland, on how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of the long-term use of tourism accommodation. It was never meant to be long term. It was meant to be short to medium term. This is not just from a hotel's point of view but also for the families in the hotels.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I assure the Deputy that the Government did not put such extensive supports in place during Covid for those businesses to close now. My Department and I have extensive and ongoing engagement with the sector. As I said earlier, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I will convene and co-chair the tourism and hospitality forum next week in order to engage and hear concerns. On the 9% VAT rate, as I made clear to Deputy Verona Murphy, I have always said I am in favour of an extension to the lower rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector, that I am acutely conscious of the challenges facing the entire sector and I will be engaging with the Minister for Finance and Cabinet colleagues in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On 1 December last, I approved the allocation of the remaining €1 million from my Department's commitment to the Galway European Capital of Culture programme to support delivery of the programme under the proposed legacy framework. It is expected that the legacy framework will be published on the website of Galway Culture Company, the successor trading entity to the Galway 2020 company, in the coming weeks. The website of Galway Culture Company, which is fully bilingual, has been live since last Monday and sets out the key high-level programme aims and actions under the legacy framework. The €1 million funding from my Department will be broken down to support the delivery of these programme aims as follows: €300,000 to facilitate EU and international relationships and funding, €500,000 to develop and support place-based cultural programming and €200,000 to provide supports to the cultural and creative sector. Galway Culture Company, operating within Galway City Council and led by a board comprising local and regional leaders of organisations with a role and remit in the support of culture and creative industries in Galway, has already commenced work on facilitating EU and international relationships and funding. For example, it has established an ecosystem of EU supports comprising the key agencies on the board of the company. This inter-agency ecosystem is working to share knowledge and co-operate on EU funding applications. It has already been successful in the award of funding for the stimulating performance of ecosystems in creative territories and regional actors, SPECTRA, project under the Horizon Europe programme. This project is being led by the Western Development Commission in partnership with CREW, Atlantic Technological University and Galway Culture Company as well as a number of partners from other EU countries, including Germany, Bulgaria and Denmark.  Galway Culture Company is working to develop the legacy framework of Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture and to build on the learnings and outcomes of Galway's many European and global designations, including European Capital of Culture, UNESCO city of film, European Green Leaf city and European region of gastronomy.  Over the coming months, open calls will commence for projects under place-based cultural programming as well as the development of actions to support and enhance the capacity of the Galway region's cultural and creative sector. Regular updates on all actions and initiatives, as well as relevant EU and international funding opportunities, will be provided on the website of Galway Culture Company.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, of that €1 million, €500,000 will be to develop and support place-based cultural programming, while €200,000 will be to provide supports to the cultural and creative sector. Galway Culture Company is working to develop the legal framework of Galway's designation as European Capital of Culture and build on the learnings and outcomes. It operates within Galway City Council and is led by a board comprising local and regional leaders of organisations with a role and remit in the support of culture and creative industries in Galway. It is the strategic objective of Galway Culture Company to bring together key agencies and stakeholders to drive forward a collective creative vision for Galway through meaningful partnership and collaboration, so creativity is at the heart of that. It will seek to complement the work of the two local authorities in Galway by working with the cultural units in the city and county councils and will assist in the implementation of both arts plans and the cultural strategy. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I looked at the website and if you look at the itemised breakdown of investment in the local cultural sector during the lifetime of the projects, you can see the investment in local arts. The Deputy may be referring to physical infrastructure as legacy. The bid book for Galway 2020 upon which it was awarded the designation of Ireland's 2020 European Capital of Culture set out that any new cultural infrastructure to be delivered would be part of Galway's culture strategy 2016 to 2020, Everybody Matters, which is developed and managed by the local authorities. The bid book also stated that infrastructure was not part of the European Capital of Culture project, which would rely on existing infrastructure and infrastructure that came on stream between designation and delivery through existing plans and developments. Infrastructure is not and never has been part of the direct delivery and legacy of Galway 2020 European Capital of Culture. I am running out of time but I am happy to engage with the Deputy afterwards. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Anuraidh, choimisiúnaigh Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann, in éineacht le Foras na Gaeilge agus le tacaíocht ó mo Roinnse, tionscadal taighde chun an leibhéal spéise i seirbhís raidió Gaeilge dírithe ar an aos óg a fháil amach. Bhí dhá chéim ar leith sa tionscadal taighde. Ar an gcéad dul síos, Iorgadh tuairimí sampla ionadaíoch náisiúnta de dhaoine idir 15 agus 34 bliana d'aois maidir leis an spéis a bhí acu in éisteacht le stáisiún Gaeilge agus lena n-oscailteacht ina leith. Ba é an dara gné ná tuairimí phobal na Gaeilge a fháil maidir lena nósanna fuaime agus meán, an cineál ábhair fuaime, idir Bhéarla agus Ghaeilge, a bhfuil siad ag plé leis faoi láthair agus bearnaí a mheastar atá ann i soláthar ábhar Gaeilge. Cé go raibh sé i gceist an taighde a chur i gcrích agus an tuarascáil a tháinig as a fhoilsiú roimh dheireadh na bliana seo caite, tuigim gur thóg cuid den obair allamuigh níos mó ama le críochnú ná mar a ceapadh ar dtús. Mar sin, níor cuireadh na dréacht-tuarascálacha faoi bhráid an údaráis ach i lár mhí na Nollag. Tuigim gur phléigh coiste comhairleach Gaeilge an údaráis na dréacht-tuarascálacha agus go bhfuil siad á n-ullmhú le foilsiú, rud atá beartaithe a dhéanamh sa chéad leath de mhí Feabhra. Rinneadh an taighde chun an oiread tuisceana agus ab fhéidir a fháil ar an éileamh féideartha ar a leithéid de sheirbhís agus ar an gcineál ábhair a bheadh feiliúnach agus a bheadh ar fáil ar aon seirbhís nua. Cabhróidh sé seo le Coimisiún na Meán aon straitéisí nua ceadúnaithe a mheas mar chuid dá ghníomhaíochtaí rialála craolacháin chun a chinntiú go bhfreastalaíonn raon éagsúil seirbhísí craolacháin ar lucht féachana na hÉireann. Samhlaítear go mbeadh aon seirbhís fhéideartha amach anseo hibrideach chun rochtain a thabhairt ar ábhar ar mhodhanna traidisiúnta FM agus digiteacha nó ar líne araon. Tá sé seo ar aon dul leis an moladh ón gCoimisiún um Thodhchaí na Meán maidir le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar sheirbhísí Gaeilge, go ndéanfaí scrúdú ar rannpháirtíocht na n-óg, cláir óige agus úsáid níos fearr a bhaint as na meáin dhigiteacha. Cuirtear san áireamh ina leithéid de shamhail hibrideach freisin cumas teicniúil teoranta sheirbhís iomlán FM agus baintear cothromaíocht amach idir lucht féachana FM agus níos mó daoine óga ag dul i dtreo seirbhísí agus ábhar digiteach. Tacaím go láidir le níos mó ábhar agus seirbhísí Gaeilge a sholáthar agus iad a chur ar fáil níos leithne, go háirithe do dhaoine óga. Más féidir an cineál seirbhíse seo a chur i bhfeidhm, ba mhaith liom é a fheiceáil ag tarlú. Níl sé i gceist agam tuilleadh plé a dhéanamh ar na sonraí, toisc gur faoi Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann mar an rialtóir neamhspleách atá sé seirbhísí craolacháin raidió a cheadúnú.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar a luaigh mé i mo fhreagra, ba mhaith liom, más féidir, an cineál seirbhíse seo a fheiceáil i bhfeidhm do dhaoine óga ach tá Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann mar an rialtóir craolacháin neamhspleách atá freagrach as seirbhísí craolacháin raidió neamhspleácha a cheadúnú in Éirinn. Is é an t-údarás, agus ní mise mar Aire, a thionscnaíonn an próiseas ceadúnaithe do sheirbhísí raidió. Faoi láthair, tá 22 seirbhís phobail nó sainspéise ar an aer. Nuair a bheidh toradh thionscadal taighde an údaráis againn, beidh sé riachtanach cinneadh a dhéanamh faoin mbealach is oiriúnaí chun an tseirbhís a sholáthar. Mar a leagtar amach sa reachtaíocht, tá próiseas foirmiúil, reachtúil, rialála ann maidir le seirbhís nua a thabhairt isteach, a dhéanann an rialtóir neamhspleách, Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann, agus ní mór dó go leor gnéithe a chur san áireamh, lena n-áirítear na himpleachtaí a bhaineann le cúnamh stáit.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Creidim go bhfuil sé tábhachtach ar dtús an taighde a fhoilsiú agus deis a thabhairt d’ Údarás Craolacháin na hÉireann agus, nuair a chuirfear ar bun é, Coimisiún na Meán, machnamh a dhéanamh ar conas gur féidir eolas a dhéanamh d’aon straitéisí ceadúnaithe amach anseo. Seo cuid den chúis go bhfuil a leithéid de thaighde chomh tábhachtach, ní hamháin chun an leibhéal spéise sa tseirbhís seo a mheas ach chun tuairimí daoine faoi aon bhearnaí sa tseirbhís a mheastar atá ann a fháil amach chomh maith. Tá sé i bhfad róluath labhairt faoi cén tseirbhís a d’fhéadfaí a chur ar fáil sa deireadh, cé a sholáthróidh an tseirbhís sin agus conas a mhaoineofar í, ach is féidir féachaint ar cad iad na tacaíochtaí a cheadófaí agus a d’fhéadfaí a bheith oiriúnach. Bheadh ar thacaíocht den chineál seo teacht le rialacha cúnamh stáit. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, más féidir linn an cineál seirbhíse seo a chur i bhfeidhm do dhaoine óga, ba mhaith liom é sin a fheiceáil.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe this question relates to the vulnerability to blacklisting and failure to vindicate people's rights as employees under EU and national law. The Deputy is following up on the previous question. It is an excellent use of his time.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will answer the question tabled and then get back to the copyright. I understand that the Deputy's question on blacklisting refers to a situation when a person or persons are denied fair opportunities for work or they are discriminated against for one reason or another in gaining employment or both. Employment law is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the mechanisms for dealing with allegations of breaches in the employment laws of the State are under his aegis. These mechanisms are the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court and they are the appropriate forum for dealing with allegations of such breaches. In the event that allegations are upheld, applicant companies for section 481 must provide details of all WRC decisions relating to the qualifying company, the producer company or other companies in the film group, and where those decisions are a finding against such a company, confirmation that the finding has been followed or an explanation where the finding has not been followed must be provided. I am a passionate advocate for diversity. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, I would not condone blacklisting or discrimination of any kind. I have introduced policies that highlight the need for inclusion of all. The work of the skills division of Screen Ireland has been particularly important in improving hiring practices in the audiovisual industry. Screen Ireland states that open hiring practices have increased to the extent that crew calls are now becoming commonplace for most productions. Crew calls mean that there is an open application process so that everyone can apply for crew positions in that production. This is for the industry and those working in it including those who may be marginalised, from minorities or from disadvantaged backgrounds. My Department has been informed that 2022 had the highest number of productions providing placements for disadvantaged groups. More broadly, as I referred to earlier, the Safe to Create programme incorporates zero tolerance of seven damaging behaviours including victimisation. Victimisation occurs when there is adverse treatment of a worker in reaction to a complaint made by the employee or worker. It is intended that free online training in tackling bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias will be undertaken by all in the audiovisual industry. Training in these areas should further protect the rights of vulnerable or marginalised workers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Employment practices in industry have been examined by the WRC. The Deputy had a role in the background on that examination. We constantly monitor the operation of the scheme and work with all stakeholders to bring enhancements where we can. The recent extension of section 481 is a positive development for the sector and all working in it. Without section 481, productions as diverse as "An Cailín Ciúin" and "The Banshees of Inisherin" would not be feasible in Ireland. The WRC and Labour Court are independent statutory bodies under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Industrial Relations Act 1946, respectively. They are the mechanisms for regulating employment law in the State. They are under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Both organisations have statutory powers under which they conduct their business and I have no role in their operation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier this morning, I note that Screen Producers Ireland strongly refutes any claim of blacklisting in the Irish film industry-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----and demonstrates its commitment to relations with the unions. If the Deputy knows of a specific instance, or of people to whom it has happened, it is up to him to make a complaint to the appropriate mechanism, which is the WRC. Certain individuals are claiming they have not been able to get a job since. The employment record of any individual is a private matter between him or her and the Department of Social Protection-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	-----and the individual and the Revenue Commissioners. If the Deputy is aware of a specific incident, it is up to him to make the complaint to the appropriate mechanism, which is the WRC.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 20 together. Internationally, tourism continues to recover steadily, yet several challenges, both geopolitical and economic, remain. The combination of increasing interest rates in all major economies, rising energy and food prices, and the growing prospects of a global recession are major threats to the recovery of international tourism for 2023. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the tourism industry here in Ireland this year. Though the strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year was welcome, there are significant challenges facing the sector. I am, therefore, continuing to direct significant resources to support the sustainable recovery of the sector. In budget 2023, I secured an additional €15 million for the overseas marketing of Ireland. The budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million for the continuation of the investment in skills development and retention, which is critical, as there are significant employment challenges faced by tourism businesses in attracting talent, assisting skills development and retaining staff. Additionally, a €2 million increase in funding for domestic marketing will continue to promote Ireland's tourism offering to Irish holidaymakers. I have also secured €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Other allocations include €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development for the continued delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030. Tourism Ireland will roll out an extensive and targeted programme of activity in 2023, with a total marketing budget of €78 million. A wide range of promotional activities will be undertaken, including a new global marketing campaign, publicity and programming, social media and digital marketing, as well as working with the tourism industry at home and the travel trade overseas to facilitate sales. In the area of screen tourism, we can expect many international tourists to head for County Mayo on foot of "The Banshees of Inisherin". Economic, social and environmental sustainability will be at the heart of Tourism Ireland's work over the coming years, driving greater economic prosperity and benefiting communities across the island, while at the same time increasing our consideration of the environmental impacts of tourism. In addition, Fáilte Ireland will announce its plans for 2023 shortly. The Government has recognised the challenge of rapidly rising energy costs for businesses and last year introduced the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS. I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry that the number of tourism beds taken out of the system for humanitarian reasons is likely to have a real impact on the industry's recovery in 2023 and beyond. In addition, hotel accommodation is not an ideal medium- to long-term solution for the accommodation needs of families. That is why the Government is actively exploring a wide range of alternative options, including the roll-out of a rapid-build housing programme to provide accommodation for families fleeing the war in Ukraine. My Department has communicated concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. That Department is working urgently across Government with agencies, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and local authorities to bring new accommodation on board so that the State's humanitarian responsibilities can be met. My Department has initiated the development of a new national sustainable tourism policy that will seek to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years to support sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. The new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable economic development in communities throughout the country while protecting our environment and natural resources, with greater demand spread out across the year. While the sector faces many challenges, I am confident that the supports the Government has put in place will ensure that Ireland's tourism industry is well positioned to maintain its current levels of recovery and to grow sustainably in the coming years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tourism Ireland has been quite fast off the mark. It put up a video on social media maybe three months ago. It shows the actors being interviewed about the beauty of where they worked on location in Achill and Inis Mór. The Deputy can retweet that to his heart's content. It is very aware of the immense value that this will bring to attract international tourists and is capitalising on that. That is another great reason we have tourism, arts and culture in the same portfolio. I have always talked about the links there. In regard to the large country houses, there may be one or two in Kildare north. I can talk with Deputy Durkan afterwards about the potential of that from a tourism point of view. In regard to the conferences, I am aware of that and engage with that specific area in the tourism industry. I expect it to have someone in attendance at the tourism and hospitality forum next week, which is being convened by myself and the Minister, Deputy Coveney. I know Tourism Ireland is aware of the potential there. In regard to the concerns about the humanitarian response, it is, of course, the right thing for us to do. As a nation, we sought refuge for generations and we should never forget that. The Government has approved the construction of 700 rapid build homes with the potential to house up to 2,800 individuals in family units. The vacant homes initiative led by local authorities aims to provide 1,000 homes while refurbishments led by the Department of House, Local Government and Heritage will provide an estimated 3,000 beds. Under those measures between 6,000 and 7,000 beds or more will come on stream in the coming months to ease the pressure. Of course, I am aware of the concerns in the industry. In particular the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC, published reports recently and I have met with its representatives on foot of those reports. I will be engaging with the industry with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, at the tourism and hospitality forum next week.
