CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The key message coming from COP 24 is that climate change is moving faster than we are and that we have to catch up before it is too late. However, Ireland is actually going backwards. Our commitments require us to reduce our emissions by 1 million tonnes per year, but instead they have increased by 2.1 million tonnes per year. Yesterday we got our latest climate change report card, the climate change performance index. For the second year in a row - twice under the watch of the present Taoiseach - we are ranked bottom of the class. Ireland is the worst performer on climate action in the EU. It is embarrassing, disgraceful and shameful. Despite all the years of talk and Government announcements about the need to transition to a low-carbon economy, it has been a case of more talk and glitzy announcements than any real action. The report stated: "The long-standing lack of implementation of substantive measures to put the country on a well-below-2°C pathway results in a very low rating for Ireland’s national policy performance". That is basically a technical way of saying that Ireland may talk the talk and spin the spin, but it certainly does not walk the walk, which is the responsibility of the Taoiseach. Leaders must lead and the people do not want to see our country continually trailing in climate action. It is an unfair reflection of their concerns. The people are way ahead of Government on this. The Government is out of sync with Irish and global concerns and the demands for real climate action. It is all well and good to produce plans, roadmaps and recommendations, but they are of no use if they are not followed and if they do not have cold hard figures to back them up. If the Government were serious about climate action, why would it launch Project Ireland 2040 when it has not been climate proofed? Everything in the plan is wonderfully vague when it comes to climate impacts. Whenever I or one of my colleagues on this side of the House asks the Taoiseach or anyone in government for information on how they plan to tackle climate change, we get the same response: that €1 in every €5 under the national development plan is being spent on climate action initiatives. However, the climate action committee has been told that 60% of that €1 in €5 is already committed energy expenditure, meaning that the €1 in €5 appears to be a sham. Today I would like to ask the Taoiseach about the other €4 in €5. How does he know what the impact of our greenhouse gas emissions of non-climate related spending under Project Ireland 2040 will be when there are no real numbers in the plan? There are no projected emission reductions, no identification of any real climate proofing. I ask the Taoiseach to give me the number for our projected emission reductions under Project Ireland 2040. I do not want vague plans and more announcements today; I want real numbers. If the Taoiseach does not have the numbers, does he intend to do that analysis?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am certainly not saying that the national development plan on its own will solve climate change. It certainly will not do so when it has not even been climate-proofed, which is the main point. The EPA's recent report states that emissions have decreased. I am glad the Taoiseach accepts that this is due to the mild winter. Another reason is the reduction in fuel tourism because of Brexit's impact on the pound. The underlying trend is that we are still way off target but at least the Taoiseach has not tried to take credit for the weather, which would be a whole new level of spin. The recent reductions are certainly not due to Government action. We are 3 million tonnes off where we promised to be under European effort-sharing agreements and at the current carbon market prices, this would cost us some €60 million. That cost is only going to increase, year on year. In terms of plans and the all-of-Government plan to which the Taoiseach referred, at this stage people are suffering from Government climate action spin fatigue and plan fatigue. Under the national mitigation plan for this year, only 21 of the 40 actions have been completed. As I said, the national development plan has not been climate proofed. The national energy and climate plan must be submitted to Europe by the end of the month but, as recently as last week, Departments were unable to outline any additional measure being undertaken to close the emissions gap. The current national development plan is not fit for purpose. Restoring Ireland's reputation will require that the new national energy and climate action plan replaces Project Ireland 2040. This should include a new land use element which commits us to a new future for Irish farms, forestry and bogs. It should promise a radically different transport system which promotes walking, cycling and public transport ahead of road construction. Of course, we also need to divest from fossil fuels. This would ignite our economy but it requires leadership. Everybody matters in making this just transition, which is why my party has published a just transition Bill. If it can be done, it will only be done if the Taoiseach and his Government changes track and gets serious about this. The Government must lead and must prioritise tackling the most serious threat to us all.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am fatigued with plans. I am fatigued with Government spin and plans. It is nothing but plan after plan after plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The programme for Government committed to the recruiting of additional teachers within a reformed and better managed public service. Earlier today, parents in a primary school in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown received a message from the principal stating, "In the new year there will be teaching vacancies in our school. These positions have been advertised repeatedly over the last three months without a single reply." This is an appalling position for a principal of the school to be put in with regard to managing her school. It is an appalling position for the teachers, given the extra pressure of operating in a school that has a shortage of staff. Most importantly, it is appalling for the children who have to attend a school where there will not be enough teachers to properly provide the best possible education for those children. This school will, of course, continue to try its hardest to fill those vacancies but the fact remains many schools across the country are dealing with the same issue.Pay inequality is very much part of the problem as students are refusing to join the teaching profession while, for the same reasons, young teachers are walking away from it. What measures is the Government adopting to tackle teacher shortages?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a primary school.
