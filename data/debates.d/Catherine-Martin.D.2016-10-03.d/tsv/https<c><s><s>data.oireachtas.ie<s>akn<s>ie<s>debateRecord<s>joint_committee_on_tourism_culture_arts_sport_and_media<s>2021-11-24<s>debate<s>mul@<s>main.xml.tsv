CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Go raibh míle maith agat a Chathaoirligh. Táim thar a bheith sásta bheith libh chun labhairt faoi tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne. I intend to address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, and Media while my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jack Chambers, will address matters related to sport. I understand that matters relating to the Gaeltacht will be dealt with by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and Irish-speaking Community. I am pleased to have this further opportunity to address the committee on the key priorities of my Department and to set out the vision for these wide-ranging and valuable sectors. I spoke to the committee last about my priorities in April this year. At that time, I said that these sectors contribute significantly to our country’s economy, while also supporting individual and community well-being right across Ireland. However, there is no doubt that the diverse range of sectors served by my Department have been, and continue to be, amongst those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. These sectors are fundamental to societal well-being. They encourage public confidence and our collective resilience as we continue to emerge from the pandemic over the longer term. They also remain among the most vulnerable to the cruel unpredictability of this devastating disease. It has been said many times that they were the first to close and last to reopen. A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, in order that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery. During 2021, the €55 million support fund announced as part of budget 2021 for strategic tourism businesses, and the €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector, continued to be provided. These measures have complemented the horizontal measures employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS; the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP; the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS; and the restart scheme. I also launched a €17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme, which is delivered in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities across the country. For the coming year, €288.5 million is allocated for tourism services, which represents an increase of €67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation. The additional funding will help to address immediate survival-related concerns for business continuity, domestic and international marketing, and support for tourism product development, while also enabling further resilience and recovery across the industry as we reopen to international tourism and transition to a more sustainable future. I was very cognisant of the challenges the restrictions caused for the arts, culture and live entertainment industry in 2021, and I allocated more than €60 million to support the sector and drive employment opportunities for artists and crew through the introduction of several new schemes. Those included the provision of support for live entertainment businesses, encompassing a new live performance support scheme, a new support scheme for live events and entertainment businesses, and funding to support local authorities for outdoor live performances. As part of budget 2022, I maintained the Arts Council allocation at the record level of €130 million. This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties. With these ongoing levels of public funding in 2022, the Arts Council is empowered to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead. I have also allocated €25 million for the live entertainment sector as part of budget 2022, and I am examining the supports in place for the sector to ensure available resources are best deployed to meet the needs of the sector to ensure a full recovery is possible. The supports provided have been essential for those hardest-hit, and I will continue to do everything possible to ensure necessary provisions are in place to allow these sectors, which are essential for our physical, social and mental well-being, to thrive once again. Regarding my Department’s capital programme, I worked closely with colleagues across Government to renew our national development plan. The programme for Government makes strong commitments to continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure. My priorities under the renewed national development plan are aligned under three categories of activities my Department undertakes to support and develop its sectors: supporting economic recovery and resilience, promoting well-being and social cohesion, and providing sustainability and guardianship of our cultural, linguistic and environmental resources. A key priority for my Department is the continued safeguarding and modernisation of institutions through the national cultural institutions, NCI, investment programme in the national development plan, NDP. This is an ambitious €460 million programme of capital investment across all our NCIs which will ensure they can continue their legacy of providing engaging cultural and artistic offerings to the people. The national development plan also includes €265 million for a cultural and creativity investment programme. The large-scale sports infrastructure fund and sports capital and equipment programme are also key elements of my Department’s NDP plans, which will be further addressed by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. As we continue the recovery, my Department will work to deliver on priorities that are informed by the programme for Government. My Department’s key priorities for economic recovery are also informed by the tourism and arts and culture recovery task forces, which were established to provide recommendations for overcoming the challenges faced by these critical sectors. Ireland’s tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits the development of rural Ireland, especially in regions that lack an intensive industry base or are economically fragile. For tourism, recovery and sustainable growth are essential. This will begin with a survival, stabilisation and recovery programme informed by the recommendations of the tourism recovery task force as well as inputs from the tourism recovery oversight group. I continue to work on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years towards ascertaining that we have a tourism sector that is socially and economically sustainable and that ensures sustainability is at the heart of the recovery in the sector. This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment as we develop our national tourism product. This investment programme will take a regions-led approach and will include investments in activity-based tourism, with a particular emphasis on the outdoors, and the development of strategic tourism locations. As well as investing in our tourism product, these investments will provide important supports for regional enterprise and employment, and these are often located in areas where tourism is a key driver of the local economy. The significant increase in funding for this sector provides an opportunity to reimagine and reconfigure Ireland’s tourism for the future. With the climate emergency as our backdrop, we must also play our part. The future we imagine is one that will tell the story of our ancient past and our current modern communities, and one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty. Turning to our arts and culture sector, last year the arts and culture recovery task force submitted to me its report, entitled Life worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors. We have made significant progress already on implementing the report. For example, I was particularly pleased to announce €25 million for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022. This is a major policy intervention for the arts and culture sector that requires significant resources from my Department to develop. Work is ongoing and regular engagement with the sector is taking place. My ambition is to open the pilot scheme for applications early next year. I believe this makes a strong statement about the value we place on the arts sector, where employment is characterised by low, precarious and sometimes seasonal income. Artistic and creative work is intrinsically valuable to society, and perhaps never more so felt than during this pandemic. I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector, and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists after the difficult circumstances they have endured during the crisis. The report of the night-time economy task force was published in September and contained several practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy as well as some pilot measures to support new developments in this area. Work is also ongoing on the flagship digitisation of the 1926 census records this year, which will provide a further valuable set of records for genealogists across our global Irish community. My Department has a range of key priorities in this area and I look forward to discussing them with the committee. These include support for culture activities in the State-supported and commercial sectors, in which the Arts Council will play a central role. My Department also continues to work on supporting the creative industries, including the audiovisual sector. A key priority in this area will be the continued implementation of the audiovisual action plan over the coming years. It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and to safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content that are so essential to a democratic society. I am very aware of the important role played by the broadcasting and media sector in delivering key and necessary public health messages in recent times. Some examples of measures in budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional €4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which is the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the €5.5 million allocated for the media commission. This funding will be used for the setting up and commencement of the media commission’s functions, to recruit an online safety commissioner and to lay the groundwork for an effective regulatory structure. The spread and amplification of harmful online content raises serious concerns, and this will help us close a gap in Irish and international law concerning online safety. Regarding the enabling legislation for the online safety and media regulation Bill, I also thank this committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the online safety and media regulation Bill. The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill. I commend the thorough and consultative approach taken by the committee in conducting its pre-legislative scrutiny. It represents a continuity of the approach in developing the general scheme, which involved public consultation and significant stakeholder engagement. I am closely considering all the recommendations. Some deal with issues I have been examining for some time, and this includes how the Bill can be further strengthened to better protect individuals online, including by addressing issues relating to the appropriate avenues of complaint or redress. I intend to progress the Bill as a matter of urgency following the current consideration. Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and democracy. As Minister with responsibility in this area, I will continue to advocate intensely for these sectors, as we all understand there is still much work left to do. I will also continue consulting with the sectors and assessing supports in that regard. We are operating in the shadow of Covid-19 and our recovery will not be easy. It will not happen overnight, but I am confident Ireland will recover. Our world-renowned tourism industry will welcome visitors back better than ever; our vibrant arts and culture sector will flourish again, showcasing our incredible talents both at home and abroad; we will have a rich landscape in which our language can continue to grow; and we will see our dynamic sports and media sectors strengthened, reinforced and supported. This will require a long-term approach, and all of us here understand these sectors are critical to our lives. I am deeply committed to supporting and realising this strategic vision. I am happy to take any questions members may have later, but I will hand over to the Minister of State now.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. We are all very much aware of the serious impact the pandemic has had on the live performance sector, our musicians and artists. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with a wide range of stakeholders across the sector, with a view to understanding the pressures that are faced and to ensure that the supports meet the needs of the sector. In 2021, I allocated more than €60 million to support the sector and drive employment opportunities. I also introduced €25 million for the live performance support scheme, €16.5 million for the events sector Covid support scheme, €10 million for the local live performance support scheme, €4 million for the music and entertainment support scheme, €5 million for the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme and €1 million for the St. Patrick's Festival.In budget 2022, I allocated €25 million for the live entertainment sector. I have maintained the Arts Council allocation at a record level of €130 million. This allocation will allow the Arts Council to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and to assist arts organisations through financial difficulties. My Department will continue to receive feedback on evolving challenges facing the sector. It is on foot of these engagements that the significant supports have been provided. Further funding is available in the recently secured budget. We have continued to engage with the sector on how the supports can be better tailored to meet the needs. The engagement will continue in the coming weeks with a view to opening the supports for applications as soon as possible. If it is the case that these supports are exhausted in 2022 and the pandemic continues to impact on the sectors, we will review the situation. In terms of the social welfare supports, the Department of Social Protection stands ready to provide support to those impacted in the short term. To date, the Government has responded appropriately and has paid out more than €8.9 billion through the PUP and a similar amount via the EWSS. The Government has not been found wanting. I assure the Deputy that we are monitoring the situation closely. The position remains under review. We will take the appropriate measures to support people, if and when required. I also remind the Deputy that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, clearly signalled in his budget speech that he and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, are holding approximately €4 billion of the Covid provision as a contingent reserve in order that we can adapt if faced with the unexpected. Should further measures be warranted to support the sector, I will talk to those Ministers. Regarding the query relating to Wexford, I will revert to the Deputy with more detail on the position in that regard. Wexford is very important from a cultural perspective, not least because of the Opera House and the opera festival. I will revert to the Deputy on the Dun Mhuire Theatre.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This was the number one recommendation of the task force, and I was delighted to secure a commitment to it in the national economic recovery plan and to ring-fence the money in the recent budget. There has been ongoing engagement and an oversight group was set up. Everything is being done in close consultation with the sector. A tender has issued for a partner to develop an online application portal. On 8 December, a significant stakeholder engagement will take place to hear the views of the artists, creatives and the relative resource bodies and representative organisations. This scheme is so important and must be designed in close consultation with the sector, and 8 December will be a key date for the scheme. Stakeholder engagement is key to the success of this policy and has been a cornerstone of my approach to the sector during the pandemic. The launch date for applications and the eligibility criteria will be announced in January following the consultation on 8 December. The consultation will be a global café-style event.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator. As he indicated, the current iteration of Creative Ireland comes to an end shortly. My officials are preparing proposals which seek to extend the programme, in particular the creative communities via local authorities, which I will shortly bring to Cabinet. The work of Creative Ireland in increasing access to creative opportunities for young people has been impactful and will continue. On the creative industries, the Creative Ireland programme consulted extensively with industry bodies, businesspeople, practitioners and academics in the field of design-based digital creative and content creation sub-sectors and with other Departments, agencies and enterprise partners. A roadmap for the creative industries was drafted in 2020, as the Senator will know. However, the Covid-related issues have been prioritised over the past year. With a view towards economic recovery, discussions are again under way concerning how best to finalise and implement the draft roadmap. Comhaltas has committed to the area of dignity and equality in the context of the recent launch of its results and in regard to Speak Up. We are doing a lot of work to reinforce the importance of dignity at work for the creative sectors. For example, we have worked extensively with, and funded, the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI, survey and report on bullying and harassment survey. The ITI will be funded to continue its work, as a starting point in regard to the findings of the survey. It will develop a code of behaviour that organisations can adopt and, in doing so, declare their commitment to provide a safe and dignified workplace. The code will be accessible online and will include a register that organisations and individuals can formally sign. A dignity in the workplace toolkit will be developed for arts organisations and individuals. It will contain comprehensive information on supports and resources for independent workers. This will provide a suite of training tools, starting with bystander training and intimacy co-ordination, and incorporate behaviour modules onto all arts-related accredited courses. It will expand existing resources, including access to counselling, human resources, mediation, and legal consultation, free of charge, to artist art workers. In this area, Minding Creative Minds, which is funded by my Department, has been providing an exemplary service since 2020. We will be developing arrangements for confidential reporting of harmful behaviours without fear of reprisal; build cross-sectoral support for change; continue research in this area; and, as committed to at the launch of the survey, commit to further follow-up service so that we can monitor the success of our actions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The National Library of Ireland is already doing work to digitise websites. We will continue to work with it and the National Archives with a view to addressing the question of digital archives.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We will address that issue of digital archives. I absolutely appreciate its importance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As regards the issue he and Senator Warfield raised, as I stated, it is being considered and we are consulting the National Library of Ireland. I will revert to both of them on that specific issue. As regards clarity and certainty for pubs and restaurants, I wish I was in a position to provide that. The only thing that is certain about Covid-19 is its uncertainty. As the Deputy is aware, the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, will be meeting this week. We await its deliberations. Just like everyone else, I am not in a position to give clarity or certainty, unfortunately. I can point to the budget, which included an increase of more than 30% for the tourism sector in my Department, and the cross-sectoral supports that are in place already, such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, the restart grant, the credit guarantee scheme, the €55 million for the tourism business continuity scheme, the €26 million in the Covid adaptation fund, the €10 million allocation for coach tourism, the €10 million for Ireland-based inbound agencies, the €8 million in restart grants and all the outdoor dining and urban animation schemes. We have not been found wanting in that regard. I do not have a crystal ball - none of us have one - in the context of this awful pandemic that has had a devastating impact on our tourism sector that supports more than 250,000 jobs. The Government will not be found wanting. We will keep everything under review. As regards the business continuity scheme and the money that was ring-fenced in the most recent budget, Fáilte Ireland is in consultation with relevant stakeholders to assess where that money will go. It is open to anyone to apply to the board of Fáilte Ireland. Obviously, we will be looking for specific skill sets, in consultation with the chairman of the board. It is open to anyone to apply to that process. Of course, the hospitality sector does have a strong voice via the tourism and hospitality forum I and the Tánaiste co-chair.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The directors and I will consult with the chairman on that. It then goes through the Public Appointments Service process and that shortlist is brought to me. As I stated, it is open to anyone to apply. It is a fair and transparent process. The hospitality sector has a strong voice via the tourism and hospitality forum. I know this has been a devastating time for those in the sector and that the uncertainty for the sector as we approach Christmas is awful. The Government has not been and will not be found wanting in the context of supports.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, I am trying to write them down to make sure I answer them all. In regard to the media commission, it cannot formally be established until the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is enacted. However, it is my intention to go to the Government in the coming weeks to seek agreement to start the recruitment process for key personnel on an administrative basis in advance of this. That would enable preparatory work to be undertaken to ensure the commission hits the ground running on establishment. The provision of the €5.5 million in funding that I secured in the recent budget will enable that. I reckon the commission will probably require 120 personnel for the start-up phase, with a number of these to be hired before the formal establishment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the individual complaints, this is a matter I have been considering closely for some time. The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is, of course, complex. I am currently looking at the 33 recommendations. I have to commend the committee for the detailed and thorough pre-legislative scrutiny that was done. Although the Senator is talking about one specific recommendation, to have made 33 recommendations shows the complexity of all of this.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am currently examining how this issue and others can be overcome. It is a complex issue. Ireland could actually be regulating for the whole of Europe in respect of video-sharing platforms. That is approximately 450 million people and it brings various languages and cultural norms into it all. It is about how we would actually manage that volume. I am examining how these issues could be overcome in the context of that specific recommendation. That is where we are right now. In regard to the levy, the Bill already provides that such a levy may be introduced by the media commission once its viability has been assessed with regard to whether or not it would have any negative effects. The proceeds of any such levy will go into a content production scheme from which producers could apply for funding, similar to the sound and vision scheme, with which the Senator will be familiar. I hope that answers the question. In regard to the Future of Media Commission, that report currently lies with me and the Taoiseach. We will be consulting key Cabinet colleagues and then bringing it to government. As the Taoiseach said in recent weeks, the terms of reference and recommendations of that commission are pretty substantial so we are giving it consideration. We will consult the relevant Ministers and then bring it before Cabinet. In regard to the basic income, the Senator may have heard me answer on that earlier. There is a key stakeholder agreement consultation on 8 December. We went out to tender for the facilitator of that and it will be a sort of global, café-style forum. I would like as broad a range as possible, which was the Senator’s question. It is so important that the sector is with us all the way in the design of this process, so I would see all of that being discussed on that key date of 8 December. The invites will issue shortly for that consultation process. Was there a final question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree they are operating very well and they are to be admired for it. However, as I said earlier to Deputy Griffin, I cannot give a definitive response on the pandemic and the twists and turns it will take, nor is there any ambition to impose any further restrictions at present. We have to wait and assess the impact of the changes introduced last week and the consistent messaging around individual behaviour. I am, of course, hugely sensitive to the impact of this on live performances in all the venues the Senator has mentioned. As I said earlier, we will not be found wanting in regard to supports. There is the €25 million that was ring-fenced in budget 2022 and there is the money in the Covid fund mentioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath. It will come through him and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, if needs be. We have them open and I want to keep them open and I want them to be viable. I hope that is the case. If that does not happen, I can assure the Senator they will receive the supports they need. Let us hope we can turn this around.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The procedure for appointing the board members to RTÉ is set out in section 81 of the Broadcasting Act 2009.That section provides for a board of 12 comprising six members appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister, four appointed by the Government on the nomination of the Minister after the joint Oireachtas committee process, one staff member and the director general. As the Senator will know, arising from the most recent joint Oireachtas committee process, the Government approved the nomination of four persons to fill the four vacancies. There is now one vacancy because a subsequent resignation took place. I have engaged with the Senator on this. I look forward to hearing from members of the committee regarding a new nominee to the RTÉ board. This is a challenging time for public broadcasting and I look forward to working with the board of RTÉ. I understand that this replacement process is ongoing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier, we are all very aware of the serious impact of the pandemic on the live performance sector and on our musicians and artists. The recent changes-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Deputy will please allow me to answer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not really a "Yes" or "No" answer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish things were that simple, but they cannot be distilled into that simplicity.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I know that from working with the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Deputy wants to take the floor, that is fine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not a "Yes" or "No" answer. I know this a line the Deputy likes to pursue and is very fond of, but these questions do not have "Yes" or "No" answers. I am also Minister-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These are not "Yes" or "No" answers. What the Deputy insists on ignoring is that I am also a Minister in the Government that awarded record, unprecedented funding to the Arts Council. I am also a Minister in a Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On social welfare supports, the Department of Social Protection stands ready to provide support to those impacted in the short term. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with the stakeholders and we will continue to do so to receive feedback on the evolving challenges facing the sector. We have not been found wanting. We will assess the situation and keep it under review.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The most recent analysis I have by the Department of Social Protection was that in September, 533,000 people with a known employer number had returned to work having availed of the PUP. It shows that 62% returned to the same employer, 12% moved to a different employer and 26% moved to a different employer and different activity. Four in ten tourism and hospitality workers on the PUP did not return to their pre-pandemic employers. Some 18,500, or 15%, had moved to a different employer in the same sector while 33,500, or 27%, had moved to a different sector. This summer one in three workers were new to the sector. Up to 40,000 vacancies, 24%, are at senior level. Those are the details I have on tourism.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I really think that is absolutely unnecessary.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A question from a script -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, was something we did. It has had a few iterations. We did it with close consultation from MEAI. The officials examined the specific scheme to which the Deputy referred and felt it was not feasible -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Having said that, we will continue to engage with the arts sector to see if supports are needed. The live performance support scheme of €25 million is available for 2022 -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The officials examined it and felt it was not feasible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have not met with the Minister on this yet but I will meet him in advance of the tourism and hospitality forum to discuss it. As the Deputy can imagine, the current evolving situation with Covid has been taking all our attention where we are assessing and reviewing the supports that are needed. We are seeking to address skill shortages. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge in the sector. Two thirds of businesses have reported reduced capacity. We can see that. I was glad to see the work done by Fáilte Ireland on a new recruitment, marketing and awareness campaign. It continues to promote opportunities and communicate the benefits of working in the industry with its content and social media strategy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This was addressed in the tourism and hospitality forum, which myself -----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Myself and the Tánaiste attend that forum. The matter was raised in that forum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did not have to go to him specifically. The stakeholders have a discussion with us as co-chairs of the forum. The idea is that they are talking to both of us at the same time and that the Tánaiste hears what I am hearing at the same time and we both respond.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It was raised at the forum and we responded during the forum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. I will make sure that will happen.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the other issue, I reassure the Deputy that the Secretary General of the Department is a member of the Covid-19 oversight group and the body that makes the recommendations is represented on that oversight group. The Secretary General gets to feed into that process. I would add that dancing is allowed in certain circumstances.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can send the Senator a letter on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, it depends. There are strict regulations on it. I will make sure the Deputy gets the relevant information on that. If one has a relevant licence, the dance-floor space and the event is ticketed, it is allowed. The restrictions are about the layering process. I know the decision on the midnight issue is very tough on the night-time economy in particular. That is what the Deputy is fighting for but at least the sector's doors are still open. Up to two months ago, they had been closed for 18 or 19 months. This is about simply reducing socialisation and the interaction that involves. That is where the decision came from. The doors of the sector are still open and we want to keep them open. I am determined to do that. We will keep the supports in place. That would be my comments on that point.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Comhghairdeas le Maggie Farrelly on being the first woman ever to referee a county final. As the Chairman said, it is shocking that she is the first despite it being 2021. We have a long way to go. Maggie has definitely played her part. As the Chairman knows, young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see. Maggie will definitely inspire young girls to referee in the future. The members should rest assured that the Minister of State and I are absolutely determined to increase the participation of women in all areas of sport, as the Minister of State has outlined in so many ways. We are committed to that. With regard to eligibility for the basic income, a lot depends on the engagement on 8 December at the global café-style event. We are considering the possibility of having two streams, one being for professional artists, most likely based on membership of a resource body such as Visual Artists Ireland or Dance Ireland. That stream would also include emerging artists to ensure developing artists are given the opportunity to develop their creative practice. There would be a second stream for those working in the arts sector who have a creative input into the final output of an artist's practice, such as screenwriters, directors and costume designers. We are considering this. Participation will not be based on a means test; it will be a non-competitive process. We will have a control group, a meaningful number of unsuccessful applicants, so we can capture the important data and determine the impact on both unsuccessful and successful applicants, creative output and artists' well-being. A tender has been issued for a partner to develop the online application portal. Maybe that is what the Chairman was referring to. The key date in the basic income guarantee pilot is 8 December. All the artists issued with invites will get to help to shape the scheme. With regard to Creative Ireland, together with the Department of Education, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and the Arts Council, the programme has seen investment of approximately €13.4 million in the Creative Youth initiative since 2017, with a further €6.8 million in 2021. That will considerably enhance children's and young people's access to creative activities. Three additional education and training, ETB, initiatives are being advanced in Cork, Galway–Roscommon and Mayo–Sligo–Leitrim. The ETBs have been really brilliant at targeting the disadvantaged Responsibility for the decisions on the local Creative Youth partnerships lies mostly with the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley. A total of 651 schools have chosen to participate in the Creative Schools programme since its introduction, and a further 299 schools have been chosen to participate in the Creative Clusters initiative of the Department of Education. The current iteration of Creative Ireland is coming to an end and my officials are preparing proposals to extend the programme that I will bring to the Cabinet. Creative Communities, with the local authorities and Creative Ireland, has resulted in incredible work on increasing young people's access to creative opportunities.It has been and will continue to be a real positive.
