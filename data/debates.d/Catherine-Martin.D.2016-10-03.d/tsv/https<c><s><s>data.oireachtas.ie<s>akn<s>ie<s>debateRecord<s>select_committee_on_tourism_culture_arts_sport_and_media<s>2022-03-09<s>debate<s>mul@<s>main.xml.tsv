CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Fáiltím go mór roimh an deis labhairt leis an gcoiste agus Meastacháin Athbhreithnithe 2022 do mo Roinnse á mbreithniú. Tá €1.2 billiún sa leithdháileadh iomlán do Vóta 33 in 2022, méadú de thart ar 8% ar an bhfigiúr inchomparáide do 2021. Éascóidh an maoiniú méadaithe seo sraith bearta substaintiúla chun na hearnálacha a bhfuil mé féin mar Aire freagrach astu a thacú agus a neartú agus iad ag dul in oiriúint don, agus ag teacht chucu féin ón, dochar nach bhfacthas riamh a d'eascair as paindéim Covid-19. These sectors are both wide-ranging and valuable and were among those most severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Employing many hundreds of thousands throughout the country, these are the sectors that thrive when people congregate to enjoy their leisure time together. Our cultural institutions and theatres, live performances, tourism destinations, sporting occasions and Gaeltacht communities have all been severely impacted for almost two years. The public health measures necessitated by Covid enabled us to protect the most vulnerable in our society through our collective action but also had such a negative impact on the way we have lived our lives for the past two years, for example, our ability to watch a match, to attend a live performance, to enjoy a weekend away with friends, to participate in the arts as well as the ability of artists, workers and businesses to provide these uniquely valued experiences. As Minister, I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society and, with it, our tourism sector, our arts and culture venues and events, and the return of fans to our sports grounds. The 2022 Revised Estimates for my Department have been informed by ongoing engagement with sectoral representatives. The additional funding covers a wide range of initiatives and measures to support the resilience and growth of practitioners, businesses, communities and operations in the sectors overseen by my Department, with all efforts very much focused on both social and economic recovery. I will outline total 2022 funding for the sectors supported by my Department. There is €288.5 million in funding for tourism services in 2022, which is an increase of €67.6 million or 31% on the comparable 2021 allocation. This additional funding includes a €50 million provision for further business continuity support to help drive the sustainable recovery of the sector. A €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund will support the delivery of a marketing strategy to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland. In addition, €27 million
is allocated for a range of industry initiatives, including domestic marketing and festivals, investment in digital skills development, and staff retention, and €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development – an increase of almost €4 million over the 2021 allocation – for the delivery of enhanced visitor experiences in line with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2021-2030.
Some €371.4 million
will be allocated to the arts and culture sector, including €25 million to pilot a new basic income guarantee scheme for artists. This measure was the key ask from the arts and culture recovery task force and will bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector. The Arts Council maintains the record €130 million
funding
allocated in 2021, allowing it to continue to protect the jobs and livelihoods of artists and assist arts organisations through financial difficulties and empowering it to play a strong role in supporting artists and arts organisations to flourish in the years ahead. Some €50 million is allocated for further supports for the live performance sector following on from the successful operation of a number of schemes in 2021, including the live performance support scheme, LPSS, the music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, and the events sector Covid support scheme, ESCSS, thereby supporting a successful return to full-scale performances.The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland is €36.7 million, an increase of more than €6.6 million on the 2021 allocation. The audiovisual industry has been one of the success stories of the past two years and this additional funding will ensure the continued success and growth of this internationally renowned industry into the future. Funding for this programme area includes the following: €4 million to deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force; €5 million in additional funding for the national cultural institutions to ensure they continue to provide high-quality services to the public and deliver progress in their ongoing programme of investment; and €5 million to support the 2022 commemorative programme delivering rich and diverse national and local programmes marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022. Funding of €295.7 million will be provided for media and broadcasting in 2022, which includes €5.5 million for the establishment of the new media commission and the appointment of an online safety commissioner to begin work on key issues following the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill in 2022. This allocation also provides for an increase of €4.2 million, the largest ever funding increase for TG4, bringing its annual funding for 2022 up to €44.9 million. This additional funding will allow it to deliver its ambitious post-Covid strategy, focusing on news content and putting audiences centre stage. In conclusion, I am satisfied the increased allocation for my Department in 2022 of €1.222 billion will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes. As Minister, I intend to do everything possible to continue to support all the sectors for which I have responsibility as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, and I look forward to their future growth and successes. I will now hand over to my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak about the Revised Estimates for 2022 as they relate to sport.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is used to provide funding for overseas tourism marketing. The bulk of the funding forms the State's share of the agreed North-South co-funding of Tourism Ireland's destination marketing of the island of Ireland overseas. Given Tourism Ireland is a North-South body, it also receives funding from the Northern Ireland exchequer for its core overseas marketing. The primary objective of the tourism marketing fund is to increase tourism revenue by attracting more overseas visitors to Ireland. Irish tourism is marketed primarily on an island-of-Ireland basis and the majority of the tourism marketing fund goes toward Tourism Ireland's core funding for all-island overseas marketing activity. A proportion of the non-core tourism marketing fund is allocated for the development of Ireland's specific product and regional marketing by Fáilte Ireland, to be delivered by Tourism Ireland as its overseas agent.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism marketing fund is used to pay for Tourism Ireland's destination marketing overseas and for Fáilte Ireland's niche product marketing. Tourism Ireland delivers marketing programmes in 21 markets throughout the world and reaches a global audience of more than 600 million each year. The agency is doing incredible work and I have witnessed that in two missions I have undertaken, to the United States and, recently, to Dubai. The work it is doing to sell our island as a destination at a time when that is so badly needed is incredible, not least because of the time and commitment that is given to it. As an example of where the money goes, targeting market activity includes advertising online, on television, at outdoor sites, in cinemas, newspapers and magazines and through e-marketing, overseas publicity and co-operative marketing with carriers, other partners and promotions. I have heard from the main tour operators to which they are trying to sell Ireland that at a time of absolute devastation in those early days of the pandemic, it was Tourism Ireland that reached out to the tour operators when others did not, and kept that relationship really special and valued. They linked in with them and that is what is being remembered as tourism reopens. That is all down to the incredible work Tourism Ireland does.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. Fáilte Ireland is delivering four new regional tourism strategies in 2022, setting out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for each region. They will be activated through a series of local destination and experience development plans. By the end of 2022, 27 of them will be live, while by 2025, every part of the country will have a destination development plan. That should address some of the Deputy's concerns. Each plan will be appropriate to a given region's level of tourism maturity.The Deputy can look also at the incredible amount of funding provided by Fáilte Ireland last year to develop tourism attractions, for example, in Westport, Donegal, Dublin and Cavan. It was the largest funding ever announced by Fáilte Ireland, which is constantly working on developing new destinations and attractions for tourism and sharing tourism out.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The four new regional tourism strategies will be delivered in 2022. They will set out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for the regions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Where did Deputy Munster say it is?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is looking at the short-term letting. The National Tourism Development Authority legislation is to be updated to take account of the Housing for All requirements and to limit capital increases. It is looking at how that can help.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is to register Airbnb accommodation. The registration would be welcomed. My departmental officials are linking in with the officials of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Fáilte Ireland will develop, support and promote tourism at a regional and county level. The Vice Chairman mentioned one of the four regional tourism experiences. These are the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, the Hidden Heartlands and Dublin. Tourism Ireland is promoting the island of Ireland in more than 21 markets. Those four brands resonate with tourists, and they work very well. In terms of Fáilte Ireland-supported capital projects, although restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic may have delayed some openings, some examples of projects that were completed in recent years include the Butler Gallery in Kilkenny, the Blasket Islands viewing platform, which will open shortly, and Carlingford Castle. The work is ongoing. Fáilte Ireland allocated the sum of €1.1 million to the Butler Gallery; €1.7 million was allocated to the Blasket Islands viewing platform; Carlingford Castle got €400,000; Nowth in Meath, where I was last week, received €1.4 million; and the Céide Fields visitor centre in Ballycastle, County Mayo, received a Fáilte Ireland investment of €863,000. Some of the Fáilte Ireland tourism projects due to be opened during 2022 include the Blasket Islands, the Céide Fields, Avondale House, Strokestown Park, Mount Congreve House and Gardens and the Norman Heritage Park. We are constantly building on the regional spread. Much-needed investment is taking place.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is a separate line this year for Covid supports under B16. Cultural supports now have their own separate line. It looks like the figure has dropped, but it has not. It is just that we have given a separate line now to the Covid supports. That was well spotted by the Deputy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In general terms, the lesson that has been learned by everyone, not just the Department, is the value of the arts. As an artist, Deputy Cannon will appreciate that. We have often spoken about the value of arts and how we treasure it, but it really came to light during Covid. A valuable lesson also is not just about the performers themselves, who of course are incredibly important, but also about the people who make these events happen - those who work backstage on whom the spotlight does not shine. A light was shone on them, and it is my intention to keep that light firmly there. We could not have designed the number of schemes we did without engagement. From the first moment I became Minister, engagement and feedback have been key. Schemes have been adjusted following engagement with those affected. Although we are emerging from Covid, I would not see that as something that should ever stop. It is essential that we continue to engage with the stakeholders through the forum that was set up to assess the recovery and their current needs. Yesterday, we announced another new scheme, which is about helping people with the recovery. That needs to continue. Such engagement is evident also in what we are doing with the basic income. The artists must shape what we do in the Department. As far as I am concerned, the artists must be involved and at the table in any policy initiatives. That is the lesson that has been learned.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Engaging with the artists shows how essential that basic income is. This was the number one recommendation that came from the artists themselves through the arts and culture recovery task force. I was absolutely delighted to secure agreement within the Government on that. I secured €25 million in budget 2022 to launch this three-year basic income for arts pilot scheme. The stakeholder engagement has been absolutely core. We had the stakeholder forum in December followed by public consultation. There were well over 1,000 pieces of feedback into that public consultation. As I said, we received a significant number of submissions. That reflects the high level of interest, which the Deputy talked about, in this key policy intervention. The scheme will be open to practising and developing artists and creative arts workers. It will be non-competitive. Therefore, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, he or she will be included in a randomised selection process. The eligibility criteria will be published as part of the scheme launch, which I hope to do in the coming weeks. We are nearly there. It was essential that the artists had to feed into this and help to shape it. I expect the launch in the coming weeks. We are now down to the final details of the number of recipients and the rate of payment. We are trying to finalise that right now. Of course, issues around artists with disabilities have been raised so we must give serious consideration to ensuring this is addressed. It is my intention that the basic income for arts will be an unconditional basic regular income to artists and creative arts workers to allow them to focus on what they need to focus on. The recipients can do that when they are in receipt of this grant. It will be groundbreaking. There will be a control group as well and we will be assessing the scheme. Research will be done throughout the programme on its impact on creative output and well-being. It will be a thorough research project for three years.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier, the audiovisual industry was one of the success stories of 2021, recording a record level of output in the face of Covid-19. New figures published recently reveal a record-breaking spend of more than €500 million in the Irish economy across film, television, drama, documentary and animation production in Ireland in 2021. The Irish screen production industry is building a reputation for high-quality production across the world. The 2022 allocation for Screen Ireland will amount to €36.743 million comprising €32.15 million in capital funding and €4.593 million in current funding. For screen allocations, there will be pay of €2.2 million and non-pay of €2.275 million with capital funding at €32.15 million. That €6.65 million will allow them to keep indigenous production levels at a pace that is consistent with previous years. That is where that is being targeted. It will enable the encouragement of more regional productions in the Irish language; continue the training academies, which build on the skill set that is needed; introduce a new funding stream to support documentary series; and a provide a further round of State funding to support Irish companies. That money will allow them to invest in IT and marketing and recruit key roles and talent such as a diversity and inclusion manager, a project manager, a development executive, an audience engagement executive, an IT executive and a HR executive. That is where the money will be targeted.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy is looking at arts organisations in receipt of funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	One aspect is what we were aiming for, and we actually went above that. The 2020 out-turn target was 1,146 organisations. The 2021 output target was 840 organisations and the 2022 output target is 895. The Department is currently in the process of collating the 2021 out-turns for performance metrics. All 2021 performance information will be available in the 2021 public service performance report, which is due to be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the end of this month. That is where we will gather that information.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Of the €50 million that was allocated for a suite of supports for the live entertainment industry, €5 million was allocated for the live performance support scheme, LPSS, strand 2. The Deputy might remember that this was to support pantomimes and seasonal musical theatre, which were brought to a halt due to the Covid-19 restrictions in place in December and January. Of that, grants of €2.6 million have been offered and payments of €1.3 million have been made under the scheme to date. Up to €20 million has been allocated under strand 3 of the LPSS to support events that were due to be staged in December and January and were curtailed, cancelled or rescheduled due to the restrictions with live performances at 50% capacity and the closing time of 8 p.m. Grants of €7.7 million have been offered and payments of €1.1 million have been made under the scheme to date. Applications are being assessed on a rolling basis and grantees are advised of the status of their grants as soon as a decision is made. The payments are being made and issued on a rolling basis once grantees have supplied the Department with the required documentation. There is, therefore, ongoing liaison with my officials. There was €4 million allocated for another round of the music and entertainment business assistance scheme to support small music and entertainment businesses that do not operate out of a rateable premises. Some 642 applicants have received funding of €2.8 million. To date, €2.3 million has been awarded and payments of more than €900,000 have been made since the scheme closed on 27 February. There was €5 million allocated for local authorities under the live performance support scheme to support local artists and performances. A further €5 million was allocated to continue the capital support scheme, for example to help venues that might need ventilation upgrades or other Covid-19 adaptations. There was €1 million for the St. Patrick's festival. Yesterday, the live performance restart grant scheme was announced, which is a new scheme for businesses engaged in staging events in the arts and cultural live performance sector. We will continually assess what money goes out but that money will go where it needs to go, which is to the artists. As I said, that is through constant liaison with officials linking in with artists if further information is needed. It will go where it is meant to go, however, which is to support the artists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	People will have to apply. The scheme is really to support venues, promoters and producers and help them with the costs of reopening and hiring artists and crew to stage live performances in the coming months. It will trickle down.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To that end, all grantees will have to complete evaluation surveys on the exact purposes that for which the grants were applied.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I refer to producers, promoters and venues, including nightclubs with an established track record in producing live arts and cultural performances that are advertised as such. Existing grantees, who are fully compliant with their existing service level agreement and drawing down procedures, would be defined as LPSS pilot, LPSS 2021, LPSS 2, LPSS 3 or ESCSS stream A grantees in full compliance. The existing grantees are deemed to have already demonstrated their track record and there will be no need to demonstrate that again. If an applicant is a new entrant, that is, not an existing grantee, the applicant will have to be in a position to demonstrate either a proven track record of at least two years of delivering ticketed events in the arts and culture sector or VAT exclusive turnover generated in the State of at least €100,000 for 2018 and 2019. The business must also be in the State. There are details provided on how they would demonstrate their loss. That would probably answer Deputy Munster's question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are three streams to the scheme, namely, stream A, the existing grantees, which are those LPSS 2021 grantees; stream B, the LPSS ESCSS; and then the new entrants. The payment is up to a maximum of €100,000. It is not unusual to have a cap on the funding but, as I stated to Deputy Cannon, if demand exceeds the allocation, we will look at that. I have often stated that I will go back to the Covid contingency fund, which is where we secured an additional €25 million before Christmas. The idea is not to exclude people but to help as many as possible, up to the maximum of €100,000.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy is asking a hypothetical question. We do not know whether all the previous recipients will apply. The scheme is open to new entrants.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have not ring-fenced money for one section only. In everything I do, the Department is reaching as many people as possible. If the hypothetical scenario the Deputy presented emerges, we will reassess the matter. The idea is to get money out to those who need it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Within the €15 million allocation, I have not ring-fenced a certain amount for a certain group. I have not allocated a specific amount or provided that the majority of the funding will go to a certain group. It is open to everyone to apply for funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will assess the matter. To reassure the Deputy, there is no absolute entitlement and the scheme is open to everybody.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe that the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, has already discussed with the committee the Revised Estimates in that regard and has expressed that, as the Minister of State with responsibility for the matter, he is willing to attend the committee.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Vice Chairman has rightly identified that the section 481 tax relief is a vital part of the financial infrastructure of the audiovisual industry, as is the regional film development uplift. We are seven months out from the budget, so I will include this matter in my negotiations. This is a thriving industry and it can do much more. It helps with many other areas. I will be undertaking some trade missions with a view to developing more production in this country.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Different schemes were developed at different times throughout the pandemic. This scheme is about supporting people and has been designed to give them restart stability to ensure they can plan ahead. All applicants, existing and new, must be able to demonstrate their VAT exclusive turnovers and a proven track record of at least two years of delivering ticketed events in the arts and culture sector. If an applicant is a new entrant, he or she must be in a position to demonstrate that. Existing grantees are deemed to have already demonstrated their track records, so they will not have to do so again. The LPRGS was just announced yesterday. All grantees will have to complete the evaluation survey to demonstrate that the grants are reaching where they need to go. I am happy to forward the committee more information on comparing the schemes and how that comparison might impact on the LPRGS. What we were doing in the thick of Covid compared with what we are doing now to aid in the recovery process are quite different in design.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We engage with An Post all the time. I might be able to come back to the Deputy with the breakdown of funding afterwards, if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We engage with it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is an annual service level agreement, SLA, with An Post.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, of course. We set up the Future of Media Commission because there is an issue with the funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It comes up all the time. It has been well identified as an issue, not just in the annual SLAs, but more widely. That is why the Future of Media Commission was set up.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe it was €9.8 million in 2021.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We do not have the figure for 2022. The figure I gave is for 2021.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2020 it was €10 million, in 2019 it was €11.3 million and in 2018 it was €12 million. We can send this to the Deputy. I have the details all the way back to 2010 here. Would the Deputy like me to forward those details to her?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2010 it was at €10.9 million. It seems to fluctuate between €11 million and €12 million. In 2020 and 2021 it was between €9.8 million and €10 million. It depends on the licence fee sales.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The intellectual property is an issue of copyright which would not lie with my Department. It may be something to raise with the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
