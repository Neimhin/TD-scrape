CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Chair. I will ask my questions quickly in order that the witnesses have time to respond. I thank them for their presentations and commend them on the valuable work they do. I offer Dylan my congratulations on his recent success in the BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition. As the Chair stated, we have heard further regrettable evidence of how the poor and marginalised are last in the queue for crucial services, which is shameful for us as a country. My first questions are to Mr. Rojas Coppari or Ms Rashmi. A Vision For Change states that no one can achieve true mental heath recovery without having a meaning to life and access to employment. What has been the toll or impact of the years that so many in direct provision centres have been deprived of the right to work and the dignity of earning an independent income? Has there been an increase in mental illness among those who have been deprived of that right or are there any data in that regard? Those who have managed to make their way from war-torn countries are highly likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Are any mental health providers given specific treatment to support such people or specific training to support victims of human trafficking? What is being done in regard to language barriers? There have been reports of children interpreting for migrant parents who present for medical attention. Is that happening in respect of mental health services? If so, that is highly inappropriate and would cause huge stress for the child and for the parent who requires the child to interpret. Does Mr. Coppari or Mr. Reilly know if training workshops are available for psychologists and psychotherapists to acquaint them with the unique and intrinsic cultures of minority groups whose members may seek therapy? What culturally inclusive training is being delivered to mental health providers? The 2012 HSE intercultural strategy stated the need for an ethnic identifier for service users, but Mr. Reilly in his submission highlighted that is still not standard, which I presume makes managing or determining outcomes very difficult. Without knowing those outcomes, how difficult is it to tailor supports for people from the Traveller community or minority backgrounds and to ensure that staff are trained to meet their specific needs? What funding is allocated to mental health supports for the Traveller community, migrant groups and LGBTI groups on an annual basis? Do we have data outlining the exact funding in that regard? I recently spoke to Ms Geraldine Dunne, the managing director of Southside Travellers Action Group in DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown, to ask her about the needs of the community in that area. She mentioned the lack of supports for teenagers and youths, which, unsurprisingly and regrettably, is an issue of huge concern. In the opinion of Mr. Reilly or Ms Quirke, how could that best be addressed?I do not understand why a representative of the Traveller community was not on the youth mental health task force. The witness said that this was sought on several occasions. Therefore, what reason was given? It beggars belief. I do not understand why there was no representative and would like to know the exact reason given. How was that explained? Many of my questions arise from Dylan's and Ms Griffith's project. As a former teacher, I am wondering what training for teachers is in place with regard to gender and LGBTI sensitivities. Dylan's project refers to a number of surveys but one shows that 20% of the 277 people surveyed stated that their teachers did not use the correct name or pronoun. Was that a case of the teacher choosing not to use it? Was it that the teacher said that he or she would not use the preferred pronoun? If so, it needs to be addressed. Have the witnesses any ideas on how it can be addressed? It is not acceptable. Has BelongTo approached the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals on how schools can develop policies relating to LGBTI students for staff? What has been the response? Is anything being developed? Am I doing okay with the clock?

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is key because I was fearful it was a choice not to do so, but Dylan believes it is a lack of understanding and that is why training is needed for staff.
