CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I seek clarity on the relationship between the Minister's office and the forward planning section of the Department in respect of the manner in which they communicate on the progress of announced new schools and major builds. This arises from the recent experiences of a number of schools in my constituency where the respective communicated experience with the Department has been immersed in uncertainty and confusion over future plans. The schools in question have found communications in respect of future plans and decisions to be erratic, indecisive, unreliable and ever-changing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The nub of the question was on what happened following patronage and following the announcement. A concrete example of where there needs to be more oversight and communication between the Minister's office and the forward planning section is Ballinteer Educate Together national school, which was announced as a primary school in 2012. A deal was negotiated between the Department and St. Tiernan's community school to house the school temporarily until it received planning permission for a permanent home. St. Tiernan's agreed because it was promised a PE hall but, five years later, there is no permanent home for Ballinteer Educate Together and no PE hall for St. Tiernan's. It is the manner in which Ballinteer Educate Together school is learning about its future which is of the greatest concern. In November last year the principal, staff and parents learned of the Department's plans to move the school to the Notre Dame campus via a tweet. That is unacceptable. Last month, parents from Ballinteer heard by word of mouth from other people that a Gaelscoil would now be moving into the junior school at Notre Dame. Despite the fact that only 27 school days are left until the summer break and despite repeatedly requesting the layout of classrooms, Ballinteer Educate Together has not been guided through exactly how the move will work or whether it will happen in June, July or August, and it has not been afforded a visit to the new campus by the Department. To compound the departmental communications fiasco, when the principal recently rang to seek clarity, she was told the forward planning section was under pressure planning for other schools. It is not good enough and I appeal to the Minister to communicate with the forward planning section so that clarity can be provided.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not acceptable for a school to learn of the plans for it by social media or word of mouth and that has to stop. I ask the Minister to keep schools informed of progress. Is he aware of the problems making progress with new builds? Is this lack of communication happening throughout the country? Is the forward planning department vastly underresourced and does the Minister need to prioritise funding for the section? Dublin Rathdown is a constituency which will soon not have enough schools to meet its needs. How is the Department planning for the future needs of schools and children? The lack of vision in the Department is worrying. The issues also affect another school in my constituency, Our Lady's Grove, where a large portion of the land has been put up for sale. I appreciate that the land is private land being sold by private organisations but the Department should seek to protect the lands at whatever cost, whether that be through purchase or seeking a long-term lease. I ask the Minister to keep communication open with these schools and to do what he can to protect our schools, our open spaces and our children's education.
