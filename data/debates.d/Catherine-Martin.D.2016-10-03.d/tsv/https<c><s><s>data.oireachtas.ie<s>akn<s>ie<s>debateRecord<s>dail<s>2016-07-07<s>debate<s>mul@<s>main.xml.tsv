CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will take four minutes. I acknowledge and thank all the Members in the House for uniting behind what started as a motion tabled by myself and my Green Party colleague Deputy Eamon Ryan, but has evolved into a strong cross-party motion under which we, as members of this House, cast party politics aside and unite today in seeking justice for an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa. We recognise that the Department and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have dedicated a lot of time, effort and resources to Ibrahim's case and a number of politicians from different parties have also kept in close contact with Ibrahim's family to see how best to ensure his safe return home. I met with the Egyptian ambassador and I regret to say I could take nothing from that meeting that gave me confidence or hope in the short term. With the further deferral of the trial process last week, it was clear that a more united approach is needed whereby we, as a Parliament, stand up for his rights and call on the Egyptian Government to exercise its powers under decree 140 in the Egyptian statute book to issue a presidential decree and ensure his release. We do so citing the fact that, when arrested three years ago, Ibrahim Halawa was a child of 17 years of age. His case has now been adjourned 14 times and he has been recognised by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience held for more than three years without a trial.Justice delayed is justice denied - that is, if one takes a huge leap of faith that Egypt operates a proper system of real justice, but there is no evidence to date that it does. We propose that a parliamentary delegation from this House visit the Egyptian Parliament, and Ibrahim, to help resolve matters. We look forward to hearing from the Egyptian ambassador in that regard. She must start to appreciate that many have zero confidence in Egypt's purported system of justice. I hope there will be a speedy response from her as we try to comprehend the anguish that Ibrahim's family has been feeling over the past three years. I welcome members of Ibrahim's family to Leinster House today as they watch this debate, and commend the way in which they have tirelessly campaigned for his release in a peaceful and determined manner. We must exhaust all options in ensuring Ibrahim's release, but a stage may be arrived at where all our diplomatic representations and efforts continue to fail, including perhaps a direct intervention by the Taoiseach where, rather than telephone calls, a face-to-face meeting of the Taoiseach with the Egyptian President is requested as a matter of urgency, with Ibrahim being the sole issue on the agenda. Should that fail, however, I suggest that at that stage it may become necessary for the Egyptian authorities to be made aware that some consideration would have to be given to suspending diplomatic relations with a country which continues to unjustifiably detain one of our citizens who was a child at the time of his arrest and that this is unacceptable. Ibrahim Halawa - we say his name loudly and clearly here today so that Egypt hears one united voice saying that Ireland will not stand for the continued imprisonment and ill treatment of Ibrahim - is one of our own. Standing up for him says something about our sense of ourselves as a nation. We are in many respects his only hope - his last hope - and I am glad that we are standing together here today to demand the release of our own citizen, Ibrahim Halawa.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This question relates to the Minister's announcement last week that the drafting of legislation has been approved as a matter of priority for the de-designation of 46 raised bogs. I am appalled that this Minister of all Ministers as the one who is supposed to have a special responsibility to protect and promote our heritage would under her watch allow, permit, and actively facilitate the destruction of an irreplaceable part of our heritage, allegedly as a matter of governmental priority when the patent truth for all to see is that this decision which was set in stone in the recent programme for Government, on page 51 to be exact, would appear to be singularly motivated by a lust for power at any price even if that means sacrificing or destroying part of our country's heritage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2005 the then Government committed to designating these raised bogs as NHAs as part of the compliance with an ECJ judgment. An inevitable part of that designation was ending turf cutting on them. This Government is rowing back on that commitment and claiming that the fact that it is going to do less than it said it would is some sort of success story. Our raised bogs are among the best examples of raised bog habitats left in Europe. In addition to their obvious biodiversity value, peatlands are very important carbon sinks. They also act like large sponges helping to protect us from flooding. After the many recent catastrophic floods does this Government not get how crucial it is to take preventative action and not the exact opposite? Worse still, when drained and harvested these bogs will go from being carbon sinks to very large carbon sources. The Minister can dress this up whatever way she wishes today but to the Green Party and to many others it is nothing more than a shameful destruction of our heritage all for the sake of a promise to support and keep this Government in power. Most unfortunate of all, there was an alternative solution for all which would have protected our heritage. Raised bogs can be traced back to the Ice Age, some 10,000 years ago and 10,000 years of heritage is now being bartered and traded for votes to keep the Minister and this Government in power. The way it is going this Government might not even see a few hundred days. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Are there management plans in place for those NHAs where turf cutting is due to end from 1 January 2017? If not, why is the Minister pressing ahead with de-designating 39 and partially de-designating seven in advance of arrangements being made to ensure that conservation objectives will be met on the reconfigured network of raised bog habitat recommended in the Review of Raised Bog Natural Heritage Area Network in 2014? Our raised bogs and other parts of our environment are in jeopardy because successive Governments have tried to be all things to all men and made concessions they should never have made. These bogs are over 10,000 years old and are our heritage. They should never have been used as bargaining chips in Government negotiations. In simple terms, with this decision the Minister is setting fire to our past, our present and our future.
