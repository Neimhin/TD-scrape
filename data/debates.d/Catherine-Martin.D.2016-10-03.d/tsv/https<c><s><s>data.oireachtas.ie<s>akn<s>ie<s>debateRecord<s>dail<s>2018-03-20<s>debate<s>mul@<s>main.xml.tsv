It marks an opportunity for change. It presents an opportunity to repeal an uncompromising article of the Constitution which has caused untold and unnecessary suffering for thousands of women since its inception in 1983. Ultimately, the Legislature must bear responsibility for the ongoing endangerment of the health and safety of women. The courts have on a number of occasions reminded us it is our function to legislate and they have, quite correctly, signalled their unwillingness to fill the gap and do our job as the Legislature. The Green Party will support this Bill and will be campaigning for a "Yes" vote in the referendum that will follow. The eighth amendment has not worked. It has resulted in a system that has treated and continues to treat women appallingly. This referendum is an opportunity to make a change because change is needed. Not only have we abandoned women by forcing them to leave their own country to access a safe medical procedure, but also we have compounded it by threatening and sanctioning women and doctors with severe punishment and threatening them with jail sentences. The threat and stigma surrounding abortion puts women in a dangerous position and continues to tie the hands of doctors when it comes to emergency scenarios. When not responded to properly, as the country has learned to its eternal shame, it can result in the tragic and unavoidable death of mothers. Women should not have to steal away from their country to access a safe medical procedure and not one woman’s life should be put in unnecessary danger. It is time to trust women. We need to trust women. The Minister said in his opening speech that moving towards the recommendations of the Oireachtas committee would represent a quantum leap from our current position. I welcome that leap, as our country is now ready to take it. I also acknowledge the Minister has committed to the principle that abortion in this country should be safe, legal and rare. The Green Party supported the Citizens’ Assembly and as part of our support of that process we also support free, safe and legal access to treatments for pregnant people, up to and including legal terminations of pregnancy without restriction, up to 12 weeks’ gestation. The Green Party is in favour of deferring decisions on terminations after this point to such conditions and time limits as recommended by qualified medical practitioners who are subject to the Medical Council. As a country, we are an outlier. The implementation of the recommendations of the committee will bring us in line with Greece, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Switzerland, Finland and France, among others, in allowing access to abortion up to 12 weeks. One of the many lessons to be learned from 1983 is the need for the Legislature to be trusted as the Constitution is unsuitable for detailed provisions that tie the hands of future generations. It is time to move forward with compassion. I recognise the work of the Oireachtas Committee on the Eighth Amendment, particularly that of the Chairman, Senator Noone, for coming to a considered, shared and compassionate set of recommendations. I hope the upcoming referendum campaign will be a respectful one. I hope we can have a frank, positive and constructive discussion on the issue. I hope we become a country that provides full support for all women who decide to continue with their pregnancies as well as providing support to those who do not. I welcome the debate today because for too long the voices of our elected representatives were not sufficiently loud nor adequately effective, just, coherent or steadfast. That is why we are where we are today where some women’s lives continue to be endangered. Ireland can no longer pretend, indefinitely postpone or prevaricate, and that is why the Green Party will support this Bill and campaign for a "Yes" vote in the referendum.
