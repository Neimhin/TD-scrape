CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations today. I am somewhat distracted by the passion of my colleague, Senator Ruane, and the stories she and her friends have lived through. We read about it in the paper but I know my colleague sees it every day. It has got to me, to be frank, but that is what needs to be heard in committees such as this. I commend Senator Ruane because she brings her passion and personal experiences to the table every time.The Minister issued a circular last year on principles of cost-effective practices that referred to some of the issues Senator Ruane has brought up. It stated that all elements of a school uniform should be purchasable from various stores and only iron-on or sew-on crests should be used. There are references to the phasing out of workbooks between the time the circular was issued and September 2018. It is now September 2018. I am sure the witnesses are aware of the circular. I wonder is there data on how many schools have adhered to this? The third point in this circular referred to the rewarding of schools for adopting these principles. I wonder which schools have been rewarded and why schools would have to be rewarded for phasing out workbooks, phasing out crests and having sew-on crests and for allowing parents to buy uniforms in any store. I question why the Minister indicated in this circular that schools should be rewarded for that when we are talking about a free education system. Is there any data on this? Has the Department followed up on this circular? Has anything been done or was a circular sent out to all schools and just left there? The TUI stated in its submission that the restoration of the capitation grant to 2010 levels would cost €18.5 million. The State currently funds 60 fee-paying schools to the tune of €115 million. I am interested in hearing the views of the witnesses on that disparity and how resources should be prioritised in light of that. What are the main obstacles in rolling out an effective book rental scheme nationwide and how can they be overcome? What studies have been done on this? This week many households are under incredible stress from sending their children to school. We need to deliver a real free education system instead of having a so-called free education system. One thing that did not come up in the submissions, unless I missed it, is children in direct provision. Their parents receive €20 per week. Surely those families should be getting extra supports or grants. Is there anything like that available for them? What about homeless children? One in three of the homeless people in the country is a child. We know that 42% of homeless people are women, most of the time lone parents and often women who have left domestic abuse. Are there extra supports for homeless children who are going to school and their parents? A 2013 ESRI study outlined how voluntary secondary schools are more reliant than other schools on sources of income such as voluntary contributions and the fundraising Dr. Redmond outlined. The study recommended that the future funding of second level schools needs to be taken into account. Has the Government made any changes to the funding since that 2013 report? Dr. Redmond referred to a parliamentary question in 2017 when the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, said he agreed that the priority issue is the removal of the basic salary payment of €563 per teacher. That was an answer to a parliamentary question on 23 November 2017. Has there been any progress made since then?
