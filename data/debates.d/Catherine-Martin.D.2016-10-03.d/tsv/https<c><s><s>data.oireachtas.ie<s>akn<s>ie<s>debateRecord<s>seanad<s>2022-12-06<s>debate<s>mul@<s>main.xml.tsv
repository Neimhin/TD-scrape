CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas le baill an tSeanaid agus an chuireadh a bheith ina dteannta. The National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022 provides the basis to enable the continued provision of capital funding to the National Tourism Development authority, Fáilte Ireland, for the purpose of supporting tourism product development and the tourism industrySection 24(1) of the National Tourism Development Act 2003 gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance moneys provided by the Oireachtas to Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(2) limits the amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland for capital expenditure. Assuming the allocated funding in 2022 is drawn down by Fáilte Ireland, the current limit of €300 million will be reached close to the end of 2022. No further voted capital funding can then be advanced to Fáilte Ireland. Accordingly, I am bringing this Bill to the Houses of the Oireachtas to provide for the new spending limit of €500 million. Before giving further details of the Bill, I pay tribute to those who form part of the tourism ecosystem and make an important contribution to Ireland's overall economic performance. I particularly recognise the way in which the tourism industry reaches across the country and its importance for the regional economy. The contribution of tourism is not confined to directly generated employment, economic activity and exports. The sector has an important multiplier effect on other employment sectors such as agriculture, transport, retail, food and beverage, which are particularly important to regional economies. Apart from its economic value, tourism also plays an important role in promoting Ireland's image abroad and generating a positive impression of Irish people, our landscape and culture for visitors. Recent years have been challenging but I am confident that with all of those engaged with Irish tourism working together with the relevant agencies, Ministers and the Government, we can ensure the quality and competitiveness of the Irish tourist offering is continually improved and that the industry generates increased earnings and more jobs as part of our economic recovery. As with all industry, it is important that the tourism sector keeps innovating and developing in order to keep Ireland in the minds of potential travellers. In that regard, we know how important it is that brilliant visitor experiences, attractions and activities are available to visitors both international and domestic. As a significant proportion of tourists are drawn to attractions and participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland offers a range of supports to help tourism providers across the country to maximise their individual and collective offering in a way that attracts and engages tourists and enhances their overall experience. Ireland's tourism sector provides a wealth of opportunities for great offerings for visitors. In order to enhance those opportunities from a strategic perspective, Fáilte Ireland, broadly speaking, has four main funding channels for its capital investment in tourism product development. These are the large grants schemes provided under the platforms for growth approach, the small grants schemes, which are targeted schemes usually aligned with the tourism experience brands, strategic partnerships and other collaborations, and direct investment in experience brand infrastructure. In addition, part of Fáilte Ireland's capital funding programme uses platforms for growth to drive development in specific areas. The first platform for growth was launched in May 2019 and focused on developing immersive heritage and cultural attractions. These are attractions that appeal to overseas visitors looking for experiences that help them to connect with Ireland and bring the country's culture, heritage and people to life. Through this platform, Fáilte Ireland aims to ensure strong growth in development by investing in heritage and cultural attractions of scale that will motivate visitors to travel, either to and-or within Ireland, but without displacing the existing attractions of a destination or disturbing the competitiveness already attached to mature destinations. The overall objective is to deliver brilliant experiences that allow visitors to connect with Ireland and bring the national and local culture, heritage and people to life, while also delivering a greater regional and seasonal spread of tourism. In April last year, €19 million worth of investment was announced for the second platforms for growth strategy, to be used to develop world-class facility centres at 20 locations across the country at which water-based activities are a key visitor attraction. This includes locations such as Tipperary, Sligo and Leitrim, to name but a few. These facilities, designed to serve as a hub in each locality from which multiple water sports operators can base themselves, will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points. They will be fully wheelchair accessible and built using sustainability best practice such as solar heating panels. This sustainable tourism investment scheme was developed in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities. In addition to funding provided under the platforms for growth approach to large grants schemes, Fáilte Ireland also provides further capital supports to tourism attractions and experiences in Ireland through other channels, including small grants schemes, strategic partnerships with other State bodies and some direct investments. The strategic partnerships include entities such as Waterways Ireland, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Rural and Community Development. Fáilte Ireland supports a wide range of projects. This year alone, these have included projects in the Céide Fields in Mayo, the Blasket Islands in Kerry, Knowth in Meath and the National Famine Museum in Strokestown. From a tourism perspective, Fáilte Ireland's investment of €3.9 million is one of the largest ever investments in a visitor attraction in Ireland's Hidden Heartlands. There is a knock-on impact on the local economy both in terms of employment in attractions such as the National Famine Museum in Roscommon and in the wider tourism sector and economy. Fáilte Ireland's capital investment in tourism product development is further enhanced by complementary programme supports, including for festivals and events, business supports and training, and marketing and promotions, which are aimed at enhancing, animating and promoting the overall visitor experience. The intention is to optimise key assets for the benefit of tourism and sustainable tourism development through increasing the geographic spread of visitors. My Department has initiated the development of a new national sustainable tourism policy that seeks to mainstream sustainability. The development of this new policy will involve extensive consultation with the tourism industry and our communities to help set out a path for the coming years to support a sustainable recovery and subsequent growth in the sector. The policy will seek to support sustainable development in communities throughout the country, while protecting our environment and natural resources and encouraging a greater spread of demand across the year. I will now deal with the purpose of the Bill. The National Tourism Development Authority Act was passed in 2003 to dissolve Bord Fáilte Éireann and CERT Limited and establish the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland. Section 24(1) of the Act gives the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the power to advance, out of money provided by the Oireachtas, such sums as the Minister may determine. Section 24(2) limits the total amount of money that can be advanced by the Minister to Fáilte Ireland as capital expenditure on projects or enterprises. However, annual funding allocations are made in the normal way through the Estimates and budgetary process. This limit on total capital funding was originally set at €65 million but was later increased to €150 million and then €300 million under the National Tourism Development Authority (Amendment) Acts 2011 and 2016. Taking into account the 2022 capital allocation to Fáilte Ireland, investment in tourism capital projects is now approaching that limit. Once the spending limit has been reached, no further voted capital moneys may be advanced to Fáilte Ireland for tourism capital investment projects. Accordingly, it is now prudent to legislate for an increase in the limit. Is trí eispéiris agus áiteanna turasóireachta a fhorbairt gur féidir linn tairbhe a bhaint as an bhfás domhanda sa turasóireacht agus a chinntiú go bhfaigheann Éire, agus gach réigiún di, a sciar de na buntáistí a chuireann turasóireacht ar fáil go sóisialta agus go heacnamaíoch.

Cuirfidh an Bille seo ar chumas an fhorbairt seo leanúint ar aghaidh. I am introducing this Bill to make the necessary legislative change and I commend it to the House.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí go léir a labhair sa díospóireacht seo agus a chuir a dtuairimí faoi fhorbairt earnáil turasóireachta na hÉireann in iúl. It is proof of the importance of the tourism industry, which reaches into all parts of the country, rural and urban, and is a valued source of employment for many thousands of people in Ireland. In the time given to me, I will try to address some of the issues raised today. If I do not get back to Senators, I will ask my officials to follow up with them. Some Senators raised concerns about hotel accommodation. I wish to point out, firstly, that since Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine in February of this year, more than 65,000 people who have been forced to leave their homes in the most horrific circumstances have sought refuge here. Approximately 50,000 of them are being provided with accommodation by the State. It is by far the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the Irish State. Tourism accommodation has played a vital part in this national response. I should highlight, at the outset, that tourism accommodation should be seen as a short-term solution not just for the tourism industry but also for the families who reside in those hotels. It cannot be seen as a long-term solution. I recognise the growing concern among the wider tourism industry and sectoral bodies for the 2023 season. As we know, St. Patrick's day kicks off the peak season, although Senator Wall might argue that St. Brigid's day will mark the start of the season. I am aware that the contracting of tour group accommodation is significantly down on normal levels, and of the potential knock-on effect that the lack of availability of tourism accommodation could have on the wider tourism economy. Officials from my Department have communicated these concerns to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and I know that the Department is working urgently across Government with agencies, NGOs and local authorities to bring new accommodation on stream. I am aware that alternative modular housing will come on stream from January, with a number of sites in place. Allied to that is the increase in the monthly recognition payment to €800, effective from 1 December. The local authorities have launched a new initiative, appealing to those who have unoccupied properties to offer them as temporary homes for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Senators will be aware that the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation has published a report outlining the consequences of an overdependence on tourism accommodation stock and its proposed policy recommendations. I met with representatives of the confederation last week to discuss this issue in particular and the report. My officials have also highlighted the recommendations of the report at the meetings of the senior officials group that is engaged in the humanitarian accommodation effort. At all times, we remain resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine. We are honouring our commitment to help people who have been displaced by this horrendous war.  A number of Senators raised the issue of VAT. Obviously, the responsibility for VAT lies with the Minister for Finance. When the 9% VAT rate was introduced, it was initially planned to be for a period of 14 months. The rate was then extended for another eight months to 31 August 2022, and extended again to 28 February 2023. The Minister for Finance stated, on budget day, that he was not going to extend the lower rate of VAT beyond 28 February. I really believe, given the uncertainty ahead, that we must remain vigilant and we must keep reviewing the situation in case there are any downturns in the recovery in the coming months. We will keep that under review after Christmas. The issues of the recruitment, training, development and conditions of staff were raised by a number of Senators. The recruitment and retention of staff continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector not just in Ireland, but in many countries around the world. Prior to Covid, the sector had registered consistent increases in the numbers employed in Ireland's regions, and was an important driver of greater regional balance and dispersed economic activity. A sustained and sustainable rebuild is essential, as tourism supports communities and drives regional development in a manner unlike other sectors. I have worked with colleagues across Government to secure funding supports to keep the tourism sector alive during Covid, and to support the initial rebuild phase in 2022 and beyond. My Department participates in the tourism and hospitality careers oversight group, which brings together industry representatives, State agencies, Government Departments and the education sector. My Department and Fáilte Ireland are also working with industry and across Government Departments to ensure a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages in the sector across all roles.  With regard to the working conditions in the sector, Fáilte Ireland's research indicated that 70% of people within the sector see tourism as a long-term career option. While this is a good proportion, Fáilte Ireland has arranged programmes to build skills and capability for businesses and individual employees, including a suite of online self-directed professional development courses. The number of vacancies across the industry has fallen, and is now estimated to be 22,000, down from the previously estimated 40,000. Around 70% of businesses that are recruiting are increasing pay and offering flexible work patterns, more stable work schedules and other perks such as compensation for working unsocial hours, which is becoming increasingly common. The research also shows that staff retention has become less difficult, with employers reporting improvements in day-to-day operations. As part of the drive to promote tourism as an attractive sector, Fáilte Ireland has risen to the challenge and has launched the new employer excellence programme to help all participating businesses to improve their employer practices and enhance their reputations as excellent employers. This will help employers to drive great employee engagement, build the appeal of the workplace and unlock greater levels of performance across businesses. Hopefully, this programme will also lead to greater retention of staff and improve the view of the industry as a career choice.  Senator Cassells spoke of the value of the Fáilte Ireland investment to date and the ongoing work in County Meath and south Louth. Senator Carrigy spoke of the development of hidden heartlands as a brand. It has been and is making a difference. I will ask my officials to communicate Senator Currie's suggestions on the potential of Dublin 15 to Fáilte Ireland . On Senator Ward's comments on St. Brigid's day, central to it will be Kildare County Council's plans which are being developed at present. Fáilte Ireland, through its Ireland's ancient east brand, is engaging with Kildare County Council to offer advice and support with promotion, particularly through Fáilte Ireland's Discover Ireland platforms.  Finally, to conclude, I would like to take the opportunity acknowledge the work of two tourism State agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. While this legislation does appear technical in nature, it has an important outcome in that that allows the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland's work in the area of tourism, the value of which Senators have commented on. We continue to further develop Ireland's tourism offerings in order to entice visitors to come to Ireland and to return time and again. However, that is dependent on continued innovation in the experiences we offer, and that is where Fáilte Ireland comes into play. This Bill will allow the channel of funding to Fáilte Ireland to continue its incredibly important work in this area. I thank Senators for their engagement. 
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	The objective of the amendments in this grouping is to ensure that local sound broadcasters can avail of the scheme for professional journalistic practices which is being provided for in the Bill. Under this scheme grant funding will be available for broadcasters to provide training or professional development for persons employed by or providing services to the broadcaster in relation to promoting good professional journalistic practices. Without the amendments, this scheme would be restricted to community sound broadcasters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, it is.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group contains a range of technical amendments made to the Bill during its passage through the Oireachtas. The purpose of amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 10 is to clarify that the definition of programme schedule in the Bill encompasses both audiovisual programmes and sound programmes and that references to programmes in the definition of sound broadcasting services are references to sound programmes. The purpose of amendment No. 11 was to correct a typographical error in the definition of video sharing platform service in the Bill. The purpose of amendments Nos. 17, 18, 21, 23 to 24 inclusive, and 37 was to align the wording in the Bill regarding the roles of the Minister with responsibility for Coimisiún na Meán and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to certain financial and staffing matters with the wording in the public spending code. They are technical amendments as such and do not have any substantive effect on the Bill. Amendment No. 22 changes a reference to "a nominee of the person" in line 36 on page 25 to "a person acting on behalf of the person". The wording to be inserted is considered more suitable for the section which relates to the disclosure of interests as it is more encompassing than the term "nominee". The purpose of amendments Nos. 35, 36, 39, 40, 51, 74, 77, 78, 79, 90, 119, 292 and 293 was to correct typographical errors in a range of sections of the Bill. The purpose of amendments Nos. 68, 291 and 296 was to take account of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022 and in particular, amendments Nos. 68 and 291 update references to sections of the Referendum Act 1998 and to the Referendum Commission so that they now refer to the Electoral Reform Act and An Coimisiún Toghcháin, the new Electoral Commission. Amendment No. 296 amends a reference in the Electoral Reform Act to the Broadcasting Act 2009 so that it now refers to the relevant section of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think the point the Senator makes relates to the next group of amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of this group of amendments was to make provision in the Bill for an individual complaints mechanism as recommended by the online safety expert group in its comprehensive report. I acknowledge that this issue was of considerable interest and concern for Senators in this Chamber, particularly those who are members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media, and one that I committed to examining in detail before returning to this House. When I established the expert group earlier this year, I made it clear that if it was feasible to introduce an individual complaints mechanism, then I would provide for it in the Bill and that is what I am proposing to do with these amendments. The expert group has done its work and has given detailed consideration to the wide range of issues raised in the context of an individual complaints mechanism including through a public consultation and engagement with experts such as the Australian eSafety Commissioner. The group's report and recommendations chart a practical way forward for the introduction of an individual focused on the operation of the mechanism on a phased basis, firstly for children. These amendments were drafted on the basis of the heads contained in the expert group's report and hew closely to the group's recommendations, save for necessary legal adjustments by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. In this regard, amendment No. 89 provides for the substantive provisions for the phasing in and operation of an individual complaints mechanism, including how An Coimisiún can make schemes for complaints about various kinds of harmful online content, the threshold which must be met before An Coimisiún will handle complaints, the kinds of resolutions for complaints available to An Coimisiún, and a requirement for An Coimisiún to set out a plan for operating these provisions. The remaining amendments in this group are consequential.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a group of purely technical amendments made in the Dáil to insert a definition of "e-commerce directive" into section 2 of the 2009 Act, which concerns definitions. This was done to avoid repeating the title of the directive where it is referenced in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group of amendments made during the Bill's passage through the Dáil seeks to clarify that the jurisdictional test for when a relevant online service which is not a video-sharing platform service is established in Ireland is set out in Article 3 of the e-commerce directive. Amendment No. 14 contains the substantive section, a new section 2C to be inserted into the 2009 Act. Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 involve consequential renumbering. These amendments are purely to give greater legal clarity as to how jurisdiction for such services is determined under the Bill and do not in substance alter the legal framework set out in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Senators will recall that during the debate in the Seanad, I signalled that "party political programme" was intended to have the same meaning as "party political broadcast", namely, the short programmes carried on our public service broadcaster during electoral periods for the purpose of promoting a registered political party. The term "programme" was used in lieu of the term "broadcast" to ensure it encompassed both broadcasts broadcast by broadcasters and programmes made available by a relevant media service provider. It was to ensure it covered both party political broadcasts on RTÉ 1 and on the RTÉ Player. Senators and a number of stakeholders, including RTÉ and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, sought clarity in the Bill that "party political programme" had essentially the same meaning as "party political broadcast". Given the importance of providing clarity on this matter, I introduced amendments on Committee Stage in the Dáil to provide for a definition of "party political programme" in the Bill. I also introduced amendment No. 53 to provide that media service codes which will apply to broadcasting and video on-demand services may provide that party political programmes may only be available at specified times. Currently, party political broadcasts are only made available during electoral periods. This provision is intended to make explicit coimisiún na meán's authority to specify the timing of party political programmes. The intention is that these times shall continue to be during electoral periods. However, to provide flexibility, the provision refers to "specified times" rather than "electoral periods" to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard. I also introduced amendment No. 50 to clarify the meaning of a phrase regarding not giving unfair preference to any political party in respect of the allocation of broadcasting time or the positioning of content in a catalogue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To provide flexibility, the provision refers to "specified times" rather than "electoral periods" to allow coimisiún na meán adapt to any change in policy in this regard. It will be a matter for the electoral commission. This will allow coimisiún na meán to change if anything happens at the electoral commission. It gives a flexibility to adapt but it is a matter for the electoral commission. It relates to how those commissions will work with each other because one will affect the other. There may be a need to come back to that point, depending on a decision of the electoral commission. This gives flexibility to coimisiún na meán.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	During the Seanad Committee and Report Stage debates on the Bill, a number of Senators indicated they considered the provision that prohibits broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services making available programmes which may reasonably be considered to cause harm or offence as being potentially contrary to the principles of freedom of expression. At that stage, I committed to examining the matter. Having examined and considered the matter, I brought amendments on the Dáil Committee Stage to qualify the standard applied to broadcasters and providers of video on-demand services from "offence" to one of "undue offence". This aligns the language in the Bill with the standard of harm or undue offence to material applied by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland through its code of programme standards, ensuring the statutory provisions align with the practical implementation of the prohibition.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group of amendments is intended to allow coimisiún na meán to make media service codes which promote gender balance on news and current affairs programmes on radio, television and video on-demand services, and to promote the broadcasting of musical works composed or performed by women on radio services. A key goal of mine, as Minister, is to further gender equality within every sector under my remit and to collaborate closely with my Government colleagues to drive change across other key Departments. It is an issue that Senators raised with me and one I had committed to examining and returning to. Young girls cannot aim to be what they cannot see or hear and there needs to be a significant improvement in the ratio of women to men on radio and television, so that both genders feel represented in public discourse, as well as better representation of women in music on our airwaves. Following careful consideration of the compatibility of gender balance measures with the rights to freedom of expression and competition law, it is considered that the most appropriate approach to further this goal is to empower coimisiún na meán to make codes setting out standards and practices in relation to the promotion of greater representation for women in music and news broadcasting. Such codes will be binding on providers of radio, television and video on-demand services and, where breaches occur, such codes could be subject to enforcement action by coimisiún na meán. This approach will allow coimisiún na meán the flexibility to identify appropriate measures to promote gender equality that are consistent with our legal framework.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of this group of amendments is to provide absolute clarity that coimisiún na meán can dismiss a complaint in circumstances where it has already been effectively resolved under a code of practice prepared by a provider.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is a technical amendment to remedy a drafting error in the Bill. This amendment will ensure a section 70 contractor can continue to benefit from the exemption as set out in section 71(3) of the Broadcasting Act 2009.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 70 and 71 remove the statutory requirements for RTÉ and TG4 to establish and to maintain their respective teletext services. This change was agreed in consultation with our public service broadcasters and is considered important to allow progression from outdated technologies with very small viewerships.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These amendments are intended to address an anomaly by removing the reference to "terminal". This change, though largely technical in nature, will future-proof the prominence rules to allow them to reflect continuing changes in the ways in which audiovisual content is accessed and viewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This group of amendments inserts into the Bill provisions which require that coimisiún na meán must give reasonable notice of an audit to a provider of its designated online service and to provide an opportunity for designated online platforms to make submissions in respect of an audit report prior to its publication. This is to ensure legal clarity on the operation of these provisions and to ensure audits are not delayed or challenged on the basis of a lack of notice given. Allowing for submissions would not change the outcome of an audit report. The comments made by the designated online platform in question may also be published alongside the audit report. These provisions mirror similar requirements under the provisions for reports by authorised officers and are a key due process requirement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 92 and 93 are to clarify that coimisiún na meán may make online safety guidance materials on the risk test for non-offence specific harmful online content and may make online safety guidance materials on matters relating to the online safety aspects of the Bill rather than simply in general. Amendment No. 94 is a consequential renumbering amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These amendments will add existing offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 relating to online flashing to the schedule of offence-specific harmful online content in the Bill. This will enable the online safety commissioner to make binding online safety codes that will apply to designated online service providers and that will require those providers to take measures to tackle online flashing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of these amendments is to ensure appropriate remuneration and expenses are agreed and paid to appointed authorised officers. Of course, it is already the case that authorised officers who are members of an coimisiún staff would be remunerated. These amendments, however, will ensure any other individuals, such as external subject experts, are also appointed under terms and conditions set out by an coimisiún. Those terms and conditions, as is standard for such matters, are subject to the approval of the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of these amendments is to require coimisiún na meán to state the geographical area in which the action required of an online service addressed by a content limitation notice is to be taken. This is to provide legal clarity in that regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 274 to 277, inclusive, provide for consultation on preparing content production schemes between an coimisiún and Screen Ireland and provide that anyone can apply for funding under a scheme. Amendments Nos. 287 to 290, inclusive, allow for the Minister to provide by order that Screen Ireland may make a scheme and that an coimisiún should fund one. Amendments Nos. 278 and 279 clarify that all aspects of the development of European works may benefit from funding under a content production scheme. Amendment No. 279 also brings the content production scheme into line with the sound and vision scheme, pursuant to section 154(2)(a) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, in respect of requirements that audiovisual programmes funded under the scheme are made available on a free television service or video on-demand service. Amendment No. 280 sets out that at least 80% of annual funding provided through a scheme must be allocated to independent producers. Our approach will also ensure a minimum of 25% of funds raised through a content production scheme must be allocated to the production of Irish language content. Amendments Nos. 281 to 286, inclusive, set out the guidelines and principles to be followed in defining "independent producers" for the purposes of any scheme. In particular, the amendments provide that an independent producer may be defined by reference to the ownership of rights to use commercially any programme supported under a scheme. This is aimed at promoting the retention of rights in the Irish audiovisual sector.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as an spéis a léirigh siad sa Bhille agus an mionscrúdú a rinne siad ar na forálacha. As Senators stated on the first day we debated this, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill is crucial legislation. It modernises the regulation of the media ecosystem in Ireland and lays the foundations for the new regulatory frontier of online safety, which will be of great importance when it comes to protecting our children online. Key to this is the establishment of a robust and agile regulator, coimisiún na meán, whose remit will continue to grow in the coming years. An coimisiún will ultimately be responsible for enforcing key pieces of EU regulatory legislation, including the revised audiovisual media services directive, the Digital Services Act and aspects of the terrorist content regulation. It will have an important role in ensuring media sustainability and development. This Bill is the first step in a rolling legislative programme in this space in the coming years. I thank the officials in my Department for their tireless work and engagement with Senators and Deputies on my behalf during the passage of the Bill through both Houses. The Bill is of fundamental importance to protecting our society, particularly our children, from serious forms of harmful online content and finally ensuring online platforms are appropriately held to account. I know all Senators and Deputies are cognisant of the significance of the legislation. I acknowledge and thank Senators and Deputies for their constructive feedback and input inside and outside the Houses over the past year.
