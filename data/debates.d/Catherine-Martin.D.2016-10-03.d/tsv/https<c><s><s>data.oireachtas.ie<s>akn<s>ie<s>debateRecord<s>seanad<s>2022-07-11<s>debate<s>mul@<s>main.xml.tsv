CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments, which seek to replace the phrase "political end" in the Bill with a definition of "political purposes", with the aim of amending the current definition of "an advertisement towards a political end". As I set out on Committee Stage, the term "an advertisement towards a political end" has been defined in the 1998 High Court judgment in Colgan v. the Independent Radio and Television Commission, IRTC. This case involved an appeal against a decision of the Independent Radio and Television Commission to prohibit broadcasters from broadcasting an anti-abortion advertisement prepared by the organisation Youth Defence. The definition used in Colgan v. IRTC is currently used by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. In fact, the authority has a guidance note on its website which sets out, in accordance with the judgment, the practical meaning of the phrase. I note that the proposed definition of "political purposes" stems from the Senators' proposal to amend section 22(2)(aa) of the Electoral Act 1997 as part of this House's consideration of the Electoral Reform Bill. Given that the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, did not accept this proposal, I cannot accept it either. However, I understand that the Minister of State has set out on a number of occasions that the electoral commission, once established, will carry out a comprehensive review of aspects of election legislation in Ireland, including in respect of the definition of "political purposes".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 5 and 15 are intended to replace two references to user-generated video with references to user-generated content. Amendment No. 5 will amend the definition of “commercial communication” to replace the reference to user-generated video with a reference to user-generated content. Amendment No. 15 will amend a line in section 7 regarding the functions of an coimisiún in respect of regulatory arrangements to again replace the reference to user-generated videos with a reference to user-generated content. The reason for this is that user-generated content refers to all forms of user-generated material, whereas user-generated video only refers to video material that is generated by users. These errors were noticed during consideration of a number of the amendments proposed by Senators on Committee Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 5 will amend the definition of "commercial communication” to replace the reference to user-generated video with a reference to user-generated content.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While also addressing a number of amendments tabled by Senators on Committee Stage, the Government amendments in this group give effect to my commitment to explicitly provide for the role of online safety commissioner in the Bill. This was a key recommendation of the report of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media in its report on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the general scheme of the Bill. In this regard, amendment No. 6 provides for relevant definitions for the operation of this provision, including a definition of the online safety commissioner. Amendment No. 37
ensures that the online safety functions of coimisiún na meán are generally delegated to any designated online safety commissioners.Amendment No. 44 provides that "One or more of the Commissioners shall be designated in writing by the Minister on the recommendation of the Public Appointments Service as an Online Safety Commissioner". It is important to recognise that the online safety functions of coimisiún na meán are likely to expand significantly over time and, as such, it is important to provide that more than one commissioner can be designated as an online safety commissioner. In this regard, it is intended that the Public Appointments Service will commence a public recruitment campaign for the role of online safety commissioner in the coming weeks. Amendments Nos. 36, 38, 39, 45 to 50, inclusive, and 53 are all consequential amendments to provide for updates to the numbering of subsections subsequent to those inserted by amendments Nos. 37 and 44. I recognise the intentions of amendments Nos. 40 and 51, proposed by Senators Higgins and Ruane and Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, respectively, but note the issue they raise is addressed by the Government amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 7 is intended to address matters raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne, Cassells, Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage. Section 7(2)(b) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by section 7 of the Bill requires that, in performing its functions, an coimisiún shall endeavour to ensure that the interests of the public, and the interests of children in particular, are protected. This amendment will further clarify this provision. With regard to the matter of child safety raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, this amendment provides that, in protecting the interests of children, an coimisiún will have particular commitment to the safety of children. As to the matter of promoting the interests of the public and children raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane, I am confident that the inserting the term "commitment" will clarify that coimisiún na meán will both guard and promote the interests of children as regards their safety. I note that the issue raised by amendment No. 9 tabled by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells is addressed by the amendment I have brought. I set out some of my concerns regarding amendment No. 8 on Committee Stage. I remain of the view that it is not appropriate to highlight the rights of privacy and reputation in relation to the functions of coimisiún na meán. The mechanism to protect and vindicate these rights is set out in other legislative instruments, specifically the Data Protection Act 2018 and the general data protection regulation in relation to privacy and the Defamation Act 2009 in relation to reputation. A reference to those rights may give rise to the expectation or inference that an coimisiún has some specific function in protecting those rights. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 12 and 13 address matters raised by Senators Warfield, Ó Donnghaile, Gavan, Boylan, Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage as regards the representation and participation of people on broadcasting and video-on-demand services. Section 7(2)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 7 of the Bill, requires that an coimisiún shall endeavour to ensure that broadcasting and video on-demand services available in the State are open, inclusive and pluralistic, bearing in mind various characteristics of the people of Ireland. In this regard, these amendments require coimisiún na meán to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland in terms of its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services. A distinction is made between participation, which means involvement in the activities of those services, and representation, which means being in programmes made available by those services. Furthermore, by locating this amendment within the matters regarding the people of the island of Ireland that coimisiún na meán must bear in mind in respect of its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services, the amendment covers the participation and representation of all groups of people living on this island. While consideration was given to specifying specific groups or protected characteristics in this amendment, I think it prudent to ensure that the amendment is drafted to cover all the people of our island in all of their diversity in order that there is no implication that any people are omitted by this provision, particularly cultural minorities. On amendment No. 14, amendment No. 12 addresses the concern regarding the right to and importance of cultural participation, which is a right ultimately set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 16 would require the commission to endeavour to ensure that regulatory arrangements support equality, human rights and participation in cultural life. I agree that these should be important principles in guiding the work of the commission and I believe that these principles are set out in various provisions of the Bill as appropriate. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment. Regarding amendment No. 17, addressing climate change and environmental degradation are some of the greatest challenges of our time. This will of course impact not only the media sector but our entire society. This Government has taken action through the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the adoption of carbon budgets and the comprehensive climate action plan. I agree it is important that an coimisiún should take account of these matters. That is why section 7(4) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 7 of the Bill, requires the commission to take account of the policies of the Government and the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications as regards climate change and environmental sustainability. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 18 addresses a matter raised by Senators Warfield, Ó Donnghaile, Gavan and Boylan during Committee Stage. This amendment, and its consequential amendments Nos. 19 to 22, inclusive, 28, 29 and 129, require coimisiún na meán to promote and encourage the use of the Irish language by communications media operating in the State. In this regard, communications media is defined in the Bill as:(a) broadcasting services,(b) audiovisual on-demand media services,(c) designated online services, or(d) newspapers or periodicals consisting substantially of news and comment on current affairs;As such, the amendment places a broad duty on an coimisiún to promote the use of the Irish language, both in terms of business use and content, by media in Ireland. The Bill as initiated had already set out the responsibility of an coimisiún to promote and stimulate the development of programmes in the Irish language, so this amendment is effectively further clarifying the important role an coimisiún will play as regards the promotion of the Irish language.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think the Senator may be speaking to the next grouping.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 23 to 25, inclusive, address a number of matters raised by Senators Carrigy, Malcolm Byrne, Cassells, Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage.As discussed on Committee Stage, section 7(3)(f) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, sets out the role of an coimisiún in researching, promoting and endorsing educational activities and co-operating with educational bodies in relation to all matters relating to its functions. This wide provision is designed to enable an coimisiún to play a key educational function regarding online safety and media literacy, amongst other matters under its remit. On Committee Stage, Senators suggested that this provision should be further clarified to ensure that an coimisiún could work with a wide array of bodies. In response to those points, amendment No. 25 in particular provides for specific references to coimisiún na meán engaging with sporting bodies, as raised by Senator Carrigy, and community bodies, as raised by Senators Ruane and Higgins, in relation to co-operation regarding educational initiatives and activities. This amendment also provides for specific reference to training bodies and local and representative bodies in this regard. As suggested by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells, amendment No. 24 inserts a specific reference to media literacy. I thank the Senators for their work on Committee Stage. Regarding amendments Nos. 26 and 27, I note that the matters raised within them are dealt with by the amendment I am bringing and accordingly I do not intend to accept those amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 30 addresses a number of matters raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Shane Cassells on Committee Stage, specifically the suggestion that coimisiún na meán should have regard to the policies of relevant Ministers and the Government regarding the safety of children and the regulation of gambling. This amendment provides for these matters by referring to the relevant Ministers with regard to each matter. For example, it refers to the Minister for Justice with regard to the regulation of gambling. It requires coimisiún na meán to have regard to the published policies of that Minister and the Government on that matter. Lead responsibilities for these matters remains with the relevant Minister and the public bodies under the Minister's aegis. I note the matters raised in amendments Nos. 31 and 32 are addressed by amendment No. 30 and, accordingly, I am not accepting them. Amendments Nos. 33 to 35, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Shane Cassells on Committee Stage and give further effect to the provision in amendment No. 30 stating that the coimisiún shall have regard to the policies of the Minister for Justice regarding the regulation of gambling. Amendment No. 35 states that coimisiún na meán, "co-operate, in relation to the regulation of gambling, with any public body concerned with that matter." The reference to public bodies in this regard is designed to account for the current situation where the regulation of gambling in Ireland is the responsibility of multiple public bodies. The proposed scenario under the gambling regulation Bill foresees a gambling authority having primary responsibility in this regard.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If it is a published policy then the Government must have regard to it. Does that clarify it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If it is a published policy by Government, then yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for amendments Nos. 41 to 43, inclusive. The posts of commissioner and executive chair of Coimisiún na Meán will be vitally important. They will collectively constitute an coimisiún itself and ultimately be responsible for the decisions that it will take. It is important to note at the outset that the commissioners are not simply equivalent to board members. They will be fulfilling executive functions and will be considered employees of an coimisiún. As such, the provisions of employment law apply to these appointments. This is a model adopted from other regulators in the State, such as ComReg and Commission for Regulation of Utilities. I understand that each of the amendments are based broadly on the provisions of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 which relate to the appointment of members of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. However, the more appropriate comparator for the commissioner roles in an coimisiún would be the director rather than the members of IHREC.  On amendment No. 41, as I previously stated on Committee Stage, I do not think it appropriate to set out a non-exhaustive set of knowledge or expertise required for an coimisiún. Matters pertaining to the selection criteria are best addressed within the context of the recruitment process run by the Public Appointments Service. Accordingly, I am not accepting this amendment.  I have previously addressed the point raised in amendment No. 43 during Committee Stage a number of times. As I noted then, the duty set out in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Act 2014 is already binding on public bodies, and I do not see the relevance or merit of singling out any single UN convention unless absolutely appropriate to do. Accordingly I am not accepting this amendment. On amendment No. 42, I did consider amendments proposed on Committee Stage which aimed to achieve a gender balance among commissioners, which is something I fully support in principle. The legal advice my Department received was that providing for the membership of a minimum number of women on Coimisiún na Meán, as envisaged by the proposed amendments, would be contrary to section 8 of the Employment Equality Acts, 1998-2015, as it may lead to discrimination on the grounds of gender. This Act prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee or prospective employee in relation to access to employment, which includes the recruitment process, and Article 14(1)(a) of directive 2006/54/EC, which provides for the equal treatment of men and women in terms of, among other things, access to employment.  The specialist nature of the commissioner posts, for example the online safety commissioner, is such that each post will be recruited individually, rather than as a part of a panel of commissioners. Accordingly, a requirement in law for a minimum number of women, or indeed men, in commissioner posts would compel the Public Appointments Service, at some point, to advertise a post open only to candidates of a particular gender, depending on the composition of the commission at any one time. This would be contrary to the Employment Equality Acts, 1998 – 2015. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 42. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 56 addresses a matter raised by Senators Malcolm Byrne and Cassells on Committee Stage. Its purpose is to require coimisiún na mean to establish a youth advisory committee as one of its advisory committees. In the drafting of the amendment, it was considered the age group the committee should represent should be those under 25 years of age including children, and that at least half of its members should be not more than 25 years of age. In this regard, the stated age profile aligns with the categorisation of young people being those persons under 25 years of age under the provisions for content production schemes at section 159F of the Broadcasting Act 2009 as amended by the Bill. The amendment provides that the youth advisory committee shall include representatives nominated, at the invitation of an coimisiún, by organisations representing children or young people. Finally, the amendment specifies that, in particular, the youth advisory committee shall advise an coimisiún on online safety matters. This is a recognition of the importance of the voice of young people in online safety in particular. They are often at the coalface of new technologies and, unfortunately, of some of the harms that can arise from them. The matter raised by amendment No. 57 has been dealt with by the Government amendment in this grouping.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 59 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage to explicitly require coimisiún na meán to have regard to the effective use of its resources as well as the economic and efficient use of resources in preparing its statement of strategy and work programme. While section 27(1)(c) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, sets out that the executive chairperson of an coimisiún would be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts for the effectiveness of its operations, I believe this amendment is useful clarification that an coimsiún shall have regard to all three components of the value-for-money framework for the public service, namely, efficiency, effectiveness and economy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 60 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding a requirement for coimisiún na meán, on the direction of the Minister, to provide its statement of strategy to relevant Oireachtas committees. This will allow the strategy statement to multiple Oireachtas committees where, for example, an coimisiún may be fulfilling functions of policy interest to those committees. Amendments Nos. 61 and 62 address a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding the co-operation agreements an coimisiún may enter into with bodies within and outside the State. The purpose of these amendments is to require an coimisiún to provide the joint committee with a copy of any co-operation agreements it enters into and publish any such co-operation agreements on a website maintained by it subject to the consent of all parties to the agreement any redactions that may be necessary. I thank the Senators for raising these matters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 64 and those that are consequential to it, namely, amendments Nos. 65 to 67, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senator Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding the notification of a person when his or her personal data is disclosed by an coimisiún. Section 33 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by this Bill, sets out the circumstances in which and the bodies to which an coimisiún may disclose a person's personal data. The purpose of these amendments is to require coimisiún na meán to endeavour to notify a person whose personal data under this section. This duty is qualified by the phrase "in so far as it is practicable to do so" to avoid an coimisiún being derelict in this duty by virtue of a person becoming highly difficult or impossible to contact. The intention behind amendment No. 63 is sufficiently captured in subsection 2 of section 33 of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by this Bill. Throughout subsection 2, it is specified that the commission shall only disclose personal data where it considers that it is necessary and proportionate for the purposes set out in the various paragraphs of subsection 2. As a result, I am not accepting amendment No. 63. Amendment No. 68 and the amendments consequential to it, namely, amendments Nos. 69 to 71, inclusive, address a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding data protection impact assessments. The purpose of these amendments is to require the Minister where they are prescribed by statutory instrument either new bodies to which the commission may disclose personal data or new matters regarding which the commission may disclose personal data to consider where necessary carrying out a data protection impact assessment and if so, to carry out that assessment. It is must be noted that section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act 2018 already requires a Minister proposing a legislative measure relating to the processing of personal data to consult with the Data Protection Commission during the process of preparing the legislative measure in question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I set out on Committee Stage, I would be concerned that, as drafted, this amendment would have the unintended consequence of preventing an employee of an coimisiún from seeking to influence any considerations of an coimisiún regarding the contract of that employee. This amendment would seem to prevent employees from representing their interests to an coimisiún, their employer. This provision in the Bill, as currently drafted, was designed to prevent those very such scenarios from occurring. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendment but the figure of €2 million is derived from the definition of a media business set out in Part 3 A of the Competition Act, as amended, which provides for a framework by which we assess media mergers in the State. For reasons of consistency and proportionality, we should continue to use this figure. I cannot accept the Senator’s amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding amendments Nos. 75 and 76, I am still considering this matter in the context of bringing a possible amendment on Dáil Committee Stage. The Senator made some important points regarding the use of the term "harm or offence". My officials are consulting the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland regarding the existing practical operation of this provision. It will be important that any amendment that may be brought forward does not have unintended effects. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept these amendments. Regarding amendment No. 77, the language in the Bill and extant Broadcasting Act reflects Article 40.6 of the Constitution. Given that the fundamental right to freedom of expression flows from both our Constitution and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and European Convention on Human Rights, there is a high bar for any steps that the State may take to limit freedom of expression. As I set out on Committee Stage, while Article 40.6 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, it requires that right to be qualified in certain instances. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. As I set out on Committee Stage, while I understand the intention of amendment No. 78, I do not think that section 46L(1) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by the Bill, needs to be qualified in the manner suggested by the amendment. The language used in the section reflects similar language in the extant Broadcasting Act which has not to date exercised a chilling effect on broadcast journalism. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendments. On the commercial communications for gambling, given that the gambling authority of Ireland to be established by the gambling regulation Bill will issue codes in respect of advertising, including in relation to online gambling, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 80, 93 or 109. On the issue of speculative financial activities, I note that the Central Bank of Ireland regulates the advertising of financial activities by financial services firms under its remit. The rules are set out in the consumer protection code published by the Central Bank. Finally, as regards crypto-assets, I note that the EU markets in crypto-assets regulation is currently under negotiation in Brussels and will set out a regulatory framework for those assets. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 81, 94 or 110.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for his amendment. As I set out on Committee Stage, I acknowledge that the use of the term "party political programme" rather than "party political broadcast", may give rise to some interpretative confusion if it is not clarified. In the Bill as initiated, the term "party political programme" was used instead of "party political broadcast" to ensure that the relevant sections covered both broadcasting services and video-on-demand services. Following the Committee Stage debate on the matter, I asked my officials to examine the issue further and to consult the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. This question will be subject to further examination over the summer with a view to bringing a Committee Stage amendment to the Bill in the Dáil if it is determined that one is required. Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Sherlock for bringing forward amendment No. 84 today. I acknowledge the work she is doing in this area, including the recent publication of a Bill last week. I will address the first point of the amendment setting out that broadcast programmes should reflect the participation and be responsive to the interests of all groups. I have sought to address this issue as broadly as possible through amendment No. 11, which requires Coimisiún na Meán to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland with regard to its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services. I am absolutely committed to supporting diversity, inclusion and the full and effective participation of women across sectors for which my Department is responsible. I agree with the intention underpinning amendment No. 84 regarding the equal participation of men and women on news and current affairs shows. If we are to use media service codes as the mechanism to achieve broadly equal participation, however, we may need to provide more detail within the Bill to guide an coimisiún in making codes. Provision may need to be made to specify what happens, for example, when there are an uneven number of guests. I have asked my officials to explore this matter further over the summer recess. As to the final point of amendment No. 84 relating to airplay quotas for women, artists and composers, I would like to continue to examine the issue further. I would caution, as I did on Committee Stage, that quotas based on the residence or citizenship of an artist are not permissible under EU law. Airplay quotas based on gender may be permissible under EU law, but without a residence criterion, simply introducing gender-based quotas may lead to unintended effects. Again, I have asked my officials to examine this issue further during the summer recess. I want to finish discussing amendment No. 84 by thanking Senator Sherlock for highlighting Why Not Her? for publishing the recent gender disparity data report 2022. It is evident from the data that while there has been improvement across a number of radio stations, more needs to be done to promote and safeguard women's voices on air. I thank the Senator for the other amendments. As I stated on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendment No. 86. The principles and policies set out in section 46N of the Broadcasting Act, as amended, must reflect the need that audiences are protected from harmful or offensive content being broadcast as this is an important consideration in making media service codes. I understand the point the Senator is making in looking at the issue more generally in the context of amendments Nos. 75 and 76, which concern a proposal by the Senators to amend similar wording regarding the duties of broadcasters and providers of video-on-demand services. As I stated on Committee Stage, I am advised that the proposed wording of amendment No. 87 seems to broadly achieve the same effect as the wording currently in the Bill. Therefore, I reject the amendment on that basis. Having further considered the matter, I am advised that the provision in amendment No. 88 could not be interpreted as to preclude the provision of programme material related to sexual conduct for educational purposes, particularly on important topics such as consent, sexual health and relationships. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 89 and 90 address an issue raised by a number of Senators to explicitly provide for specific matters concerning commercial communications, which Coimisiún na Meán may regulate through media service codes, including in relation to infant and follow-on formula. I commend the quality of the debate on this issue during Committee Stage and assure Senators that I have given this matter due consideration. As Senators are aware, the Bill as published conferred broad powers on an coimisiún to regulate commercial communications on video-on-demand and broadcasting services through media service codes. In particular, section 46N(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended, by the Bill, as initiated, sets out that an coimisiún may make media service codes, which may provide for standards and practices to ensure:(d) that commercial communications—(i) protect the interests of the audience, and(ii) in particular, where they relate to matters likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children, protect the interests of children having particular regard to the general public health interests of children. Subsection (5) of section 46N of the Act further specifies that an coimisiún may prohibit commercial communications "relating to foods or beverages considered by the Commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular those foods or beverages which contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars." Amendment No. 89 is intended to clarify the language in subsection (5) of section 46N by providing that an coimisiún may not only prohibit but may "restrict, in accordance with law" the commercial communications referenced. Amendment No. 90 amends subsection (5) of section 46N by providing for a specific reference to infant and follow-on formula. It should be emphasised that an coimisiún would already be provided with this authority through the general powers that will be invested in it to make media service codes in respect of advertising. The language in section 46N(5) is based on the language used in section 42(4) of the extant Broadcasting Act 2009, which provides for the power of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to make broadcasting codes. As I set out on Committee Stage, those broadcasting codes will remain in force until amended or replaced by media service codes. The current broadcasting code relating to commercial communications, the general commercial communications code states “Commercial communications for infant formula for use by infants during the first 6 months of life are prohibited.” This reflects EU law which sets out a number of rules regarding how infant and follow-on formula may or may not be advertised or otherwise marketed, and which is primarily enforced in Ireland by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Accordingly, my amendments primarily clarify already inherent powers of an coimisiún as regards infant and follow-on formula. Following an extensive Committee Stage debate in the Seanad and the very good points raised by Senators, I was convinced of the merits of making this power explicit. Finally, the issues raised by amendment No. 91 are addressed by the Government's amendments in this grouping.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the query raised by Senator Higgins, following advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the language will not only prohibit but may also restrict and it is in line with the commission's general powers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said on Committee Stage, conversion therapy is an abhorrent practice, which is why the programme for Government includes a commitment to legislate to ban its practice. As Senators will be aware, my colleague the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is leading this initiative. I understand how distressing it can be for LGBTI+ people to encounter advertisements for conversion therapy. Following the commitment I gave on Committee Stage to considering the matter, my officials have been engaging with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to ensure that both the practice and the advertisement of conversion therapy will be prohibited when legislation is brought forward. It is vital any legislation we bring forward be sufficiently robust to achieve its objective and, in particular, that we arrive at a legal definition of conversion therapy that is sufficient to capture the practice we all agree should be banned. An incomplete or insufficient definition of conversion therapy carries with it two risks. First, a definition may not be sufficiently expansive to capture completely all the incidences of what is a harmful practice to many people. Second, it may be drafted such that it may be construed incorrectly and may inadvertently capture, or be claimed or seen to capture, forms of gender-affirming care. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendments. Nevertheless, I commit to ensuring the advertisement of conversion therapy will be prohibited when the practice itself is banned to ensure that any prohibitions and bans brought forward will be fully aligned. I have asked my officials to continue to engage with officials in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As we discussed on Committee Stage, I do not see the rationale for setting a time period in legislation for public consultation on a media service code or rule. Given the principles underpinning the establishment of coimisiún na meán, I do not anticipate an coimisiún running a time-constrained public consultation process to deliberately avoid scrutiny. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 97 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage regarding inserting a time period within which an coimisiún would be required to notify a complainant when his or her complaint was referred to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service or was dismissed. The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to notify a complainant within 30 days of any referral of his or her complaint to a broadcaster or provider of a video on-demand service or of the dismissal of that complaint.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have addressed the intention of amendment No. 98 as regards commercial communications in respect of food through amendment No. 105, which will be discussed later. As regards the references to gambling, alcohol and weapons, I note that the gambling regulation Bill will regulate the advertisement of gambling, that alcohol advertising is regulated under the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, and that the Bill as published already provides for an coimisiún to create online safety codes to ensure "that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children". I do not propose to accept the amendment. Regarding amendment No. 112, I note once again the Bill as initiated provides broad authority to an coimisiún to regulate commercial communications through online safety codes. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 99 would amend section 139E of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill, which relates to the process for designating online services for regulation and the matters which an coimisiún shall have regard to when deciding to make a designation. As I stated on Committee Stage, I do not see the relevance of inserting a reference to an individual UN convention in this context and accordingly I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We had a respectful debate on this matter on Committee Stage. As I said then, we both agree that an coimisiún must be conferred with robust and proportionate powers of investigation and compliance in order to discharge its functions effectively. This is particularly important when we are considering compliance with online safety codes addressing harmful online content. As I said on Committee Stage, I respect the intention of the Senator's amendment, but my advice remains the same. I cannot accept the amendments for the reasons we discussed on Committee Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As regards amendment No. 102, it is important to acknowledge that there is a very real issue with young children accessing online services that were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue that I am particularly aware of, both as a parent of young children and as the chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety. In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids. This strategy is built upon three pillars focused on child protection in the online environment, digital empowerment and active participation. Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, including through age verification and age-appropriate design. In this regard, the commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the Digital Services Act, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments. The commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content. In order to facilitate age verification, the commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age-verification methods. I will be asking an coimisiún to look at this issue as a priority, particularly through engaging on the Better Internet for Kids strategy, to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. As regards amendment No. 128, as I said on Committee Stage, the content limitation notice provisions in the Bill apply to harmful online content and not age-inappropriate online content so as to limit the potential involvement of the an coimisiún in matters regarding individual pieces of content to only that content which is expressly deemed harmful under the Bill. I cannot accept either of the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment 105 and its consequential amendments Nos. 114 and 115 address an issue raised by a number of Senators to explicitly provide for specific matters concerning commercial communications that coimisiún na meán may regulate through online safety codes. I commend the quality of the debate on this issue on Committee Stage and assure Senators that I have given the matter due consideration. The amendments I have tabled explicitly provide coimisiún na meán with the power to prohibit or restrict through online safety codes commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered by the commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children, in particular infant formula, follow-on formula or foods or beverages that contain fat, trans-fatty acids, salts or sugars. It is important to note that an coimisiún would already be provided with the general power under the Bill as initiated to regulate advertising of such matters through online service codes. This is contained in section 139K(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which states that online safety codes may make provision with a view to ensuring "that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children". I also note the amendment No. 105 is based on the language set out in section 46N, subsection (5) of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, which relates to media service codes. This is to ensure that the language used as regards commercial communications is consistent between media service codes and online safety codes.
 As regards amendment No. 105, it should be recognised that it does not directly prohibit or restrict commercial communications relating to any type of food or beverage. That will fundamentally be a decision that an coimisiún may take through the making of an online safety code following consultation, particularly with the relevant public health bodies, who will be best placed to advice an coimisiún on the relevant public health law and advice. Amendment No. 105 addresses the points raised via amendments Nos. 101 and 103. On amendment 104, I would note once again the Bill as initiated provides broad authority to an coimisiún to regulate commercial communications through online safety codes. On Committee Stage, I also noted that the advertisement of alcohol is primarily being addressed through the Public Health (Alcohol) Act, which contains strong measures to limit the exposure of children to advertising. Regarding Senator Black's question, amendment No. 105 provides that "an online safety code may prohibit or restrict, in accordance with law, the inclusion in programmes or user-generated content of commercial communications relating to foods or beverages considered by the Commission to be the subject of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children". Alcohol would probably be considered a matter of public concern in respect of the general public health interests of children.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 106 appears to be a reference to section 30 of the Data Protection Act 2018 regarding direct marketing profiling and microtargeting. The commencement of that section of the Act is a matter for the Minister for Justice.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and the Digital Services Act, DSA, are complementary pieces of legislation. One of the key drivers of the Bill is the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive, AMSD, into Irish law. The implementation of the directive in respect of online services, specifically video-sharing platform services, is provided for under the regulatory framework for online safety in this Bill. In this regard, the AMSD is explicitly recognised by the DSA as a distinct and complementary law to the proposed regulation. In relation to the regulation of other online services, the Bill provides for a regulatory framework for online safety that is designed to be adaptable and responsive to changes in Irish and EU law. It is clear that further legislation, in addition to this Bill, will be necessary to ensure appropriate alignment of our regulatory systems with the proposed regulation, for both coimisiún na meán and other regulators. I note that the European Parliament held its final vote approving the DSA last Tuesday, 5 July. This paves the way for formal adoption by the Council in September of this year. Ireland will have until 1 January 2024 to ensure that provisions of the DSA are provided for and supported by Irish law where necessary. Of course, the obligations on very large online platforms and very large online search engines, which will be regulated by the European Commission, will apply earlier - four months after they have been designated as such by the Commission. The Government has already decided that coimisiún na meán, which is to be established through this Bill, will act as the primary regulator or digital services co-ordinator, DSC, under the DSA. The Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the DSC, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. As I said stated on Committee Stage, in establishing an coimisiún and setting out a regulatory framework for online safety and a robust and fair enforcement and investigation mechanism, this Bill is establishing the scaffolding and structures to support future and forthcoming legislation, including the Digital Services Act. In this regard, the Bill will assist in the implementation of the regulation and not hinder it. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment. Having listened to the Senator's contribution, it may be worth pointing out that private messaging services are not covered by the DSA.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are regulating for Ireland, not the whole of the EU, with regard to private messaging.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 123 and its consequential amendments Nos. 118 to 122, inclusive, address the matter raised by a number of Senators and explicitly provide for specific matters concerning commercial communications which Coimisiún na Meán may regulate through online safety codes. The purpose of these amendments is to give further effect to these matters by providing that coimisiún na meán may consult a public health authority before making any such provision in an online safety code. This mirrors the existing similar provision in section 46N on media service codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 124 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to publish any reports regarding the operation of online safety codes it provides to the Minister on its website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 127 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to publish any rules it may make regarding the conduct of investigations by authorised officers on its website. I note that these particular rules would, in any case, be made by statutory instrument and published as a matter of course.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	For clarity, amendment No. 133 is included in this group but its proposers are not here. Should I still speak to it?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 130 addresses a matter raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane during Committee Stage. The purpose of this amendment is to provide that coimisiún na meán may fund, through a content production scheme made under section 159F of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill, new audiovisual programmes relating to biodiversity. Following the Seanad debate and the points raised by Senators, I thought there was merit in clarifying that it is intended that programmes related to biodiversity may funded through a scheme. The purpose of No. 131 is to change the reference in this provision from “human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion” to “human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion”. This is to address the point raised by Senators Higgins and Ruane during Seanad Committee Stage regarding consistency with other legislation which tends to refer to these human rights, equality, diversity and inclusion as distinctive concepts rather than treating them as a subset of human rights. On amendment No. 132, I noted during Committee Stage that I believe the general references to science and education in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F of the Broadcasting Act as amended by the Bill would already allow such programmes relating to digital empowerment and data protection awareness to be funded. I have not changed my position and will not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 133 provides that a content production scheme may be co-managed or delegated to another agency, and specifically references Screen Ireland in this regard. Given their complementary functions, I expect that coimisiún na meán and Screen Ireland will work closely together, in terms of both policy frameworks such as the audiovisual action plan and in terms of sharing information and knowledge regarding the operation of support schemes. However, I do not propose to accept this amendment as coimisiún na meán will include a media development commissioner whose remit will include the administration of any content production scheme. I welcome the intention of amendment No. 134, which would provide that an coimisiún shall have regard for the need to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in new audiovisual programmes funded by content production scheme. During Committee Stage I noted that I would be worried about specifying that any one group may imply that it should be prioritised for participation in a manner that implied other groups may not be. That is why I proposed amendment No. 11, which requires coimisiún na meán to bear in mind the participation and representation of the people of the island of Ireland in relation to its policies towards broadcasting and on-demand media services. This amendment is intended to include people with disabilities and ensure their further and adequate participation and representation. Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 134. On Committee Stage, I indicated that I would give further consideration to amendment No. 135 in the context of Report Stage. I recognise the intention and would note that the Irish language element of the amendment may be adequately covered by the requirement that 25% of the annual funds of a content production scheme should be allocated to programmes in the Irish language. I recognise the importance of both adequate access rules and participation and representation in programmes for users of the Irish Sign Language. On access rules, section 46O of the Broadcasting Act as amended provides for an coimisiún to make media service rules requiring media service providers to make their services accessible, including provision of a sign language service. I also expect that amendment No. 11 will require an coimisiún to consider the participation and representation of users of Irish Sign Language as regards its policies. Accordingly, I do not accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe I did all of them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Did Deputy Chambers do one? He did. I had a family bereavement.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their kind words. This legislation is of such significance that it was worth every moment of the 30 hours we have spent discussing it. I thank the Oireachtas committee for its extensive pre-legislative scrutiny. This time last year it was seeking an extension to allow it more time, which I was happy to agree to because the legislation is so significant. Senator Carrigy has reminded me that I had a family bereavement during this process. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for stepping in for me that day. I thank all of the Senators here for what was a very constructive and respectful debate throughout. I thank them for that engagement. I also thank my officials, who must be exhausted. There was a lot of engagement with Senators outside of the Seanad and I thank the officials for doing that on my behalf. Gabhaim míle buíochas leo.
