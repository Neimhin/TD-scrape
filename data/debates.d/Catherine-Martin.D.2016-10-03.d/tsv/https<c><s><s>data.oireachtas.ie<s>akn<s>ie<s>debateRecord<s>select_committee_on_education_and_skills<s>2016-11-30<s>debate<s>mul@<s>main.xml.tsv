CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for coming. He referred to a saving of €24 million on primary teachers' salaries. That indicates that there is room to further address the issue of pay inequality in the teaching profession. There is quite an increase of €100 million in capital expenditure. Was there a huge underestimation of how much would be needed to complete projects? There is huge concern in my constituency about the number of primary school projects that have been announced. They are badly needed because, as the Minister knows, places cannot even be found for some primary school students who were displaced owing to a recent school closure. There is concern about insufficient investment in second level schools and that we will reach a stage where children will not be able to find places in such schools. Is there a need for a review of expenditure on secondary school projects? In respect of the allocation of €37 million for superannuation payments to teaching and non-teaching staff, will the figure increase year on year? Is there an exact way of forecasting what will be needed in future years?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On that concern I raised, there is a feeling that what happens when both second-level schools and primary schools are announced is the staff go off into one Department but those who are designing the second-level schools never talk to those who are designing the primary schools, and then there is a massive problem. I was talking to a planner recently and that is the view.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My issue was not about the type of second-level schools or parents' preferences. There is a huge concern that, a few years down the road, there will not be enough second level schools in the constituency which I represent. I wonder if this is reflected in other constituencies. Primary schools are badly needed because of population growth but when children who are now in junior and senior infants get to sixth class there will not be enough places in second level schools.
