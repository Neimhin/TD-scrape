CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá áthas orm labhairt leis na Teachtaí, maraon leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Naughton, faoi théarnamh ár n-éarnálacha turasóireachta agus eitlíóchta, dhá earnáil a bhfuil dlúthnasc eatarthu. I am pleased to have the opportunity, along with the Minister of State to address the House on the recovery and reopening of our tourism and aviation sectors, two sectors with close links. The past 18 months have been incredibly difficult for everyone working in the tourism industry. However, as our economy and society have reopened over the last few months and as pandemic restrictions are eased further, we can begin to look forward to a sustainable recovery for this vital indigenous economic sector. The importance of tourism in Ireland cannot be understated. It is a sector that has made a huge economic and social contribution in recent years across the country. I am confident that, with our support, it will fully recover from the crisis and thrive again in a manner that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. In 2019, prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, tourism was worth €9.5 billion in total to our economy from overseas tourists and the fares they generated, together with domestic tourism. Fáilte Ireland has previously estimated that 23 cent in every euro generated in tourism expenditure went back to the Exchequer in tax revenues. This equates to €1.8 billion in Exchequer revenue. Tourism supported 260,000 jobs across the country, both in remote rural areas and in our towns and cities. It sustains communities and drives regional development in a manner that most other industries struggle to emulate. The tourism landscape changed drastically in early 2020 with the outbreak and spread of Covid-19. It has had a devastating impact on the tourism industry in Ireland and across the world. The pandemic struck Irish tourism towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, by which stage only 10% to 15% of annual overseas spending would have accrued. After the first quarter there was a collapse in overseas travel, and the OECD estimates that international tourism worldwide fell by 80% in 2020. Since the advent of Covid-19 and the consequential and necessary public health measures, many of the jobs supported by tourism have been lost or are surviving with State support, and income from the sector is a fraction of what it was in 2019. Last year, the tourism recovery task force estimated that of the 260,000 jobs in the sector prior to the onset of the pandemic, 180,000 are either lost or vulnerable.The successful domestic summer seasons last year and this year have been very welcome and helpful to the sector. However, the sector cannot begin to fully recover until inbound overseas tourism resumes in a meaningful way. Last year, a tourism recovery task force was put in place to prepare a tourism recovery plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector can adapt and recover in a changed tourism environment as a result of the crisis. The task force presented the plan to me in September of 2020 and it has been more than useful for both my Cabinet colleagues and me in considering measures that can assist the sector. I appointed a recovery oversight group to oversee the implementation of the tourism recovery plan and it reports to me on a regular basis with updates on implementation and the recovery of the sector. The group has just submitted its third report to me. I will use the report as an important policy consideration as I continue my work, alongside my colleagues, to support the tourism sector in this most challenging period. It is clear that substantial progress has been made in helping tourism to survive and recover from the Covid crisis. Since the beginning of the pandemic in Ireland, it has been clear that the tourism sector would be severely impacted. My Department, together with Fáilte Ireland and the Government, has responded to this challenge by providing the supports that would enable strategic tourism businesses survive the pandemic and re-emerge in a safe and sustainable manner. In the final months of 2020, I allocated funding to Fáilte Ireland to administer a Covid-19 adaptation fund, an Ireland-based inbound agents business continuity scheme and a coach tourism operators business continuity scheme. Fáilte Ireland also administered the restart grant plus for bed and breakfasts, on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In budget 2021, I secured a record level of funding of just under €221 million for tourism, including €55 million for Fáilte Ireland's tourism business continuity scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to support strategic tourism businesses to survive through the pandemic and help drive the recovery of tourism. In total, since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, I understand that in excess of €75 million has been paid out in dedicated tourism supports. The VAT reduction to 9% until September 2022, has also given the tourism and hospitality sector some additional breathing space, and is helping with its viability and price competitiveness. In addition to these direct tourism-specific supports, tourism businesses have benefited from horizontal supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, as well as the commercial rates waiver, tax debt warehousing and other initiatives such as pathways to work and the business resumption support scheme. One striking statistic is that employees in the accommodation and food services sector alone have been supported to the tune of over €1.5 billion from the EWSS and its predecessor the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS. This is a remarkable figure which shows the Government's commitment to those whose livelihoods have been so negatively impacted by the crisis. In the economic recovery plan, we acknowledge that continuing support for the tourism sector will be important for the coming adjustment period, as public health restrictions are lifted and international travel is restored. I am currently engaged with my Government colleagues in preparing for next week's budget. We will consider both the importance of economy-wide support measures for tourism jobs and businesses and any additional sector-specific measures which may be required. Any further measures must be directed at those businesses and jobs with ongoing difficulties and the restoration of international tourism. While our domestic tourism market has helped sustain the industry, it now needs international visitors to return in significant numbers in order to facilitate a meaningful recovery. In 2019, overseas tourists spent more than €5.1 billion in our economy. Since the easing of restrictions on 19 July, overseas visitors have started to return to our shores but at a much lower level than prior to the pandemic. The competition globally to attract tourists will be more challenging than ever. To this end, Tourism Ireland has started to roll out the green carpet and welcome back our international visitors, as it works to encourage as many overseas holidaymakers as possible to book Ireland for their next holiday destination. The concept centres on creating a commitment to travel by encouraging people to Press the Green Button - green being the universal colour of go and instinctively connected with the island of Ireland. I was happy to help Tourism Ireland launch this new campaign in both the UK and the United States recently when I travelled to both markets to engage with our industry partners in order to reassure them that Ireland was open and waiting to welcome back visitors. Connectivity is a major part of the picture here. Air access for tourism is a virtuous circle. Increased access drives tourism and increased demand for tourism helps to increase air capacity. I am aware, of course, that aviation poses challenges for the environment and I look forward to what the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has to say on that. At the start of this week, the Government launched the new National Development Plan 2021-2030. With provision for €165 billion worth of investment, this is the largest national development plan in the history of the State. The capital investment priorities for my Department will support economic recovery and resilience in the tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sport and media sectors, while also enhancing individual and community well-being and advancing social, economic and environmental sustainability to protect our unique cultural, linguistic and sporting heritage for generations to come. The Covid-19 pandemic had a devastating impact on tourism. As we rebuild this vital sector, we must do so in a way that ensures the contribution of the tourism sector to our economic recovery, providing sustainable employment across Ireland in a way that protects our unique environment. With specific regard to tourism capital investment, I look forward to seeing the delivery of projects that will support a sustainable tourism sector - sustainable from an environmental, social, and economic perspective. The new national development plan provides for the delivery of enhanced amenity through investment in tourism product development, including through Platforms for Growth, Fáilte Ireland's capital investment strategy to target projects that have the greatest potential to grow and foster sustainable tourism. I am also excited about the investments we are making in redeveloping and enhancing the sustainability of our national and regional cultural infrastructure, including significant capital projects at our national cultural institutions. For example, the ambitious redevelopment plans for the Crawford Art Gallery in Cork will open up our national collections to even more people, enhancing the visitor experience of the gallery while also protecting and enhancing the sustainability of this historic building at the heart of the city. While many challenges lie ahead, the Government is committed to continuing support for tourism and to working towards its full reopening and recovery. From a tourism perspective, a real recovery will only be possible when inbound international tourism returns. Compared with most other EU member states, Ireland's tourism sector is highly dependent on overseas travel. Such travel accounts for some 75% of spending in Ireland by tourists. Since the pandemic there has been a complete collapse in overseas travel to Ireland. That does not mean that we should not maximise the domestic opportunity over the next few years. While the level of demand from the home market cannot compensate for the loss of overseas tourism, it plays a vital bridging role in getting the industry through the current survival phase. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector, with up to two-thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure that there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages, A collaborative approach by stakeholders, including industry bodies, education providers, Departments and State agencies will be required to address the skills shortages in the tourism sector. As tourism and hospitality provide significant employment in all parts of the country, this will be vital for the recovery of the sector. Prior to the pandemic it was becoming clear that the traditional model of tourism was changing. As a Green Party Minister, I am concerned about the tourism impacts on our natural environment and local communities. In this regard, officials within my Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which seeks to mainstream the concept of sustainability. The development of this new policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want up to 2030 and beyond. The tourism sector has proven itself resilient before. I am optimistic that, as our economy and society begin to open up, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for their important contributions to this debate. We are on track to remove most remaining restrictions from 22 October and this will provide a further boost to the tourism sector. In the meantime, our primary focus is to continue with our careful and gradual approach to easing remaining restrictions and facilitating full reopening from 22 October, while supporting the maximum reach of the vaccine programme and allowing time to achieve the full benefits for all those currently being vaccinated. The Government will meet in advance of 22 October to decide on the next phase of easing the restrictions and on what, if any, further guidance might be required beyond that date. Overall, I am confident that our trajectory in managing Covid is very positive. This along with the very successful vaccination programme mean that we should be viewed as a safe destination for holidaymakers. I will ask our agencies to convey this message. With regard to supporting direct access to regional airports, I am providing funding to Tourism Ireland for the regional co-operative market access scheme. The purpose of this scheme is to promote direct air and sea access routes into Ireland's tourism experience brand regions, with matching funding from airlines, sea carriers, airports, ports and regional tourism stakeholders, including local authorities. In this regard, I am happy to report that, for 2021, I have increased the funding available for the scheme to €3 million from €2.5 million, the amount available last year before the pandemic struck. To help to stimulate inbound tourism directly into the regions, Tourism Ireland is currently engaged with a number of air carriers to support the promotion of routes into our regional airports. Aside from this, Tourism Ireland also engages in co-operative marketing with Dublin Airport to support inbound routes with strong tourism potential. With specific regard to business tourism and related events, Fáilte Ireland recently briefed the industry on its plans to support the sector and rebuild a strong pipeline of events. Thanks to the collaborative efforts of the industry and the tourism agencies, I understand that over 280 important events lined up before the pandemic, but subsequently postponed, have now been rescheduled. That is worth approximately €200 million to the economy. Another exciting event that has been rescheduled is the highly anticipated Aer Lingus College Football Classic, which was originally due to kick off in Dublin in 2020. It will now take place in 2022 with the first game between Northwestern University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. In its first year, this event will attract in excess of 25,000 visitors, most from the US, and many are expected to stay for a week or longer. It is expected to generate some €63 million alone for the Irish economy next year. As ever, these types of events, including the Ryder Cup in 2027 in Adare, County Limerick, are also a fantastic opportunity to showcase our beautiful country and the many attractions it offers as a holiday destination. As regards specific queries raised by Members, my officials have been taking note of them and we will follow up in writing with the Members. Before handing over to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I will refer briefly to sustainable tourism. While our focus is correctly on the survival of the tourism sector, we must also begin planning for a sustainable recovery. The global health crisis has left the tourism sector in a state of shock, but it has also provided an opportunity to address sustainable tourism development in a more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following the crisis. A sustainable tourism working group established under the Tourism Action Plan 2019-2021 published a report setting out the ambition for sustainable tourism in Ireland as well as a number of guiding principles for sustainable tourism development. This group has also drawn up an interim action plan, which will be published shortly, that aims to promote sustainable tourism practices up to 2023. In line with the programme for Government commitments, as I have outlined, officials in my Department have initiated the development of a new national tourism policy which mainstreams sustainability. The development of this new policy will be informed by, and build upon, the work undertaken by the sustainable tourism working group and will be consistent with our sectoral climate change targets and commitments. It is clear that the traditional model of tourism is changing and the development of the new national tourism policy gives us an opportunity to set out what type of tourism sector we want up to 2030 and beyond. Tourism has proven itself to be resilient previously and I am confident that, with the support of the Government, it will recover from this crisis and thrive again in a manner that is economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. Tuigim go maith na dúshláin ollmhóra atá roimh an turasóireacht agus leanfaidh mé ag obair le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas chun a chinntiú go dtabharfar gach tacaíocht is féidir don earnáil chun é a chur ar a cumas teacht slán ón bpaindéim agus tógáil ar bhealach níos seasmhaí, níos digití, níos glaise agus níos inbhuanaithe. I am fully aware of the massive challenges facing tourism and I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Government to ensure the sector is given every possible support to enable it to emerge intact from the pandemic and to build back in a more resilient, digitalised, green and sustainable way.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "That" and substitute the following:"Dáil Éireann resolves that the Broadcasting (Amendment) (Protection of Journalism) Bill 2019 be deemed to be read a second time this day eighteen months, to allow for greater analysis of the complex issues concerned and for such considerations to be taken into account in further scrutiny of the Bill." Is mór agam deis a fháil labhairt leis an Teach faoin gceist thábhachtach a ardaítear sa Bhille seo agus gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí Cullinane agus Crowe as aird a thabhairt uirthi. Is fiú i gcónaí díospóireacht chuiditheach a dhéanamh sa Teach. Tuigim an réasúnaíocht a bhaineann le moladh an Bhille seo. As Deputy Cullinane rightly pointed out on First Stage, the banning of journalists by media outlets is a step in the wrong direction.It is something that needs to be challenged in order for the media sector to function as it should. Journalism at its best informs us as citizens, engages us as a society and challenges us as representatives. It is a public good and I recognise it as such. It plays a crucial role in shaping a healthy democracy and is one of the pillars of a democratic society. A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy and freedom of speech, as well as to the provision of quality and impartial information. As Minister, I firmly believe in the safeguarding of media plurality and in protecting the freedom of journalists to perform their jobs without fear of reprisals from other media organisations, such as in the form of bans. To elaborate on this point, I bring to the attention of the House the adoption by Ireland of the Council of Europe resolution on the safety of journalists. The resolution was tabled at the Conference of Ministers responsible for Media and Information Society, which I attended in June of this year. Point two of the resolution is particularly relevant in the context of this debate. In summary, it asserts that the key role of journalists and other media actors in exposing wrongdoing, corruption, crime and abuse of power exposes them to intimidation, threats, harassment, violence, arbitrary surveillance or interception of communications, misuse of national laws, abusive litigation and sometimes to arbitrary deprivation of liberty. In adopting the resolution, the Government affirmed its commitment to the support and protection of journalists. We acknowledged that in order for journalists and other media actors to effectively and safely fulfil their role as public watchdog, they require appropriate protection. They also require an enabling environment for freedom of expression and media freedom in which vigorous public debate can thrive. The Government recognises that journalists and other media actors play a central role in enabling the full enjoyment of freedom of expression. They are critical to the healthy functioning of a democracy. In support of this point, I bring the attention of Deputies to a line from the final declaration adopted by the Conference of Ministers. It asserts that all forms of attacks on journalists and other media actors intended to undermine their ability to perform their public watchdog role must be regarded as attacks on democracy and strongly condemned. It is the responsibility of states to act to effectively prevent, investigate and sanction threats and attacks of all kinds against journalists. The relevant provisions of Bunreacht na hÉireann, as well as Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights, remain the fundamental standards to be applied in the exercise of those rights. Robust frameworks for the protection of freedom of expression and freedom of the media must be in place to ensure that journalists and the media can effectively perform their professional duties, including in times of crisis. These points demonstrate the seriousness with which this Government views the importance of journalistic freedoms. As Minister I thank the Deputy once again for bringing forward this Bill so that a thorough debate can be held, and all arguments considered. Discrimination of any sort is something this Government vehemently opposes. As the House is aware, the Bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Act 2009 by making it a breach of contractor licence for a broadcaster to prohibit any member of the National Union of Journalists from appearing on its communications media for reason or reasons of occupation, employer, company relationship or employment status. However, while I welcome the debate brought on by the proposal of the Bill, I believe that, as drafted, it raises complexities. These could lead to significant unintended consequences which I will set out presently. It is the view of the Government that these issues require further consideration to ensure the Bill is suitably robust to ensure its effectiveness. It is on this basis that the Government is proposing to defer the Second Reading of the Bill for 18 months in order to allow further consideration of the matter. The proposed change to the Broadcasting Act envisaged in the Bill would lead to a requirement to amend existing broadcasting contracts. Potential inconsistencies of application of the measure may arise across the broadcasting sector, as contracts are agreed for a fixed period of up to ten years. This would lead to a piecemeal landscape in which contract changes are implemented by the broadcasting regulator on an incremental basis over an extended duration of time, in line with the timeline for contract renewal for each individual broadcaster. Furthermore, as the Bill provides for the amendment to be inserted in Part 6 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, it would only apply to commercial and community broadcasters, and not to services operated by RTÉ or TG4. As a Government, it is important that we take account of the right of broadcasters to determine the type of programming and content they wish to broadcast, subject, of course, to meeting relevant licensing and legislative obligations. It is a long-established principle that a decision about who should be invited or not invited to appear on Irish radio or television programmes is solely a matter for individual broadcasters. As the Bill could constrain broadcasters' freedom of action on decisions regarding inclusion or exclusion from programming content, the implications of the Bill in the context of freedom of expression would require further research to establish the legality of such an approach. Another issue with the Bill is the lack of detail as to how it would work in practice. It is unclear how the regulator would determine whether a violation has occurred. For example, it is unclear whether this would have to be explicit written policy or an unwritten practice within an organisation. Furthermore, it is not clear how an investigation would initially be triggered. The Bill does not give details as to whether, for instance, such an investigation would be on foot of a complaint from a member of the public or initiated as part of the regulator's routine compliance monitoring. I have concerns regarding the fact the Bill only specifies members of the National Union of Journalists as being able to benefit from this protection. Consequently, it may be deemed discriminatory to journalists not affiliated with this union but who are members of other recognised unions, such as journalists who are part of unions in other member states. Moreover, the Bill does not account for journalists who do not belong to a recognised union. It must also be noted that the context in which the Bill was initiated was the ban imposed by Communicorp Media on journalists from The Currency and The Irish Times from appearing on its radio stations. As the latter of the aforementioned bans was rescinded following a change in ownership of Communicorp Media in June 2021, the Government does not consider that there is an urgent requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature. What matters more is that we get it right. As regards the next steps, the timed amendment I am proposing asks that we take the necessary time to consider the issues and complexities that I have put forward this evening. To reiterate, we as a Government are keenly aware of the issues raised by the Bill, and I thank the Deputy for bringing it forward and encouraging this debate. A free and pluralist media is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy. It should quite rightly be supported. In times of crisis, freedom of expression and information and freedom of the media are vital components of the functioning of democratic societies. As I stated, the Government deems this issue of the utmost importance. We will continue to strive to foster free, open and democratic debate across all forms of media. Ireland's adoption of the resolution on the safety of journalists at a European level reinforces this statement. This timed amendment will allow for the necessary care to be taken when assessing the proposal in the Bill. I know the Deputies speaking on the Bill will make a valuable contribution to the further consideration of the proposals at the heart of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Members who have contributed to the debate. I am grateful to Deputy Cullinane and other colleagues for highlighting the issue and for contributing to the debate. I do not doubt the Bill has been tabled in a sincere effort to ensure the Irish media landscape continues to be an open and pluralist space. I have listened to the Deputies with interest and I thank Members of the House for all of their comments. We agree that the banning of journalists by media organisations raises serious concerns and we must now ensure we consider all of the points raised in the debate. It is also imperative that we take into account possible future consequences of the Bill. As I stated earlier, there are fundamental weaknesses in the structure of the Bill, as drafted, and it is crucial to address these before considering whether a legislative response is the right one and, if so, what approach that legislation should take. A strong and independent media sector is central to our parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and the provision of quality and impartial information. As a government we firmly believe in the safeguarding of media plurality and in protecting the freedom of journalists to perform their jobs without fear of media organisations. Our work at European level, as highlighted earlier, shows the seriousness with which we treat the function of journalists and the media in this country. In adopting the resolution on the safety of journalists we reinforce the idea that a functioning democracy requires media freedom. I want to bring the attention of the House to the 2021 World Press Freedom Index as compiled by the international non-profit organisation, Reporters Without Borders, in which Ireland ranks 12th in the world out of 180 countries listed, just two places outside the top ten. This serves to emphasise the high regard with which we hold press freedom in this country. However, I must reiterate the concerns raised earlier in the debate. It is the Government's view that these concerns require further consideration to ensure the Bill is suitably robust and that it is the most appropriate course of action. Of major concern is that the Bill may be rushed through at this point and have far-reaching consequences in future. The Bill was tabled in the context of bans that have now been rescinded. It is essential that we take into account there is not a requirement in the short term for legislation of this nature. The proposed 18-month period will allow us to give adequate consideration to the Bill and ensure we can explore the full range of policy options around the matter. Allowing sufficient time to consider all of the issues involved is the best way to make sure any legislation or policy measure we put in place on the matter takes a careful, measured and well-evidenced approach and will do the best for journalists and our media sector. A free and pluralist media is one of the cornerstones of a modern democracy and we should do our utmost to protect and support this ideal. As I indicated, I am broadly supportive of the aims and objectives of the Bill but I have laid out the issues and reasons for proposing an amendment with regard to 18 months. As the Deputy is aware, the online safety and media regulation Bill is being drafted. It is a priority for the Government. The Deputy is also aware it will provide for the establishment of a media commission. Once established, it is my intention to consult it on this specific issue. The establishment of the media commission seemed to be something the Deputy has not considered during the debate. The period of assessment sought is very much needed, particularly for a new media commission to have a role. Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Teach arís as páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht seo ar bhealach tuisceanach agus soiléir agus táim ag tnúth le tuilleadh plé a dhéanamh ar an ábhar seo.
