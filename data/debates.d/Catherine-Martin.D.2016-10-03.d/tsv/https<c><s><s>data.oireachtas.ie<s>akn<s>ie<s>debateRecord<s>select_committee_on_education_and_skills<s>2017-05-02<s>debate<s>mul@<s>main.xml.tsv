CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wholeheartedly agree with Deputy Byrne and echo his call on the Minister. It would be very helpful at this stage if the Minister would commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work. It is no longer a matter of newly qualified teachers, NQTs, but lesser-paid teachers, LPTs. If we are truly to value education and the job primary school teachers do, in particular in shaping our young children, we should hear the Minister commit - just that word - to the principle of equal pay for equal work.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the money that is available to the Minister for the provision of salary increases for TUI and INTO members, what moneys are available to him should the ASTI come on board? I am sure the Minister is watching the call for the special convention within the ASTI. Who knows what could happen there. Something could happen sooner than we think. Is the money there if the ASTI comes on board? On middle management, if that is the word for it, can I discuss that here within secondary schools?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am glad the Minister is carrying out a review but it is really at crisis level. The Minister knows how vulnerable many children in these schools are. I am aware of one DEIS school where the principal has had to take on the role of student council liaison teacher, traditionally a B post. The same principal now holds, due to retirement, the A post of first year head. He is dealing with first years transitioning from primary to second level. It is a crucial role. The usual route for disciplinary procedures in a school is from class teacher to year head to vice principal to principal, but for students in first year in this school their year head is their principal. From a discipline point of view it is chaos. It is a recipe for disaster. That needs to be addressed as soon as possible as there are vulnerable children suffering. I welcome the two thirds restoration in the guidance allocation. What is the timeframe for the full restoration of guidance teachers? I am sure it was just a turn of phrase but, with all due respect, I do not think teachers would appreciate the phrase "time off" in respect of training for junior cycle. It is not time off. Teachers are preparing to do their jobs. It is work. I assume that was just a turn of phrase and there was no negative intent.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have a comment on what I said earlier and on what Deputies Byrne and Nolan have brought up.I would welcome the restoration of ex quota guidance counsellors. I would be appalled if there is a play on words happening because those involved are playing with students and children who need this support as it was before the 2012 cuts.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to comment on the same issue. The Minister has said that he would expect them to be professionally equipped but earlier he spoke about best practice and said in the same breath that there is nothing wrong with a science teacher giving guidance to a student. One could, however, have an excellent science teacher who has no idea what courses are available out there because the truth is that the guidance counsellors in the schools are in regional groups that meet regularly and unlike a science teacher, they constantly update and share their skills and information with one other. We would not expect the guidance teacher to teach some science on the side so why would we expect the science teacher to teach some guidance on the side? This all goes back to the original decision in 2012, before the Minister's time but he was in government. I believe the role of the guidance counsellor is completely undervalued by the Government and its predecessor. It is an absolutely crucial role and yet we wonder why one in six students in college is dropping out in first year. They are not getting the proper guidance counselling because since 2012, they have not been receiving it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I brought this subject up before. I do not know if the Minister of State spoke to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, about the vision for transport and the possibility of biofuel or looking at a greener way of running school buses.
