CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Before I answer, I acknowledge the devastating developments overnight in Ukraine. As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said earlier, we utterly condemn this act of unjustifiable war and our hearts and thoughts are with the people of Ukraine. The basic income for the arts pilot scheme will run over a three-year period and the intention is to research the impact a basic income would have on artists' and creatives' work patterns by providing the opportunity to participants to focus on their practice and to minimise the loss of skills from the arts, as a result of the pandemic. Stakeholder engagement has been core to the policy development process and this included a stakeholder forum on 15 December 2021 and a public consultation throughout January. The impact of such a scheme on artists with disabilities is a theme that has been raised throughout the consultation and I can assure the Deputy that it is a matter I take very seriously. I want to ensure that all artists, including those with a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot. The Department of Social Protection was a member of the oversight group I established last year tasked with appraising the recommendations set out in the Life Worth Living report. That group met eight times last year and the Department of Social Protection attended each of those meetings. In addition, an interdepartmental working group, including the Department of Social Protection, was established to support the work of the oversight group. It met seven times last year and the Department of Social Protection attended each of those meetings. In addition, bilateral engagement between the two Departments on the treatment of the basic income for the arts payment has been ongoing, with at least seven meetings over the past number of months.In particular, discussions around the treatment of the grant payment for the purposes of income disregards across a number of social welfare schemes, including disability allowance, are ongoing. I assure the Deputy that the issue of artists with disabilities is something on which I am focused. I believe the basic income for the arts has the potential to help artists and creative arts workers with disabilities overcome labour market barriers by creating a self-sustaining creative practice operating on a self-employed basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am determined to ensure the voices of artists and art workers are heard in the development and delivery of supports to the sector. In terms of the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, as the Deputy will know, this recommendation arose from the recommendation from the arts and culture recovery task force and is subject to ongoing consultation. I believe the whole process must be based on that consultation because it is a game changer for the arts community. A wide range of issues with regard to the operation of the proposed scheme, including the issue of artists with disabilities, have been raised in the context of this consultative process. These are now being considered by my Department in the context of finalising the scheme. I appreciate this issue has been raised by Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others, including Deputy Hourigan. I assure the Deputy there is ongoing engagement at present across government and, as I said, with the Department of Social Protection, on all the relevant issues related to this proposal, as there has been since the outset of this process. I intend to launch the scheme and all details with regard to its operation shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I am seeking to bring this to a conclusion and hope to be able to launch it shortly. As I said, however, it is such a groundbreaking initiative and a game changer. My focus is on getting it right and on the consultation with the very voices the Deputy said must be heard. It will be a three-year pilot, as promised. I am determined to get it right and that the consultation is at the heart of the process. I will get it out as soon as possible but, as I said, the consultation is key to this to make sure that when we roll out such a groundbreaking initiative, it addresses all the issues like those raised by the Deputy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	A healthy, independent and well-functioning media system is critical to our democracy, providing a platform for diverse opinion, challenge and debate. It is also of key importance for our cultural vibrancy and development, not least in supporting Irish content in a globalised marketplace. Recognising this vital role played by the wider media sector in our society and the fact the media system as a whole is under severe financial pressure, the Government established the Future of Media Commission, chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, to consider the way forward at a time of profound change and significant challenges. As such, the commission's task was a complex one, with a remit that was broader than simply examining the funding of public service broadcasting. This is about putting in place a sustainable framework for the wider media sector: print, radio and all other platforms. It is about enabling greater accessibility, equality, diversity and inclusivity in the media, supporting environmental sustainability, and the promotion of our language, culture and creativity. On the question of future funding, the commission was asked to examine how public service media can be funded in a way that is sustainable, gives greater security to the sector, ensures independent editorial oversight and delivers value for money. Given the wide-ranging and far-reaching recommendations the commission has addressed, it is only right we give the report very careful and detailed consideration. The commission's work must also be considered in the context of a range of other complex and interrelated issues that will require decisions by Government in the media and wider digital space. These include the recently published national digital strategy, the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and Ireland's approach to the implementation of the forthcoming Digital Services Act. I met with Professor MacCraith on a number of occasions since the commission was established, including since the commission's report was finalised. I also recently met with an Taoiseach and other Cabinet colleagues as part of our collective examination of the commission's report. It is intended that the Future of Media Commission report will be brought to Cabinet in the coming weeks, following which it will be published. With regard to the current funding model, public sector broadcasting is funded by revenues from the TV licence fee and the Exchequer, with An Post the designated collection agent for the TV licence fee. This will continue until such time as the Government may decide on an alternative funding model.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, the commission completed its work and, last September, the detailed report was submitted to the Taoiseach and me. It contains recommendations on a wide range of issues. I am not going to comment on the content of that report until it comes to Cabinet, but I will say there are far-reaching recommendations that require we give them appropriate consideration. They cannot be considered in isolation, however. As I said, the report is one of a number of developments taking place in the media and digital space that need to be considered in the round. These include the recently published national digital strategy entitled Harnessing Digital: The Digital Ireland Framework, and Ireland's approach to the implementation of the forthcoming Digital Services Act. As the Deputy knows, we are progressing our Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The report is with me and the Taoiseach. As I said, we met recently with some Cabinet colleagues to consider that. Our ambition is to bring it forward as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I cannot comment on the recommendations of the report until it comes to the Cabinet. As I said, I discussed the matter with the Taoiseach and with Cabinet colleagues quite recently, even this week. I expect it will be brought to all of the Cabinet in the coming weeks. My ambition, as well as that of the Taoiseach, is to publish that report as soon as possible. None of what has been in the newspapers has been verified by the Taoiseach’s Department or my Department. I have read much about what is seemingly in the recommendations. However, as I said, that has not been verified by the Taoiseach’s Department or by me. I even noted reports at the weekend that the Oireachtas joint committee’s position seems to be one that is supporting a household charge. None of these leaks has been verified by anyone. It needs, deserves and is worthy of proper consultation. It is my ambition and it is the Taoiseach’s ambition to publish it as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the national tourism development authority, in line with its statutory functions as set out in section 8(1)(a) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, Fáilte Ireland's role is to support the long-term sustainable growth of tourism in Ireland. Its remit does not extend to jurisdictions outside the State, such as Northern Ireland. Tourism Northern Ireland, which is a non-departmental body of the Department for the Economy in the North, is responsible for the development of tourism in Northern Ireland. Fáilte Ireland develops, supports and promotes tourism at regional and county level within the State in line with the relevant tourism experience brands, which provide the overarching context for enterprise supports, tourism product development and related marketing. There are four regional tourism experience brands covering all counties of the Republic of Ireland - the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East, Ireland's Hidden Heartlands and Dublin. Tourism Ireland promotes the island of Ireland in more than 21 markets overseas as a compelling holiday destination, using the Ireland brand to position the island as strongly as possible against the more than 200 other destinations with which Ireland competes. Tourism Ireland promotes Ireland's four regional experience brands, as well as Northern Ireland's experience brand, Embrace a Giant Spirit, on a range of platforms, including online, overseas trade platforms and other publicity. My Department and both tourism agencies will continue to foster North-South co-operation to enhance an all-island tourism offering and grow international visitor numbers to the entire island. My officials continue to liaise with their counterparts in the Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland through monthly meetings and also quarterly operational meetings with both the Department for the Economy and Tourism Ireland. On 20 January 2022, I took part in a shared island dialogue event hosted by the Department of the Taoiseach, which focused on all-island tourism. Over 160 tourism and civil society stakeholders from across the island joined the event online to discuss the success of tourism co-operation on the island of Ireland over the past 20 years and explore how best to enhance opportunities for domestic and international visitors in the years ahead. Over the course of the dialogue, a number of key themes emerged including the opportunity for greater alignment and linkages between tourism initiatives on the island and further developing on a cross-Border basis the on-island tourism that has grown in response to the pandemic travel restrictions.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 My Department will continue to work with the Department of the Taoiseach to implement our commitments to the North-South development of tourism as included in the shared island chapter of the renewed national development plan. This includes supporting Tourism Ireland in its mission to grow tourism into the island of Ireland, to promote the recovery of the sector post pandemic and to work with the Northern Ireland Executive on developing large-scale North-South tourism initiatives which will support the sustainable growth of the sector including cross-Border walking and cycling trails as well as new market opportunities.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism development authority is acting in line with its statutory functions under the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003. Fáilte Ireland's remit does not extend to jurisdictions outside the State. From my engagement with Tourism Ireland, I am aware that it does an amazing job in promoting the entire island. Since the establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council under strand two of the Good Friday Agreement, North-South engagement and collaboration in the area of tourism has added great value to the marketing of the island. I have been there and seen the amazing work they are doing in branding the entire island, including the branding and marketing of the Causeway Coastal Route, Ireland's Ancient East, the Wild Atlantic Way, the Global Greening initiative, the development of screen tourism, including the "Game of Thrones" studio tour, which recently opened in Banbridge, the Taste of Ireland food and drink initiative and maximising the tourism benefits of major sporting events. Tourism Ireland does a fantastic job of marketing the island.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The three tourism agencies operate within a balanced ecosystem within the remit of the enabling legislation. Fáilte Ireland supports tourism enterprises in the Republic of Ireland, Tourism Northern Ireland supports enterprises in Northern Ireland, while Tourism Ireland provides opportunities and support for enterprises across the whole island to promote their businesses overseas. As Deputy Munster says, the structures were established following careful consideration under the Good Friday Agreement. Changes to the function and remit of the bodies would require consultation and agreement on a North-South basis. My focus currently is on ensuring that Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland do the best possible job they can within their existing remit and that we continue the close co-operation we have with our colleagues in Northern Ireland to ensure that visitors to this island can enjoy a seamless experience with a wealth of attractions, activities and hospitality on the entire island of Ireland, in particular as we emerge from the pandemic.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 13 together. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022 will, when enacted, formally dissolve the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and establish a new regulator, coimisiún na meán, which will be responsible for overseeing the regulation of broadcasting and video on-demand services and the new regulatory framework for online safety. Coimisiún na meán will also have functions relating to the promotion of an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment, including research, education, media literacy, the protection of children, and journalistic and creative supports. Part 3 of the Bill sets out the legal basis for the establishment of an coimisiún, including its powers and functions, the membership of an coimisiún as a multi-commissioner body led by an executive chairperson and matters relating to the staffing and superannuation of an coimisiún. It also sets out the accountability of an coimisiún to the Oireachtas and provides for the independence of an coimisiún in the exercise of its functions. Given that infringement proceedings have been launched against Ireland for the delay in the transposition of the revised audiovisual media services directive, which will be given effect in Irish law by the Bill, I am keen to see the Bill enacted by the summer recess. This would pave the way for the formal establishment of coimisiún na meán by ministerial commencement order in the second half of this year. A key milestone in the progress of the Bill through the Houses was marked on Tuesday, when I had the opportunity to complete Second Stage of the Bill in Seanad Éireann. That debate provided an opportunity for me to set out what I believe are the most important provisions of the Bill, including the establishment of an coimisiún, and for me to listen to the perspectives of Senators from all sides of the House. Based on that debate, and the widespread recognition of the importance of the Bill, I am confident that we, as parliamentarians, can complete our consideration of the Bill by the summer. I acknowledge that this is an ambitious timeline for a Bill of this scope and scale. However, I believe this will still allow us to give extensive consideration to the Bill on Committee and Report Stages in both Houses. I know that Members of both Houses are as committed as I am to the enactment of the Bill and to the formal establishment of an coimisiún and the commencement of its operation. Given the importance of an coimisiún, the Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. While an coimisiún will, as set out in the Bill, ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services, I secured €5.5 million in budget 2022 to provide start-up funds to resource the establishment process. A programme of work is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise to establish and lead an coimisiún and to lay the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. This includes managing the transition of Broadcasting Authority of Ireland staff and functions to an coimisiún, while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulation set out under the Broadcasting Act 2009. The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage coimisiún na meán is a priority. Work is currently under way between my officials and officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service, PAS, to secure the recruitment of those staff, including the executive chairperson and online safety commissioner, through open, transparent, and effective public competitions. As provided for by Part 3 of the Bill, the recruitment of the commissioners and executive chairperson will be carried out by the PAS. I would expect that these critical posts would be advertised in the second quarter of 2022 at the latest. Part 16 of Bill provides for the dissolution of the BAI and the transfer of its regulatory functions, assets, rights and liability, and its staff to an coimisiún. In this context, it is important to note that the Bill specifies that BAI staff will transfer over on their existing terms and conditions. The dissolution of the BAI and the transfer of its staff will take place following the enactment of the Bill and commencement of the relevant provisions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Disinformation is a significant and complex issue, as Deputy Murnane O'Connor has said, and requires a distinct and targeted response. The EU is currently reviewing the code of practice on disinformation in order to strengthen it and to link it to the forthcoming Digital Services Act, which will set out the standards for platforms in dealing with the issue. The code of practice is a European Commission initiative which involves a range of online platforms, including social networks and advertising industry players, signing up to the self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. The Commission intends that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. In addition, the European Commission has established the European Digital Media Observatory, including a hub here in Dublin City University, which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. In response to Deputy Munster, I do not see the vacuum. The Bill was before the House and has completed Second Stage in the Seanad. It is very much to do with the importance of establishing the commission that we have approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill, and I have spoken about that several times. That is why I secured the €5.5 million. My intention is that the Bill will be enacted and we will have this commission set up.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I want to address the previous issues that I did not get to conclude. I have provided €5.5 million to commence recruitment of staff. The aim is to pass the Bill by the summer. With regard to recruitment, officials are engaging with the PAS and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I expect to advertise for the key commissioner posts in coimisiún na meán in the second quarter of the year. Deputy Murnane O'Connor asked about resourcing. Given the importance of an coimisiún, we approved the establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill so we can move quickly with this. That is why I secured €5.5 million in the budget to provide the start-up funds to resource the establishment process. A programme of work is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff who will have the relevant skills and expertise to establish and manage an coimisiún. This includes the recruitment of the online safety commissioner through an open, transparent and effective process managed by PAS. An coimisiún will ultimately be fully funded by the industry levy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In budget 2022, the Government allocated €67.6 million in additional funding for tourism, thereby bringing the overall tourism services budget to €288 million. This funding will enable the tourism agencies to assist in the recovery of the sector. The funding allocated to the tourism agencies in 2022 includes €50 million for further business continuity support for strategic tourism businesses and a €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund as well as €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development. Fáilte Ireland recently unveiled plans to support a sustained and sustainable recovery of the tourism industry this year. The plans include a doubling of domestic marketing investment to €10 million to drive domestic demand including short breaks all year round. The implementation of four regional brand tourism strategies will be critical to driving the long-term recovery of tourism across Ireland and to capitalising on the anticipated growth in inbound tourism in 2022. There will be further investment in the digital presence of tourism businesses, including enhancing the digital capabilities of more than 400 tourism businesses through Fáilte Ireland's Digital that Delivers programme. A digital audit of more than 800 hotels will be conducted and a suite of digital supports will be rolled out to ensure that businesses are visible, searchable and, most importantly, bookable. Fáilte Ireland will help address staffing and skills issues in the tourism and hospitality sector, including the first-ever excellent employer programme. The agency will assist businesses in their immediate recruitment efforts and help them to commit to driving long-term change and to making the industry an appealing and rewarding workplace that can attract and retain talent.  Fáilte Ireland will continue its investment in new and enhanced and best in class visitor experiences. Projects that will open between now and 2025 will be dispersed throughout the country and will help drive visitor growth with a strong focus on the outdoors. This will be complemented by a strong network of festivals and events such as the Fleadh Cheoil 2022, which I am pleased will return as an in-person physical event, taking place this summer in Mullingar. The Fleadh Cheoil is the world's largest annual celebration of Irish music, language, song and dance and it attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to the host town.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is much to address there. As I outlined earlier, there has been that increased funding in the form of the €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund, as well the €36.5 million in capital funding for tourism product development. The Deputy will be aware of the largest-ever investment announced last year by Fáilte Ireland in Westport, Dublin, Donegal and Cavan. That is the investment in those new visitor experiences. From my engagement with Tourism Ireland I can tell him there is pent-up demand to visit Ireland. People are being attracted by the key attractions the Deputy mentioned such as the greenways, walkways and blueways. I am acutely aware of those commitments in the programme for Government and how they can really drive the tourism industry back. I am of course working closely with Fáilte Ireland to encourage people to still holiday at home and support our tourism industries. There is engagement with the Minister, Deputy Harris, on recruitment. He is doing fantastic work there and has worked with the Irish Hotels Federation on that, as the Deputy will be aware.
