CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the group for the continued work that they do in this sector. I thank the witnesses for their excellent presentations on the huge challenges that face universities. I echo what other members of the committee have said about ensuring students from disadvantaged areas can access third level education. At this late stage of the meeting some of my questions have already been answered.  I have a question about increasing the number of non-EU students who pay the full amount of fees. I was going to ask if there is a capacity for doing so but I think the witnesses have indicated that serious capital investment is needed to increase the number of places taken up by non-EU students. A few members have mentioned the national training fund. The witnesses have called for the fund to be used for third level education. I ask the witnesses to elaborate on how such a scheme should work? How are universities with large financial deficits funded from a cashflow perspective? Do they draw down funding early from the HEA? Do they borrow funding from the HEA? If so, how will the moneys be paid back? The witnesses have said funding needs to be increased. Would that funding be sucked into paying back the deficit before reaching crucial areas?  Senator Gallagher mentioned the concerns about drop-out rates. He asked whether the reduction in the number of guidance counsellors at second level was a factor in the increase in drop-out rates. I have spoken to many students and groups of students at third level who have stated that there are waiting lists of 18 months for counselling services at third level, never mind second level. Is that a factor in drop-out rates too? What can be done to address the problem?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentation. They said they moved from an overall surplus of €40.8 million in 2008 to a deficit of €2.7 million in 2014-15. Like others I read the recent Higher Education Authority, HEA, review which shows six ITs under immediate financial pressure. What would the biggest deficit in any one IT be? Is it able to pay bills as they fall due? If not, what are the implications of that? How is it currently funded from a cashflow perspective? Would increased funding be sucked into paying deficits like this? They mentioned that reserves fell from €132.5 million to €78.7 million, wiping out 40% of finance available to underpin ongoing sustainability. What exactly does that mean? Can the witnesses elaborate on that? What are their target reserves? In the recent HEA report there is a reference to human resources flexibility. Is that part-time lecturers to save on costs or what is it? If that is the case, have any of these lecturers acquired employment rights over this period and if so what has been done to regularise that and what are the financial implications of that?
