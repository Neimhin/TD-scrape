CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta. B'ionann leithroinnt mhaoinithe phoiblí TG4 agus €37.2 milliún in 2020, leithroinnt a bhí comhdhéanta de €34.2 milliún i gcaiteachas reatha agus €3 milliún i gcaiteachas caipitil. Fuair m'oifigigh comhfhreagras ó TG4 ar 11 Meán Fómhair inar iarradh €1.9 milliún i maoiniú breise don bhliain 2020 i ndáil le costais bhreise a bhain le Covid. Aithním gur bliain thar a bheith dúshlánach a bhí inti do gach earnáil agus go raibh dúshláin ar leith i gceist le hiad i dtionscail na cruthaitheachta. Táthar ag lorg tuilleadh faisnéise ó TG4 maidir leis an iarratas ar mhaoiniú agus tá m'oifigigh i dteagmháil leis ina leith sin. Táim ag labhairt faoi seo mar Aire ar a bhfuil freagracht as na meáin, as an nGaeltacht agus as an gcultúr. Tuigim an obair atá déanta ag TG4 chun foinsí nuachta, oideachas agus faisnéis seirbhíse poiblí a chur ar fáil i rith na tréimhse seo. Tá an sceideal coinnithe ag TG4 mar atá agus tá sé curtha in oiriúint aige le freagairt ar riachtanais a lucht féachana in ainneoin gur bhain dúshláin léiriúcháin leis sin de bharr na srianta sláinte. Tá ról tábhachtach ag seirbhísí craoltóireachta a chuirtear ar fáil trí mheán na Gaeilge i straitéis 20 bliain don Ghaeilge an Rialtais. Is ríthábhachtach atá TG4 ina leith sin. Tá ról tábhachtach aige i dtreo cultúr na Gaeilge agus an Ghaeilge í féin a chur faoi bhráid lucht féachana a bhfuil Gaeilge acu. Cuireann sé ábhar nuálach agus ábhartha ar fáil trína sheirbhísí teilifíse agus ar líne. Chomh maith leis sin, mar chraoltóir foilseacháin, cuireann sé tacaíocht thábhachtach ar fáil d'earnáil na cruthaitheachta in Éirinn. Chaith sé €23,000 in 2019 sa réimse sin. Tá na meáin Ghaeilge ag teacht laistigh de chúram an choimisiúin um thodhchaí na meán, coimisiún a d'fhógair mé féin agus an Taoiseach ar 29 Meán Fómhair chun féachaint ar an bhfís amach anseo do na meáin seirbhíse poiblí. Tá sé beartaithe agam chomh maith cruinniú a bheith agam le TG4 sna seachtainí amach romhainn. Táim ag súil leis an mbealach ina mbeidh sé ábalta leanúint ag fás agus tacú tuilleadh leis an nGaeilge a phlé leis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Rinne an Teachta Ó Snodaigh tagairt don chlár "Cúla4 ar Scoil", clár a choimisiúnaigh TG4. Soláthraíonn an clár seo seirbhís chuimsitheach do scoileanna Gaeltachta agus Gaelscoileanna chun foghlaim i nGaeilge a éascú don lucht féachana. Clúdaíonn sé na príomhábhair: an Ghaeilge, matamaitic, stair agus tíreolaíocht. Bhí áthas orm a nótáil freisin go bhfuil an clár ag clúdach ranganna cruthaitheacha ar na healaíona, ar na healaíona traidisiúnta agus ar shláinte agus folláine. Mar gheall ar an mbeartas seo, bhí costas breise de €1.9 milliún le clúdach ag TG4 i mbliana. Tá iarratas á dhéanamh agam chun tacaíocht airgeadais a fháil i mbliana i leith na costais Covid seo. Mar is eol don Teachta, tá grá agam ar TG4 agus déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun gach tacaíocht a thabhairt dó, don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Mar a dúirt mé cheana, táim ag súil le cruinniú a bheith agam le TG4 sna seachtainí atá romhainn.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Tá m’oifigigh i mbun idirchaidrimh le TG4 maidir leis an iarratas do mhaoiniú bhreise agus tá siad ag lorg tuilleadh faisnéise. Measfar an t-iarratas nuair a fhaightear an fhaisnéis sin. Beidh mé i mbun idirchaidrimh leis an Aire Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe maidir le riachtanais maoinithe mo Roinne don bhliain 2021 mar chuid den phróiseas Meastacháin. Ní féidir a rá ag an bpointe seo cén t-airgead a chuirfear ar fáil d’aon ghníomhaireacht go dtí go n-aontaíonn an Rialtas leis sin. D’éirigh liom maoiniú breise de €2 milliún a fháil i bpacáiste spreagadh mhí Iúil don scéim fís agus fuaim agus tá sé sin ar fáil do gach craoltóir. Seolfaidh mé aon eolas breise ag an Teachta Dála níos déanaí inniu.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am acutely aware of the enormous and unprecedented challenges which face the tourism and hospitality sectors as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.Almost all tourism businesses were initially required to close to comply with the necessary public health measures introduced. Many have since reopened but, unfortunately, the majority of businesses are operating with significantly reduced levels of turnover compared with 2019 as a result of the ongoing public health measures and the almost complete absence of overseas tourists coming into the country. This has meant that many jobs in the sector have been lost or remain vulnerable. Along with my colleagues in government, I have taken a number of measures to help the sector survive this crisis. The July stimulus package introduced significant measures to help businesses recover following the devastating impacts of the Covid-19 crisis. Some of the key measures for tourism and hospitality include the stay and spend initiative, the €26 million adaptation grant, the €10 million grant for coach tourism and the revised restart grant, which now includes bed and breakfast establishments. Tourism enterprises will also benefit from wider horizontal support, such as the new employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, liquidity and enterprise investment measures, warehousing of tax liabilities and the extension for a further three months of the waiver of commercial rates. As part of its response to Covid-19 and to drive bookings for short breaks and holidays in Ireland in 2020, Fáilte Ireland has invested in a number of domestic holiday campaigns since June of this year, and I have seen at first hand that these campaigns have been successful in getting Irish people to holiday at home. All of these measures have helped the sector, but I appreciate that severe challenges remain and there is justified deep concern in the sector. We need to continue to examine ways to ensure businesses survive and recover. The tourism recovery task force, appointed in May, has just submitted its report to me. It is making a number of recommendations to help the sector survive the crisis and recover. That will feed into the roadmap the Deputy refers to in her question. Along with my colleagues in government, I will consider its recommendations as we prepare for the budget and the subsequent national economic plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While absolutely necessary, the public health guidelines disproportionately impact the sectors supported by my Department, namely, tourism, culture, arts, Gaeltacht, sports and media. I have had extensive engagement with people representing those working in the tourism and hospitality sector and will continue to do so. As the Deputy said, at the beginning of the year tourism supported 270,000 direct and indirect jobs. That is one in ten of all jobs. The IHF has estimated another 100,000 jobs are at risk. I am aware of the pressure they are under. On the stay and spend initiative, the purpose of that was to support the accommodation and food sector during the off-season, not during the peak season. That is what was flagged to us as what was needed. There was concern about the season between October and April. However, this is a fast-paced pandemic and we are in a different position now to July when we launched what was a very innovative scheme. The country was reopening then but now we are dealing with much harsher restrictions on already devastated sectors. Given that, it is natural to assess if the initiative is providing the full benefit that was planned in July.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is why I have been engaging with them extensively. One of the first things I did as a Minister, on day two, was to meet with the sector. On the stay and spend initiative, that is exactly what I said in my answer: it needs to be reassessed. I take that on board. That is why I am saying that in this Chamber. It is because of the fast-paced nature of this horrifying pandemic and how it is impacting on the sector. The tourism recovery task force report landed with me this week. I am reading that and will give it consideration. As the pandemic evolves, the Government will consider what are the best supports and measures which can be introduced to support businesses and employment. I will be discussing this with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of the budget and in my role as a member of the Cabinet committee on economic recovery. The people who represent that sector and other individuals I have spoken to know I voice that at Cabinet and will continue to do so. That means everything has to be considered. As far as I am concerned, everything is on the table in the context of the budget.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The programme for Government has expanded the remit of the public service broadcasting commission to become a future of media commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media on a platform-agnostic fashion. The programme for Government calls for a report within nine months on the measures that need to be taken to ensure there is a vibrant, independent public service media for the next generation. It notes that the current funding model for public service broadcasting is inefficient and the commission will publish recommendations. The commission is being established by the Department of the Taoiseach in liaison with my Department, and the terms of reference and membership were approved by the Government on 29 September. The goal of the independent commission is to identify what the Irish experience has been in delivering the above aims through public service broadcasters, or broadcasters, print and online media at a local, regional and national levels, and the challenges created for these media by new global platforms and change in audience preference for the delivery of content. It will consider the extent to which the current models of delivery are appropriate for the next ten years and review the best practice in other comparable jurisdictions, particularly across the European economic area, in terms of providing future-proofed models for meeting the above public services in light of changing audience expectations, in particular the preferences and behaviours of younger audiences. Within this context, the commission will examine how these aims can be delivered in a way that is sustainable, give greater security of funding, ensure independent editorial oversight and deliver value for money to the public. It will also make recommendations on RTÉ's role, financing and structure within this framework. It is expected that the commission will engage in a wide-ranging consultation with all relevant stakeholders and sectors to ensure that all relevant perspectives are considered in its work.  In light of its remit, I expect that the licence fee will be among the issues examined by the commission. I believe it is important to allow the commission the time and space to undertake its work and any recommendations made about the funding model and licence fee will be considered by the Government. In the meantime, An Post, which acts as my issuing agent for licence fee collection, will continue to sell television licences and free licences will continue to be issued by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to qualifying applicants under the household benefit scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The future of the media commission also has consideration of the Irish language and media within its remit. I made sure to have someone on the commission who is fluent in Irish and works in the sector. I recognise the work TG4 has done in providing an important source of news, education and public service information during this time, maintaining and adapting its schedule to respond to its audience needs despite the production challenge posed by the health restrictions. The delivery of broadcasting services through the medium of Irish plays a vital role in the implementation of the Government's 20-year strategy for the Irish language and TG4 has been essential in that regard. TG4 plays an important role in bringing Irish language and culture to Irish-speaking audiences, providing innovative and relevant content through television and its online services. In addition, as a publisher and broadcaster, it also provides valuable support to the Irish creative sector, spending €23 million in 2019. I look forward to the recommendations of the commission in this regard. As the Deputy said, there is a need to support quality journalism and media now more than ever. I am committed to doing so and that includes RTÉ but I do not want to pre-empt the work of the commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As I said, the licence fee will be discussed in the context of the commission. I do not want to interfere with the work of the commission.I am aware that evasion is currently estimated to be at 12.57% even though An Post makes every effort to bring the evaders into the licence pool with reminder notifications and inspections. There is also an increasing number of homes, approximately 11%, which have televisions and do not pay a fee.  I cannot pre-empt the work of a commission, the members of which will serve really well. The NUJ has written to me and sent me its report, which I will bring to the attention of the chair of the future of media commission. As I said, there will be extensive engagement with all stakeholders. The print sector was added to the commission as an acknowledgement by the Government that it is at risk. We have to acknowledge that and see how best to provide a road forward for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism, arts, culture and sport are integral parts of the fabric of society, supporting economic activity and physical and societal well-being. The public facing and audience driven nature of those sectors means that each time there is an escalation for any county in the level applicable under the living with Covid plan those sectors will be hardest hit. The Government is acutely aware of these challenges. The need for important public health measures, such as social distancing, has placed necessary limits on gatherings to protect public health. This has had a devastating impact, which the Government and I, as Minister with responsibility for tourism, culture, arts, the Gaeltacht, sports and media, have sought to address in a range of ways. Some key measures have been introduced to help support the tourism, arts, culture and sports sectors, including an additional €25 million for the Arts Council, a €5 million live events pilot grant scheme, €5 million to support national cultural institutions and nationwide arts infrastructure, the stay and spend tax credit initiative, a €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector, a €10 million grant for coach tourism, €40 million for the three main field sport its bodies, the GAA, IRFU and FAI, and a €15 million resilience fund for sports governance bodies and clubs.  The universal income support of PUP and the wage subsidy scheme have been key to supporting sectors through this crisis and the extension of these schemes has provided certainty for the coming months. My officials and I are in regular contact with stakeholders and representatives in all of the sectors for which I have responsibility. I have established a number of sector specific task forces. I have considered the views and recommendations of these task forces in the context of budget 2021 and the development of the national economic plan, and will review and refine existing support as required. I intend to continue this collaborative process with stakeholders in order to ensure the sectors remain viable and resilient as we continue to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. That is why I feel task forces are key to this. My engagement with people across my Department brief has shown me that they want to have a say. The arts task force, chaired by Claire Duignan, met for the first time last week and is due to report on 31 October which is obviously post budget. That is why in the first meeting I attended last week I asked it to give me its key priorities before the budget so that I can use that information to feed into my negotiations. On the tourism recovery task force, that landed on my desk this week and it is key in the budget negotiations. The Government is fully aware that, given the social nature of such gatherings, tourism, arts, and culture were the sectors first affected by the pandemic and may be the last to return to normal. We must find a way to get our performers singing again and help them. Our pilot €5 million live performance support scheme assists that and has worked really well.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can assure the Deputy that my Department and I are engaging closely with the sectors and, in the context of the budget, we are very aware of the demands. Waiting for the task force report does not preclude us from taking immediate measures. For example, the live performance scheme involved an allocation of €5 million. My Department developed the conditions of the scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC. The initial closing date was 24 August and by that date more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over €15 million. The main objective of the scheme is the provision of employment for artists, creative technicians and their support. That is just one element. The task forces will also feed into the national economic plan which will come after the budget, and will in turn feed into a long-term plan. The July stimulus package was part one, and we will then have the budget and the national economic plan. Ongoing consultation and engagement is key to how we get that roadmap in place and identify the supports that are needed so that they can feed into the negotiations.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Before the Minister of State answers it would be remiss of me not to comment on Carrickmacross. When I was in primary school, which was neither today nor yesterday, I used to buy raffle tickets in the hope that we would have a swimming pool in Carrickmacross by my time in secondary school. It was Dave Phelan who championed it when I was in my secondary school days. I will keep an eye on this development. I will allow Minister of State continue now.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government published the Resilience and Recovery 2020 - 2021, the Plan for Living with COVID-19, on 15 September. This is a cross-Government approach to managing the pandemic for the coming months. This plan sets out how the balance between public health, economic and social aspects of living with Covid-19 will operate in the short to medium term. Most of the country is now at level 2, which is based on a medium-term approach to managing risk. At all times the priority will be to keep our schools open, while keeping people safe and protecting the resilience of our economy and communities. I am very aware of the impact of the pandemic on those working in the commercial events sector, not just in terms of performers but also the crews and the wide range of people it takes to put on a drama or a music performance. I have met the Events Industry Alliance and my Department is in regular contact with the representative groups. The Deputy approached me informally to make sure there was a member of the events industry on the task force. In response to the Deputy's informal request, I have put two on the task force to make sure their voices are heard. The arts and culture sectors have been severely impacted as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic; cultural venues and events were among the first to be closed in the country and they will be among the last to recover. The Arts Council is the statutory body charged with supporting and developing the arts in Ireland and has received an additional €25 million in funding in 2020. Among the measures being introduced are new and additional bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. The jobs stimulus package has specifically provided a wide range of supports across the culture and audio visual sectors. These include the €10 million pilot performance and production support package to support the live performance and the audiovisual production sector as well as a new €10 million culture fund. The recently appointed task force will prepare a report including a set of recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. With the upcoming budget and the development of the national economic plan, the Government will review and refine existing supports. The programme for Government states that that task force must feed into the national economic plan but as I said earlier, I have also asked them to give me a report outlining their key priorities ahead of the budget so that I am not waiting until 31 October. It is to ensure I get their key priorities before the budget. On 31 October, after the budget, that task force will feed into the national economic plan when they present the report.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is exactly where my focus remains because from my engagement with the stakeholders, as the Deputy stated, that is what they need. I realise the situation has deteriorated. I am also very conscious of the unprecedented nature of the challenges facing live performers, promoters and producers, not least from a financial point of view. I recently announced a new fund that will assist established commercial venues and promoters to employ performers, artists, technicians and creative and performance support staff up to the end of 2020 in anticipation of the return of audiences to live performance. An allocation of €5 million has been made under the live performance support scheme. That was a pilot scheme, which is why the amount is €5 million. It is looking at the applications and the number of applications seen helps and informs me in my negotiations on the budget because I can see how well that has been responded to. My officials engaged with the sector in designing that specific scheme because it helps de-risk the cost of preparing for new productions which may subsequently have to be postponed, cancelled or curtailed due to restrictions to safeguard public health. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector, allow commercial organisers of live performance to commence preparations immediately and for productions to go ahead in the near future, while also complying with the protection measures. My focus is on getting these people performing again and getting technicians working again because, without them, we will not have any performances.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	From my extensive engagement with the sector, I am conscious that the changes to the PUP and employment wage subsidy scheme affect the lives of thousands of artists and other workers across the arts, culture and live entertainment sectors in a devastating way. I understand these supports are needed now more than ever to support artists in their long-awaited return to work. I have raised these matters with my Cabinet colleagues in the context of budget 2021, recognising that there will be an extended period in which we will have to live with the virus. I am aware of the difficulties this will raise, especially in the sectors in question. My focus is firmly on the survival, sustainability and recovery of this vital industry. As the Deputy stated, there are 35,000 workers, but they bring €3.5 billion to the economy. As the Taoiseach said at the Dáil on Tuesday, the Government is considering sector-specific supports to protect the livelihoods of as many people as possible. In the face of this pandemic, we have to be creative and innovative, and we have to think outside the box to support as many as possible. All suggestions should be considered and all should remain on the table. All schemes will be kept under review and no decision will be finalised until budget day.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 13 together. I am pleased to inform Deputies Boyd Barrett and Brendan Smith that earlier this month I launched a number of new music and performance schemes, totalling €6 million, to aid employment in the creative industries. The music stimulus package involves three funding schemes designed to help sustain the popular commercial music sector across all music genres, including rock, pop, hip hop, indie, jazz, country and traditional folk. Under this package, a fund of €1 million has been put in place to stimulate areas of work which artists would usually fund with income from own sources, including live event fees. These schemes are targeted at professional musicians and their teams and will support song writing camps, recording and album releases. The aim is to ensure that Irish musicians, engineers, PR, media, agents, labels and publishers can continue to develop and insure their work in the context of Covid restrictions. The music stimulus package schemes are being managed on behalf of the Department by First Music Contact and will be subject to peer panel assessment.  Under the live performance supports pilot scheme, a further allocation of €5 million is being made available, which aims to assist commercial venues, producers, promoters of live performances and provide employment to workers in creative industries. My Department developed the conditions of this scheme in consultation with the sector, with particular assistance from EPIC. By the initial closing date, more than 100 applications had been received, requesting funding of over €15 million. That is why it is a pilot scheme. We will engage with the stakeholders to see what would work best before we consider anything further. The Deputy will be aware that I cannot have the negotiations for the budget on the floor of the House and that that is work I will be doing with my Cabinet colleagues.  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Brendan Smith will also be aware that I recently appointed the arts and culture recovery task force, which is being chaired by Clare Duignan. The membership of that task force includes representatives from the Events Industry Alliance. Taken as a starting point, the research and evidence of the devastating impact of the pandemic on the sector compiled by the Department, the Arts Council and other stakeholders, the task force will prepare a report setting out recommendations on how best the arts and culture sector can adapt and recover from the unprecedented damage arising from the pandemic.  The sector includes culture, the arts, the audio-visual industry and the live entertainment industry. The task force has already met twice. Its proceedings will be conducted in a transparent manner and all correspondence will be published in due course. I will consider the findings of the task force, as well as the experience of new schemes which were launched last month, in framing any further responses to the crisis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Both Deputies will be aware that it is not possible to anticipate the budget. I am very familiar with the pre-budget submissions of the Events Industry Alliance and everyone involved in this sector. I acknowledge the Deputies' interest in these matters and I can assure them that I will be doing my best for the sector in the budget and subsequently. For information, the total funding for the arts in Ireland this year is €338 million. That has increased by more than 30% this year. I would never have suggested - this is the reason I continually emphasise the word "pilot" - that €5 million was enough. It is a start. I come from this background myself. There are many Deputies here who have family or friends in this sector. I am acutely aware of not just the needs and livelihoods of the performers who are front and centre stage but those who enable to go on stage.  On the international comparison, I know some people look to approaches taken in other countries but it can be very difficult to make those comparisons. Population differences mean that supports are not directly comparable. We need to focus on what is in Ireland. For example, in the UK there is a very large commercial theatre sector that does not exist here to the same extent. We need to focus on the measures that are needed here. My focus will be on the report of the task force, which will consult widely to develop a clear approach which, in turn, will inform not only the budget but the national economic plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I guarantee that I do not want to lose this sector either. I am very conscious of the emerging artists. For example, we ran a programme online with Hot Press for young and emerging artists earlier this year. I also guarantee that I have never undervalued music and the arts. That is the background I come from; it is what I studied. That is where all my friends and family are. I place an immense value on the sector. It is a privilege to be the Minister with responsibility for culture and arts at this most challenging time. I have a keen eye on doing what is best for this sector, to support it not just to survive but to thrive at the other end of Covid. That is why I am engaging extensively with the sector. I have heard people's concerns and I will bring those to the negotiations, but I cannot have the negotiations on the floor of the House. However, I can guarantee my commitment to this sector and how much I value it. It is the beating heart of our nation, as far as I am concerned. It is our identity. We have to stop talking about and praising it without placing a value on it by supporting it.
