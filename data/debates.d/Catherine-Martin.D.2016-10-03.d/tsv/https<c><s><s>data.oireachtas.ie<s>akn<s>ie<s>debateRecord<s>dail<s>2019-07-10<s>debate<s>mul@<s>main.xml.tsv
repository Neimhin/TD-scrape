CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In light of the forthcoming introduction of the national childcare scheme, will the Department of Children and Youth Affairs carry out an assessment of the impact of this scheme on lone-parent families? Will the Minister show how the scheme will impact on subsidies for childcare and the hours of childcare available to lone parents?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for her reply but I do not feel it will ease fully the worries of the more than 215,000 single-parent families in this State who are not seeing the benefits of this scheme and who are fearful. There are parents, predominantly women, who feel they are at risk of being forced to forgo work or education because of the potential impacts of the national childcare scheme on existing support schemes for single parents. According to Single Parents Acting For Rights of Kids, SPARK, lone-parent families could face losses of up to â‚¬350 per month through the loss of these schemes. The schemes are invaluable in helping lone parents to work or upskill and in helping them to fall into welfare dependency. With the greatest respect, the Department allowing people to stay on their existing schemes until August 2020 if they are not better off is equivalent to admitting that some people may be much worse off as a result of the introduction of the national childcare scheme. That measure is actually elevating fears rather than easing them. I fear that, while the scheme will potentially benefit 95% of parents, it will have a negative impact and possibly awful repercussions on the other 5% and will push them deeper into poverty. Will the Minister outline how the level of subsidies under the scheme will not have a negative impact on such families?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Minister that we should get the word and the proof out to all stakeholders that the level of subsidies under the scheme will not negatively impact on lone-parents' current supports. There must be much clearer two-way communication with single-parent families and with advocacy groups. It must be clear to a mother who is hoping to return to her studies in October that she will still be able to do so under the national childcare scheme. People need to be able to plan their lives and the lives of their families with certainty. I ask the Minister to consider holding a briefing with the persons affected, women's organisations, and Oireachtas Members because we all need clarity on this issue. Families need to know because they need to plan for their future. I have heard that parents are being told subsidies will be based on their own personal circumstances, but it is not clear to them how much they are set to lose once the scheme is up and running. That is where the clarity is really needed. Will the Minister commit to meeting with stakeholders and to giving them concrete answers to their questions?
