CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Am I correct in understanding that we are now dealing with programme A and the SNAs?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the question of SNAs, how do we know that the demand is being met? The graph on page 6 of the summary document shows an 11% to 45% variability in increase. Why can we not forecast more accurately? What data are we missing? The target figure, for example, for SNAs in 2015 was 11,330 but the number of SNAs reached by December of 2015 was 12,036. What is the Department basing its targets on? Are the targets needs based? It is quite clear that the demands on the service are continuing to outpace the resources available. I ask the Minister to take steps to address the continuing uncertainty about the allocation of SNAs and, in particular, the timeline for the publication of allocations in advance of the next school year. This is a perennial problem which makes life very difficult for school principals, SNAs, students and parents.  Also under programme A, I wish to refer to the output indicator for the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. The indicator holds that a NEPS psychologist is to be assigned to all ordinary national and second-level schools. The indicator does not tell us how we are doing in that regard. Are we meeting demand? What are the waiting lists like? Is every child who needs access to the service getting it within a certain timeframe? If demand jumps, how do we make sure we have sufficient supply? In his previous role as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Minister advocated for the private sector to have access to the right skills-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am referring to access to the right skills in order to achieve the best outcomes. I ask him to be as proactive in education and to have the vision and commitment to do something similar here to ensure that our children have access to the required amount of trained psychologists and counsellors so that their well being is looked after. I am very disappointed to see no reference whatsoever to resilience in the Estimates. I have spoken to the Minister about this in person. We need to ensure that our children have a toolbox of skills to cope at times of crisis. A rounded education is of paramount importance for our children. I am aware that some secondary schools are doing excellent work in this regard - involving Headstrong, Jigsaw and so forth - where vulnerable teenagers are targeted and their psychological needs addressed. Unfortunately, however, such programmes are sporadic. They must be further developed and designed by experts. We must also consider making such programmes available in primary schools. A more uniform approach is needed in this area. We must move away from a situation where resilience is squeezed into the school day through the efforts of particular teachers who have possibly taken time out and paid for training in this area towards a whole-school approach. I ask the Minister to consider reversing the decision made in the 2012 budget to remove the ex-quota guidance allocation in second level schools. Cuts to such services reduce that crucial, easy access for teenagers when they are in trouble. That decision had a very unequal impact because many schools were able, through parental contributions, to pay for private counsellors. It was the DEIS schools and the disadvantaged students who were crying out for help who had their only trained counsellors taken away. I ask the Minister to consider that as key to the well-being of our children. I note that the provision of additional resource teachers is not included - it is on page 18. Yet there is a reference to a new model which would cost €24 million in 2017, with a full year cost of €72 million. Why is this vital resource not included? At the end of his presentation, the Minister mentioned the €130 million relating to the Lansdowne Road agreement. Is that the money needed to uphold the recent agreement with two of the teacher unions? Is there potential provision if agreement is reached with ASTI? Regarding addressing the inequality for newly qualified teachers, is there provision for reimbursement for loss of earnings for NQTs who have been on reduced pay scale for the past four or five years given that it will have a substantial impact on their pension entitlements?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On that issue, Minister-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I ask a question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If those hours are restored to the counsellors, would it be for the school to decide where those hours go? Could they go elsewhere and not into counselling?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As regards the Lansdowne Road agreement, the €130 million does not include the two teacher unions so there is no provision if the ASTI comes on board.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Minister have any intention of addressing the pension impacts on NQTs? For the past four years they have been doing the same work.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I have a quick question on capital. On page 11 it appears that the capital building programme has exceeded its budget, yet on page 79 it is stated the target is to build 50 schools this year, but only 14 have been completed at the end of September. Is there a budget to complete the other 36? There are many references to significant pressure on the capital budget, but in the programme for Government there is an intention to introduce physical education, PE, to the leaving certificate programme. Will there be a budget provision to review second level schools? I am aware of a school in my constituency that opened in 1980 but which still does not have a PE hall. Where is the equal access in that instance? How can it and other schools provide for PE classes? It is a case of putting the cart before the horse. The Minister must check that the schools have PE halls and proper PE facilities before the introduction of PE to the leaving certificate programme. With regard to higher-level education, it is indicated on page 13 that universities and institutes of technology required the earlier payment of grants in 2016. Why was this? Why are the universities and institutes of technology underwater already? As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, third level cannot wait for us to debate the Cassells report. There is now a crisis and the chickens have well and truly come home to roost. How will the Government address this in the upcoming budget? Funding is needed now. I noticed there is no budget to make progress on the junior cycle policy reforms. That is quite astounding. This is the major reform that is happening in second-level schools. The policy reform is actively happening so it is a problem if there is no budget to progress it. There is no budget for certain forthcoming initiatives, such as the Gaeltacht strategy. Will the budgets for these initiatives be found?
