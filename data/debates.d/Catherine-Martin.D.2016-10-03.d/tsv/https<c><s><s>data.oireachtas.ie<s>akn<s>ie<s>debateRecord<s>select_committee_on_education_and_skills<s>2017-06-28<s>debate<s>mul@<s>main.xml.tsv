CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to reiterate what all of the members have said. Through the Chair, I believe that section 7(3) of the Act is directly related to admissions to schools. The provision is fundamentally tied to it. The baptism barrier is a huge issue in admission policies as it allows discrimination across the board. It makes me wonder the following. Why have we discussed the Labour Party's Equal Status (Amendment) Bill for more than a year? Perhaps our discussions have been a complete waste of time and it should have been discussed by the Oireachtas Select Committee on Justice and Equality. It is bizarre if we have been misguided in that way and the legislation will be delayed. A huge issue of discrimination, along with the baptism barrier, is discrimination on the grounds of special educational needs. That is why I echo what Deputy Byrne has said. I am massively disappointed that the amendment that gives the National Council for Special Education the power to compel schools to open autistic units has been ruled out order. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am fully in favour of Deputy Shortall's proposal. The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has raised the issue for the Minister’s attention that section 30(2)(e) of the Education Act 1998 provides that the Minister “shall not require any student to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student”. My amendments Nos. 56 and 84 deal with the opt-out for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. Many schools with a religious ethos do not have alternatives for children. We have scenarios where children will not attend school when communion and confirmation are being prepared for. There are students in secondary school who are told to sit at the back of the class, given a study class or told to go to the library when religious instruction takes place. There are no guidelines in place, however, for the schools or students. These two amendments would require the Minister to provide definite clarity and guidelines to schools on how they should put in place alternatives for children who do not wish to attend religious instruction and require a timeline for same.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I appeal to the Minister to reconsider providing guidelines. There should be minimum standards in regard to the nature of the exemption for students. It is not fair on students who are being excluded, whether they are being put to the back of the classroom or sent to a library. It is not fair on the students and teachers in the class who want to study religion because teachers are being asked to manage classes and teach religion, along with dealing with seven others who are not doing the subject. That leads to discipline issues. Students coming into schools in September will see from the timetable that religion is scheduled for 2.40 p.m. on a Tuesday, but a student who does not do religion will ask what he or she should do, and his or her tutor will not know because the school has no idea what is happening. If those not studying religion are not included in the timetable provisions, will a teacher be available to supervise those students who are not sitting at the back of a classroom? Are those students unsupervised, which is wrong? Are they with an SNA, which is not fair on him or her?  It is a domino effect. I ask the Minister to set down minimum guidelines to at least ensure that those who are not studying religion are doing something of educational benefit during the time involved.We have to consider the children in the class who are willingly doing religion and ensure their learning experience is not impacted. With everything that is happening in society, particularly in the past year and a half, we should be promoting an inclusive approach. Instead, we have those who do religion and those who do not in the same classroom. That is wrong on many levels. I appeal to the Minister to put in place minimum standards to ensure that every child gets the best value out of their education.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is Deputy Thomas Byrne withdrawing-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Just for clarification, is amendment No. 83 being withdrawn?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, that is fine. I was just checking about amendment No. 83.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to that, is it specific to the unit or is just a case of the school catering for a specific special education need and stopping any other?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Where in the admission policy will it state what needs are catered for and what needs are not catered for?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If it is oversubscribed?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is because it is reserved for special education needs. Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are two matters to be clarified. First, did the Minister say it is not only the autism units? Second, if a special needs class was dealing with three specific needs, would that lead to a school deciding, for example, that a child who has all those needs but also has, for example, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and an emotion behaviour disorder, would not be suitable in terms of the needs provided for in the class and, therefore, the school will not take in the pupil?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Putting forward amendment No. 16 was the only way I could see of getting round the restriction of not being able to open up the Equal Status Act. I saw in it some way of tackling the baptism barrier. The amendment states: "In page 6, line 13, after “school” to insert “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”. I am of the opinion that this would mean schools which are State-funded could not then discriminate. Is the Minister suggesting this would only apply to the private schools? To clarify, we are talking about schools not aided by the Department of Education and Skills. If we are that specific, we can then tackle the baptism barrier to some extent.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, my amendment No. 16, by inserting “not aided by the Department of Education and Skills”, is making the best of a bad situation but at least it would ensure that State-funded schools could not discriminate on the grounds of religion. It would make it very specific to privately-funded schools so, at least, the taxpayer would not be paying for discrimination. I ask members to support it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 16:In page 6, line 13, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 20 is in my name also, and I tabled amendment No. 55. These amendments require that in the case of Irish medium schools that are oversubscribed, these schools would have the right to assign priority to children who speak Irish as a home language or who are transferring from primary to secondary Gaelscoileanna.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Minister is proposing to accept the amendments? Will we hear more from him on Report Stage. Is that right?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In amendment No. 44, section (9)(b), why did the Minister decide on one in four, or 25%, of children of past pupils?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 44, section (9)(b).
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I referred to subsection (9)(b), which deals with the 25% quota. Deputy Tom Neville is referring to subsection (9)(a) which refers to siblings. I have absolutely no problem with it because it makes sense for siblings to be able to attend the same school, if only in managing a household, but I do have an issue with the 25% quota. I am still not convinced that it is evidence-based and believe it has been plucked from the air. Why stop at a parent and grandparent? Why not include a great-grandparent also? There could be circumstances in which the grandchild of someone who attended a school, who may be travelling 15 miles across the city to attend school, could have a greater right to attend it than a child who is living beside it. That one in four pupils could have this right just because he or she happens to be the grandson or granddaughter of a past pupil is bizarre, wrong and unfair. The measure is not about equality and equal access. Of course, I can see the argument about siblings and do not have an issue with it. The quota of 25% is way too high.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I, too, will be seeking to amend the section on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My amendment No. 39 is similar to my previous amendment No. 16, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills". It is an effort to ensure that State-funded schools are not funding discrimination.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 39:In page 7, line 23, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills".I called a vote on amendment No. 16 but I am happy to revisit this on Report Stage. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 55:In page 9, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(3) Nothing in this section shall prohibit—(a) a primary school which teaches through the medium of Irish from giving priority in its admissions policy to students who speak Irish as a home language, or(b) a post primary school which teaches through the medium of Irish from giving priority in its admissions policy to students who speak Irish as a home language or who has attended a primary school which teaches through the medium of Irish.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 56:In page 9, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:“(3) (a) In particular, the Minister shall, within 3 months of the commencement of this Act, make regulations governing the age-appropriate arrangements to be made for students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.(b) Such regulations shall have regard to the rights of students under the Constitution to attend a school in receipt of public funds without attending religious instruction or classes at that school.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 84:In page 11, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:“(f) age-appropriate guidelines for primary and post-primary schools, respectively, in relation to students who do not wish to attend religious instruction or classes.”.I intend to press the amendment as I will bring it to Report Stage. This is similar to the one on which we voted already.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the first amendment under discussion amendment No. 100?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, but the first of my amendments is No. 100. This amendment proposes to insert the words "all reasonable efforts" after "the ability of the school to". This is in order to prevent that soft-barrier discrimination, creating more of an onus on schools to provide for a child before it can refuse to admit them. It would state that the NCSE should have regard to the ability of the school to make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the child, rather as it currently stands, that is, to have regard to the ability of the school to accommodate the child.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is amendment No. 121 also in this grouping? This is where I propose to delete lines 15 to 24 on page 13. There is a double barrier there for children with special educational needs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I feel there is a double barrier for children with special educational needs. Amendment No. 98, tabled by the Minister, creates a double barrier. A school might be able to discriminate on the grounds of religion, which would stop access for a child with special educational needs.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I completely agree with Deputy Shortall on amendment No. 98 and I believe it will lead to further discrimination. To this end on Report Stage I will table amendments on the principle of what is in the best interests of the child.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would we not run the same risk with amendment No. 98? There is reference to having regard to "the admission policies of schools in the locality".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the Minister address that?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That would be appreciated by everyone.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 100:In page 12, line 22, after "to" where it firstly occurs to insert "make all reasonable efforts to".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 113:In page 13, line 6, after "school" to insert "not aided by the Department of Education and Skills".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of issues I will be bringing on Report Stage so I cannot agree to the section as it stands.
