CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the delegates for the submissions. I have a number of questions. At senior cycle, is the requirement to do RSE applicable to students doing the applied leaving certificate programme? I read the Department's submission to the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.The submission stated that RSE, at senior cycle, is still based on an interim curriculum from 2011. Is a seven-year interim curriculum the norm? To me, a seven-year interim curriculum seems quite lengthy. RSE is one of five strands that make up the SPHE curriculum. Why is RSE the only one to be delivered? Does the Department intend to deliver the other four strands? I respectfully suggest that the gender studies strand needs to be updated and I ask that it be updated as part of the review. The gender studies strand only refers to male and female experiences. Everything is described in the language of both genders rather than referring to the spectrum of gender identity. My next group of questions is for the NCCA. The Stay Safe programme is centred around children learning to say, "No", get away and tell. Does the NCCA believe enough has been done to deal with the issue of consent? Are children being taught to be cognisant not only of their own comfort and boundaries but those of others? Finally, when were the RSE resources last updated?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The witness stated that the ethos may have an impact on how students hear what is being presented. Surely what students hear being presented is that which is said. The ethos, therefore, would have a major impact on what is being presented.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I asked earlier about students doing the leaving certificate applied. Is it a requirement that they study RSE? With regard to the interim curriculum, how long can a curriculum be interim? It appears to be seven or eight years here. Is that the norm with any other subject? Regarding the gender studies strand, does the NCCA intend to review the language? The language only refers to both genders. When were the RSE resource materials last updated?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the question of going into schools, are there inspections of RSE at present? Are such inspections included in the so-called "drive-bys" or are there official inspections? Is there anything about students' experience of RSE or parents' knowledge of the RSE curriculum in the management, leadership and learning, MLL, surveys of parents and students? I would have thought it would be essential to gather such information during detailed MLL inspections.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is that at senior level?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It seems to me that merely asking whether a parent is aware of the school's RSE policy is not sufficiently probing of the parent's level of satisfaction with the RSE programme. Perhaps this is something that needs to be reviewed. Maybe parents should be asked if they are content with the school's RSE policy and if it has been explained in detail to them. To ask simply whether they are aware of it seems very general.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I also asked how long a curriculum under the leaving certificate applied programme can be allowed to stay in place as an interim programme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	How long is an interim curriculum allowed to stay in place? Surely the word "interim" indicates that it is temporary by its very nature.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am asking about what was submitted in 2011.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This interim curriculum has been in place since 2011.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is mislabelled.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Who determines what is age-appropriate material? How do we make sure it is not given too late because we are so fearful of doing it too early? Mr. Browne mentioned that teachers in schools with a high implementation rate were trained in facilitating openness and confidentiality among students. Does that mean that happens in only some schools? How sporadic is the teacher training? Surely all teachers should be trained in the same way. We have been told that RSE must be taught at senior level but in her statement Ms Burke said that her school had no RSE in two years. I do not understand that if it is compulsory at senior level.  Can the three unions tell me if there has been a survey of RSE teachers or does dissatisfaction with the training ever come up at TUI and ASTI conventions or branch meetings? I hear many references to the partnership needed and fully agree because everything in education involves a partnership between parents and teachers but how is that presented in reality? What exactly is happening or is it just something that is beautifully written into the RSE policy in schools but is not actually happening?  Perhaps Ms Leydon, Mr. Duffy or Ms Lewis could tell me how teachers are selected at second level. Is it a timetable issue such that whichever teacher is available at a given time, be they the music or maths teacher, teaches it or is it typically the religious education, RE, teacher who becomes the RSE teacher? Is there really good training for these teachers or are they thrown in at the deep end? That would not be fair to teacher or student. Does the Department support the teachers, given that so many new subjects and so many changes have been introduced?
