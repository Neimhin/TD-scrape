CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Dlí ceannródaíoch is ea é an Bille um Rialáil Sabháilteachta ar Líne agus na Meán, 2022 agus tá áthas orm é a chur faoi bhráid an Tí. The main aim of this legislation is to jump-start modernisation of Ireland's approach to the regulation of content, both for traditional editorial media and the landscape of newer online services fuelled by user-generated content.This is driven by changes in the way we consume media and the growth of the online world. Streaming services are now a key feature of everyday life. They are on our phones, laptops and televisions. However, regulation of these editorially controlled services has not kept pace with the regulation of broadcasting services. This Bill will change that and ensure that streaming services are subject to up-to-date rules. While the fact the Internet is a key part of our lives has become increasingly apparent, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought sharp focus to this reality. From working from home to schooling from home, the Internet has enabled us to weather this pandemic in ways that have surprised us all. While the Internet has had a broadly positive impact, there are risks, however, especially to children. Some of these risks are online extensions of existing problems, such as bullying. Others represent new challenges in our digital age, such as image-based abuse. While we have updated our criminal law for the online age, there has not yet been a way to hold online services to account. These are key matters this Bill will begin to tackle for the first time. As such, the Bill's scope is ambitious and includes updates to the regulation of broadcasting services, including radio, television and streaming services. It also provides for the creation of a new regulatory framework for online safety to tackle the availability of the most serious forms of harmful online content. This will be done by providing for risk-based regulation of services that facilitate access to user-generated content. In doing this, the Bill also provides for the implementation of the revised audiovisual media services directive into Irish law. The foundations for achieving this ambition are those elements of the Bill that provide for the creation of a new regulatory body, coimisiún na meán, the media commission, which will implement and enforce these new and updated rules. In order to do so, an coimisiún will have a robust and modern suite of regulatory functions and powers and, in line with EU law and best practice, will be wholly independent in its exercise of those functions and powers. Regulatory independence is key to effective regulation, especially for content regulation, where fundamental rights are so important. In some parts of Europe, this independence is being eroded. It is vital that Ireland leads on this issue. The powers of an coimisiún include the power to fund its operations by levying the services it regulates; to create legally binding regulatory codes; to gather information and appoint authorised officers to conduct investigations; and to seek the imposition of sanctions for failures of compliance, including financial sanctions of up to €20 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is higher. In the most serious cases, an coimisiún may seek criminal prosecution of senior executives of non-compliant services and seek court orders to block access to a service in Ireland. In respect of broadcasters, an coimisiún will retain the power to revoke broadcasting contracts for serious breaches. An coimisiún will also take over the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI. The staff of the BAI, approximately 40 people, will transfer to an coimisiún. I envisage that an coimisiún will need to scale quickly up to a staffing level of at least 160 and in the longer term may require staffing of up to 300. The Government has approved the establishment of an coimisiún on an administrative basis, including recruitment of key personnel, prior to the enactment of this Bill. Work on this is ongoing between my officials, the Public Appointments Service and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. While the functions of an coimisiún primarily relate to the regulation of services, it will also have wider roles relating to the protection of children, research, education, media literacy, and journalistic and creative supports. In carrying out these roles, an coimisiún will support and promote an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment. There is a widespread problem with the availability of harmful and criminal content on widely used online services. It is clear that self-regulation in online safety is not working and that oversight and accountability is required. As regards online safety, the Bill requires an coimisiún to regulate video-sharing platform services in line with the directive. In addition, the Bill provides an coimisiún with the power to designate further online services for regulation from a pool of relevant online services.In this context, an online service is relevant if it facilitates access to user-generated content. This covers a very wide range of services, including social media services, many gaming services and online messaging and storage services. In order to designate an online service, an coimisiún is required to conduct a risk assessment of the service, including regarding the prevalence of harmful online content available through the service and the nature and scale of the service. This approach will enable an coimisiún to direct its energies to the areas where they are most needed. Once an online service is designated, an coimisiún can require it to comply with binding online safety codes. These codes can require online services to adapt their systems and processes in three key areas which are rules for content moderation and complaints handling; rules regarding the design of the service and how and why it displays certain content to users; and rules about advertising. With regard to video-sharing platform services, an coimisiún is required to apply the provisions of the directive to those services through these codes. The main aim of the online safety codes is to tackle and progressively reduce the availability of harmful online content on designated online services. In this regard, the Bill clearly defines harmful online content. Online content is harmful where it either relates to one of 40 criminal offences listed in the Bill, or is cyberbullying, the promotion or encouragement of eating disorders, self-harm or suicide, or makes available knowledge of methods of self-harm or suicide. The schedule of criminal offences includes the offences under Coco's Law, or the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, with regard to image-based abuse, abusive communications and harassment. For harmful online content which is not criminal in nature, a risk test must be met for it to be considered harmful. This includes whether the online content gives rise to any risk to a person's life or a reasonably-foreseeable risk to a person's mental or physical health. The Bill also provides for a mechanism for future categories of harmful online content, both criminal and non-criminal, to be added to this list, subject to Oireachtas oversight. The Bill also requires an coimisiún to create a super-complaints scheme, under which nominated bodies such as expert NGOs can formally notify an coimisiún of a range of online safety issues. In addition, the Bill empowers an coimisiún to audit the handling of complaints by designated online services. In summary, the online safety elements of this Bill will ensure that an individual person will be exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to and robustly deal with complaints when they are made. In this regard, an coimisiún will have significant powers of compliance and sanction to hold these services to account. As the Members will be aware, I have established an expert group to examine providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. The role of the expert group is to examine whether it is practicable to do this and, if so, how it may be done. The group has 90 days from the date of its first meeting, which was on 31 January 2022, to examine this matter and to report back to me with its recommendations. Following this, I will then consider tabling an amendment as the Bill passes through the Oireachtas. If an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for, I would like to ensure that it is. In this regard, any proposals that I bring forward must be workable and legally robust. In terms of the regulation of broadcasting and streaming services, this will for the most part be done through media codes and rules. Media codes are mostly about the content of programming, including rules for programme standards and advertising. Media rules, on the other hand, are mostly about the presentation and structure of the service, including rules regarding the time given to advertising, accessibility requirements for persons with disabilities and quotas for European works. In order to ensure the uninterrupted regulation of broadcasters, provision is made for the existing broadcasting codes and rules to be carried over and become media codes and rules. The Bill also provides for the mandatory registration of streaming services to ensure that, in line with the directive, all streaming services established in Ireland are subject to appropriate regulation. Broadcasters will remain regulated on a contractual basis. The Bill also provides for the transposition of an optional provision in the directive to empower an coimisiún to levy broadcasters and streaming services, including those established elsewhere in the EU, in respect of any revenues that they may make in Ireland in order to fund the production of European works, including Irish-produced works.Provision is made so that the money collected could be dispersed by an coimisiún through a content production scheme. The Bill does not set the amounts of any such levy as this would be inflexible but enables an coimisiún to design and implement a levy having regard to relevant economic factors. There are potential risks and benefits to a levy, including for consumers, and it is intended that an coimisiún would thoroughly examine these matters before these provisions are commenced. Turning to a more detailed overview of the provisions of the Bill, it is first important to note that it amends the Broadcasting Act 2009. Part 1 addresses preliminary and general matters. Part 2 amends the 2009 Act to insert and amend a number of definitions, including key definitions such as the definition of a "relevant online service". Furthermore, sections 4 and 5 under this part provide for the relevant jurisdiction rules from the directive. Part 3 amends Part 2 of the 2009 Act to provide for the establishment of coimisiún na meán. Key provisions under this part include provision for the independence of an coimisiún, the appointment of commissioners, including a chairperson, an coimisiún to impose levies on regulated services - not including community broadcasters - to fund its operations, an coimisiún to report on its operations and the accountability of the chairperson to the Committee of Public Accounts and the chairperson and other commissioners to relevant Oireachtas committees. Part 3 also provides for the general powers and functions of an coimisiún. It is important to note that this provision does not contain every power and function to be exercised by an coimisiún but does set out, at a high-level, certain powers and functions that an coimisiún shall exercise and matters that it shall take into account when exercising its powers. This includes upholding Ireland's democratic values, protecting the interests of the public, in particular children, ensuring the diverse needs of the people of this island are served by our media, stimulating content production, particularly in respect of the Irish language and climate matters and sustaining independent and impartial journalism. In particular, an coimisiún is provided with a strong education and research role. Part 4 provides for matters related to the registration of providers of streaming services through the insertion of a new Part 3A into the 2009 Act. Part 5 concerns the duties, codes and rules applicable to radio and television broadcasters and streaming services and provides for these through the insertion of a new part 3B into the 2009 Act. Chapter 2 of this new Part concerns duties, including in relation to privacy, news and current affairs and advertising. Chapters 3 and 5 of this new part concern media codes and rules. Chapter 3 of this Part also provides that existing broadcasting codes and rules made by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, such as access rules, will continue in force following the enactment of the Bill. Part 6 amends Part 4 of the 2009 Act and primarily concerns changes to take into account the establishment of an coimisiún and the statutory regulation of streaming services in respect of redress mechanisms. Part 9 amends Part 7 of the 2009 Act to take into account the establishment of an coimisiún in regard to public service broadcasting, allow for the part-funding of the broadcasting functions of an coimisiún from television licence receipts, provide for changes to the calculation of total advertising time for broadcasters and insert a new chapter 7 regarding the availability and prominence of public service programmes and services. Part 11 inserts a new Part 8A into the 2009 Act concerning online safety regulation. Chapter 1 of this new part concerns the definitions of harmful online content and age-inappropriate online content, which I have already detailed. Chapter 2 concerns the process for designating relevant online services for regulation. Chapter 3 concerns the making of online safety codes, the matters which they can address and matters which need to be taken into account when the codes are being drawn up, including the protection of children, fundamental rights, the nature and scale of online services and the impact of automated decision-making or algorithms. Chapter 4 concerns the making of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices. Chapter 5 concerns an obligation on an coimisiún to establish a super-complaints scheme for nominated bodies, and a number of other matters. Part 11 also inserts a new Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act containing the list of offence specific categories of harmful online content. Part 12 inserts a new Part 8B into the 2009 Act concerning investigations and sanctions. Chapter 2 and of this new Part provides an coimisiún with the power to appoint authorised officers and concerns the procedure for investigations by those officers and decisions by an coimisiún following investigations. Chapter 4 concerns the imposition of administrative financial sanctions. Chapter 5 of this new Part provides an coimisiún with the power to issue notices to end a contravention and provides for secondary criminal liability for senior executives linked to these. Chapter 6 provides an coimisiún with the power to seek court orders to block access to non-compliant online services in Ireland. Chapter 7 provides an coimisiún with the power to issue content limitation notices in respect of individual items of harmful online content. Chapter 8 provides for three categories of summary offences under the Bill and provides an coimisiún with the power to prosecute these offences. This part also inserts a new Schedule 4 into the 2009 Act concerning oral hearings. Parts 7, 8, 10, 13, 15 and 17 amend various Parts of the 2009 Act and other relevant Acts to take into account the dissolution of the BAI and the establishment of an coimisiún. Part 14 inserts a new Part 10A in the 2009 Act concerning European works. This Part provides for the requirements of the directive for European works quotas and prominence and provides an coimisiún with the power to introduce a European works levy and European works scheme. Lastly, Part 16 provides for transitional matters. As can be seen, given its subject matter, this Bill is necessarily complex and far-reaching. It deals with a wide range of important issues from modernising media regulation to introducing, for the first time, online safety regulation to tackle the availability of serious forms of harmful online content. I would like to conclude by acknowledging the work undertaken by the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media on the general scheme of the Bill as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process. The report of the committee demonstrated the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny to the democratic process. I was pleased to address a significant number of the recommendations made by the joint committee through the Bill. As we now progress through the next phase of parliamentary scrutiny of the Bill, I look forward to the Senators' contributions.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their valuable contributions. The constructive approach demonstrated during the debate reflects our shared determination to put in place an effective regulatory framework for online safety and audiovisual on-demand services. It builds on the intensive scrutiny the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media gave to the general scheme of the Bill last year. The diverse range of issues raised on the floor in the past few hours highlights both the scale of the Bill and the fact it will break new ground regulating sectors that have so far not been subject to oversight. As such, it represents an important step into a new frontier of lawmaking. I agree with Senator McGahon that this Bill is not the final word when it comes to legislation in respect of the online world but rather the first of many in the coming years as more legislation comes from Europe. I reiterate the core contents and objectives of the Bill. It will ensure we are all exposed to far less harmful online content and that online services will be required by law to respond to, and robustly deal with, complaints when they are made. While the Bill will not and cannot address every issue of concern arising from the online world, it will create a robust and adaptable framework for accountability that can be amended and expanded over time to match the pace at which, as Senator McGahon mentioned, the tech world moves. This framework will be enforced by Coimisiún na Meán, which will include an online safety commissioner and have one of the most modern and robust suites of regulatory powers in Irish law. In providing a basis and starting point for the regulation of harmful online content, the establishment of Coimisiún na Meán is the most vital part of the Bill. In regard to broadcasters and streaming services, the Bill is fundamentally about the modernisation of the regulatory environment, enabling the commission to deal with the continuing changes in how we engage with and support our media in Ireland. The Bill has a critical EU law dimension, given it will transpose the revised audiovisual media service directive, which has strongly informed the underpinnings of the coimisiún. As Senators will be aware, given the complexity of this legislation, we missed the transposition deadline for the directive, which is one reason I am especially keen to see the legislation progress through the Houses to enactment as soon as possible. Having said that, I am committed to comprehensive debate in this House on Committee and Report Stages, which will provide opportunities for us to discuss each section of the Bill and any amendments in further detail. In the time that remains, I will endeavour to address the issues raised by various Senators. I thank Senators Martin, Cassells, McGahon, Warfield, Sherlock and Higgins for raising the individual complaints mechanism, a matter I have been considering closely for some time. The issue of providing for avenues of redress against individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the Bill as published is to provide Coimisiún na Meán with the power, through the making of binding online safety codes, to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanism in place, with powers of audit and investigation in that respect. In addition, the Bill provides that the coimisiún shall establish a super-complaints scheme under which bodies such as NGOs or other expert groups may be nominated to notify the commission of matters relating to online safety, including in respect of the availability of harmful online content. There are practical issues with providing the online safety commissioner with an almost ombudsman-like role in this regard, including the volume of content online, the fact it will regulate some services on an EU-wide basis, issues of due process and questions of how quickly decisions could reasonably be made. However, in light of the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee in the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Bill, I am examining how these issues can be addressed. As I set out at the start of the debate, this is why I established an expert group to report to me within 90 days on these matters, with recommendations I may use as the basis for an amendment to introduce an individual complaints mechanism. The terms of reference of the expert group are very much focused on the practicalities of whether the individual complaints mechanism can work. Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the Australian e-safety commissioner, and this group will engage with that commissioner. I had hoped the Australian e-safety commissioner could be a member of the group but she was not available. Instead, she has committed to engaging with the expert group, which is important. As I have said on many occasions, if an individual complaints mechanism can be provided for in the Bill, I will ensure that is done. I met the expert advisory group and made clear at our first meeting that that was my intention. Given the timeline set out in the terms of reference for the group, I expect to receive the report at the end of April and then consider whether and what amendments will be required in the context of Committee Stage in the Dáil. Taking account of the work of the expert groups under way, I do not want to pre-empt or prejudge any recommendations it may make, although I reiterate I am committed to a full and open discussion of any Government amendments made in the Dáil when the Bill, as amended, is returned to this House. Senator Keogan raised the issue of the commission being funded from the licence fee. The Bill will enable this but not require it. It is carried over from the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 and will allow the broadcasting levy to be reduced for broadcasters, including independent radio. To clarify, TG4 is not funded from the licence fee. Senators Keogan and Pauline O'Reilly spoke about how a rights-based approach has been taken in the Bill, which will underpin the work of Coimisiún na Meán. This means there will be a careful balance between the need to safeguard freedom of expression while taking into account that children and other members of the public need to be safeguarded. Their rights matter too. Senators Martin, McGahon, Warfield, Kyne, O'Loughlin and Murphy raised the issue of disinformation. This is, of course, a significant and complex issue that requires a distinct and targeted response. The EU is reviewing the code of practice on disinformation in order to strengthen it and to link it to the forthcoming Digital Services Act, which will set out the standards for platforms in dealing with these issues. The code of practice, a European Commission imitative, has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation.The commission intends that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. In addition, the European Commission has established the European Digital Media Observatory, including a hub in Dublin City University, which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. Senator Sherlock asked about specifying the role of the online safety commissioner. This is primarily a drafting issue. During the drafting process, legal advice was given that explicitly carving out specific roles within the multi-commissioner model could create difficulties if, for example, a commissioner was ill or if we wanted to appoint more than one online safety commissioner to an coimisiún. I am looking at how these issues can be overcome and will table an amendment to the Bill to address this matter. In any case, it is my intention, and that of the Government, to advertise for, and recruit, an online safety commissioner this year through an open, transparent and effective process managed by the Public Appointments Service. Work is under way in this regard.  Senator Kyne questioned why this would be a commission and not a board. This is the model for many regulators. For example, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has an executive chair and a number of commissioners, while ComReg and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities also have a multi-person commission model. Senator Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of youth advisory groups. The Bill, I am glad, provides for advisory committees to coimisiún na meán to be established. Senator O'Loughlin asked about the educational role of the media commission. The online safety commissioner will have a role in carrying out educational initiatives such as public information campaigns and I will work with existing educational bodies such as the Department of Education, webwise.ie and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment on this. The commissioner will also be able to endorse third-party providers of online safety educational materials, which will help schools source appropriate and robust online safety materials for students. Senators Cassells and Warfield raised the Future of Media Commission report. The programme for Government, Our Shared Future, provided for the establishment of the commission to consider the future of print, broadcast and online media. This was in recognition of the challenges facing the media sector, such as falling advertising revenue arising from the shift in consumption patterns due to evolving technology. The commission was tasked with making recommendations to the Taoiseach and myself to ensure that the future funding of public service broadcasting could be sustainable, give security of funding, ensure independent editorial oversight and deliver value for money to the public. The commission completed its work last autumn and submitted its report to the Taoiseach and me. As Senators can imagine, the report's recommendations are far-reaching and will inform media and broadcasting policy in the coming years. The commission's recommendations require careful and detailed consideration, particularly in light of a range of other complex and interrelated issues that will require decisions by the Government in the wider media and digital space. It is intended that the report be brought to Government for consideration shortly. Senators Cassells, McGahon and Malcolm Byrne raised the issue of staffing. Some €5.5 million was secured as part of budget 2022 to establish the media commission on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. This funding will help in the recruitment of key personnel. I previously stated that staffing of approximately 120 will be required during the start-up phase of the media commission. In the longer term, I estimate that the commission will require in excess of the 300 I mentioned at the beginning of the debate to fully operationalise its envisaged functions. I anticipate the need for additional staff, should the commission be assigned further functions in the future, including in respect of upcoming EU legislation. Of course these staff would need to have specific expertise. That goes without saying. With regard to the data tracking issue raised by Senator Sherlock, that is a different matter from content regulation and lies with the Data Protection Commissioner. However, the Bill provides for co-operation between the online safety commissioner, coimisiún na meán and other regulators.  Senators Cassells, Warfield, Sherlock, Higgins, Currie and Pauline O'Reilly raised bans on the advertising of gambling, alcohol, foods high in fat, salt or sugar, or HFSS foods, and infant formula, particularly with regard to advertising to children. It is not a question of bravery. These are significant and cross-cutting matters that bring together a range of different policy areas under different Ministers. For example, the regulation of gambling advertising is set out in the recently published general scheme of the gambling regulation Bill, which comes under the Department of Justice. Infant formula, food and alcohol advertising are policy areas under the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Health and are already subject to extensive regulation through, for example, the Public Health (Alcohol) Act 2018. While my officials are engaging with officials from other relevant Departments on these matters, it is clear that the functions and expertise for these policy areas lies more appropriately with those Departments. The online safety commissioner will have a role in regulating commercial advertising on certain online services through its online safety codes. Just as the BAI does currently, the commissioner will engage with health experts and others in developing these codes and will reflect public policy in this regard. This will also be the case in respect of media codes and rules that will apply to broadcasters and video on-demand services. Senator Higgins raised section 30 of the Data Protection Act, which banned processing of children's data but was never commenced. This confirms that the issue has a strong data protection dimension. The regulators will collaborate. The Senator also raised the potential overreach. The powers have been scrutinised by our legal advisers but I am open to listening to concerns in that regard. The Bill provides for measures to ensure the prominence and findability of public service content. I agree with Senator Warfield that this is an important matter as the volume of content and services expands. On the matter of data and access for researchers, this will be provided for in the Digital Services Act. Senator Conway raised age verification for children online. There is a real issue with young children accessing online services that simply were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue of which I am particularly aware, both as a parent of young children and as chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety. We need to find workable solutions to the negative uses of online spaces. Anonymity raises a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented. In this regard, an EU-funded pilot programme called euCONSENT is in development. That pilot aims to deliver a system for online age verification and parental consent that balances the rights of children with the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content. The outcome of this pilot will inform any approach taken to this issue at EU and national level. I will ask an coimisiún to look at this issue as a priority and to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. As I said previously, not everything can be dealt with in a single Bill but what matters now is that we have the framework in place. Senators Cassells, Warfield, Malcolm Byrne and Kyne raised the issue of the content production levy. The revised AVMSD provides member states with the option of introducing a levy on television broadcasting and video on-demand services to fund audiovisual content production. To exercise this option, section 53 of the legislation provides that coimisiún na meán may introduce a content production levy and a content production scheme to fund the production of European works, including Irish works. The proceeds of any such levy would go into a content production scheme, which producers could apply for funding from. It would be similar to the sound and vision fund. It is intended that this levy would be introduced by the comisiún, subject to an assessment of its viability and whether it would have negative effects. As I said earlier, there are risks as well as benefits here for the Irish audiovisual sector. In line with EU law, any levy introduced under the Bill must be imposed equally on all services targeting the Irish market, including Irish services and those based outside Ireland. That means that Irish media service providers such as RTÉ or Virgin Media Television would also be subject to this levy. In addition, both Irish services and those based in other member states of any size will then be eligible to apply for the content production fund established as a result of the levy. Any levy will only apply to income earned within this State. For example, for a provider such as Netflix, which earns 2% of its overall EU revenues in this State, the levy can only apply to that 2%. The aforementioned factors could significantly constrain the overall positive impact on the potential level of additional funding for Irish content. I was asked if I would set out the exact percentages and the process involved with the levy in the legislation. That approach would be inflexible and an coimisiún, as an independent body, should have the power to design and enforce the levy and change it over time. I expect that an examination of the content levy will be among the priorities of an coimisiún upon its establishment. I am almost out of time. I apologise to those who raised issues I did not address.I look forward to a constructive and detailed debate. As I said, I am committed to that debate. The interest Senators have shown, their attendance and their varied contributions show how important this legislation is to many Senators. I look forward to debating it further.
