CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for her amendments. I cannot accept amendment No. 188 because, as a matter of principle, I cannot accept amendments that would unduly limit the discretion of the comisiún in the creation and maintenance of regulatory codes. However, the proposal in amendment No. 189 is a good one and while I reject the amendment today, I am considering the matter for Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is important to note that not all online safety codes will apply to every designated online service. The designation of online services for regulation and the application of different online safety codes to them is based on assessments of risk. As such, requiring the provision of information from providers of designated online services of their compliance with all online safety codes does not align with the model of regulation provided for in the Bill. An coimisiún is empowered to require the provision of large volumes of technical, detailed and commercially-sensitive information from providers of designated online services in order to assess their compliance with online safety codes. I do not see that it would be desirable or practical to lay such information before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their amendment. We agree that it is important that the Bill contains robust and proportionate powers of investigation and enforcement sufficient to ensure compliance with the online safety codes issued by an coimisiún. As the Senators will be aware, the Bill as initiated already provides for significant administrative financial sanctions in respect of a contravention under the Bill and for the liability of a director or manager of a designated online service for a specified criminal offence in situations where a contravention continues following the decision of an coimisiún. Section 139Y of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, defines failure to comply with an online safety code as a contravention under the Act. It is important to note that a contravention is not in itself a criminal offence under the Act. The Bill sets out a clear process for investigation of a contravention which begins with the appointment of an authorised officer to carry out an investigation and make a report to an coimisiún. The Bill provides significant powers to authorised officers, including powers of search and seizure. Following their investigation of a contravention, an authorised officer must prepare a report to present to an coimisiún for its decision. On receipt of the report, an coimisiún shall, on the balance of probabilities, decide whether or not a contravention has been committed by a provider of a designated online service and whether to impose administrative financial sanction. It may impose administrative financial sanctions of up to €20 million, or 10% of the turnover. Given the scale of some of the designated online services which will be regulated by an coimisiún, a sanction of 10% of turnover may run into the hundreds of millions of euro. If a provider of a designated online service continues to commit a contravention following a decision of an coimisiún, section 139ZT of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by section 46 of the Bill, provides that an coimisiún may issue a notice requiring the provider to put an end to the contravention. If the provider fails to comply with such a notice, a director, manager, secretary or other officer of the provider can be held liable for the criminal offence of failing to comply with a notice by coimisiún na meán to put an end to a contravention. The criminal offence is a category 1 offence under the Bill, which is set out in section 139ZZ of the Act, as amended, as an offence for which a person is liable (a) on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both, or (b) on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both. The provision is tightly drawn and limited to circumstances in which the facts underlying the offence and indeed secondary liability in respect of it are provable in practical terms. This is very important and the legitimacy of the regulatory framework and the legislation will hinge in many respects on its operability. I want to emphasise that the provision for secondary criminal liability in the Bill was arrived at following extensive consultation with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences. The amendment brought forward by the Senators is intended to set out a new offence which would apply when a designated online service has failed to comply with an online safety code in the first instance and for associated criminal liability. I absolutely understand the point the Senators are making regarding the dissuasive effects of applying criminal sanctions in the first instance of a failure to comply with an online safety code, rather than following a failure to comply with a notice issued by an coimisiún. However, I am advised that the dissuasion sought could only occur if the offence was provable in practical terms to the legal standard of "beyond reasonable doubt". This is achievable in the circumstances in which the Bill provides for secondary criminal liability but I am advised that there are doubts as to whether that would be the case in the circumstances described by the Senators. In addition, the intention of the Senators here would provide a legislative choice to an coimisiún where it has determined a contravention has occurred to either pursue the imposition of an administrative financial sanction, or prosecute or pursue the prosecution of a provider of a designated online service for an offence tied to that contravention and potentially a secondary prosecution against a senior manager. Where such a legislative choice exists, the question arises as to how an coimisiún would choose between these courses of action, particularly as they have different legal standards of proof attached to them. This creates a decision point which would be subject to judicial review and in respect of which it would be difficult for an coimisiún to defend its choosing either course of action. A mischievous actor could easily make an argument that an coimisiún is only pursuing an administrative financial sanction because it does not have sufficient proof to pursue a criminal case and that an coimisiún is denying the provider due process on that basis. I have no intention of introducing such an opportunity into this Bill. For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Senator said, this is ground-breaking legislation. It represents the first steps to regulate user-generated online content. In establishing a whole new regulatory framework and regulator to enforce it, Coimisiún na Meán, the Bill lays a foundation that we can build on. There will be changes to the regulatory framework, driven by initiatives taken at EU level, for example, not least through the recently agreed EU digital services Act, which does not take the approach proposed by the Senator. It is important that the regulatory framework that we are establishing as a foundation stone is effective and that any provisions we include are applicable in practice by Coimisiún na Meán. It is important in that context that consideration is given to the investigation and enforcement regime set out in the Bill so that it can be done in practice. I meant to refer to the comparisons between the provisions for secondary criminal liability in this Bill and other legislation, such as the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, as amended. The offences set out in that Act for secondary criminal liability attach focus to failures by persons to comply with the provisions of that Act, including failures to discharge clearly identified duties or non-compliance with requirements to prepare plans. Such provisions would have more in common with the existing provision in the Bill which attaches criminal liability to the failure to comply with a notice to end a contravention issued by the coimisiún, given that the facts of compliance or non-compliance would be relatively clear, which is an important consideration when the matter must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. As I said earlier, my advice is that the dissuasion the Senator seeks could only occur if the offence was provable, in practical terms, to the legal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. This is achievable in circumstances in which the Bill provides for secondary criminal liability. I am advised that there are doubts as to whether that would be the case in the circumstances the Senator describes. It is vital that those who contravene the regulatory provisions can be sanctioned appropriately and effectively, up to and including criminal sanctions. We agree on that. The approach we have taken followed extensive engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences. I have outlined the sanctions of €20 million or up to 10% of the turnover for non-compliance. The coimisiún may issue a notice to end that non-compliance. Failure to comply can lead to an offence for which officers may be found liable. My advice is that this is just not workable and that what we have in the Bill, after extensive engagement with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and consideration of the report of the Law Reform Commission on regulatory powers and corporate offences, is what is workable, which is why it is in the Bill. I am sure there will be engagement with officials on other amendments. I have committed to that between now and Report Stage. I am sure this will arise in the engagement. I am being straight with the Senator that I will not commit, because my advice as it stands is that this is not workable. That does not stop the Senator from engaging further with the officials. I am happy for that to take place, because I know it will happen with other amendments the Senator has tabled. I am not committing to anything. It would not be fair for me to say I will bring something in on Report Stage. Engagement will happen. My advice, as it stands, is that what we have provided for in the Bill is workable and the amendment is not.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They will not be in a position to share the advice but they will discuss the principles with the Senator.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I have said previously, it is not usual practice to lay internal records of processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas, nor for the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to store such materials. As such, I do not see the value in doing so. Regarding the matter of the records of consultations, I again note that I understand the intention of the amendment is to ensure the transparency of the comisiún in respect of those persons it seeks to consult with. However, as I said previously, as a public body, the comisiún will be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability requirements, including to the Oireachtas joint committee. For that reason, I do not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for tabling the amendment. The purpose of section 139X of the 2009 Act as inserted by the Bill is to require the comisiún to develop a strategy to ensure its compliance with the provisions of the e-commerce directive 2000 regarding the liability framework for intermediary service providers set out in that directive. The purpose of this provision does not relate to the matters raised by the Senator’s amendment and, as such, I do not accept it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I acknowledge the importance of ensuring that the offence-specific category of harmful online content appropriately covers all online content that relates to the offence of assault. I understand that the intention of amendments Nos. 194a and 194b is to ensure that the use of "force" does not unintentionally exclude the non-contact application of such, for example, through online content. I am satisfied that this is not the case, as "force", which is defined in section 2 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997, includes, for example, the application of light. As I consider the effect of these amendments to be provided for in the Bill, I will not accept it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To be clear, the definition of "force" in the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 includes, as specified in section 2(2)(a) of that Act, "application of heat, light, electric current, noise or any other form of energy". I do not see a circumstance in which the matter raised by the Senator would not be covered.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am confident of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On amendment No. 196, I do not see the value in inserting the word "reasonably" into the provision. The circumstances in which an authorised officer may use his or her powers are set down comprehensively in section 139ZC and are, among other things, subject to considerations of reasonableness. On amendment No. 197, section 139ZC clearly provides that an authorised officer cannot keep material or equipment obtained in the course of an investigation in perpetuity and that, during the course of an investigation, may keep such materials or equipment for a period deemed reasonably necessary. This discretion is proper and sufficiently drawn to mitigate against unnecessary retention of equipment and materials. I do not believe that requiring an authorised officer's supervisor to statutorily review this matter every eight weeks is proportionate. It would be an unnecessary administrative burden, especially during lengthy investigations. Amendment No. 198 is not substantially different to the present provision in the Bill enabling an authorised officer to be accompanied by a member of An Garda Síochána and anyone the officer considers appropriate. Accordingly, I am not accepting these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 139ZC clearly provides than an authorised officer cannot keep material or equipment obtained in the course of an investigation in perpetuity and that during the course of an investigation the officer may keep such materials or equipment for such a period as deemed reasonably necessary. This discretion is proper and sufficiently drawn to mitigate against unnecessary retention of equipment and materials. Furthermore, it is clear that authorised officers do not have the power to keep such equipment or material upon the conclusion of an investigation. I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	First, I note that the indemnification of authorised officers is a standard and necessary legislative provision. In this regard, the proposed deletion of the relevant provision by amendment No. 200 is not something I can accept. What the provision does is to squarely place the legal responsibility for the actions of an authorised officer on coimisiún na meán, except where the officer acts in bad faith. It is right and proper that complaints in respect of the actions of a person engaged by an coimisiún to carry out an investigation should first and foremost be directed at an coimisiún. Otherwise, a bad actor could stymie investigations simply by threatening legal action against the investigator as an individual. As regards amendment No. 201, it is difficult to understand why the exercise of such an important legal provision should be subject solely to the quantity of claims against an authorised officer. One can easily imagine a mischievous actor making several separate claims to exceed the threshold in order to be able to bring a claim directly against the authorised officer. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As regards amendment No. 202, I do not see the value of specifying a maximum timeframe of eight months for an authorised officer to draft the report of an investigation. The wording of the Bill at present is: "As soon as is practicable after the completion of an investigation, the authorised officer shall prepare a draft report of the investigation." In my view, this is sufficient to ensure the draft report will be prepared within a reasonable time, depending on the nature of the investigation, whether it is within weeks or months. As regards amendment No. 203, I believe the section as currently worded, particularly the reference to fairness, covers matters of necessity and proportionality that may arise in respect of rules relating to the conduct of investigations. In this regard, I note that an coimisiún and its officers will be subject to the extensive provisions in this Part on how investigations may be carried out, and that there are more than sufficient principles and policies in this respect. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendments. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Section 139ZG of the 2009 Act, as inserted by this Bill, requires an coimisiún to publish guidelines made by it in respect of the operation of the enforcement provisions of the Bill. It is proper that an coimisiún should be subject to the same obligation in respect of rules made by it under section 139ZF regarding the conduct of investigations. Accordingly, I am rejecting the amendment but I am considering the matter for Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I understand the purpose of the amendment and that it is trying to mitigate against perceived delays to the execution of enforcement decisions, whether the granting of a judicial review should override or pause the application of a decision of an coimisiún is a matter for the courts. In relation to this matter, I note that section 38 of the 2009 Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies how applications for judicial review regarding decisions by an coimisiún shall be treated under this Bill, including in terms of timescales, the matters that may be considered, the staying of proceedings and the role of various courts. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Senator is a agreeable, I will get my officials to get back to her.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As a matter of public policy, the treatment of moneys raised through administrative financial sanctions is for such moneys to be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. Hypothecating the moneys, as the Senator suggests, would be counter to this policy. In addition, it would appear to create an incentive for coimisiún na meán to attempt to impose more or higher financial penalties than warranted in order to increase its own operating budget since it will have a function in promoting media literacy. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment aims to enable coimisiún na meán to issue a content limitation notice to restrict the availability of specified content to people aged 18 or over. This would be in cases where the content appears to an coimisiún to fall within the definition of "age-inappropriate content" in section 44, by inserting section 139D into the 2009 Act. In this regard, it is important to note that the content limitation notice provisions in section 46, inserting sections 139ZV to 139ZY into the 2009 Act, are limited in application to "harmful online content" and not to "age-inappropriate online content". This is to limit the potential involvement of coimisiún na meán in matters regarding individual pieces of content to only that content expressly deemed harmful under the Bill. The definition of "age-inappropriate online content" does not constitute a category of "harmful online content" under the legislation, but rather stands separately and is intended to inform the creation of online safety guidance materials and advisory notices. Section 44 is inserting sections 139R to 139T into the 2009 Act rather than online safety codes and, as such, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for bringing forward amendments Nos. 208 to 227, inclusive, which relate to the European works levy and scheme provisions contained in section 53. I acknowledge that this is an important issue for the Irish audiovisual sector and it is one on which my officials have engaged extensively with the sector. By way of background, Article 13(2) of the audiovisual media services directive gives member states the option to levy media service providers under their jurisdiction or which are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories. The proceeds of such a levy must be used to fund the production of European works. Section 53 exercises this option by providing for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund a content production scheme to support the production of European works, which of course includes Irish works. The section further provides that funds raised by the levy can be used to support the production of new audiovisual programmes across a number of areas, including Irish culture and language, climate change, and equality, diversity and inclusion. Both the levy and the associated scheme will be administered by coimisiún na meán. The section also provides that a minimum of 25% of funds raised by the content production levy shall be for the production of programmes in the Irish language. As Senators will be aware, there are a range of public funding measures in place to support the production of audiovisual works in the State, including through the section 481 film tax credit, Screen Ireland, the sound and vision scheme operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and through our public service broadcasters, TG4 and RTÉ, which are funded through the Exchequer and television licence fee, respectively. In 2020, these supports collectively amounted to over €198 million. The content production levy will provide the means to provide further support to the audiovisual sector, which has been an Irish success story. Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 provide that an order imposing a levy on the media service providers shall be not less than 3% but not more than 5% of their revenues from subscribers and-or advertising revenues. It is my view that it is not appropriate to set out a percentage for the levy in primary legislation, given the need to carry out further research into the risks and benefits of such a measure. Setting a specified rate in legislation is inflexible, as it would prevent an coimisiún from varying the rate following any research it may carry out or subject to changing circumstances. It is important to note that any levy system will have to abide by the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination under EU law. Accordingly, any levy will be imposed equally on all audiovisual media services targeting the Irish market, both those based outside Ireland and Irish media service providers, such as RTÉ and Virgin Media Television, will also be subject to this levy. In addition, Irish services and services based elsewhere in the European Union would be eligible to apply to the content production fund established as a result of the levy.Furthermore, it should be noted that any levy will only apply to income earned within the State. For example, if a provider such as Netflix earns 2% of its overall EU revenues in the State, the levy can only apply to that 2% of its overall revenues. These factors could significantly constrain the overall positive impact on the potential level of additional funding for Irish content.  Amendments Nos. 208 and 209 also provide for the inclusion of timelines requiring the content production levy to be commenced by a specified period. I intend to commence the provisions of the Bill giving effect to content production levy after coimisiún na meán has carried out independent research into the viability of such a levy in an Irish context. It is important that a thorough examination of these issues is undertaken in order to avoid any unintended consequences arising from the introduction of a levy. It is intended that an examination of the content production levy will be among an coimisiún’s priorities on establishment. I expect that an coimisiún will carry out a programme of stakeholder engagement on the matter and will subsequently report to me with its recommendations. For the reasons I have set out, I do not intend to accept amendments Nos. 208 and 209. Amendment No. 210 provides that the content production levy shall be calculated on the amount of the subscriptions collected from audiences in the State, and on the amount paid to media service providers by advertisers for advertisements targeting audiences in the State. The amendment also proposes that the levy order should have effect for a minimum period of five years. Similar to amendments Nos. 209 and 210, I do not intend to accept this amendment as I believe specific details regarding the calculation of the levy should only be decided following a thorough examination of the content levy. Setting out such detail in primary legislation would constrain the options available to an coimisiún in making a levy order. Amendment No. 212 provides that a content production scheme or schemes shall be made as soon as possible after 1 January 2023. Amendment No. 213 serves a similar purpose by obliging an coimisiún to implement a content production scheme as soon as possible after establishment. Given I do not intend to commence the content production levy until the necessary research has been undertaken to inform the levy design I cannot accept amendments Nos. 212 and 213. Amendment No. 214 is a consequential amendment to the previous amendment and I therefore do not intend to accept it. I understand the intention of amendment No. 211 arises from a concern that sections 21 and 22 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as amended by the Bill, which relate to the industry levy imposed for the purposes of funding the operational costs of an coimisiún, may adversely impact the operation of the content production levy and cause confusion as to which levy is being referred to. Section 159E(8) provides that the terms "levy" and "levy order" should be construed in relation to sections 159E and 159F only. Section 21(12) provides that the terms "levy order" and "levy period" used in sections 21 and 22 should be construed in relation to those sections only. I am advised that this ensures a clear delineation between the levy set out in sections 21 and 22 and that set out in section 159E. Accordingly, I am not accepting amendment No. 211. Amendment No. 215 sets out additional detail in terms of the nature of programmes to be funded under a scheme, and specifies that drama, films, animation and factual programmes can be funded under a scheme. In addition, it sets out that a scheme should specifically fund works by Irish creative talent. The amendment also sets out that a scheme can provide development funding to support the production of audiovisual works. First, the additional detail included in the paragraph (c) of the amendment regarding the types of programming to be funded appears to achieve the same policy intent as the current wording of the section. The wording of section 159F(2) of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by section 53 of the Bill, provides that a scheme can fund the production of audiovisual programmes. As this wording already captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes, I am therefore of the view that it is unnecessary to include any specific detail in this element of the provision. Paragraph (b) of this amendment proposes that a content production scheme would specifically support works which relate specifically to the works of Irish creative talent. On the fact of it, the intrinsic quality of works of Irish creative talent would be appear to be that such works are produced by Irish citizens. This would imply that persons of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme. While I am of course strongly in favour of doing all we can to support Irish creatives, this element would run contrary to European Union law on non-discrimination as it would appear to place Irish nationals at an advantage over nationals or residents of other member states.  Paragraph (d) of this amendment adds a clarification that a content production scheme may make provision for development funding for programmes funded under this section. While I am of the view that the existing provision in the Bill as currently drafted already provides for this, I acknowledge that there is scope to add further clarity regarding development funding. Accordingly, I have asked my officials to consider the matter further with a view to bringing forward an amendment. At this point, I would signal that my intention is to address any amendments to the content production levy and scheme on Dáil Committee Stage rather than in this House, to allow for meaningful engagement with stakeholders on this issue. Accordingly, while I cannot accept amendment No. 215, I hope to address some of the concerns raised by the amendment. Amendments Nos. 216 to 221, inclusive, seek to amend the language applying to the kind of audiovisual programmes which may be funded by a content production scheme with a view to further specifying the scope of content which may be supported. Amendment No. 216 adds the term "diverse" before the reference to "experiences of the people of the island of Ireland" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I understand the intention of the amendment. However, I believe that the term "experiences of the people of the island of Ireland" necessarily carries with it the recognition that such experiences shall be diverse, given the existing diversity among our people. I do not therefore intend to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 217 amends the term "people of Irish ancestry living abroad" to "people of Irish origin or ancestry living abroad" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I understand the intention of the amendment but believe that the term "Irish ancestry" already incorporates people of Irish origin living abroad. The term "ancestry" is not intended refer to ethnic origin in a way that implies racial connotations. Instead, the term is intended to refer to origin, at some point, on our island in all its diversity, both past and present. I do not therefore intend to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 218 adds the term "biodiversity" to "environmental sustainability and climate change" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I recognise the intention of the amendment. I am open to amendment on this and intend to return to the matter on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 219 deletes the term "including" in the phrase "human rights, including equality, diversity and inclusion" in subsection (a) of paragraph (2) of section 159F. I understand the question here is whether the phrasing implies that equality, diversity and inclusion should be considered under the rubric of the overarching idea of human rights or whether they should be considered separate concepts. I think this may be a philosophical question which will not have a substantive impact on the kind of audiovisual programmes which may be supported by a content production scheme. For that reason, I intend to reject the amendment.  Amendment No. 220 inserts a provision specifying that new audiovisual programmes may, through a content production scheme, support literacy in the Irish language, or support literacy in Irish Sign Language. In terms of literacy in the Irish language I believe that this may be covered by the reference to the Irish language in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F. As regards literacy in Irish Sign Language, I will further consider whether the references to the types of audiovisual programmes referenced in subsection (2) would encompass programmes relating to literacy in ISL and return to the House on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 221 would specify that new audiovisual programmes in relation to digital empowerment and data protection awareness may, through a content production scheme, be funded. I believe that the references to science and education in paragraph (a) of subsection (2) of section 159F would already allow such programmes to be funded. Therefore, I do not accept the amendment. Amendment No. 222 would specify that support under a content production scheme may be given in relation to capacity building. I believe the intention of the amendment is already captured by paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 159F which provides that support under the scheme may be given in respect of research, assessments of need, feasibility studies or pilot projects. The insertion of the term "capacity building" would be too expansive. The purpose of a content production scheme is to fund new audiovisual programmes. The term "capacity building" implies that a content production scheme could be used, for example, in skills development. I believe that skills development in the sector is more appropriately progressed by Screen Ireland through Screen Skills Ireland, which is Ireland’s screen industry training resource. As such, I am not accepting the amendment. However, as I indicated in my response to amendment No. 215, I can see the merit in inserting a reference to development funding in paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of section 159F. This reference is not as capacious as "capacity building" but may capture the intent of amendment No. 222.  Amendment No. 223 provides that a content production scheme shall dedicate not less than 80% of the funding available under each scheme to audiovisual works that are developed or produced by independent production companies, as described in, and which qualify as an independent programme under section 116(12) of the Broadcasting Act 2009. The amendment further seeks to provide for a fair and equitable balance in relation to the allocation of rights ownership in those works funded by a scheme under this section.The amendment also provides that a funding scheme under the section could be managed by an coimisiún in co-partnership with another agency or that its management may be delegated by an coimisiún to another agency on such terms and conditions as an coimisiún shall prescribe. In regard to the proposal to dedicate at least 80% of funding from a scheme to independent productions, I can see the merit in specifying that the Bill contains an explicit acknowledgement that the independent productions can benefit from funding through a scheme made under the section and I have, therefore, asked my officials to examine this matter further with a view to bringing forward a Government amendment in the context of Dáil Committee Stage. In particular I will ask them to examine an appropriate definitions of "independent programmes" and "independent production company", and the appropriate percentage.  The issue of rights ownership is a complex issue that cuts across the remit of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Given the need for further extensive policy analysis and consultation in the matter to ascertain the implications of providing for this in legislation and the fact that this issue is not provided for in the AVMSD, I will ask my officials to further examine the issue. Regarding the proposal that a funding scheme under the section could be in co-partnership with another State agency or that the management of a scheme could be delegated entirely to another State agency, I do not see the value in this portion of the proposed amendment. I am confident that an coimisiún will effectively manage the funding scheme, should it be introduced, given it will operate as both a media development agency and a regulatory body. My Department is currently working with the Public Appointments Service to launch an executive search for the commissioner and executive chairperson posts. This will include a media development commissioner who will take responsibility for the funding and development of the wider media sector. Given an coimisiún will be responsible for the content production levy, it is appropriate that it is also the body responsible for the implementation of content production schemes and I expect that the media development commissioner will work closely with Screen Ireland with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes. Given the complexity of the proposed amendment, I intend to ask my officials to carry out further consultation and analysis with a view to returning to some of these matters on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  Amendment No. 224 is a consequential amendment following on from amendment No. 223 and, therefore, I do not accept it.  Amendment No. 225 provides that an coimisiún, in preparing a content production scheme, shall have regard for the need to ensure that people with disabilities can participate in new audiovisual programmes funded by schemes made under this section. I recognise the intention of the amendment, and I would be concerned that specifying that any one group should be prioritised for participation would imply that other groups, such as an ethnic minority, would not be prioritised. I wish to give this matter further consideration on Report Stage.  Amendment No. 226 provides that an coimisiún, in preparing a content production scheme, shall have regard for the need to support cultural and social participation, access to programming for the use of the Irish language and Irish Sign Language. Similar to amendment No. 220, I believe that some of the proposed amendments may be encompassed under section 159F(2)(a). However, as with amendment No. 220, I will give further consideration to the amendment in the context of Report Stage.  Amendment No. 227 provides that an coimisiún, in preparing schemes under this section, shall have regard for the need to support the development of community broadcasters. The Bill as initiated sets out that an coimisiún shall encourage the development of community broadcasters and, therefore, I do not see a substantive distinction between the terms "support" and "encourage". Accordingly I proposed to reject the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On amendments Nos. 208, 209, 212, 213 and 214, I have said that the content production levy has the potential to raise funds to further support the audiovisual sector. It is really important in that context that the levy is effective and efficient in its design and application. That is why we are giving time to the commission to do that research and make sure it works properly.
