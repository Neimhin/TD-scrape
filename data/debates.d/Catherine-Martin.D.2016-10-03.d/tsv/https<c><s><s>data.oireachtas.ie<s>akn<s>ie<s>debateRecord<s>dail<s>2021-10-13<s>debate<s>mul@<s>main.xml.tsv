CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá áthas orm an deis seo a fháil labhairt leis an Teach maidir le Meastacháin buiséid 2022 de €1.197 milliún do mo Roinn agus léargas a thabhairt ar roinnt de na bearta chun tacú le teacht aniar agus fás na n-earnálacha a bhfuil mé freagrach astu. Individually and cumulatively, these sectors are an integral part of the fabric of our society, most particularly in rural and regional areas, for they support economic activity and physical and societal well-being. This was never more evident than during the pandemic. As we rebuild these vital sectors, we must not lose sight of the valuable contribution they make to people’s everyday lives and livelihoods all across Ireland and enable them to contribute to the resurgence of a vibrant and sustainable economy.  Budget 2022 has been informed by ongoing engagement with the sectors and communities that come under the remit of my Department. That engagement will continue as we implement the policies and programmes to support regrowth and development.  I refer to the funding for the sectors supported by my Department. A total of €288.5 million has been allocated for tourism services representing an increase of €67.6 million. This increased allocation will help address immediate survival issues while also enabling further resilience and recovery as we reopen to international tourism and transition towards a more sustainable future. The increased funding will allow for €50 million in further business continuity support and an additional €27 million for investment in domestic marketing and festivals, particularly during the shoulder season and to assist in attracting and retaining staff in our tourism and hospitality sectors, together with increased capital funding, bringing to €36.5 million the moneys available for tourism product development, to include new and exciting attractions. There is an increase of €35 million in the tourism marketing fund to help restore inbound tourism to Ireland and to begin preparations for the programme for Government commitment to the Year of the Invitation. This significant response to the impact of the pandemic recognises the vital contribution of tourism to our overall economy and jobs.  While our primary focus to date has been on survival, we now have an opportunity to reimagine our tourism sector in the wake of the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on mainstreaming the principle of sustainability from an environmental, social and economic perspective.  Funding for the arts and culture amounts to €346.5 million. Budget 2022 represents a recognition by Government that bold steps are necessary for our much-treasured arts, events, and culture community to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. The extensive package of supports proposed under budget 2022 will allow for this recovery. I am particularly pleased to announce €25 million in funding for the pilot of the new basic income guarantee scheme for artists and art workers. The scheme will bring new life and support to the artists and to those working in the arts and cultural sector after a profoundly difficult 18 months. If there is one lesson to be learned from Covid-19, it is how the arts and culture community was taken for granted up until then. The basic income scheme is a signal from Government to this invaluable sector that it is treasured, appreciated, and will never be taken for granted again.  I am also pleased to maintain funding for the Arts Council for 2022 at the current record level of €130 million. This will empower the council to help artists, art workers and arts to flourish again in Ireland.  Some €25 million is being provided for live entertainment, building on the diverse suite of initiatives introduced for the sector this year in response to the pandemic.  The audiovisual industry continues to be one of the success stories of the past 18 months with internationally successful productions such as the animated feature film, "Wolfwalkers", and the TV drama, "Normal People".I am pleased to increase Screen Ireland's funding by €6.7 million to €36.7 million in 2022 to maintain and grow its output. The extension of section 481 relief to the gaming sector, as well as increased funding of €4.2 million for TG4, will also contribute to the ongoing growth of this vibrant sector. Additional funding of €5 million is being allocated to our national cultural institutions to facilitate increased access to their extraordinary collections and the enhanced audience engagement they developed during the pandemic. A total of €4 million in funding is being provided to help deliver a suite of initiatives proposed by the night-time economy task force. Finally, €5 million is being allocated to support the 2022 commemorative programme marking the significant centenaries arising in 2022. Budget 2022 recognises the value arts, culture and entertainment bring to people living in Ireland and abroad and the important role artists play in our society, which was particularly evident during the pandemic. It signals a new dawn for the sector, building on existing Covid supports. Funding for the media and broadcasting sector will also be increased in 2022, including €5.5 million for the establishment of a new regulator, the media commission, which will support the provision of high-quality public service broadcasting and oversee effective regulation of online safety. I am conscious my allocated time is running out and the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, is sharing my slot. In short, our clear objective is to support a strong and sustainable tourism industry, a vibrant arts and culture sector, dynamic sports and media sectors and a landscape in which our first language can continue to grow and flourish.
