CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Like the previous speakers said, the elephant in the room is pay equality. I understand there may be some moves towards that and I welcome the Taoiseach's comments yesterday on possible new talks on the issue. It is something that needs to be tackled with the utmost urgency. Are the Taoiseach's comments an indication that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work? We know it cannot be done overnight. The recent report shows that. However, would the Government be willing to indicate a timeline for the delivery of equal pay for equal work? I have read today, like other Deputies, that, alarmingly, we do not have enough junior certificate home economics teachers to examine the practical element. It is going to delay it, which will cause stress for the students involved. Will the Minister outline the measures he is taking to address that issue or how will that affect the budget Estimates here? On career guidance counsellors, I do welcome the additional 100 posts. That will bring us to 500 of the 600 posts cut having been restored. However, that is based on the number of career guidance posts needed in 2011. The Minister in his opening statement referred to an expanding young population, so surely we should not be working towards a number for career guidance counsellors that was needed in 2011. It is 2018 now. We should be looking at delivering one guidance counsellor per 500 students at this stage. We are not going to achieve that if our marker is the 2011 number. What is the Minister's intention to deal with that? On the superannuation subhead, A8, and indeed in C10, in each of the past two years we have had to vote through a considerable Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year in respect of superannuation payments for teachers. I see this subhead is down 5% and 7% for the equivalent at third level this year. Does the Minister anticipate that we will be looking at a similar increased Supplementary Estimate come the end of 2018?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for his response. I asked whether the comments made by the Taoiseach yesterday indicate that the Government is finally willing to commit to the principle of equal pay for equal work. The Minister mentioned that a review of career guidance posts is under way and suggested that students might be able to access vital information in other ways. Another aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor in the school is often forgotten even though it is essential. The career guidance counsellor is the only trained member of staff to whom a vulnerable child with mental health difficulties or family difficulties can turn. I respectfully request that when the Minister is reviewing this area, he should not confine his considerations to the career advice aspect of the role of the career guidance counsellor but should also pay attention to the counselling aspect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In subhead B, under the heading of skills development, there is an estimated substantial surplus for the national training fund, NTF. A review is being undertaken on the structure and direction of the NTF. Will the Minister indicate when that review will be completed and the impact it may have on the national training fund surplus? Under the equality budgeting and performance indicators, I am looking at the number of female apprentices. The output target for 2018 is 300 which is up from an output target of 145 last year. Did we reach the target of 145 last year and are we on track to meet the target of 300 for this year?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I raised the issue of female apprentices.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the Minister does not have it now, is it possible to forward to us information on whether the target of 145 for female apprentices was reached last year? I understand the Minister might not have the information to hand but I am interested in it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I welcome the increase in the allocation for higher education in subhead C4, but the fact remains it is simply not quite enough to address the needs of the higher education sector. With regard to subhead C11 on student grants and support, despite an overall increase in the budget attributed to the higher education sector this year, there has been a fall in the funding allocation under subhead C11 with regard to student support. Why is this the case? Last week in the Dáil, along with other Deputies, I raised the fact that the lack of investment in student support is resulting in third level institutions pushing more and more of the burden onto students. We saw this recently in the Trinity protests with regard to supplemental examination fees. Only today we have seen that next year, the privately owned Shanowen Square in DCU will charge up to €9,000 for nine months' accommodation. It is not right and something needs to be done because the students are feeling too much of a burden because of a lack of investment and they are being forced to carry the cost.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My question is on the provision of physical education facilities in schools. I welcome the introduction of physical education as a leaving certificate subject. I find it remarkable, however, that not one request by a secondary school to build or operate a sports hall has been approved. How is a school expected to deliver PE at leaving certificate level on an equal footing with another school if it simply does not have a PE hall? A school in my constituency, Dublin-Rathdown, opened its doors in 1980 but, almost 40 years later, it still does not have a PE hall. How many second-level schools do not have PE halls? I have asked this question before. I do not get a direct answer to parliamentary questions. I am told that if a school does not have a hall, there are facilities for it in the community. The school in my constituency is a DEIS school and it cannot afford to hire a bus to go to a community centre or swimming pool. It should not have to use part of its double period of 80 minutes to do that. It is not putting the school on a level footing with others. I presume that, in the pilot programme the Department is running with 80 schools, at least one school with no PE hall is included so the Department can monitor and evaluate the fairness of the system. How is it fair that schools do not have PE halls? How will that work in terms of rolling out the new PE subject? Has one of the schools with no PE facilities been chosen for the pilot programme so that it might be evaluated? This needs to be done in order to ensure the fairness of the system. I just do not know how it works. It is not fair on teachers or students.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The new pilot programme for PE will consist of 80 schools. Can the Minister confirm whether all of those schools have a PE hall? It would be useful if the Department compared the educational experiences of children who attend schools that have a PE hall with a school or schools that have no PE hall. I ask the Department to make that comparison. In advance of the official roll out of the new subject to all of the second level schools, will his Department conduct an audit so we can establish the exact number of second level schools that do not have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Minister saying that a school in my constituency, for example, will be unable to execute the programme because it does not have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would a school need to already have a PE hall?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is the point I made, Minister.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will schools be audited?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the Department conduct an audit to see which schools have a PE hall?
