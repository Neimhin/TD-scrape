CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	At the outset, I acknowledge that the announcement by Dublin Pride last week that it is terminating its media partnership with RTÉ reflects the hurt and anger within the LGBTI+ community and beyond it. I am proud of how far Ireland has come in recent years in terms of the greater respect offered to minorities and groups in society that were previously marginalised, and in particular to members of the LGBTI+ community. I am committed to supporting LGBTI+ people across all the areas under the remit of my Department. In that regard, my Department will be providing €55,000 to support the Dublin Pride festival this year. As the Deputy will be aware, the independence of our public service broadcasters is set out in legislation in section 98 of the Broadcasting Act 2009. For that reason, it would not be appropriate for me to meet with RTÉ in respect of an individual programme. However, I am strongly of the view that media policy and regulation does and must continue to play an important role in ensuring respect and protection for trans people and other vulnerable groups in society. As Minister, my role is to ensure that there is a robust statutory framework in place, with appropriate standards and accountability mechanisms overseen by an independent regulator. Under the Broadcasting Act, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, as independent regulator for broadcasting content in the State, is required to make broadcasting codes governing the standards and practice to be observed by broadcasters. The two codes of particular relevance are the code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs and the code of programme standards, which is designed to ensure that the representation of persons and groups in society is appropriate, does not prejudice respect for human dignity and does not stigmatise, condone discrimination or incite hatred, including on the basis of protected characteristics. All broadcasters in Ireland must ensure that their output is compliant with the law and with any codes and rules made by the BAI. The Broadcasting Act provides for a robust complaints procedure and sets out the power of the compliance committee of the BAI to initiate an investigation of a broadcaster for a serious or repeated failure by a broadcaster to comply with a broadcasting code and ultimately for the imposition of financial sanctions. The framework for broadcasting regulation is designed to protect the independence of the media and I am therefore necessarily restricted in terms of direct intervention on this matter. I do, however, wish to conclude by saying we must ensure that all our people feel safe, valued and equal in our country. This is particularly the case where people are members of a very small, and consequently very vulnerable, minority, as is the case for trans people. Any conversations involving such a small minority must be carried out with great care and with absolute respect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The framework for broadcasting regulation is designed to protect the independence of the media by preventing interventions by Government or Ministers, particularly the Minister with responsibility for the media, in programming decisions or programming content. As I said, that is outlined in section 98 of the Broadcasting Act. The provisions to prevent the Government of the day from intervening in programme content broadcast on Irish television or radio necessarily and rightly limits the degree to which I can comment on individual terms of content. That is a vital principle that underpins the freedom of the media in our country and, in particular, the freedom of our public service broadcasters.That said, I acknowledge that it can be uncomfortable and frustrating at times.  As I set out in my initial reply, there is a robust regulatory framework in place requiring broadcasters to adhere to appropriate standards and practices. I understand that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media issued a statement yesterday indicating that it does not propose to hold a meeting to consider the broadcasts in question in recognition of the rights of the complainants to be afforded due process in proceedings. It is also important that I as Minister do not intervene in any regulatory decisions of the BAI and allow the process to operate as designed.  I repeat that as a general principle it is important that we conduct our national conversations in a spirit of respect and in recognition of the fundamental dignity of all our people. We must be cognisant of the words we use and how we use them and that is all the more important when we are speaking about a small and vulnerable minority in our society.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Equally, I hope that those events are very well attended. I cannot answer his specific questions but what I can do is tell the Deputy what I am doing in my own Department to support and engage with the LGBTI+ community across the areas under my remit. Under the Creative Ireland programme, the creative communities initiative with local authorities provides funding to support community-led creative projects including for the LGBTI+ community such as Rainbow Library in Cork and the LGBTI+ Inclusion Festival in Galway. The Deputy may also be aware that the Government decided in February of this year to extend the Creative Ireland programme to 2027. As part of this, I specifically proposed that Creative Ireland should deepen its work collaborating through creativity across key interest groups and supporting, among others, LGBTI+ equality promotion. In the broadcasting sector the BAI plays both a regulatory and a development role through support schemes such as Sound and Vision. My officials have been engaging with the BAI regarding the actions it is taking to promote equality, diversity and inclusion in the broadcasting sector in Ireland. The BAI is currently reviewing its 2018 gender action plan.  Finally, I share the Deputy's hope that both events are very well attended. As I outlined in my initial response to the Deputy's question, it would be inappropriate for me to intervene at this point and the Oireachtas committee made the same decision.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together. While the recovery momentum in our tourism sector continues, inflation, other economic factors and the significant cost pressures on tourism businesses are likely to impede the recovery. In terms of international perception, there is a risk of damage to Ireland's tourism offering and the promotion of Ireland as a good value destination through negative customer experience arising from the issues and challenges within the sector post­Covid. Many of these issues and challenges, such as reduced services and higher prices as a result of inflation, energy costs, labour shortages, recruitment challenges and supply chain issues, occur in other countries around the world. We see them manifested in Ireland in a lack of affordable accommodation and car rental options in certain areas, and in delays at Dublin Airport.  While I have no regulatory function with regard to the operation of our airports or the car rental sector, I am very aware of the potential impact of negative stories on customer sentiment. In this regard, Tourism Ireland is monitoring sentiment in our source markets in terms of reputational impact as a result of pricing concerns based on consumer, media, industry, and trade feedback and is issuing a weekly report on this matter to my Department. As we enter the peak summer months and the tourism industry recovers, there is inevitably additional pressure on hotel capacity and pricing. Hotel supply in Dublin has been affected by a range of factors, some of which are short term. These include deferred business from the past two years and increased demand. Businesses are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors, all of which have contributed to higher prices than in 2019. It is important that Ireland maintains its reputation as a value for money destination. Value is not just about the price the customer pays; it is also about what the customer gets for that price so that visitors are attracted back again and continue to recommend Ireland to family and friends. We cannot assume that 2022 will be a baseline for linear growth in future years because it is an exceptional year as we emerge from the Covid years of 2020 and 2021. Next year will present its own challenges as the pent-up and deferred demand that we are seeing at the moment might be dissipated. The distorting effect of the pandemic makes it difficult to definitively assess the long-term supply and demand situation but there does seem to be a clear need for more short-term accommodation supply, specifically in Dublin.  We all want to see the return of a sustainable and vibrant tourism sector and I must stress how important it is that businesses maintain a long-term perspective on competitiveness and value for money. The céad míle fáilte reputation that the sector has built up over the years is an important element of our tourism offering and must be protected.  With regard to assisting inward tourism, Tourism Ireland, as part of its marketing strategy, established a recovery framework which will be underpinned by an extensive programme of promotional activity throughout 2022. The organisation has a flexible, three-phase plan to restart, rebuild and ultimately redesign demand. Over €80 million will be invested in the programme in 2022, which will allow Tourism Ireland to ramp up its campaigns in key international markets.  My officials continue to engage with many stakeholders, including the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation, in order to further understand the underlying issues impacting the recovery of the tourism sector and to emphasise the importance of maintaining a strong value proposition at the core of tourism. Department officials are also working with the tourism agencies to identify potential remedial actions such as the reweighting of marketing campaigns to ensure promotional activity is aligned with supply across the year. Tourism Ireland's promotional activity right now is focused on driving demand for later in 2022. The Tánaiste and I co-chair the tourism and hospitality forum, which is due to meet next week. This will offer another opportunity to discuss and address the many issues facing both sectors.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies. I am concerned about any potential reputational damage to Ireland. We must be seen as a value for money destination so that people would want to return. Neither my Department or Fáilte Ireland have any role in setting the prices for accommodation. Commercial decisions such as pricing are the sole responsibility of business owners. I would continue to urge accommodation providers to be mindful of that longer-term picture with regard to competitiveness and value for money. I believe the distorting effect of the pandemic makes it too difficult, as I have said, to robustly analyse the long-term supply versus the demands to meet currently. Reference was made to Europe. Our hotel occupancy in Dublin is now one of the highest in Europe. It is driven by a range of factors, some of which are short term. I believe that in Dublin we have been running at 10% above Paris, Amsterdam and London in recent weeks. That shows the demand that is there. Pricing is, ultimately, a commercial decision for each business. We do not have a role in that but I would urge accommodation providers to be very mindful of the need to attract tourists back. I believe that what is happening now is probably due to the pent-up demand from the past two years. On the costs of car rental and the issues with the Dublin Airport Authority, of course I am aware of these. The DAA issue is an operational matter for it. It may be more for my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. On the car rental costs I have no remit there but I have had-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My Department officials have engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation and the Irish Hotels Federation on this very issue. On the VAT question I would point out that the reduced VAT rate applies to a wide range of businesses in addition to the hospitality sector, many of which are still trying to rebuild after a very difficult and stressful two years. These include catering, restaurant supply companies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres, museums, historic houses, open farms, amusement parks, certain printed matter, and hairdressing. While no option should be off the table in the context of encouraging price moderation and a strong focus on a good value-for-money proposition into the medium and long term, it is likely that a disapplication of the extension of the reduced VAT rate would damage many hotels around the country. The extension of the VAT reduction is providing an important support to rebuild. Nonetheless, no potential option should be off the table, as the protection of the value-for-money proposition in Irish tourism is a critical priority for the years ahead. I will be making that very clear at the Hospitality and Tourism Forum, which the Tánaiste and I will be co-chairing next week.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy asked about the steps I am taking to support the live performance sector. In 2021, my Department paid out grants of almost €54 million to support the live entertainment sector and drive employment opportunities for artists and crews, through the following schemes. There was €25 million for the live performance support scheme, LPSS; €13.7 million for the events sector Covid support scheme; €8.8 million for the local live performance support scheme; €3.1 million for the music and entertainment support scheme; €1.7 million for the commercial entertainment capital grant scheme; and €880,000 for the St. Patrick's Festival. Following budget 2022, I announced details of another €50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022. That has provided for the LPSS 2, which supported pantomimes and seasonal musical theatre impacted by the Covid restrictions in December and January, and under which €2.9 million has been offered. The LPSS 3 supported events due to be staged in December and January that were curtailed, cancelled or rescheduled due to the Covid restrictions. Grants of €9.5 million have been offered under LPSS 3. The live performance restart grant scheme, LPRGS, is supporting the live entertainment sector by providing businesses with restart grants to derisk the planning of events across spring and summer of 2022 and to assist with the costs of reopening. Grants of €14.7 million have been offered under the LPRGS. There was also €1 million for the St Patrick’s Festival. The music and entertainment business assistance scheme, MEBAS, provided grants as a targeted support for self-employed performers and sole traders operating solely in the live entertainment sector. Some €2.8 million has been allocated under MEBAS 2022. The local live public performance scheme phase 3 has provided €5 million for local authorities to stage live events until the end of June. I have recently allocated a further €5 million to local authorities to provide for live events until Hallowe'en. Grants of €1.7 million have been provided under the 2022 commercial entertainment capital grant scheme, which assisted with the capital costs associated with reopening after closures due to the pandemic. To date, grants of almost €42.6 million have been allocated. None of the live performance schemes has been oversubscribed and there has been sufficient funding available to provide grants to all eligible applicants.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Venues are a critical part of the landscape of musicians and bands, and music venues in west Cork are among the most high profile in the country. I am pleased a number of venues in that part of Cork were among the grantees under the live entertainment schemes operated by my Department, including the iconic De Barra's, Shanley's bar, Levis's in Ballydehob and Connolly's of Leap. In regard to any delay, all requests for payment are being processed and the Department is supporting any grantees who have outstanding information to submit it. Payment continues to issue on a rolling basis as grantees submit their documentation and payment requests, and all payment requests and requests for information are being addressed without delay. Once an application has been deemed eligible and a grant offer made, a service level agreement, SLA, issues to the grantee along with further information on the drawdown procedures and notice of the feedback required on conclusion of the activity the grant supports. Once the signed SLA and payment request have been returned along with other necessary supporting documentation, the payment request is examined and, if all is in order, payment is made. From time to time, further information may be required or vital documents may not have been included with the payment request. In that instance, the Department will contact the grantee and provide assistance with what is needed. That can cause a delay in payment, but as soon as all the necessary documents are there, it will be processed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I referred to the live performance restart grant scheme, LPRGS, which is supporting the live entertainment sector by providing those businesses with restart grants to derisk the plan of events in the spring and summer, and I hope that will assist with the costs of reopening. As I said, €14.7 million has been offered under the LPRGS. I can revert to the Deputy with information on the date. That is no problem. Much of this funding related to Covid supports. We will keep everything under review as we enter the budgetary process and see Covid numbers rise. It may be that some funding could be allocated, but that will all depend on where we are with Covid. We keep in close contact with the sector at all times, and that is why we were able to design schemes that worked for it. That will continue and, as I said, we will monitor the situation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I introduced the local live performance support scheme, LLPSS, in 2021 as part of a suite of measures aimed at supporting the live entertainment sector through the Covid pandemic. The scheme allocated funding to local authorities to stage live events and thereby animate our town centres for local communities. A key objective of the scheme was to provide for the procurement by local authorities of performances by local performers and local crews in their communities. I provided funding of €8.8 million in 2021 to the LLPSS and the scheme proved very popular, with events taking place in every county. Every local authority participated, with 352 events taking place during 2021. In that year, the scheme provided for more than 7,800 employment days, while more than 5,600 individual artists, performers, production and technical crew benefited from it. Across the four local authorities in Dublin, 122 individual events that took place in the same year were funded by the LLPSS. This resulted in 1,692 employment days for 1,006 individual artists, performers, production and technical crew benefiting from events in Dublin under this scheme. Feedback from local authorities was overwhelmingly positive, acknowledging the scheme has helped to reinvigorate local communities and provide a welcome boost to their economies during the pandemic. This year, I provided €5 million for events up to the end of June to provide a boost to the reopening of the entertainment sector, allowing live events to take place and local talent to perform to audiences throughout the country. Given the events are ongoing until the end of the month, the feedback surveys detailing the number of artists, crews and events to date in 2022 are not yet available. In light of the success of the scheme, I recently allocated a further €5 million to provide for events up to Hallowe'en. I am delighted the local live performance programming scheme for local authorities has been such a success. It is part of a €50 million suite of supports in 2022 for those working in the live entertainment sector and has provided support to many working within it. I look forward to seeing communities enjoy the wide range of events over the coming months.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In 2021, the scheme provided for 7,800 employment days among more than 5,600 individual artists. That relates to the overall scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	For Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, for example, €245,000 was given. We give that money and the local authorities then look after the events and the artists from that. The Deputy will have seen those recent events, such as one relating to the poetry of Séamus Heaney in Irish from Féile IMRAM and Tír na nÓg in the Mill Theatre. I think there was even a baby rave as well. The four local authorities in Dublin were given €245,000 each year. We give the money to them and they employ the local artists and organise the events.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is about babies dancing together and exploring the wonders of music and rhythm at an early age.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the most recent tranche was the €5 million for events up to the end of June and, more recently, due to its success, a further €5 million that will run up to Hallowe'en. The various supports put in place for the live entertainment sector were designed to address the challenges posed by the pandemic and, in particular, the constraints imposed on live performance by the necessary restrictions on indoor and outdoor congregation. These supports were designed in close consultation with the stakeholders and have been the subject of very positive feedback. Thankfully, we are in a position whereby the restrictions have fully lifted and the rationale for interventions no longer applies. Nonetheless, my officials will remain in contact with stakeholders throughout the sector. While a continuation of the existing schemes is not envisaged, we will continue to engage in the coming months and I anticipate submissions from the sector in advance of the budget, which will be considered in the normal way ahead of budget 2023.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Platforms for growth is Fáilte Ireland's strategic, platform-based approach to large-scale capital investment in tourism product and it targets investment in line with specific platforms or project types that have been identified as a priority for tourists on the basis of research. Under Fáilte Ireland's first platforms for growth investment scheme for immersive, heritage and cultural attractions, Westport House and Gardens was successful in an extremely competitive process. It was awarded an investment grant of €20.2 million in 2021 as part of a €36.1 million project to transform Westport House and Gardens into a world-class tourist attraction to enhance regional dispersal of visitors and extend the tourism season beyond the traditional summer months. The proposed restoration, reimagining and rewilding at Westport House and Gardens estate will offer visitors a multilayered, multi-day experience. A key element is the wild realms project, which will allow visitors to connect with nature and explore ancient Irish rituals and our ancestors' connections to the land, as told through a series of accessible wild and natural spaces. In 2021 also, the second platforms for growth scheme was announced. This investment scheme, developed in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities, will support the local economy and the outdoor activity sector by significantly enhancing the overall visitor experience, providing new business opportunities in local communities. This funding is to be used to develop world-class facilities at 22 locations across the country where water-based activities are a key visitor attraction, including Achill Island and Louisburgh in County Mayo. These facilities, designed to serve as a hub in each locality from which multiple water-sports operators can base themselves, will provide hot showers, changing and toilet facilities, secure storage, induction spaces, equipment wash-down and orientation points.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We must also take into consideration the two years we have had with the pandemic. As I said, the €20.2 million in Westport House was Fáilte Ireland's largest investment ever in a singular tourism product. Funding was also awarded to Mayo County Council to develop the two state-of-the-art facilities to which I referred. Mayo County Council was also a successful applicant for the outdoor dining enhancement scheme, with Claremorris and Castlebar receiving funds. The Clew Bay destination experience development plan, which was launched on 19 November 2021, sets out an ambitious vision for the region over the next three to five years. That was developed over a period of three years with robust consultation. We have to take into consideration the two years we had but there is no doubt that County Mayo is being developed. There is ambition for this beautiful part of the country, and rightly so.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Fáilte Ireland indicated at the time that it would consider a second round but the current focus is on delivering the first round. A second round has not been ruled out, however. At a regional local level, Fáilte Ireland develops, supports and promotes tourism in line with the relevant tourism experience brands. To guide medium to long-term development, Fáilte Ireland aims to deliver four new regional tourism strategies in 2022, which will set out a ten-year vision and a five-year action plan for each region. At a more local level, the four regional tourism strategies will be activated through a series of co-ordinated local destination and experience development plans developed by Fáilte Ireland in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders. I can get the Deputy further information on a second scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ireland's well-being framework is the result of a programme for Government commitment to develop a set of well-being indices to create a well-rounded, holistic view of how Irish society is faring. The overarching vision for the framework is enabling all our people to live fulfilled lives now and into the future. The framework is a cross-government initiative, which is led by the Department of the Taoiseach and jointly sponsored by the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. The second report on Ireland's well-being framework, Understanding Life in Ireland: A Well-being Framework, was published on 2 June. This report sets out an updated well-being framework for Ireland, which has 11 dimensions of well-being as well as sustainability and equality as cross-cutting themes. With regard to language and culture, which were raised by the Deputy, Ireland's well-being framework is similar to comparative international well-being frameworks. The 11 dimensions allow for a multidimensional approach to monitoring Irish society and the consideration of language and culture takes place across a number of the dimensions. Cultural identity and language issues are considered as part of the dimension entitled civic engagement, trust and cultural expression, which includes an aspect of cultural expression, identity and non-discrimination. This dimension explores a person's rights to express his or her identity, for example, activities relating to specific groups such as traditional Irish communities, including Gaeltacht communities, as well as the cultural practices and expression of migrant or new Irish. It also includes the ability to express one's culture or identity or celebrate one's native language, placing a particular emphasis on the Irish language. In addition, individual cultural participation is recognised as part of personal time in the time use dimension. Similarly, the social aspect of participating in community groups like artistic or creative groups and sporting clubs is captured in the community and cultural participation aspect of the connections, community and participation dimension. The role of culture and language in the assessment of our collective well-being is very important to me. In this context, the Deputy may be interested to know that officials in my Department have begun early research with a view to developing a sectoral well-being indicator set relating to arts, culture, creativity, sport and language over the coming months. Such indicator sets will allow more detailed analysis of specific sectors with linkages to the high-level well-being dashboard which, by nature, cannot cover every area in detail.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I firmly believe that culture and language are vital for our well-being in Ireland. This was clearly demonstrated particularly with regard to culture during the Covid-19 pandemic, and I will continue to make this clear to my colleagues in the Government. The Deputy referred to Wales. A key lesson, too, is that it is an iterative process requiring patience, commitment and planning, as the embedding process takes time. For example, in New Zealand, which the Deputy referenced in his initial question, there is the inclusion of a specific, additional dimension on culture related to the demography of the country and the Maori culture specifically. In the case of Ireland's well-being framework, culture, both in terms of identity and participation, has been explicitly integrated into the dimensions of well-being. My officials and the Department are currently giving detailed consideration to how we can use data to allow us to measure well-being. I am grateful for the Deputy's contribution and for his ideas with regard to what is being done in Wales. That is something my officials are looking at too. We have to identify indicators across the sectors in my Department for capturing data that will assist us in measuring well-being for evidence-based policy development.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will enjoy that at the weekend. A tourism recovery task force was established in May 2020 and delivered a tourism recovery plan with recommendations on how best the Irish tourism sector could adapt and recover in the changed tourism environment. Later that year, I appointed a recovery oversight group to oversee the implementation of this plan. This group has reported regularly to me and has provided valuable inputs to the Government on the measures required to assist the sector. The recovery oversight group is continuing its work and will report to me with updates on implementation of the tourism recovery plan and recovery in the sector more generally. Looking to the longer term, my Department has initiated the development of a sustainable tourism policy. The development of this new policy will involve consultation with the tourism industry and with communities to help set out a path for the coming years which will support sustainable recovery and growth in the sector. In budget 2022, €288.5 million was allocated for tourism services. This allows for significant increases in domestic and overseas marketing in building a strong digital presence for the sector and in developing new and enhanced visitor experiences that will drive sustainable and dispersed visitor growth. I have referred the Deputy's question to Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland for further details of their specific plans to help the tourism sector to recover in 2022 and beyond. A significant challenge facing the sector at present is the recruitment and retention of staff. My Department and Fáilte Ireland have been collaborating with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing the labour and skills shortages. A key task in this regard is to drive the long-term repositioning of the sector as an appealing and rewarding career choice and workplace. As we enter the peak summer months and the tourism industry recovers, there are inevitably additional pressures on hotel capacity and pricing. The initial recovery phase has resulted in issues for all tourism businesses, many of which are repeated in other markets around the world. Hotel supply in Dublin has been affected by a range of factors. Some of them are short-term, such as deferred business from the last two years and increased demand. Businesses are also facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors, all of which have contributed to higher prices than in 2019. International supply chains are impacting on the car rental fleet. While this is not in the control of the Government and there are no short-term solutions, my Department is examining possible taxation options which might assist, with the recognition that taxation measures are a matter for the Minister for Finance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the hotel prices the Deputy mentioned, my officials have engaged with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Irish Tourism Industry Conferation, ITIC, and the IHF. They are also working with the tourism agencies. The Tánaiste and I co-chair a tourism and hospitality forum. That will be convening next week and we will raise those issues with it. I wrote to the DAA at the time, although it is not under my remit. I could see the potential and I wrote to express my concerns about the reputational damage to Ireland as a tourism destination as we seek to rebuild. Regarding car rental, I am aware of the difficulties and the potential impact on the recovery of the tourism sector or the reputational damage. My officials have met the Car Rental Council of Ireland, which recommends that people can contact hire companies directly. However, neither my Department nor Fáilte Ireland has control over prices set by service providers in the tourism industry.We have no regulatory or other functions in regard to the car rental industry. Each operator decides on its level of charges, having regard to its costs and the requirement to make an adequate return on its investment. My Department is examining possible taxation options which might assist car rental companies to rebuild their fleet in order to meet tourism demands, while recognising that taxation matters are ultimately a matter for the Minister for Finance.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, the smooth running of Dublin Airport is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of the tourism sector. The DAA has the statutory responsibility to operate, manage and develop Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening at the airport. The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling far short of the service that citizens and visitors should expect at our largest State airport. The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, continue to hold meetings with the CEO, Dalton Philips, and his management team in this regard. From a tourism perspective, I am concerned. If this situation were to continue, it has the potential to cause significant reputational damage to the country abroad, and as a result hinder the recovery of the tourism sector. That is the reason I wrote to Dalton Philips to express my concern. In his reply, he outlined some key measures being rolled out, which aim to substantially mitigate the risk of a repeat of recent days. My time is short, but I can send the communication to the Deputy. I am informed that regular meetings will continue with the DAA at ministerial level with the Department of Transport until the Minister is satisfied that difficulties persisting at the airport are satisfactorily resolved. I will keep in contact with the Minister and Minister of State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My Department runs an annual small-scale local festivals and summer schools scheme. The scheme is reserved for appropriate not-for-profit festivals, summer schools and other such similar events. Funding available under this scheme is typically capped at €5,000. Although making available relatively modest amounts, the value of the payments under this scheme is amplified hugely by the community commitment and voluntary effort that bring about these events, which are greatly enjoyed and appreciated around the country. The scheme is intended to support local cultural festivals and summer schools which are not in receipt of other central government moneys and which may not be eligible under funding criteria for larger scale events supported by Fáilte Ireland, the Arts Council and similar bodies. Events that are funded by the Arts Council and Fáilte Ireland are not eligible. The projects make a very important contribution to the development and promotion of Ireland's cultural tourism offering, to the benefit of both the domestic and foreign tourist market, and represent an important component of the delivery of the cultural tourism commitments in the programme for Government. I am very conscious of the special efforts being made this year by event organisers and promoters to re-establish their annual arrangements, which have been suspended for two years because of Covid. Tremendous efforts were made by many to continue their programmes with online presentations while public gatherings were not possible. Some of these initiatives may be carried forward to strengthen outreach and inclusion. However, the calendar of local festivals and shared celebration is a vital element of community life and cultural expression, and I am pleased to be able to support the recovery efforts through this scheme. The closing date for applications for the 2022 scheme was 23 April. The applications are being assessed in the Department and the decision will be announced imminently. The Deputy may be interested to know that from the introduction of this scheme in 2017 up to 2021, a total of €393,611 has been awarded to eligible events. In that period, 22 applications for events in County Mayo were approved for payments amounting to €59,000. Four applications were received this year from County Mayo in respect of the small local festivals and summer schools scheme 2022.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with Deputy Dillon that festivals are of great significance to communities, even more so now after two years of being deprived of the festivals. The 2022 allocation has been capped at €5,000. The announcement is imminent for the 2022 allocation, which remains as it is. Although the scheme is capped, it is working in that it has a massive impact on local communities. There are no plans in train to increase the allocation. The current scheme, which is capped at €5,000, will be announced very shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Heritage, tradition and culture are not the exclusive preserve of a few, nor to be found only within institutions. These festivals are essential to community life. They thrive and develop among people shaped by their diverse interests and enthusiasms. I am very pleased to provide supports for such events. Other supports are provided by my Department. We also operate schemes to support links and strengthen exchanges in relation to culture, heritage and history with counterpart groups in Northern Ireland. Completing our suite of small grant schemes, there are two others that are worthy of mention: the scheme supporting the mobility in Ireland of the collections of the national cultural institutions and the scheme supporting the development of regional and local museums. I place particular importance on these schemes because they are of significant value to the community activities that they support. My officials will get back to the Deputy on any other issues or ideas he has raised.
