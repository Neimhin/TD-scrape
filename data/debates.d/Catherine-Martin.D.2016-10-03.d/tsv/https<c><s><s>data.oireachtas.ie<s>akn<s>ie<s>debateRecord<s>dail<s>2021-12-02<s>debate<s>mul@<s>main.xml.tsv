CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	We are very aware of the decimation of the tourism and hospitality sectors due to Covid-19 and the necessary restrictions.As the Tánaiste has referenced, it is the messaging and not necessarily the restrictions right now that are causing an issue for them. We are awaiting NPHET’s advice to Government and then will give consideration to supports, if needed. I would also like to inform the Deputy that the Tánaiste and I will co-chair a meeting with the tourism, hospitality and live events sector next Monday. It is right, following NPHET’s advice and consideration of supports. We will liaise closely with them.
