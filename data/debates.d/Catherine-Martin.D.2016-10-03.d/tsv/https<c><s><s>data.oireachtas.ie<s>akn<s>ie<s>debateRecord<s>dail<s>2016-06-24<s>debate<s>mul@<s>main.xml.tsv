CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Minister for bringing this Bill before the House and I welcome the introduction of a paternity leave entitlement. Some 40 years ago, Sweden became the first country in the world to introduce paid parental leave. However, it is only now in 2016 that fathers in Ireland will have access to any kind of paid paternity leave. The Nordic countries, when dealing with parental leave, operate under the assumption that children under the age of one are best cared for at home. How a child is cared for during the first year after birth is of utmost importance for his or her development. Studies have found that the placement of infants outside the home in the first year after birth can have negative developmental impacts.We must ensure that every parent has the freedom and ability to do what is best for his or her child. For children to develop secure attachments to the main care givers, it is essential that parents have the ability to take time to care for their children during this crucial period without fear of financial burden. The fathers of this country are an integral part of that, and it is well past time that the House has sought to create security for them to be able to make that attachment with their children, which in turn gives greater security and care to infants. I strongly welcome the introduction of a paternity leave entitlement. However, I also believe that to ensure the best interests of the newborn children and the parents of this country we must continue to expand statutory leave entitlements for both parents. We must also move towards an approach that is oriented towards parental leave encompassing both parents, rather than a system which makes a strong distinction between paid maternity leave of 26 weeks and paid paternity leave of only two weeks, with the only provision of parental leave being an unpaid one. Currently, while we have equality between both parents for access to unpaid parental leave, this entitlement has created its own inequalities in our society. In the words of my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in the House more than ten years ago: "if parents are poor and cannot afford to take parental leave because of a loss of salary, the Government is saying, 'Sorry, this is not for you'." While there is an entitlement to paid maternity leave, this does not fully recognise the partnership of both parents in families where this is applicable. We must create a system with a paid entitlement which everybody can avail of and which recognises that every parent has a unique role to play. The paternity leave entitlement created in this Bill seeks to complement existing paid maternity leave benefits, and I welcome the provisions of the Bill that allow this provision to be passed to the other parent upon the tragic possibility of the death of one parent. However, while it is crucial that we do not reduce the important existing maternity leave benefits available to new mothers, comprehensive reform must be introduced which helps both parents to care for their child properly in the early, formative years of his or her life. Parenthood can be a partnership, and it is important that we allow families with two parents the flexibility to work as a partnership. The introduction of paid parental leave for the first six months after birth in addition to existing maternity leave would be a much more appropriate system for the 21st century. With this legislation the House is getting the ball rolling on an issue that still requires comprehensive reform to fully realise how we view parenthood, and how we seek to act in the best interests of our children. It is still only papering over the holes in our parental leave system. I welcome the Bill, as two weeks is better than none, but I call on the Government to continue to phase in entitlements to which all parents will have access, be they rich or poor, mothers or fathers.
