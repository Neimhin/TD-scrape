CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for attending today's meeting and making their insightful presentations. I would like to ask a couple of questions about upskilling in the energy-efficiency sector. As Ms White will be aware, Waterford-Wexford Education and Training Board is developing a centre of excellence in the area of nearly zero-energy building. Limerick Institute of Technology has worked with the board to develop the training content for programmes that will upskill electricians, plumbers and blocklayers, etc. I wonder whether Ms White might comment on this specific project. Are other ETBs looking to take it up? What lessons can be learned from this initiative as we seek to make sure there is investment in apprenticeships and to recognise the need to shift to the new green economy, which will provide job opportunities? Do the education and training boards need supports in delivering these programmes? Are they getting enough funding and supports for the shift to a green economy that is needed? It has been said that many of those who are working in new green areas like renovation, retrofitting and energy-efficiency have been trained overseas. What is being done at a regional level to upskill and support the retrofitting sector through the ETBs? Does the ETBI have a policy in that area? I would like to comment on the gender balance issue as it applies to those who are being fast-tracked into information technology. One of the submissions recommended that there should be a campaign to encourage women to take up apprenticeships. What would that look like? How is it imagined that this could be done in the information technology area and across the wider apprenticeship sector? I mentioned last week that an incentive - perhaps the equivalent of the Athena SWAN award - might be needed to encourage institutions and businesses to get involved in this area. What would the witnesses think of that as an idea? What actions are being taken in light of the fact that just 2.75% of apprentices declare themselves to have a disability? What are we doing in this regard? Mr. Davitt used the term "de-commute" and I ask him to elaborate on that. What would make this concept more attractive to employees and employers alike? Dr. Smyth wondered whether tourism and hospitality should be a leaving certificate subject. Is tourism and hospitality, or something very similar to it, not a subject on the leaving certificate applied curriculum? Has it been reviewed to determine how successful it has been? If tourism and hospitality has been successful as a leaving certificate applied subject, could that help to persuade the Department of Education and Skills to put it on the leaving certificate as well? Has there been an increase in uptake in this sector as a result of tourism and hospitality being a leaving certificate applied subject?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes. My questions were not answered.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In response to Dr. Smyth, I was not questioning tourism and hospitality being placed on the leaving certificate. I was wondering, given that it is on the leaving certificate applied, whether it has been successful and if that could be used to strengthen the argument to roll it out to the leaving certificate. I am in agreement with him.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the ETBI intend to roll out a policy?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The ETBs have a crucial role to play in the move towards a green economy.
