CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Since its foundation 40 years ago, the Green Party, alongside environmental NGOs, campaigners and climate activists, has tirelessly campaigned and advocated for an ambitious and far-reaching response to the climate crisis facing our planet. This immense climate challenge requires an equally immense effort to combat what will be, if we do not act, an utterly devastating impact on our world as we know it. The Green Party entered Government with a mandate from the Irish people to tackle this challenge head-on and to implement legislation that would make Ireland a leader on the world stage in the fight against climate change. The message was clear; we need climate action now. This momentum and appetite for system change, not climate change, has been steadily building. The urgency of this crisis has united millions of people across the globe. They have marched in their droves to strike for climate, demand change and fight for their futures. We must deliver emission reductions now for our children's futures, our planet's future and our shared future. Sustained climate action requires a combined commitment and co-operation across politics and society. It cannot just be climate action. Crucially, we must also have climate justice. They are inextricably linked; the same side of the same coin. We must ensure a just transition that protects the most vulnerable in our society and ensures nobody is left behind. This will be a transition that will centre on people and their communities: where everyone can partake in a socially just society with access to housing, a strong education and stability; where we strengthen our connection with nature, build better communities and transform our society; where environmental awareness is in the mainstream and not seen as an alternative lifestyle; and where we come together to rise to this challenge with a shared purpose, while simultaneously ensuring that those who are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis are brought along with us every step of the way. The green movement is unique in that it is both on a global and an individual scale. At its core, however, it is a movement of the people for the people. The climate challenge can only be addressed if we are all working together to do so. This requires a change in the way we govern, live and work. We must educate our children through school, university and apprenticeships so they are equipped with the skills and knowledge to tackle this challenge head-on. We need system change so that it is clear, obvious, safe and cheaper to make the green choice rather than the environmentally destructive one. It is critical that we engage with people and ask how the State can best help to support them to make the green choice. The Government's consultation on the climate action plan does not just ask what we can do but how Government can best help everybody to work together to meet this challenge. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill is a momentous Bill. I commend my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on his work on this Bill and in bringing it before the Dáil. I commend every single official, activist, expert and campaigner who contributed to make this the vital Bill it truly is. This Bill is the culmination of years of hard work, endless campaigning and unwavering commitment by so many to protect our planet as best we can, to make it a livable and safe place for generations to come and to transform Ireland into a world leader when it comes to tackling this climate crisis. Ní neart go cur le chéile.
