CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all of the witnesses for their presentations. My first question is directed to the representatives of the Department and Bus Ã‰ireann. What is being done to ensure that drivers and escorts have the relevant training in special education needs? Having taught in many schools for children with special educational needs, I know that not only teachers but all staff need training in special educational needs because when it comes to many of the basic interactions we take for granted, without an understanding of disabilities, in particular autism spectrum disorder, issues can escalate. We should be seeking to ensure that all drivers and escorts undergo basic training in this area. In regard to the establishment of "nearest recognised school", one of the criteria is that a copy be provided of the decision reached following an appeal under section 29 in respect of refusal of entry to a school. Often, a primary school will have only one class which fills up quickly every year such that it is obvious to a parent that a child will not get a place in that school and so the parent does not engage in the section 29 process. Is there any leeway in such cases? In other words, is there any point putting the parent and the school through a section 29 process when it is obvious to everybody there is no way the child can be accommodated in the school? A school in my constituency, Ballinteer Educate Together, is awaiting a permanent building and is to be relocated outside of the catchment area to Churchtown, which is beyond the 3.2 km for parents to travel. Other schools that are temporarily located are also being moved outside of their catchment areas when planning permissions are unsuccessful. The children currently attending the Ballinteer Educate school are able to walk to the school but following its relocation to Churchtown they will not be able to do so. Many of their parents do not have cars and so the children will need school transport. What arrangements, if any, are put in place where this happens?  In regard to special educational needs, the phrase "nearest school which is or can be resourced to meet their needs" was mentioned. Am I correct that if a parent identifies the nearest school as not having the resources to meet his or her child's needs that school can be so resourced? If I have a child with special educational needs I would be seeking to enrol him or her in a school that has special education needs provision in place which has been tried, tested and is working. In terms of special needs allocations, if a parent seeks provision on behalf of a child at what point does the school apply for the resources identified? At a recent cross-party meeting on school transport, I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, the issue of the 4,000 school transport vehicles and the 100 million km covered by them annually. What consideration, if any, is being given to the use of bio-fuels or electric vehicles? As a country, we need to reduce our emissions and this small change could help us in achieving our climate change targets.
