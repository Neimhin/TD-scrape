CatherineMartin	Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move the following Revised Estimate:
Vote 33 - Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Revised)
That a sum not exceeding €376,236,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 2020, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and grants and that a sum not exceeding €3,435,000 be granted by way of the application for capital supply services of unspent appropriations, the surrender of which may be deferred under Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004.Is mór agam an deis seo a fháil inniu chun Meastacháin na Roinne Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta do 2020 a phlé. Tá an-áthas orm an deis seo a bheith agam labhairt faoi leithdháiltí agus tosaíochtaí na Roinne Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta do 2020. Is eol do na Teachtaí gur le na meáin, turasóireacht, ealaíona, cultúr, spórt agus an Ghaeltacht a bhaineann mo cheapachán. Tá réimsí cláir an-leathan agus an-éagsúil i gceist leis sin agus táim ag tnúth go mór le dul ina mbun agus iad a chur ar aghaidh le linn mo thréimhse mar Aire. Today's appearance relates specifically to the 2020 Revised Estimates for the previous Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I will therefore confine my remarks to those programme areas and ask that Deputies likewise confine any questions or clarifications they require to these areas. It should be noted that, in the newly created Department, my responsibilities will no longer include the heritage division, which will transfer to the new Department responsible for housing, local government and heritage where they will be the responsibility of my colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan. In addition, in the newly created Department my responsibilities will no longer include the islands, responsibility for which will transfer to the new Department responsible for social protection, community and rural development and the islands under my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. Déanfaidh an tAire Stáit, Teachta Calleary, agus mise araon tráchtanna gairide ar réimsí cláir aonair anois. Táimid sásta tuilleadh sonraí a thabhairt faoi aon ní ba mhaith leis na Comhaltaí a tharraingt anuas. Over the past few months, we have all been witness to the devastating and unprecedented impact of the Covid-19 pandemic across all sectors of society and the economy. The arts and culture, heritage, language and islands sectors have suffered considerably in view of the audience-facing focus of much of their work. They will continue to experience difficult and challenging times long after many other sectors have returned to work. These sectors are an integral part of the fabric of society, particularly in rural areas where they support tourism, economic activity, and well-being. They represent a very important component of regional development. Myriad community, voluntary and not-for-profit entities typify these sectors and there is a very significant ecosystem of local and small enterprises, economic activity and regional employment dependent on these sectors. It is therefore imperative that we support these sectors through their vulnerability in the face of the Covid pandemic. There has been extensive consultation with cultural bodies, the Arts Council, arts organisations and individual artists and arts practices since the commencement of the Covid-19 crisis. This engagement has made us all very aware of the challenges that artists have faced and also of the hugely important role that they have played in sustaining all of us in recent months. The recent announcement of a further investment of €25 million in arts and culture during 2020 reflects the significant role arts and culture play in our individual lives and across society as a whole. Many challenges lie ahead as we begin to exit from Covid-19 restrictions but there is a determination to ensure that we have a vibrant arts and culture sector to see us through these challenges and into the future. Among the measures that will be introduced on foot of the additional funding will be new bursaries and commissions from the Arts Council, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. The Department will provide supports for cultural centres, including local and regional museums, as well as for new online cultural and creative content to build on the success of programmes such as Ireland Performs, the "Other Voices: Courage" programme and Cruinniú na nÓg. The funding will ensure that the important role culture plays in contributing to our well-being at all times, and particularly in times of crisis, can be safeguarded and enhanced. When account is taken of this additional funding of €25 million, a gross provision of €379.6 million is available to the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht in 2020, representing an increase of 12% on the comparable allocation for 2019. An additional €3.4 million in funding has been carried over from the 2019 capital provision for expenditure on priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures. In broad terms, the 2020 breakdown of allocations to the Vote is as follows. Just under €218 million is allocated for culture. This includes €100 million for the Arts Council, €48.9 million for the national cultural institutions, €21 million for Screen Ireland, €9.5 million for cultural infrastructure and development and €14.8 million for regional museums, galleries, cultural centres and projects. Some €62.6 million is allocated for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage. This includes: €13.7 million for natural heritage; €10 million for peatlands restoration, conservation and management, including €5 million from the carbon tax fund; just over €6.6 million for the Heritage Council; and just over €6.8 million for built heritage including the very successful built heritage investment scheme and the Irish Heritage Trust.There is €58 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands, including €23.7 million for Údarás na Gaeltachta, just under €9 million for the islands and €3.7 million for the 20-year strategy for the Irish language. There is also just over €41 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South implementation bodies, Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga. The gross allocation for the Department in 2020 is 12% higher than the comparable figure in 2019 and allows for increases in funding across a range of bodies under the Department’s remit, as well as increases in funding for a number of culture, heritage and Gaeltacht schemes. This increased funding is targeted at a number of key initiatives. In the case of the culture programme, 2020 funding is 15% higher than the 2019 equivalent. Of its priorities, Arts Council funding is up by 33% to €100 million, including €20 million in response to the Covid pandemic. Among the measures that will be introduced will be new bursaries and commissions, including supports for freelance artists and those looking to develop projects on a collaborative basis. With this funding, the arts sector will be stabilised in 2020, art will continue to be created, artists will be employed and the public will continue to have access to the arts, sometimes in new and imaginative ways. Funding for our national cultural institutions amounts to €48.9 million in total. Since the lockdown began on 12 March, these institutions have done a wonderful job in responding to the Covid crisis by providing online content of the highest quality on their websites. Clearly, this is no substitute for being able to visit a gallery, library or museum and I am delighted that most of these institutions have now reopened to the public, albeit with a slightly different visitor experience on offer. Those yet to reopen, such as the National Concert Hall, face somewhat different challenges as a consequence of the Covid crisis, but I have no doubt that they will overcome these challenges and welcome patrons across their thresholds again before too much longer. There is dedicated funding of just under €15 million for regional museums, galleries, cultural centres and projects to provide robust supports that ensure their viability and sustainability and secure new online cultural and creative content. Funding of €12.5 million, including €3 million carried over from 2019, in respect of cultural infrastructure and development will ensure that momentum is maintained in the delivery of a suite of ambitious capital programmes and projects as part of Project Ireland 2040. Fís Éireann, or Screen Ireland, is to receive additional funding of €1 million. It follows the Government’s decision to extend the section 481 film tax credit to 2024 and the regional uplift of 5%, which provides an additional incentive to increase Irish and international production across the regions. These measures are in line with the audiovisual action plan, which sets out the Government’s ambition to make Ireland a global hub for the production of film, television drama and animation. Also under the culture heading, an additional €900,000 is being made available for 2020's decade of centenaries programme. This will enable the delivery of a significant programme of commemorative events, including Bloody Sunday on 21 November and the execution of Kevin Barry on 1 November, in an appropriate and meaningful manner consistent with the advice of the expert advisory group. While the restrictions necessarily imposed as part of the Covid-19 crisis management measures will potentially require a reimagining of the commemorative events originally envisaged, it remains critical that all pivotal moments in the history of our nation continue to be remembered in an appropriate and meaningful way. Funding for the heritage programme in 2020 is €62.6 million, an increase of 16% on the 2019 allocation. The largest increase in the programme is in respect of peatlands restoration, conservation and management, where an increase of €2 million, or 67%, plus a further €5 million from the carbon tax fund will result in an allocation of €10 million for 2020 compared to the 2019 allocation of €3 million. This increased funding will allow for an accelerated programme of peatlands restoration and conservation works, resulting in 1,800 ha of restored peatland in 2020, the generation of 100 jobs in the midlands and ultimately the storage of 28 million tonnes of carbon. Restoration and rehabilitation of raised bogs will provide multiple additional ecosystem services, such as water and air quality improvements, flood mitigation, biodiversity enhancement and opportunities for tourism development, and contribute to the social and economic well-being of local communities. An additional €1 million is being provided in 2020 to accelerate key nature conservation and biodiversity programmes under the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Funding for the farm plan programme is being doubled in 2020 to €1 million to support measures to protect biodiversity and assist farmers with lands designated as special areas of conservation in their role as custodians of nature. Also under the heritage programme, Ireland’s national parks and reserves will continue to be supported, including the tourism interpretative master plan, under which the Government is investing to enhance visitor centre experiences and facilities in 2020. These parks and reserves have provided a welcome refuge to many during the past few months when restrictions on movement limited travel and interaction. It was a welcome reunion with the wealth of natural beauty on their doorstep and it is critical that these wonderful natural amenities continue to be available in their optimum iteration for all who wish to enjoy them. Labhróidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Calleary, faoi na gnéithe a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge, an nGaeltacht agus na hoileáin.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In terms of North-South co-operation, a provision of more than €41 million is made available to support the two North-South implementation bodies, An Foras Teanga, comprising Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, and Waterways Ireland. These allocations are also subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council. I am satisfied that the 2020 allocation of €379.6 million for the Vote of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will allow for the continuation and enhancement of its very diverse but critical work programmes. We, as a nation, are beginning to emerge from the public health restrictions necessitated by the Covid-19 pandemic. I am confident that the Department is equipped to provide the necessary supports and assistance to the relevant sectors and their myriad stakeholders to ensure they all emerge together and stronger. I am happy to take any questions Deputies may have in respect of the 2020 Vote of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I again ask that the questions be confined to these programme areas, notwithstanding the broader remit of my ministerial responsibilities.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Freagróidh an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Calleary, na ceisteanna faoin nGaeltacht, má tá sé sin ceart go leor. I acknowledge that Deputy Ó Snodaigh and his family are deeply connected to and steeped in culture and the arts. I recognise the invaluable contribution that his family has made to the arts and culture sector. This Revised Estimate comprises the allocation from last year's October budget plus the additional €25 million announced last month. That €25 million for the arts and culture reflects the significant role that they play in our individual lives and across society as a whole. With regard to the Deputy's question about repurposing money, we are halfway through the year and 48% of our money has been spent. Our intention is to spend all the money but we will repurpose if necessary. We did that already with "Other Voices: Courage" and Ireland Performs. All funding remains in place for our cultural institutions. We have an ambitious capital development programme for all cultural institutions, including the museum. As Minister in this area, I am aware that the arts and culture sector is on its knees. This is a crisis. I am aware that arts and culture go to the being of who we are as a nation. Our culture, arts and music are a celebration of who we are as a nation. They must be supported. The crisis has emphasised the importance of our arts and creativity in all of our lives. I pledge that I will work with my Department officials and State bodies in consultation with stakeholders to ensure that the talent and creativity of Ireland's performers, writers, music-makers and makers of everything in the arts world are developed to their full potential, sustained and stay alive to be once again enjoyed by widespread audiences nationally and internationally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This is not the July stimulus package; this is last October's budget with the addition of the €25 million announced last month. Some €20 million of that has gone to the Arts Council and the other €5 million will be allocated. I am still new to the role, but I am working on that to support the other artists the Deputy mentioned and those who work in the industry. I am keenly aware of how they are struggling and the supports they need. This is last October's budget and not this the July stimulus package. Regarding that July stimulus package, I am that voice at Cabinet. I am working on that and the discussions are under way on it. I am advocating for the arts and culture sector at Cabinet. On the night-time economy task force, I am getting to grips with my brief. It is moving quite fast, but I am completely up for that challenge. I will be meeting representatives of the Arts Council this week. I hope to establish this month an arts task force with voices from the entire sector on how best to support them. As the Deputy said, there is a commitment there with the night-time economy task force as well. I will be looking at how best to protect that night-time culture. Does the Deputy have further questions?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Absolutely. I am that voice pushing for more funding and supports for the arts and culture sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Deputy compared the €25 million with the supports given across the water. Making comparisons across different countries is difficult for many reasons, including population size and the nature of the arts and entertainment sectors. For example, the UK has a very large commercial theatre sector. According to the EU, the arts and culture share of public expenditure in Ireland in recent years has been broadly in line with the EU average. The Arts Council has established an expert advisory group to make recommendations on measures to support the arts. The recent allocation of that additional €25 million to the sector, including the €20 million to the Arts Council, was a direct response to the need identified by that expert advisory group. It is also very much in line with the recommendations of the National Campaign for the Arts. I am very mindful of the concerns of people working in the sector. I am absolutely willing to meet all stakeholders. That is my intention and it is what I will be doing. Local authorities have well developed connections with local historical groups and are very effective in supporting a wide range of events, for example, commemorative events.The creative communities initiative is being implemented via the local authorities, largely through a joint investment programme of €8.7 million supported by Creative Ireland and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. We will continue to protect that. The Deputy also mentioned discretionary funding. I will sit down with officials in my Department and tease out how best to deal with that matter. I am keenly aware of the struggles and crises that are there and if Deputies will bear with me, I am determined to include and listen to all stakeholders as we seek to support them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am quite happy to answer. I welcome the Deputy's engagement which is always highly constructive and helpful on these areas and working with the communities involved. I am aware that options exist in respect of turf cutters which include relocation to non-designated bogs, annual compensation payments and in some instances lump sum payments. My colleague, Deputy Noonan, will have responsibility for this and I will bring the matter to his attention. I will also bring the issue to his attention in respect of the roll-out of broadband and hedge cutting.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ar an gcéad dul síos caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil, mar is eol don Teachta, an-suim agus an-ghrá agam don Ghaeilge. Úsáidim í chomh minic agus is féidir liom. Beidh mé féin agus an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Calleary, ag tabhairt cuairte ar an nGaeltacht an mhí seo. Is i nGaeilge a rinne mé mo chéad agallamh. If the Deputy can bear with me as regards Galway 2020, táim chun an cheist sin a fhreagairt i mBéarla agus beidh sé níos soiléire, I hope, ansin. I have received a request from Galway 2020 to continue funding for a repurposed programme. The current Covid-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant impact on the delivery of Galway 2020. The Department has indicated approval for Galway 2020 to re-engage with cultural partners from the original bid book to examine options for the delivery of a revised cultural programme in light of Covid-19 impacts. On this basis, Galway 2020 is proposing a revised cultural programme comprising 27 projects from the original winning bid book, many of which will include multiple events to be held over the period from July to March 2021. The proposed format for delivery is on the basis that social distancing requirements will remain in place, with delivery methods to include limited access physical performance, exhibition installations and a significant element of digital delivery. One cultural partner has indicated that it will not be possible to deliver its proposed events by the end of March 2021. A request for the prolongation of the cultural programme to April 2021 has been sent to the European Commission to allow time for delivery in changed circumstances and a response is awaited. The unspent elements of committed local authority funding is no longer guaranteed and there is no expectation of further private sponsorship, leaving the Government as the sole funder. As I said, I have received a request from Galway 2020 to continue funding for a repurposed programme and I hope to make a decision on this shortly. I ask the Deputy to bear with me as I am only a few days in this brief. The matter has been brought to my attention and I am dealing with it. Gabhaim buíochas léi.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On Deputy Cathal Crowe's question regarding Shannon Heritage, we are critically aware of the issues facing the heritage sector, as well as the arts and cultural sector. As a Government, we are working with all stakeholders to ensure facilities can reopen safely and to stabilise them financially. As requested by the Deputy, I will raise this matter with my colleagues in government, including the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who will have responsibility for heritage. In terms of my new remit, I am also very conscious of it from a tourism perspective. On the issues raised by Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, as I have previously stated, the Covid-19 crisis has emphasised the importance of our arts and creativity in all of our lives. Along with my Department officials and State bodies I am working with all stakeholders to ensure that the talent and creativity of our performers, writers and music makers is developed to their potential and sustained and enjoyed once again by audiences in our local communities, at national level and globally. The impact of Covid has been deep across the sector. Live performances to audiences will be impacted long-term. This is one of the sectors that was first hit and it will be the last to return. I am very aware of that. On live performances, my Department is engaging with EPIC and the entertainment industry in order to ways to sustain them.I fully agree we have built a skilled labour force in that sector and we want to protect and continue to work with the sector. As I said, it was the first to go and will be the last to return. I am fully aware that the arts and culture sector is heavily dependent on the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and the temporary wage subsidy scheme and that an extension of the former has been sought by the National Campaign for the Arts. As the Deputy may be aware, the programme for Government states that, as part of the July stimulus package, the Government will set out a pathway for the future implementation of the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the future distribution of the PUP based on the principles of fairness and equity. As he rightly noted, these are industries where seasonal workers must be considered. That is on my radar and I seek to address it. The work is under way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy and all Deputies who have expressed their good wishes to me and the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary. I look forward to working with them all. While the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is responsible for the equality budgeting programme, my Department was one of six that participated in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's equality budgeting pilot in 2018. Dedicated equality indicators were included in the 2018 Revised Estimates with the objective to work to achieve enhanced levels of representation of women and girls in films and screen content supported by the Irish Film Board. Equality budgeting uses impact indicators to provide information on how the allocation of resources impacts various groups in society, such as women, children and disadvantaged groups. While the pilot scheme focused mainly on gender in 2018, with five gender objectives and one socioeconomic objective, the scope was broadened in 2019 to include other equality measures such as poverty, the promotion of inclusiveness and disability. My Department has engaged, and will continue to do so, with this process annually. While an equality budgeting advisory group has been established by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to support this process, my Department is not a member of the group. I am very supportive of equality budgeting as a means of advancing equality, reducing poverty and strengthening economic and social rights. With regard to the pilot programme, a key lesson for my Department was the value in setting metrics as a means of driving policy change. In 2018, for example, the Irish Film Board, or Screen Ireland as it is now known, launched a scheme, POV, that was aimed at delivering on Screen Ireland's commitment to achieving a 50:50 gender parity in the Irish screen industries, both in front of and behind the camera. Screen Ireland offered enhanced production funding for female-initiated or female-driven feature films. Screen Ireland surpassed its 2018 equality budgeting targets of 5%, achieving an increase of 12% in the number of applications with female talent attached and an increase of 7% in the number of successful applications with female talent attached. Equality budgeting provides an objective way to track and measure success in this area. A key lesson learned from participation in the pilot was that linking funding decisions to greater gender equality has paid dividends in encouraging greater equality in the film industry and provides a positive model to replicate in other policy areas. Screen Ireland is confident that 2020 will build on the success of 2018 and 2019 in terms of the participation of women in screen productions. It is my strong belief that extending equality budgeting to other policy areas in my Department will incentivise and reward positive change towards greater equality, and I will seek to expand this success into areas in the Department. To respond to the Deputy's third question, my Department is very cognisant of the recommendations contained in the OECD report on equality budgeting. While the report recognises that equality budgeting in Ireland is in its infancy, I am pleased my Department has participated in Ireland's initiative since its inception. In recent years my Department and its bodies have engaged in a number of initiatives to promote inclusion and equality in the context of gender participation in the arts and culture sector. This work has involved staff in the culture and corporate divisions and external staff in agencies under the Department's remit working together to achieve gender balance on State boards in the arts and culture sector, which I am pleased to say stands at 49%. The project focused on support for women at a senior level in arts organisations, support for promotion to the public of the work of women artists, leadership in dealing with accusations of abuse of power and sexual harassment in sections of the arts sector, and diversity and equality training for boards and senior management of State agencies in the sector. This work was the subject of a Civil Service excellence and innovation award in 2019. My Department will continue to focus on equality when developing policy and will be proactive in ensuring that our strategic objectives underpin equality of opportunity, access and outcomes in the arts for everyone living Ireland.
