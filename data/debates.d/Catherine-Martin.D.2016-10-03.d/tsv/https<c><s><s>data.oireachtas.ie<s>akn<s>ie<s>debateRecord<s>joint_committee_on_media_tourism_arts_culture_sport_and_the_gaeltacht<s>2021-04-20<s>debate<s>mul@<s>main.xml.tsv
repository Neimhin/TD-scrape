CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith anseo chun labhairt faoi thosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne. I intend to address the committee on tourism, culture, arts and media and my colleague, the Minister of State, will address matters relating to sport and the Gaeltacht. I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee on the key priorities of my Department and to set out the vision for these wide-ranging and valuable sectors. These sectors contribute significantly to our country’s economy while also supporting individual and community well-being right across Ireland. It is important, however, that we recognise the ongoing impact the global Covid-19 pandemic and associated public health measures continue to have on these sectors, on the people who work in them and on the communities that depend on them. When I last addressed this committee in November, I spoke about the devastating impact that has been felt by workers and businesses throughout our tourism, culture, arts, sports, Gaeltacht and media sectors, as well as the measures that my Department had put into place to mitigate against the harmful effects of the pandemic. We have since faced another wave of the virus and, along with it, another period of level 5 restrictions has been imposed on these hard-hit sectors. I am deeply conscious of the effects that measures taken in the interests of public health have had on our ability to participate in the arts, to watch a match or to enjoy a meal or a night out with friends, as well as the ability for artists, workers and businesses to provide these uniquely valued experiences. We should also recognise that the tough decisions that were made have enabled all of us, through collective action, to protect the most vulnerable in our society. With the ongoing roll-out of the vaccination programme, we find ourselves at the beginning of a process where we can start to move on from the pandemic and focus our efforts on economic and social recovery. Over the coming months, as the restrictions ease and the vaccine programme is rolled out, we will see the safe and successful reopening of our society, and with it our tourism sector, our arts and culture venues and events and the eventual welcoming back of fans to our sports grounds. I am confident that the Government is ready to meet the challenges and opportunities of recovery. Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead recognises, in particular, the need for bespoke sectoral supports to address the worst affected sectors, such as tourism and culture, in the forthcoming national economic recovery plan. Last week we saw the initial easing of some restrictions and yesterday saw the return of more high-performance sports and training for adult inter-county GAA teams. This is just the beginning of the positive changes we hope to see this year. From 26 April, our young people will be able to return to outdoor non-contact sports and dance training, which will provide a much needed well-being dividend. We are guided at all times by the health advice, we look forward to returning to in-person cultural and sporting events and being able to visit galleries, museums and libraries. The prospect of being able to eat in a restaurant or café or go on holidays within Ireland is on the horizon if the epidemiological position continues to improve. We are looking forward to the time we can welcome international visitors back to our shores. As we emerge from the most difficult period of the pandemic, my Department will continue to prioritise the development and implementation of targeted supports for the sectors most affected by the pandemic. We will also work across Government to develop a national economic recovery plan that addresses the specific sectoral issues of our sectors, in line with the commitment set out in Covid-19 Resilience and Recovery 2021 - The Path Ahead. I announced a new €55 million support fund as part of budget 2021 for strategic tourism businesses and €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector. These measures will complement the employment wage subsidy scheme, pandemic unemployment payment and Covid restrictions support scheme schemes and the restart scheme. Recently, as part of a suite of measures to support the live entertainment sector, I was pleased to announce details of a €25 million live performance support scheme for 2021, which is aimed at supporting employment and well-being opportunities across all genres of live entertainment and the continued production of high quality artistic output for the public. I also recently announced the new music and entertainment business assistance scheme, which will make a contribution to the overheads of businesses, including musicians, crew and engineers, that have been significantly negatively affected by Covid-19 and that do not have a rateable premises. Earlier this month, initial applications opened for a new €17 million outdoor dining enhancement scheme being delivered in partnership between Fáilte Ireland and local authorities across the country. This scheme will provide funding for tourism and hospitality business to develop and increase their outdoor seating capacity and will also provide funding to local authorities to develop permanent outdoor public dining spaces in towns and urban centres, similar to those that exist in various European cities. These are just some examples of the kinds of supports that are needed to support hard-hit sectors as we transition out of the current restrictions, and I will continue to do everything-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sure. Tourism, culture, arts, language, sport and media are an integral part of the fabric of our society and democracy, serving to enhance our physical, mental and social well-being. As we overcome the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, I am looking forward to turning our attention to the restoration of these activities that sustain us and bring joy to our lives. I will ensure that the sectors can, in time, again become vital components of our economy, our social lives and our well-being. This will require a strategic approach and long-term vision. The Minister of State will now speak to sport and Gaeltacht matters.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Cassells. Of course, international travel, as we know, accounts for 75% of the revenue generated by the sector due to the pandemic. Specifically, because the time is short, in relation to supports, the Government has committed that there will be no cliff edge. Of course, tourism is one of the impacted sectors recognised in the path ahead and we will be looking at that in the context of the national economic recovery plan. The Tánaiste and I have a tourism and hospitality forum. The next meeting is in May. Also, I presented the report from the tourism oversight group to my colleagues at Cabinet and have discussed it with Cabinet colleagues as well. That identifies the key supports that are needed. As I said, there will be no cliff edge. We absolutely recognise the need for support throughout the reopening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Quickly, on the tourism oversight group, that is set up to oversee the recommendations from that sector. It is not a representative group but, rather, it is made up of an independent chairperson and eight other members with a broad spectrum of backgrounds who were selected on the basis of each person's capacity to bring their knowledge, skills, experience, competence, capability and strategic leadership to the ideas of this working group. It is overseeing the implementation of the recommendations. The groups that the Senator mentioned are on the hospitality and tourism forum, which meets the Tánaiste and me regularly. It includes representatives from the Irish Hotels Federation, the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Fáilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association etc., to name but a few. They will be meeting me and the Tánaiste again this month. At the previous meeting, the Taoiseach met them as well. In relation to the stay-and-spend scheme, that was set up last summer by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. Of course, it was to target that off-peak season. However, public health conditions beyond our control clearly prevented the success of this scheme. That stop-and-start nature of the pandemic and unpredictable consequences have resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised. A review of the stay-and-spend scheme is one of the recommendations of the tourism recovery oversight group and I have urged Cabinet colleagues to look at that. I am in favour of a scheme that would provide a boost to the industry in that off-peak season. Once the scheme ends at the end of this month, it is anticipated that my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will take stock and look at what supports would be best suited to the tourism sector to be put in place for that off-peak season again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will get back to the Deputy on insurance for the outdoor dining scheme. As he will be aware, it is €500 million for outdoor seating accessories for tourism and hospitality and €12 million for the local authority structures. I will get back to the Deputy with a note on that insurance query. The charter boat operators were invited to apply for the first stage of that €55 million tourism business continuity scheme. I know some operators are disappointed that they were found ineligible because they did not have a minimum annual turnover, as the Deputy said, of €50,000. The rationale for this requirement is that the focus of the tourism business continuity scheme is to support strategic tourism businesses to offset fixed costs incurred in 2020 and support them to continue operating in 2021. That eligibility criteria for the €50,000 threshold is based on the likelihood that for a business with a turnover of less than €50,000, the non-payroll fixed costs will be sufficiently low to enable the owners to furlough the business by availing of other state aids, namely, income supports such as the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, thereby enabling these businesses to re-emerge as public health restrictions ease.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I share the Senator's enthusiasm and look forward to a return of outdoor performances. Unfortunately, the public health advice is that it is still too early to say when that will happen. We must look at the case numbers, hospitalisations, vaccinations and variants of concern. As the Senator will be aware, the Government will meet in advance of 4 May to review the level of restrictions and see what can be done. I have two schemes in place to facilitate that. The €5 million for live performance schemes in local authority areas is to employ and engage live performers during the summer months and help them programme for outdoor live performances. The outdoor public spaces scheme of up to €250,000 is for projects to create those spaces for us all to enjoy. At the minute, however, it is too early to say when but I am cautiously optimistic for the summer.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sorry about that. I just keep switching on and off. I am very familiar with the great work done by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. My children participate in it by Zoom. It has done a wonderful job of keeping it going, even though it is by Zoom. My Department does gives funding and grant assistance to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Additional resources were given last year for its great work, and we are engaged with Comhaltas on an ongoing basis as to its needs. Outdoor dance classes will resume in line with outdoor training for young people next week, but I am happy to engage with specific groups if Deputy McGrath wants to give me the details.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The night-time economy is a hugely important sector, as the Senator said, contributing to our economy and our cultural and creative sectors. It can have a really positive impact on our well-being and has really felt the brunt of the pandemic due to the sector's very nature. I was delighted to establish the night-time economy task force last July, and the Senator will be aware that it has been examining all the challenges facing the vibrant night-time culture and economy such as regulations and licensing laws, transport and diversity of cultural activities. A huge demand for diversity of offering and flexibility in the operating environment arose from in-depth and extensive consultations. There has been a positive indication from the Minister, Deputy McEntee, regarding the modernisation of the licensing laws. That is a really positive outcome from the ongoing work of the task force. The task force is due to finalise its report, I expect, in the coming weeks with its practical recommendations, and I intend to publish the report once I have reflected on the findings, so yes, it will be published and available to the Senator. However, we have to get much more creative in our thinking and in innovative solutions to the challenges facing the night-time economy. Every opportunity has to be explored. Senator Warfield is correct that the current iteration of Creative Ireland will come to an end next year. My officials are preparing proposals, which I hope to bring to Cabinet, that will seek to extend the programme, in particular Creative Communities, through local authorities and Creative Ireland's wonderful work increasing access to creative opportunities for our young people. That has proven to be really impactful and I would like to see it continue. I hope to see that report in May.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for his feedback on the LPSS. I know that venues such as De Barra's Folk Club, Connolly's of Leap and many others did great work under the scheme. We hope to see a lot more of this with the recent scheme which closed for applications just last week. I absolutely understand the sector's need for clarity and certainty. I have extensive and ongoing engagement with the sector. However, it is still about the public health advice, as I said earlier. It is still too early to say how and when other restrictions should be eased, given the current uncertainties. Based on my engagement with people from the sector, they find the speculation quite unhelpful so I do not want to engage in it. I prefer certainty too but at the minute, the restrictions and the public health advice do not allow me to give that certainty just yet. It comes down to the case numbers, the hospitalisations, the vaccinations and the variants. The Government is meeting in advance of 4 May to look at what May, June and July will look like and as I said earlier, I am cautiously optimistic, and when it is safe to do so we will look at that. There is also the tourism and hospitality forum. I addressed that issue regarding the oversight group, which is a more representative group and the bodies the Deputy is talking about are part of the tourism and hospitality forum the Tánaiste and I have established. We will meet again in May. At the last meeting, we brought the Taoiseach in to hear the concerns of all the members. The Restaurants Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association, Drinks Ireland, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland are just some of the stakeholders in the forum. On the specific supports the Deputy mentioned, everything will be examined. A lot of those supports are in the recommendations of that tourism oversight group so I have brought that to the attention of my Cabinet colleagues and we will look at everything in the context of the national economic recovery plan. On the stay-and-spend scheme, as I mentioned earlier, the stop-start nature of the pandemic has resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised. I am in favour of a scheme that would give a boost to the industry in the off-season. It was designed for the off-season and has attracted consumers. It was my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who did that. It was an innovative scheme but as I said, the stop and start nature of the pandemic led to it being underutilised. It is anticipated the Minister for Finance will take stock of the scheme as we reach the end of the month and look to see what appropriate measures could be put in place for the off-peak season.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the theatres, I conducted that pilot in the Abbey Theatre and in the National Concert Hall, and the feedback was very positive. Due to public health advice, it is still too early to give a definite date for theatres. Obviously, it is something I would like to happen. On the return to live events, the theatre forum is on the expert group that is examining the roadmap for a return. That will be helpful. Outdoor dance for groups of up to 15 will be permitted. It is the same for all non-contact outdoor activities, so it will be allowed. On the elite artists, we are engaging with the sector on that specific point about artists' travel. Unfortunately, at present there is no opportunity to perform, but we are in engagement with them. The circus is an art form and it is funded by the Arts Council. The Arts Council is independent in its funding decisions, but I will relay the Senator's concerns to it. Like me, the Senator is an advocate for the basic income. As I told him, he is pushing an open door with me on the issue. The basic income by its nature supports creativity and innovation. That specific recommendation has been very well received, and not only here. Even internationally, journalists are talking about it. The latest information is that an oversight group has been established to deal with the recommendations. I have given direction to the oversight group to prioritise the basic income. The Ministers in the relevant Departments are supportive of this proposal being examined. Of course, any proposal on this will not just come from my Department so it is positive that the relevant Ministers are supportive. On a personal level, the Senator is pushing an open door with me, as it would be with the Senator. It is the most important recommendation of that report and I have asked the oversight group to prioritise it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The €17 million outdoor dining scheme is being administered by Fáilte Ireland through the local authorities and there are two elements to it. There is the €5 million element, which is for outdoor seating and accessories for tourism and hospitality businesses, and the second element is the €12 million for local authority structures for weatherproofing and outdoor dining infrastructure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, the aim of the scheme is to support local authorities and businesses to increase and operate their outdoor dining offering. It is up to the businesses to apply. I am sure many businesses in County Louth will do so.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That will depend on how many businesses apply and how much money they want. The maximum grant for an individual business is €4,000. It will depend on how many wish to apply and how many wish to go for the €4,000 maximum. Fáilte Ireland will be running the scheme and assessing the applications.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is €4,000 per business. This has been really well received by the Restaurants Association of Ireland and all businesses. I have not heard an individual business question this but rather welcome it. It depends on the individual applications.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand why the Deputy is asking. Fáilte Ireland did the assessment. The scheme was developed by Fáilte Ireland based on its knowledge and engagement with the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not a case that I do not know, Deputy Munster, with respect. What I am saying is Fáilte Ireland developed the scheme based on its knowledge and engagement with the sector. Based on the response to this from the sector it has been very well received. It is one of the most positively received schemes we have and I have not heard the questions being raised by the Deputy. I have only heard positive affirmation of the scheme.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can get the information for the Deputy but I suspect that for the businesses concerned the priority is not the reasoning of the allocation but rather the actual allocation and how helpful it is to them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	All supports, including the CRSS, will be considered. I am a strong advocate for the sector and this is reflected every time the Taoiseach makes an announcement. I reflect that the sector needs supports. I am a very strong advocate and voice for the sector and it knows it from its engagement with me. As I said earlier in reply to other members, the Tánaiste and I will meet the tourism and hospitality sectors in May. We have brought in the Taoiseach to hear their concerns. I asked for recommendations on the supports to be on the agenda for the meeting that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and I attended. I felt it was also essential for the Taoiseach to hear them. The Deputy can be sure I am a loud advocate for the sector. Reopening is dependent on public health conditions. It is about the public health advice and the case numbers, hospitalisations, vaccinations and variants of concern. I am anxious for the sectors to reopen but we want them to do so as soon as it is safe. With regard to the stay and spend scheme, when the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, launched it he did not foresee the stop-start nature of the pandemic and how it led to the scheme being completely underutilised. As I said in reply to previous speakers, I am in favour of a scheme that gives an essential boost to the industry. Everything should be considered by the Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can ask Fáilte Ireland to engage with Louth County Council on the scheme if that would be helpful.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding local creative youth partnerships, those are in the gift of the Minister for Education, Deputy Foley, as it is led by her Department. A significant announcement about that initiative will be made on 13 May at the creative youth conference, in which the Taoiseach, the Minister for Education and I will participate along with panellists from the areas of education and business. We are very keen to expand these partnerships and I have engaged with the Minister for Education in that regard. As the Chair said, the ETBs have been brilliant at targeting the most disadvantaged young people, and the Deputy knows this from her previous work. Regarding the basic income, I express my thanks to the committee for its support of the proposal. I welcome the committee's support for this initiative. I reiterate that I am working with colleagues to progress the appraisal of this recommendation. I am very supportive of it. I have indicated to the oversight group that the number one priority is determining how this can be done. The Ministers from the relevant Department, whose officials sit on that oversight group, are key in this regard. I confirm those Ministers are supportive of this proposal being examined. That is very positive. I am strongly advocating for a basic income. It would be a game changer for the arts, so it came as no surprise to me that this proposal was being sought as the number one recommendation. Moving to the tourism oversight group, it is not a representative group. It is there to examine the implementation of the recommendations. What I said was that the restaurant and pub sector had its voice on the tourism and hospitality forum, which the Tánaiste and I set up in the autumn of last year. We have another meeting in May. However, all those relevant sectors which the Chair mentioned are on that tourism and hospitality forum.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, because it is not a representative group. The voice of the restaurant and pub sector is heard by the Tánaiste and me in the tourism and hospitality forum. The oversight group is not a representative body. Moving on to the State boards, those appointments are made through the Public Appointments Service, PAS, process and it is open to all applicants. I do not direct those appointments. The stay and spend scheme, as I remarked earlier, was completely underutilised because of the stop-start nature of the pandemic. The scheme was designed for the off-peak season. It is my understanding the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will take stock of the situation and look at the relevant supports. As I said, however, there will be no cliff edge cut-off of supports for the sector, and we will look to see what relevant supports can be put in place for that off-peak season.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have kept funding for international marketing in place with Tourism Ireland all along. Contained within the programme for Government is The Year of The Invitation. I think that initiative is along the lines of what Deputy Crowe is talking about and it is a commitment in the programme for Government. It is envisaged for the moment for 2023, but we are engaging with the sector in that regard. However, I think that is exactly along the lines of what Deputy Crowe was saying.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Recommendations concerning the requisite supports were presented to me and I brought them to Cabinet. Everything will be considered, and the outcome will depend on when things reopen. The Government has given the guarantee that there will be no cliff edge cut-off in the supports. These sectors will need support beyond their reopening. We are very aware of that aspect from our engagement with the industry. That commitment exists. It was recognised in the national economic recovery plan that tourism was one of the sectors most impacted. The Taoiseach also flagged this as one of the sectors which will need supports on the path ahead.Everything will be considered for the supports, not just for reopening but also beyond.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said earlier, we are guided by the public health advice, which depends on the numbers for case numbers, hospitalisations, variants and vaccinations. We can be cautiously optimistic for reopening but the difference with museums, galleries or theatres is that theatres are enclosed and seated venues. This is quite different from walking through a gallery. Nobody would like to see them open more than I would. This is why I made sure to have that pilot for theatre in December. We will continue to be guided by the health advice, but the Senator can rest assured that I will be advocating for this. As soon as it is safe to do so, they will reopen. We must, however, be guided by public health advice.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We said we would look at May for museums and galleries. We have indicated that when we come to the end of April, we will look at museums and galleries. This is a positive first step for the reopening of culture and arts. It is significant that this is happening in May. As I said, theatre is slightly different because it is enclosed seating. As soon as it is safe to do so, rest assured I will be looking for that. We have to go with public health advice on this. Based on the recent numbers it is looking more positive for us. I absolutely agree on the issue of rebuilding our cultural identity. We are a nation that has spoken so much about how much we value the arts.We have all felt it and as we emerge out of this, it is not just a case of getting these cultural institutions reopened or performers back on stage but of supporting them beyond that and showing the intrinsic value they have to us and our very being as a nation. That is essential. I am absolutely determined to work with my Cabinet colleagues, performers and all stakeholders to identify the best way not just to support them but to really emphasise the value we place on our arts and culture, which have been so sorely missed in the past year. I do not know if the Senator caught the programme on TG4 for President Michael D. Higgins's birthday. It was wonderful. Every time I hear magnificent performances like that it brings sadness to me, as I think it does to everyone else, because it emphasises how much we miss hearing those performances and how we yearn to return to theatre or hear someone sing live, and more important, how that performer yearns to have that interaction with an audience again. My priority right now is the reopening of this sector as soon as possible but beyond that, it is working with colleagues like the Senator on identifying the ways we can show how much we as a nation value our arts and culture.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I ask members to please communicate with me and I will give everything consideration and get back to them. Did the committee communicate in writing with Fáilte Ireland on that query?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay. I will connect with Fáilte Ireland on that exact question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would hope to have that in the summer. That is the plan for when to expect the report from the commission, which will include all the recommendations. I do not expect it to give individual recommendations at different times. I expect to see that report in the summer.
