CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses. As a mum of three young kids and as a former teacher who taught at second level for 20 years - four in a private school and 16 in a disadvantaged school - I have seen the differences in facilities offered to children. On the Food Dudes programme, described by Mr. Neary, I saw the change that occurred when I, as a parent, did not choose what went into my children's lunch box. They made the decision and wanted the fruit and the vegetables. I thought it was fantastic and it has been sustained. I love the idea of the golden mile. On the fixed playground in primary schools, which Ms Heneghan raised, the only issue is insurance. Other members have raised that. My questions are really directed to Mr. Ward. As my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan said, great things are happening but it is sporadic. What can we do to make sure it is happening in all our schools for all our children? Even in my own constituency I see one of those issues. A second level school is waiting 37 years for a PE hall. I have asked for an audit of the second level schools but have been told it is not happening. A response from the Department told me that where schools do not have PE halls, they have access to local facilities. They do not. Much of the time they are disadvantaged schools that do not have the money to pay for transport to a local facility. Frankly, I do not think they should have to use up part of their PE time getting on a bus to go to a local facility. If Mr. Ward will pardon the pun, waiting 37 years is not a level playing field. It is not fair on second level pupils. It rains a lot and they do not even have an all-weather pitch. I do not see how that is right at any level when we have an obesity crisis in Ireland. They are being asked to change in a classroom when it rains. It is mixed school. That classroom is their PE hall, with the outline of a goalpost painted on the wall. It is a huge issue which the Department needs to address. I do not understand the refusal to audit second level schools. Mr. Ward mentioned that teachers should be equipped in terms of the requirements of the curriculum and these wonderful initiatives in the junior and leaving certificate cycles. If they do not have the facilities, it is very hard to deliver the programmes properly, fairly and equally to all children. Ms Heneghan talked about the small areas covered with tarmacadam that are seen as the play areas. There is a problem coming down the road and we are not future-proofing our schools. This came up in my constituency and in the neighbouring one. Some 93 of 105 schools in DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown are zoned residential. We have seen two schools lose their green spaces. There is no forward planning or future thinking when it comes to population growth. We will need more space for schools and green space, yet we even had the chief executive of Dublin City Council announcing last week that we should build on the green spaces in Dublin city. There is a lack of thinking ahead to protect the future. There is a crisis currently but we must also think ahead to make sure it does not continue. We must protect the green spaces in our schools and cities to keep our children healthy and happy.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My questions were not addressed. I ask Mr. Ward to stress to the Department that teachers want to do a good job but cannot do so without a PE hall.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The school I mentioned has been there for 37 years. It came through the Celtic tiger without getting a PE hall. When the State was at its wealthiest and money was spent ridiculously on other things, this school was overlooked. That is why I would like an audit. Have other schools spent 37 years without a PE hall and, if so, why?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Following on from the Chairman's question about vending machines being banned, is the case even more extreme? Some schools do not have vending machines but they have the fizzy drinks for sale behind the counter in their canteens. Should we be looking for fizzy-drink-free zones in schools? One can see the difference in the children's behaviour after taking that sugar rush. Is that something the Department would consider? My other questions are for the officials from the Department of Health. What sort of contact do they have with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Education and Skills, not just about activity in schools but about ensuring that children can walk and cycle safely to school? Activity on the way to school can also help tackle obesity. We always look to Finland when we talk about education. They have a "health in all policies" approach which has helped tackle obesity in childhood in recent years. Some 8% of Finland's education budget goes on delivering school meals. I understand it is provided for in legislation that every child is guaranteed a school meal. Is that something we should be considering? Should we be rolling out comprehensive healthy school meals? We have a crisis in obesity but we also have one in five children going to school hungry. It makes sense that it would help their education if they were eating the right foods and if we make sure they are not hungry in the classroom.
