CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding C11, has the Minister considered allocating supports to students from low income families who are still being refused SUSI grants while doing their full-time degrees in independent third-level colleges, such as the Dublin Business School and Griffith College? Some students appeared before this committee in the past year who were really struggling and doing their best to get through third level, but needed access to the SUSI grants.  The Fine Gael manifesto mentioned â‚¬100 million of additional funding just to stand still. What supports there are fall way short of what is needed to significantly boost the standing of the sector. I would ask the Minister to address this.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I know it would be a policy change but is there any intention to do exactly that and to weigh up the pros and cons? We are talking about students from disadvantaged areas and low income families and, as the Chairman pointed out, the CAO form does not make it clear that they would be unable to access grants for their chosen courses. There is a journalism course, in particular, that attracts many students.
