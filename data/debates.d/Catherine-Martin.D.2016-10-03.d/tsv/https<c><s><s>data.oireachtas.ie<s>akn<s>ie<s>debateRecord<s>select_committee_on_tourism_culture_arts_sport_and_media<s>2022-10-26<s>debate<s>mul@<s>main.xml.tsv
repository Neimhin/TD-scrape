CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 79:In page 59, line 34, to delete “Complaints”.Section 11 provides for amendments to sections 47 and 48 of the Broadcasting Act 2009, the purpose of which is to extend the complaint-handling provisions which currently apply to broadcasters to cover video on-demand services and to provide for circumstances in which coimisiún na meán may handle complaints made to broadcasters and video on-demand services. Section 47 of the Broadcasting Act, in particular, provides for the preparation and implementation of codes of practice for complaints handling by broadcasters and video on-demand services. Section 48(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, provides for the circumstances in which an coimisiún may dismiss a complaint, while section 48(9) provides that a complaint that is being resolved under a code of practice prepared by a broadcaster or video on-demand service may still be treated by an coimisiún as a complaint made to it. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland has noted that section 48(9) could be interpreted as allowing for a complaint to be submitted to an coimisiún which has already been effectively resolved under a code of practice prepared by a provider and that it is unclear whether an coimisiún would have the authority to dismiss such a complaint. The purpose of amendments Nos. 80 and 81 is to provide absolute clarity that coimisiún na meán can dismiss a complaint in those circumstances. Amendment No. 79 is a technical amendment to delete the section titled "Complaints" before section 48 of the 2009 Act to be inserted by the Bill, which deals with complaints handling with regard to media service providers, in light of the fact that a number of other sections with regard to the individual complaints mechanism for harmful online content will be inserted later in the Bill. This will avoid a single section being entitled, "complaints", where there are no multiple sections dealing with complaints in the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 80:In page 60, line 23, to delete “or” and substitute the following:"(c) the complaint has been resolved effectively under a code of practice prepared under section 47(3), or”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 81:In page 60, line 24, to delete “(c) the complaint” and substitute “(d) the complaint”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 82:In page 60, line 27, to delete “section 139ZA(2)” and substitute “section 139ZI(2)”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 83:In page 61, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following: “(e) in subsection (21), in paragraph (q), by the substitution of “section 31 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022” for “section 3 of the Act of 1998”,”. The purpose of these consequential amendments is to take account of the enactment of the Electoral Reform Act 2022. Amendments Nos. 83 and 316 update references to sections of the Referendum Act 1998 and to the referendum commissions in order that they now refer to the Electoral Reform Act and, an coimisiún toghcháin, the new electoral commission. Amendment No. 319 amends a reference in the Electoral Reform Act to the Broadcasting Act 2009 in order that it now refers to the relevant section in this Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. As she said, it would require that no fewer than 50% of the board members of RTÉ be proficient in the Irish language. A provision of this kind would be at odds with provisions for membership of State boards more generally. With regard to the criteria necessary for consideration as a member of the board of RTÉ, section 82 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 already provides that candidates must have "experience of or shown capacity in", among others, "matters pertaining to the development of the Irish language". The specific provision contemplated by the amendment, over and above that already provided for or in addition to the provisions for membership of State boards more generally, is not necessary. Accordingly, I will not be accepting this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I again thank the Deputies for the amendment but I cannot accept it for a number of reasons. The amendment seeks to change the position in the 2009 Act where video on-demand services are titled "non-broadcast non-linear audio-visual media services" to "audiovisual on-demand media services" in line with the language in EU law.However, this is already provided for in sections 33 and 34. On the other elements of the amendment, which proposes to replace a reference to "the Irish language" with a reference to "the national aim of restoring the Irish language to use as a spoken language nationwide", I am advised that the current reference to the Irish language is sufficient and appropriate in the context of this section of the 2009 Act, which states that, in pursuit of its public service objects, RTÉ shall "be responsive to the interests and concerns of the whole community, be mindful of the need for understanding and peace within the whole island of Ireland, ensure that the programmes reflect the varied elements which make up the culture of the people of the whole island of Ireland, and have special regard for the elements which distinguish that culture and in particular for the Irish language".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. As with amendment No. 86, I cannot accept amendment No. 87 as it simply repeats a change to the 2009 Act made by the Bill, in this case in section 33. The other element of this amendment seeks to change the requirement on RTÉ to make available a national television and sound broadcasting service to the whole community on the island of Ireland “as far as is reasonably practicable” to a requirement to make it available “in full”. This would not be appropriate as it would legally oblige RTÉ to obtain a set of circumstances where it does not reasonably have the means to ensure those circumstances would always be in place, particularly as RTÉ is not a State body in both jurisdictions on this island. As with amendment No. 86, this amendment would have the effect, for instance, of obliging broadcasts to make available sports events both within and outside the jurisdiction of the State. Acquisition of rights to sporting events are a commercial matter between a rights-holder or sports body and broadcasters. These are very often allocated on an exclusive territorial basis and, as such, it is not possible to legislate for and compel RTÉ to make such events available. Examples of such events might include the World Cup or the Olympics. I understand the frustration of viewers in Northern Ireland when certain events may not be shown on RTÉ in Northern Ireland given the distribution of rights to those events. However, I am advised this amendment would not make a difference to the current position. Were this amendment to be interpreted as compelling RTÉ to acquire rights to sporting events, such as the Olympics, on an all-island basis, there could be significant unintended consequences in terms of the amount of additional expenditure that would need to be incurred by RTÉ. For example, were a rights-holder aware that RTÉ is compelled by legislation to make events available on an all-island basis, it may seek to charge a premium, given it would know that RTÉ would have to acquire the rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The difference here is it would be known by people that RTÉ is compelled by legislation to make events available, so therefore it would be unfair because it would be charged premium rights if it is compelled in legislation. Regarding the GAA, RTÉ made that decision itself. This would be forcing it in legislation and therefore would lead to that unfairness when it comes to looking to acquire rights.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Not within the context of legislation; perhaps in the broader outlook. This is not for legislation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I said in my contribution that I understand the frustration of viewers when certain events may not be shown. The people who cannot travel down and want to watch it in Tyrone and support their team cannot do that. However, if it were to be interpreted as compelling RTÉ to acquire the rights to such sporting events, it leads, as I said to Deputy Munster, to that unfairness. Premium rates would be charged if it is absolutely compelled. Sporting organisations – not RTÉ – are the ones allocating the rights on a territorial basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Deputy addressing amendment No. 88?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, in the case the Deputy is referencing, it is the sporting organisation, not RTÉ, that is the one allocating the rights on a territorial basis. It is not RTÉ, it is the actual sporting organisation, which in this case was the GAA. It is not RTÉ. Amendment No. 88 seeks to change the requirement on RTÉ to make available a national television and sound broadcasting service to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland “in so far as RTÉ considers reasonably practicable” to a requirement to make it available “in full, unless limited by factors beyond the control of RTÉ”. I do not see this amendment as materially changing the obligation already on RTÉ, as any limitation on RTÉ’s provision of services to Irish communities outside the island of Ireland arise almost exclusively from factors beyond the control of RTÉ. The purpose of the present provision is so that RTÉ can ascertain those limits and work within them to provide its services on the widest possible basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment would introduce obligations regarding the rates of pay for RTÉ employees. The independence of RTÉ in operational matters is provided for in legislation and I do not believe it is appropriate to introduce legislative provisions in this regard. RTÉ is currently undertaking a review of the staff grading structures across the organisation and services. If there are any discrepancies with regard to equal pay for equal work, I expect them to be identified and rectified through this process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I hear the Deputies' concerns and frustration about this. I am not sure if the place for this provision is within this legislation but I will ask my officials to follow up with RTÉ on this. I would be of the opinion, as I said earlier, that any discrepancies around equal pay for equal work should be addressed in that review. They should be identified and rectified. I will give a commitment that my officials will follow up with RTÉ on this. I just do not think this specific legislation is the place to put this but I will get my officials to follow up, if that is okay.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We will come back to the Deputies before Report Stage. I am committing that my officials will follow up and look for clarity on that issue. We will have that information and the response before Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would introduce a new baseline for investment by RTÉ in Irish language content of 25% of the investment it makes in independent productions annually. As I outlined yesterday, the Future of Media Commission has recommended a comprehensive review of all Irish language services. I do not believe that making a statutory provision, as envisaged by the amendment, is the most appropriate way to achieve any further Irish language services. For this reason, I cannot accept the recommendation. We are going to have a comprehensive review of all Irish language services.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 94:In page 71, line 21, to delete “(1)”.Section 128C of the Broadcasting Act, as substituted by the Bill, provides that coimisiún na meán may make rules to ensure the prominence of public service programmes and media services on "interactive guides". In practice, public service programmes and services refer to RTÉ and TG4 as public service broadcasters and Virgin Media as a holder of a television programme service contract. Section 128C is intended to exercise an option available to member states under Article 7b of the audiovisual media services directive to take measures to ensure the appropriate prominence of audiovisual media services of general interest. In subsection (1) of section 128A the definition of "interactive guide" refers to an interface accessed by a "terminal", which itself is defined to refer to equipment with interactive computing capability other than a computer, tablet device or smartphone. In practice, the reference to "terminal" used in the Bill may have the effect of confining the application of any rules on prominence made by coimisiún na meán to platforms accessed through set-top boxes. That has the anomalous effect of applying the prominence rules to an interactive guide offered by a platform provider, such as Sky or Vodafone, through a terminal but not to the very same interactive guide offered by the same platform provider through a smartphone. Amendments Nos. 94 to 97, inclusive, are intended to address this anomaly by removing the reference to a terminal. This change, though largely technical in nature, will future-proof the prominence rules to allow them to reflect continuing changes in the ways audiovisual content is accessed and viewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 95:In page 71, lines 24 and 25, to delete “and accessed by the use of a terminal”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 96:In page 72, to delete line 18 and substitute “77.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 97:In page 72, to delete lines 19 to 27.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendments Nos. 98 and 99 are intended to ensure that coimisiún na meán provide for the prominence of Irish-language programming and services in any rules made by coimisiún na meán under section 128C of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill. As I indicated earlier, public service programmes and public service media services include, by virtue of the definitions set out in section 128A of the Broadcasting Act, as amended by the Bill, RTÉ and TG4. Both of our public service broadcasters are required by their statutory objectives, set out in sections 114 and 118 of the extant Broadcasting Act, to provide programmes in the Irish language. TG4 is, of course, required to provide programmes primarily in the Irish language. For that reason, in providing for the prominence of our public service broadcasters, in particular TG4, section 128C adequately provides for the prominence of programming and services in the Irish language. Given the Bill already addresses the intention of amendments Nos. 98 and 99, I will not accept them. Amendment No. 100 seeks to insert a reference to the rights of Irish-speaking users to engage with interactive guides in the Irish language in section 128C(2)(b). I believe the intention underlying this amendment is addressed by subsection (2)(e), which provides that in preparing rules on prominence an coimisiún shall have regard to the rights of users of prominence guides, with particular regard to their rights and likely expectations regarding Irish-language programmes and services. Accordingly, I do not accept amendment No. 100.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not propose to accept the amendment. I note the intent of the amendment but this matter will primarily be addressed by my colleague, the Tánaiste, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the DSA in Ireland. It would not be useful to cut across that work at this stage. Members will be aware that in March the Government decided that coimisiún na meán, when established by this Bill, will act as the primary regulator, termed the digital services co-ordinator, DSC, under the DSA. Government made this decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the DSC, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. Disinformation and false information are being tackled on an EU-wide basis, not just through the DSA but also through the European Commission’s code of practice on disinformation. This is a Commission initiative, which has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. The Commission intends that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. Clearly, an coimisiún, as the DSC, would have an important role to play in that context. In addition, the Commission has established the European Digital Media Observatory, including a hub in Dublin City University, DCU, which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. At national level, as the Deputy referenced, the Future of Media Commission recommended the creation of a national counter disinformation strategy. A working group is being set up in my Department to start work on this and to give effect to that recommendation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When the DSA comes into effect-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It will be the DSC. The Government agreed that. There is crossover there but we are working closely with our colleagues in the other Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Coimisiún na meán will be the regulator of it. The Deputy asked about the strategy as well, which is being led by my Department but it involves a working group of the relevant Departments, civil society organisations and industry stakeholders. I propose that there would be a public consultation on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	From the beginning I have always said that the Bill cannot address every issue at once. There is that connection with what has been done with the DSA in the Tánaiste's Department so it is not that it is being left to one side; we are getting this up and running. It cannot address every issue at once and because the coimisiún will be the DSC you will see that being worked together and whatever crosses over will be addressed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not propose to accept this amendment but I accept that there is an issue with young children accessing online services that were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue that I am aware of, both as a parent of and as the chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety. It is a complex issue that it is being worked on at EU level. Finding workable solutions in this area will raise a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters, that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. However, I will ask an coimisiún to examine this issue as a priority, in conjunction with the Data Protection Commission and through engaging on the Better Internet for Kids strategy, to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. As I said, not everything can be dealt with in a single Bill but what matters is that we put the framework in place. I will tell the commission to deal with this as a matter of priority but it is also about dealing with it on an EU-wide basis. In May, the European Commission launched a new European strategy for a Better Internet for Kids. The strategy is built on three pillars - child protection in the online environment; digital empowerment; and active participation. Under the child protection pillar, there is a strong focus on providing age-appropriate online experiences, which the amendment is trying to address, including through age verification and age-appropriate design. In this regard, the Commission commits to facilitating a comprehensive code of conduct on age-appropriate design by 2024 using the provisions of the DSA, which provides that such codes of conduct may be co-regulatory instruments. The Commission has indicated that the code could provide for age verification for accessing certain online content. To facilitate age verification, the Commission has committed to work with member states and EU standardisation to strengthen effective age verification methods. This would be most effective if it was done on a Europe-wide basis and that is why we need to wait. There is a pilot as well called euCONSENT.I think I have mentioned the pilot to the Deputy previously during Question Time or at the committee. It is an ongoing pilot looking to deliver that online age verification and parental consent which balances the rights I mentioned earlier, the rights of the children and the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content. The result of that pilot will inform us on an EU-wide basis. It would be more effective to do it on an EU-wide basis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is no intention to do that in this Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with the Deputy that it is an important issue, but it is highly complex. The important thing is to get this framework in place and getting the commission set up. I will be asking it to look at priorities in conjunction with the cross-cutting of the Data Protection Commission. Getting the framework in place is the important bit. I agree with the Deputy that it is a very important issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 103:In page 81, line 28, after "services" to insert "the provider of which is". These are technical amendments to refer to the provider of video-sharing platform services in section 139G, as inserted by the Bill, rather than simply the service itself. It is being done on the advice of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 104:In page 81, line 32, after "service" to insert "the provider of which is".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 105:In page 81, line 34, after "service" where it secondly occurs to insert "the provider of which is".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. Policy regarding employment rights is primarily the responsibility of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and is more appropriately dealt with in employment legislation. The amendment is also straying into matters which may be more appropriate to the functions of the Workplace Relations Commission. In particular, section 11(1)(d) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 provides that the WRC shall "conduct reviews of, and monitor developments as respects, workplace relations". I would be wary of any provision that might have the effect of duplicating the work of the WRC. I understand the intention of the amendment. The protection of workers' rights is an important consideration in all sectors, including the sectors which are regulated by the Bill. I also acknowledge the concerns raised by Deputies regarding working conditions in the technology sector. Last year, the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment heard evidence from trade unions, experts and content moderators regarding their working conditions. The evidence pointed to issues regarding the pay and conditions of content moderators and some of the dangers inherent in the practice of hiring employees through outsourcing firms. One of the witnesses, a former content moderator, set out the very difficult nature of the work involved, as Deputy Mythen noted, and in particular the kinds of distressing content that she was required to view as part of the role.  The Tánaiste also addressed the committee and stressed the duty of care that employers have towards employees to create a safe working environment. He also indicated to the Chair of the committee that he had written to a particular technology company about the terms and conditions of content moderators and indicated that it would be on the agenda when he spoke to the company again.  It is important to stress that the protection of workers’ rights is not a core function of my Department or its agencies. It is important that our employment rights framework, which is the responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, places consistent rules and obligations on employers in all sectors of the economy. Moving responsibility for workers’ rights to sectoral regulators would dilute the enforcement of the overarching framework and potentially lead to an inconsistent approach between sectors. In that regard, the role of an coimisiún, as an independent regulatory body, is ultimately to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation across broadcasting, video-on-demand and designated online services. It is not intended to regulate employment relations or assess working conditions.  As a general principle, in considering any amendments to expand the functions of an coimisiún I am very conscious of not unduly expanding the scope of an coimisiún into other areas of policy, with the effect that its core functions, which I have just outlined, might suffer or that it might duplicate the functions of other bodies in the State.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I go back to the role of an coimisiún. It is an independent regulatory body to enforce new and updated regulatory frameworks for content regulation. There would not be a role there to put in a code on workers' rights. We are tackling it through the codes that will be there relating to prohibiting damaging content being available. That is what this is about. Moving responsibility for workers' rights into this is not what this commission is set up to do. It is there to end the era of self-regulation. We are tackling online harmful content through this. I could not envisage a code there on workers' rights. That is for a different Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The protection of workers is still an employment issue and it is not the core function of coimisiún na meán.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment has two purposes. First, it seeks to ensure the measures taken under online safety codes create equal level protections for users of Irish and English language user-generated content available on designated online subject to online safety codes. Second, it seeks to ensure that Irish language content cannot be removed or prevented from appearing on a designated online service if similar English language content was not removed or prevented from appearing from the service. I cannot accept these amendments for a number of reasons. The first of these is that the online safety codes will give effect to provisions of EU law in many case, particularly in the implementation of the EU's audiovisual media services directive. In that regard, it would be inappropriate to single out only two of the official languages of the EU. The second reason is that the proposed requirement for designated online services to not remove Irish language content would not reflect the fact that Irish and English are separate languages and a word or phrase that may be functionally equivalent in each may carry entirely different implicit meanings or connotations that may cause either or both to fall within a particular category of harmful online content. This is the case not only with English and Irish, but with all languages. In fact, it is a particular problem space in online safety and something that coimisiún na meán will need to be alive to in operating the regulatory framework for online safety.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I did not say that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What I said was that the online safety codes will give effect to provisions of EU law in many cases, particularly in the implementation of the EU's audiovisual media services directive. In that case, it would be inappropriate to single out only two of the official languages of the EU when there are many languages in the Union.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 108:In page 86, line 34, to delete “section 139X” and substitute “section 139ZF”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment seeks to prevent current and former political officeholders from being appointed as auditors regarding a designated online platform's compliance with online safety codes or their complaints handling systems. I am not accepting the amendment as, in particular, I am not sure what is the value in preventing a former political officeholder, especially a member of a local authority, from being appointed as an auditor. Realistically, appointed auditors are likely to be firms providing professional services rather than individuals and it would be strange to prevent the appointment of a firm as an auditor on the basis that a member of its staff used to be a councillor. If the Deputies’ concerns relate to cooling-off periods more generally for persons holding public office, then that would be a matter for the Standards in Public Office Commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 111:In page 88, line 36, to delete “and”.These amendments insert into the Bill provisions requiring that coimisiún na meán must give reasonable notice of an audit to a provider of a designated online service.The purpose of these amendments is to ensure legal clarity around the operation of these provisions and to ensure audits are not delayed or challenged on the basis of a lack of notice being given.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is just saying that reasonable notice of an audit must be given. It is up to the commission and it depends on how complex the audit will be and how much preparation is needed. It will differ. It is making sure reasonable notice is given to ensure these audits are not delayed or challenged.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 112:In page 88, to delete line 37 and substitute the following:“(d) specify the co-operation that may be requested by the person appointed, and”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 113:In page 88, between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:“(e) require the provider to provide that co-operation, subject to reasonable notice being given by the person appointed.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 114:In page 89, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following: “and shall give the provider an opportunity to make representations in writing to the Commission on the report within such period as the Commission specifies.”This amendment would require an coimisiún to provide an opportunity for designated online platforms to make submissions in respect of an audit report prior to its publication. To clarify, it would not change the outcome of an audit report and the comments made by the designated online platform in question may also be published alongside the audit report. These provisions mirror similar requirements under the provisions for reports by authorised officers and are a key due process requirement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 115:In page 89, line 10, to delete “and” and substitute the following:“(9) After considering any representations made under subsection (8), the Commission”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 116:In page 89, line 14, to delete “(9) If” and substitute “(10) If”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 117:In page 89, line 19, to delete “(10) A provider” and substitute “(11) A provider”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 118:In page 89, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:“CHAPTER 4
Complaints to Commission about harmful online content

Complaints to Commission about harmful online content
139R. Where a scheme under section 139V provides for the making of a complaint to the Commission on the grounds that harmful online content is available on a designated online service, the Commission may deal with the complaint in accordance with this Chapter and the provisions of the scheme.
Complaints which may be considered by Commission
139S. (1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commission may not consider a complaint under this Chapter unless it is satisfied that the following conditions are met:(a) the complainant has made a complaint to the provider of the designated online service concerned about the availability of the content on the service;(b) a period of more than 2 days has elapsed since the complainant made the complaint to the provider;(c) where the provider operates a process in accordance with an online safety code for handling such a complaint, the complainant has taken reasonable steps in that period to have the complaint resolved through that process.(2) Where the Commission is not satisfied that the conditions in subsection (1) are met, it may consider a complaint under this Chapter if it considers it appropriate to do so having regard to the principles referred to in section 139U.(3) Where a complaint relates to content which falls within one of the offence-specific categories of harmful online content defined in section 139A(2), the Commission may consider the complaint under this Chapter only if—(a) the Commission has brought the complaint to the attention of the Garda Síochána, or any other body the Commission considers appropriate,(b) the Commission has informed the complainant and the provider of the designated online service that it has done so, and(c) where the complaint was brought to the attention of the Garda Síochána, the Garda Síochána has informed the Commission that they do not intend to take any action, or any further action, in relation to the availability of the content on the service concerned.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I discussed this last night.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This concerns bringing the complaint to the attention of another body where the commission considers the complaint relates to activities of the body. That could be, for example, the Garda. Is that what the Deputy is referring to?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That could be the Garda or the Data Protection Commissioner. It will be brought to those sorts of bodies.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The sanctions are those outlined in the Bill. In regard to the handling of complaints, there are sanctions up to and including fines.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It could be the Data Protection Commissioner and it could be the Garda. I can forward the Deputy a more detailed list, if that is helpful.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is not this committee; it is the advisory committees to the commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They will be laid by the commission before each House of the Oireachtas, so the committee will have access in that way.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am not sure what the Deputy is referring to but I understand that will be published on the website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It could also be the EU for video-sharing platforms.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am happy to come back to the Deputy if she wants to communicate with me afterwards.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 119:In page 89, line 25, to delete “4” and substitute “5”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 120:In page 89, line 28, to delete “139R.” and substitute “139Z.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 121:In page 89, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:“(a) on identifying harmful online content, and in particular on the application of subsection (4) of section 139A,”.These amendments insert into the Bill provisions that clarify matters relating to the making of online safety guidance materials. Amendment No. 121 clarifies that coimisiún na meán can make online safety guidance materials relating to the risk test for non offence-specific harmful online content. Amendment No. 122 clarifies that coimisiún na meán can make online safety guidance materials on matters relating to the online safety aspects of the Bill rather than simply in general. Amendment No. 123 is a consequential renumbering.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 122:In page 89, line 30, to delete “(a) on any matter” and substitute “(b) on any other matter relating to the operation of this Part or”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 123:In page 89, line 32, to delete “(b) otherwise” and substitute “(c) otherwise”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 124:In page 90, line 12, to delete “139S.” and substitute “139ZA.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 125:In page 90, line 12, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 126:In page 90, line 29, to delete “section 139X” and substitute “section 139ZF”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 127:In page 90, line 31, to delete “139T.” and substitute “139ZB.”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 128:In page 90, line 32, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This amendment seeks to require an coimisiún to provide an explanation to the Minister and to the Houses of the Oireachtas whenever it withdraws any online safety guidance materials or advisory notices. I am not proposing to accept this amendment. There are already a range of Oireachtas oversight mechanisms built into the Bill and, in that context, I am advised it is not appropriate to require it to account in this way for this specific type of decision. For example, it would appear it could apply in a situation where an coimisiún was withdrawing some guidance because it was updated with new guidance, which would seem to be overly burdensome.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 130:In page 91, line 7, to delete “5” and substitute “6”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 131:In page 91, line 10, to delete “139U.” and substitute “139ZC.” 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 132:In page 92, line 21, to delete “139V.” and substitute “139ZD.”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 133:In page 92, line 27, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 134:In page 92, line 29, to delete “139W.” and substitute “139ZE.”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 135:In page 92, line 40, to delete “section 139R” and substitute “section 139Z”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 136:In page 93, line 30, to delete “139X.” and substitute “139ZF.”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 137:In page 93, line 40, to delete “Directive 2000/31/EC” and substitute “the E-Commerce Directive”. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy for the amendment. It seeks to introduce rules for businesses offering subscription services, including in relation to renewals, cancellations, recurring charges and information provision. I cannot accept the amendment because it is outside the scope of the Bill and it is more appropriate to consumer protection legislation. As well as this, the amendment does not appear to provide for any enforcement mechanism and would also appear to apply to any business, whether it operates online or offline.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No 139:In page 98, between lines 34 and 35, to insert the following: “35. Online content by which a person exposes his or her genitals intending to cause fear, distress or alarm to another person contrary to section 45(1) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.36. Online content by which a person intentionally engages in offensive conduct of a sexual nature contrary to section 45(3) of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017.”.There are two kinds of categories of harmful online content contained in the Bill at present, those related to existing criminal offences, such as harassment under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, or Coco's Law, and those that are not linked to criminal offences, such as cyberbullying and the promotion of eating disorders, suicide and self-harm. This amendment will add existing offences from the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 relating to online flashing to the schedule of offence-specific harmful online content in the Bill. This amendment will enable the online safety commissioner to make binding online safety codes that will apply to designated online service providers that will require those providers to take measures to tackle online flashing. Without this amendment, online safety codes could not specifically refer to this type of harmful content online and an coimisiún would not be able to require online service providers to tackle it in terms of how they deal with complaints, how they deliver content and in terms of risk and impact assessments. These codes will apply to online services designated by an coimisiún on the basis of risk assessments and may include social media services, messaging services and videoconferencing services. It will remain the role of An Garda Síochána to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour. An coimisiún's role will be to be oversee the regulatory framework for online safety and hold designated online services accountable for their compliance with online safety codes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I believe we are replicating the wording of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017 in the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are not creating a new criminal offence. We are replicating the language that is used in the 2017 Act. The determination of whether an offence has been committed is made on the balance of probabilities. We are not creating a new offence.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That would be a matter for the Department of Justice to consider, not my Department. We are just providing for this to be harmful online content on the basis of what is set out in the 2017 Act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am not sure intention works the same way in legal terms as we might understand it in everyday terms. The amendment is replicating the language used in the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2017. We are not creating a new criminal offence. We are ensuring the issue can be tackled in the online world.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have to remember what I said at the very beginning. It will remain the role of An Garda Síochána to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour by an individual. The role of the coimisiún will be to oversee the regulatory framework. In the context of criminal proceedings, it would be a matter of being beyond reasonable doubt. Taking online content down will be ascertained on the balance of probability. There are two different things. It will remain the role of the Garda to investigate allegations of criminal behaviour. This is about the online content.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, this amendment seeks to replace the words “any neglect” in the phrase “the consent or connivance of, or to have been attributable to any neglect” in the provisions for senior management liability, where a provider of a designated online service commits an offence for failing to comply with a notice to end a contravention. I understand that some industry stakeholders have raised concerns that the liability standard of “any neglect” is too low and have sought to replace it with “wilful neglect”. I cannot accept this amendment for a number of reasons. It is important to note that the senior management liability provisions in the Bill can only be triggered as part of the following series of steps: an authorised officer investigation has been carried out; coimisiún na meán has determined that a contravention is occurring; the findings of an coimisiún have been confirmed by a court; an coimisiún has determined that a contravention is still occurring and has issued a notice to the provider of the designated online service to end the contravention; the provider of the designated online service has failed to comply with the notice and is being prosecuted for the offence by the Director of Public Prosecutions; and the Director of Public Prosecutions, independently to an coimisiún, seeks to prosecute a director or senior manager under the secondary liability provision. In this context, I think “any neglect” is appropriate. It was provided for in this way in light of, on the one hand, the extensive financial sanctioning powers in the Bill and, on the other, the need to provide a particular balance in a Bill that deals with media, user-generated content and fundamental rights such as freedom of expression. For context, I understand, and the Deputy raised this matter in his contribution, there are almost 1,500 references to the same liability standard in Irish law so this is not unique. In this Bill, in fact, the circumstances provided for wherein senior management liability may be triggered are quite narrow. Recent examples of its usage include the sanctions on Russia in light of its illegal invasion of Ukraine, building regulations, protected disclosure legislation, food safety regulations, domestic violence law and childcare laws. The Deputy referenced the UK's Law Commission report, but Ireland's Law Reform Commission report, Regulatory Powers and Corporate Offences, stated that this specific form of secondary liability "does not necessarily result in undue harshness to a defendant, particularly where in a corporate setting the processes and procedures required to meet the standard of negligence are within the peculiar knowledge of the senior managers and comparable agents".

This amendment will simply provide legal clarity in that regard. The geographical limits of any particular content limitation notice will depend on the kind of harmful online content being addressed and any associated national, EU or international law. For example, a content limitation notice ordering the removal of an item of content on the grounds that it constitutes a public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, which is an EU law, would have an EU-wide geographical reach. Under EU and international law and jurisprudence, this would already be required of coimisiún na meán when issuing a content limitation notice requiring, for example, an online service to remove or disable access to a particular item of harmful online content. Amendment No. 271 is a consequential renumbering.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 293:In page 126, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:“(b) by the insertion of the following definition after the definition of “free television service”;“ 'local sound broadcaster' means a person holding a sound broadcasting contract under section 63—(a) which is a contract for the provision of a sound broadcasting service in an area consisting of a part, but not the whole, of the State, and(b) which is not a contract under section 64 or 68(1)(b);”,”.The objective of the Government amendments in this grouping, namely, amendments Nos. 293, 295, 296, 298, 302, 303, 305 and 321, is to ensure that local sound broadcasters can avail of the scheme for professional journalistic practices that is being provided for in the Bill. The Bill as published would have restricted the scheme to community sound broadcasters. This scheme has been under consideration for some time, and I understand may have originated when Deputy Naughten was Minister, a fact I want to acknowledge today. The scheme formed part of the Broadcasting (Amendment) Bill 2019 introduced in the Oireachtas by the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, and was subsequently incorporated into this Bill. Amendment No. 293 inserts a definition of “local sound broadcaster” in order to give effect to the intention to extend the scheme to local broadcasters. In practice, the definition of "local" includes any contract for a sound broadcasting service in an area consisting of a part of the State. Accordingly, I emphasise that the use of term local includes holders of multi-county and regional sound broadcasting licences. These amendments will ensure that local broadcasters can avail of grant funding to provide training or professional development for persons employed by, or providing services to, the broadcaster in relation to promoting good professional journalistic practices.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I address all the amendments to which the Deputy has spoken? She mentioned amendment No. 300, which seeks to achieve the same objective as a Government amendment. Accordingly, I will not be accepting amendment No. 300. I have introduced that measure.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the rationale underpinning amendments Nos. 294, 299 and 301, which seek to make this scheme accessible to community television broadcasters. I agree with the Deputy that it is important to recognise the important role played by community television in this country. I will not accept those amendments today but I will consider them on Report Stage. I believe the objectives of amendment No. 297 are already addressed in the Bill. Amendment No. 304 seeks to require that the commission, in developing a scheme, should have regard to developing impartial journalism through the medium of Irish. In the context of this particular scheme, which is directed towards training in respect of good journalistic practice, I do not think it is necessary to make reference to the language medium in which journalism is provided to the public. However, while I do not accept the amendment, I agree with the objective of developing journalism through the medium of Irish. As the committee is aware, the report of the Future of Media Commission recommended the establishment of a platform-neutral media fund to support six new schemes. I secured €6 million in budget 2023 to set up two of those schemes for local democracy reporting and a court reporting scheme. My officials have commenced work on developing the broad parameters of the schemes and I have directed them to ensure that part of the funding is directed towards journalism in the Irish language.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I reply?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, as part the new schemes we are developing, I have directed my officials to ensure that part of the funding is ring-fenced for journalism in the Irish language.

CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We all strongly support measures to support the works of Irish artists and the creation of Irish art. Since I became Minister, annual funding for the Arts Council has risen from €100 million in 2020 to a record €130 million. This year, I launched the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, which will support 2,000 artists over three years. However, the proposed amendment appears to be contrary to European Union law. The proposed criteria for Irish cultural works offered in the amendment includes residence on the island of Ireland and supervision or control by producers on the island of Ireland. Those criteria would appear to be incompatible with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guaranteeing freedom of establishment and free movement of services and prohibit discrimination based on nationality. Notwithstanding the legal complexities I also have concerns regarding the practical implementation of the amendment. There is a potentially large outstanding catalogue of musical and audiovisual works that would be considered as Irish cultural works under the proposed amendment. The Arts Council would be required to devote considerable resources to assessing those works against the criteria suggested by the Deputy and providing certification. In the event of a rejection of a work for authentication by the council, there would also be a need for an appeals process. I fear that an attempt to implement this in practice would prove both highly contentious and time consuming with little benefit for Irish artists or art. For reasons of both legality and practicality, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 307 seeks to amend the requirement for a video-on-demand service to have a share of European works in its catalogue of not less than 30% to further require a minimum percentage of works in the Irish language, being 5% from 2031 and 10% from 2036. The requirement for a minimum share of 30% of European works is set out in Article 13(1) of the revised audiovisual media services directive, which is binding on all member states. The European Commission has published guidelines for member states regarding the method of calculating the share of European works in the catalogue of a video-on-demand service. Under section 159B(3) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, it will be for an coimisiún to make rules to determine whether video-on-demand services meet the European works quota. I expect it will be heavily informed by the guidance of the European Commission in that regard. I am aware that some member states have provided for a minimum quota for native language works in catalogues of video-on-demand services. For example, I understand that the legal instrument providing for the European works requirement in France, published last summer, included a requirement that 40% of works should be in the French language, subject to agreement between individual services and the French audiovisual regulator. In the Irish context such a requirement is complicated by two factors. First, there is a relatively small catalogue of audiovisual works in the Irish language as a percentage of all audiovisual works in other languages. We are attempting to address this through increased funding for TG4 and initiatives such as Cine4, which, of course, funded the beautiful "An Cailín Ciúin", but there is still much work to be done. I understand that the amendment sets out to partially address this by pushing out the imposition of a quota to 2031 and 2036, respectively. However, there remains the risk that a perverse effect of the amendment would be to force video-on-demand services to provide a relatively smaller catalogue to meet the 5% and 10% quotas. This would not be to the benefit of audiences. The second factor is the number of video-on-demand services that will be regulated in Ireland. Under the country-of-origin principle, those services established in Ireland would be regulated in Ireland for the entire EU. As drafted, the amendment would require those services to adopt the Irish language requirements for their catalogues. While this may have the potential, in the longer run, to be of the benefit to Irish audiences, it would not necessarily be in the interest of audiences in other member states. I cannot accept the amendment for that reason. Amendment No. 308 seeks to require an coimisiún, in making rules for the promotion of European works, to have regard to "the prominence of Irish language works in view of the national aim of restoring the Irish language as a spoken language and language of media nationwide". Given that I cannot accept amendment No. 307, I also cannot accept this amendment, which is consequential to amendment No. 307.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputies for their amendments, which seek to amend the provisions of the Bill relating to the content production levy and schemes. As the committee will be aware, Article 13.2 of the AVMSD provides an explicit legal basis for member states to levy media service providers that are under their jurisdiction or that are not under their jurisdiction but are targeting audiences in their territories for the purpose of funding European works. I have opted to take the opportunity offered by Article 13.2 of the directive to provide for the imposition of a content production levy on media service providers to fund content production schemes to support the production of European works. There was a lengthy debate on Committee Stage in the Seanad on both the content production levy and the scheme provisions of the Bill. I committed then to return to consider a number of matters on the Dáil debate on the Bill. In particular, I committed to examine whether express provision could be made to ensure that development activities could be funded through a scheme; to examine whether a certain minimum proportion of funds paid out under a scheme could be ring-fenced for "independent production companies"; and to examine whether provision could be made in respect of the allocation of rights ownership between independent production companies and media service providers. The Deputies have raised those three issues in their amendments and I intend to address them on Report Stage. In addition, as I indicated during the debate in the Seanad, I expect that coimisiún na meán and Screen Ireland will work closely together with a view to maximising the potential of content production schemes. Turning to the detail of the Deputies' amendments, amendment No. 309 seeks to require coimisiún na meán to impose a content production levy as soon as is practicable after establishment day. As I have said previously, it would not be prudent or advisable to impose a levy until a comprehensive study has been undertaken into the incidence, design and prospective revenue of any content production levy. That will allow coimisiún na mean to identify any unintended consequences that may arise from the levy and to outline clearly whether and how the incidence of the levy will ultimately fall on audiences and consumers of audiovisual media services. Given the many additional questions about the content production levy that coimisiún na meán will need to answer, I cannot accept the amendment. I understand that amendment No. 310 seeks to address a drafting error in the Bill, as published. It is an intention of the Bill that a content production scheme should be open to all prospective producers of European works. This error came to the attention of my officials shortly after the Bill was published and it was intended to address the issue when other Government amendments to the content production scheme were brought forward. Accordingly, while I do not intend to accept the Deputies' amendment today, I will table a Report Stage amendment to correct the error. I understand that the intention of amendment No. 311 is to ensure that funds provided under a content production scheme may be used to support "development" activities relating to a production. At present, section 159F(2)(d) of the Broadcasting Act, as inserted by the Bill, specifies a number of development activities that can be supported under a scheme. My preferred approach would be to amend that paragraph to provide absolute clarity that all stages of the development of an audiovisual programme may be funded under a scheme. I cannot, then, accept this amendment but will seek to clarify further on Report Stage that a content production scheme may include funding for development activities. Amendment No. 312 sets out additional detail in respect of the nature of programmes that could be funded under a scheme. It is unnecessary to specify that a content production scheme may fund feature films, animation, drama and documentaries. Section 159F(2) provides that a scheme may fund the production of audiovisual programmes, which captures all types of audiovisual content, including drama, films, animation and factual programmes. Amendment No. 312 also provides that a content production scheme would specifically support works that relate to the works of Irish creative talent. As I noted during Report Stage in the Seanad, the outstanding and defining quality of such works would appear to be that they are produced by, or involve the work of, Irish citizens. This carries the implication that those of Irish nationality would be given preference in any funding provided through a content production scheme. This would appear to be contrary to EU law as it would, on the face of it, place Irish citizens at an advantage over citizens or residents of other member states as regards a content production scheme and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. Amendment No. 313 seeks to amend a description of the kinds of audiovisual programmes that may be funded under a scheme by qualifying a reference to the experiences of the people of the island of Ireland such that it refers to "storytelling" experiences. The relevant paragraph of the Bill is intended to encompass experiences in the most expansive sense to facilitate the funding of the widest array of content. The effect of the proposed amendment would be to restrict the types of content that could be funded and, therefore, I do not intend to accept it. Amendment No. 314 seeks to require that 80% of the funding under a content production scheme would be ring-fenced for "independent production companies" and to provide for the prescription of a fair and equitable balance in rights ownership. Although I do not intend to accept the amendment, I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to provide for the ring-fencing of a certain proportion of funding for independent production companies. I am also examining the question of providing that coimisiún na meán could make a certain allocation of rights ownership a requirement for receipt of funding under the scheme. I thank the Deputies for their engagement and their amendments. Our positions on a number of the matters discussed are quite close. I look forward to tabling amendments to address those issues on Report Stage and to the debate that will ensue then.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The purpose of this amendment is to require coimisiún na meán to carry out research on the introduction of investment obligations on media service providers operating in the State. The amendment also provides that the Minister shall present draft legislation before the Houses of the Oireachtas outlining proposals for the introduction of investment obligations for audiovisual media service providers not later than six months following publication of the report. Before addressing the substance of the proposed amendment, I wish to note that it was determined that a content production levy was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context. As with the existing sound and vision scheme administered by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, the model envisaged in the Bill would allow producers to compete for funding on a transparent and competitive basis in line with objective criteria. This would not be the case with investment obligations, where decisions on the nature of content to be funded would sit with the company subject to the investment obligation. Furthermore, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe. Our approach in respect of the content production levy already ensures a minimum of 25% of funds raised must be allocated to the production of Irish language content. It is also worth noting that any investment obligation would have to be for the production of European works and not necessarily Irish content. Many major EU-based providers targeting Ireland would likely already fulfil that requirement through their existing investments, so there may not be a substantial net benefit to Ireland from such a measure. I do not propose to accept this amendment as I am of the view that section 7 of the Broadcasting Act as inserted by section 7 of this Bill will contain appropriate provisions to enable an coimisiún to carry out research in relation to this matter. I draw the Deputy’s attention to section 7(5)(d), which enables the commission to conduct strategic reviews on a number of matters including the funding of sector. I also note that the Minister will have the power under this provision to direct an coimisiún to carry out research on any matter connected to its functions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No. We decided to go with the content production levy. We thought that was the most appropriate approach in the Irish context.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The difference as well is what has been done in France is with individual providers whereas what we are doing here is with the sector as a whole.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, it was determined that the content production levy was the appropriate approach in the Irish context. As I said earlier, it is not possible under EU law to introduce an investment obligation based on a specific production location within Europe.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, that is to do with individual, whereas we are dealing with the sector as a whole.
