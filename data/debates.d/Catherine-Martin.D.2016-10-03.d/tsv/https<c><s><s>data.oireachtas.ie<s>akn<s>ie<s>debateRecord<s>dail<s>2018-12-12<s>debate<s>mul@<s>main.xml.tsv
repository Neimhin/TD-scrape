CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On behalf of the Green Party and on behalf of the Oireachtas women’s parliamentary caucus, I extend my deepest sympathies to the family, relatives and friends of Monica Barnes. Ba mhaith liom ómós a thabhairt do Mhonica Barnes, laoch pearsanta domsa agus bean a bhí ar an scoil chéanna liomsa. Mar Sheanadóir agus mar Theachta, las sí soilse do mhná sa pholaitíocht nuair a bhí sé an-deacair dúinn dul chun cinn a dhéanamh. Sa seacht mí ó cailleadh í tá cácas na mban ag dul ó neart go neart, agus tá rian agus oidhreacht Mhonica le braith iontu siúd. Monica was a towering figure, a woman who made a difference and left a lasting impression, a fearless advocate. It is crucial that we remember that she was a fearless advocate in a very different time, in a less kind Ireland, in what was at the time a judgmental Ireland. It was a completely different place. But it never deterred her pioneering voice from articulating in a most persuasive way what she believed in. On a personal note, I have lost a fellow past pupil from our shared alma mater in the Barony of Farney, namely, St. Louis secondary school in Carrickmacross. Monica travelled to school from the neighbouring town of Kingscourt, as did many of my school friends when I was a student in St. Louis. As a young pupil there, I found her inspirational and we were very proud that she was the first past pupil from our school to be elected to Dáil Éireann. The last time I spoke to Monica was in Áras an Uachtaráin on International Women’s Day this year, when we took a photo together to mark the fact that we were the two past pupils of St. Louis who were elected to the Dáil. When I established the Oireachtas women’s parliamentary caucus last year, Monica’s campaigning voice was ever present. More importantly, her belief and support were invaluable and unwavering in reminding us in the caucus that although we may have come far since her days in Leinster House and have increased our representation in the Oireachtas, there is a long way to go. While we have all lost a dear friend, the greatest tribute we can make to Monica is to continue her pioneering work for women. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis. On behalf of the Green Party, I wish to extend my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of Paddy Harte. I concur with the comments made by others. The President recently spoke of the State's at times selective amnesia but Paddy Harte was never in that category. In respect of true reconciliation, he was ahead of his time. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is nearly a year since the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government published the Safe as Houses report, which recommended that the Government set up a scheme to remediate legacy defects in residential buildings. The Dáil called for same when it passed a Green Party motion in June 2017. Some affected homeowners from my constituency in Dublin Rathdown are currently outside Leinster House, marking another year with no movement from the Government on this issue. When I raised the matter with the Taoiseach in October, he said that the Minister of State, Deputy English, was examining proposals and he admitted that there must be an understanding of the extent of the defects across the country so that such proposals could be drawn up. Has the Government made any moves towards investigating the extent of the latent defects in residential housing, with a view to drawing up a plan for practical State reliefs along the lines recommended in the Safe as Houses report and the Green Party motion on building standards or are the homeowners to remain abandoned by the Government?
