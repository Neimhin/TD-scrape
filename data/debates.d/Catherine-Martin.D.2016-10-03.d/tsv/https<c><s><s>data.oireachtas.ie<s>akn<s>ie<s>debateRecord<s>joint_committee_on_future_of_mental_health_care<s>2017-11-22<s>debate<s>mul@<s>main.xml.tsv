CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The witness said the HSE had invested significantly. Could I have that figure? Can the witnesses provide a breakdown of expenditure on out-of-area placements and agency staff in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 please? Can I have a breakdown of last year's mental health expenditure in CAMHS, general health and old age psychiatry by community health care organisation? If there is no time to answer all these questions, I would like the answers in written form.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will the division please provide a breakdown for the 2018 mental health budget, including the 2018 development funding? Will the witnesses let me know how and why these areas were identified for investment? The 2017 HSE mental health operation plan commits to reviewing existing out-of-hours services, exploring ways to improve 24-7 crisis intervention arrangements and considering pilot sites. It makes commitments on the development of out-of-hours mental health supports being included in the HSE mental health operation plans since 2014. In February of this year, the then Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, Deputy Helen McEntee, publicly stated that work was under way on a roadmap for the development of out-of-hours access to mental health services. Has the HSE completed this work? When did the HSE complete the work? When will the roadmap be published? Has a budget been identified for its implementation? Has any funding been allocated to the exploration and design of evidence-based psychological resilience building programmes in our schools, even on a pilot basis? There is extensive research from other countries showing that certain strategies taught in schools can leave children less vulnerable to mental illness. This is not to take away from the well-being policy being implemented in the new junior certificate. Are we being specific about psychological interventions based on psychological research, which indicates that early intervention is key? Has any consideration been given by the HSE to establishing a team of appropriately trained psychotherapists or psychologists dedicated specifically to schools? There are some teachers who are trained as psychotherapists. NEPS is under-resourced and such a team would take the pressure off it. Has any research been done on this by the division? Has a budget been identified to implement this?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In that case, if my last question is being moved to next week, I will ask a different question on funding. Could I have a breakdown of expenditure in the following areas in the past three years: mental health and intellectual disability, dual diagnosis of addiction and mental health difficulties, mental health services for people experiencing homelessness, and mental health services for minority groups?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am also concerned with working towards a national view. We need a national view. What exactly does Ms O'Connor mean when she says the HSE is working towards the national view? It worries me that the witnesses are saying that services within schools are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills because there is a huge problem with the lack of joined-up thinking. There is a need for Departments to communicate and link up with each other. One cannot say that the issue of children suffering with mental health issues belongs in one box, which is the Department of Education and Skills, and that the HSE can take a hands-off approach. It is not acceptable. The HSE must take responsibility for it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is also the question of agency staff from 2013 to 2017.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is there a timeframe for the breakdown the witnesses are going to provide to us? Will we have it for next week? Will it include mental health and intellectual disability dual diagnosis, homeless and minority groups? The witness has said that information is not readily available today, which beggars belief. With respect, when they were coming in to this committee dealing with funding, did the witnesses not foresee that we might want that information? Surely this is not the first time this information has been sought. I would say practically every member here has submitted parliamentary questions and written to the HSE. I really am struggling with how the witnesses were not ready for that today. Even in this DÃ¡il, have the two Ministers of State who have held responsibility for mental health sought that breakdown from the HSE at any stage? Have they asked where that money is being spent and how?
