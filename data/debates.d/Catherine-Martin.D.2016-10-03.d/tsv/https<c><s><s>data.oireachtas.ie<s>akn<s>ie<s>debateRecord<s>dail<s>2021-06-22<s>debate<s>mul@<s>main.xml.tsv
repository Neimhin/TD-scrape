CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Pilot events are necessary as proof of concept for the safe management of events while Covid-19 is still circulating in our communities and to evaluate and build confidence in the Covid-19 guidance and event management protocols developed by the culture and sports sectors. The pilot events will use a range of measures to militate against Covid-19, including reduced attendances, social distancing, mask wearing, hand sanitising, contact tracing, the careful management of ingress and egress of audiences and spectators, and appropriate ventilation for indoor events. I sought these pilot events as I am determined to see a safe reopening of our live music sector as soon as possible. Neither my Department nor I had indicated an intention to use antigen testing at the Iveagh Gardens event, although I am aware that the National Concert Hall has employed antigen testing for staff and performers in the past. The Department has been monitoring pilot events internationally and is aware of the role that testing can play in supporting activities. As the Deputy will be aware, I announced today that antigen testing will be deployed for the forthcoming concert event at the Irish Museum of Modern Art on 3 July. Some 3,500 fans will be in attendance, 500 of whom will be healthcare workers. Some of Ireland's best talent will be performing on stage, talent we have all so greatly missed seeing live in this past year. It should be noted that in addition to the pilot events, from 7 June numbers permitted at organised outdoor events have increased to a maximum of 100 for the majority of venues, with a maximum of 200 for outdoor stadia and venues where there is a minimum capacity of 5,000. The measures being employed will be reviewed for their appropriateness as pilot events proceed and will be adjusted as necessary and if necessary. They will allow sports, arts, culture and entertainment organisations to test necessary control measures and other measures in venues across a range of settings and have been designed to inform the safe reopening of these sectors. They will be subject to ongoing review including with respect to the prevailing public health situation. I have never been unwilling to publish the minutes of the meetings of the live entertainment working group and am happy to supply those to the Deputy, should he so wish.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are still a number of test events to take place, as outlined last month when we announced that events would take place in various indoor and outdoor venues. Today's announcement of antigen testing and reduced social distancing shows that progress is being made. The reason this was not the case with the Iveagh Gardens event was because it was the first pilot event. As the Deputy will know from his knowledge of this sector, it is not a question of switching it on overnight. These are venues that have not been in operation for over 15 months and are now working in the context of Covid-19. The first event was really about the logistics of simple things like staggered entrance and egress and social distancing. We learned from that and we are moving to 1 m social distancing. Progress is being made. We will complete the pilot events as set out a few weeks ago in the Government announcement. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that in my engagement with the sector, I am determined for it to reopen. I will, of course, have to be guided by the public health guidance at that time.We are making progress and will reopen as soon as possible.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I think we are all in agreement that we want there to be a return to economically viable live performances as soon as possible, and there are many reasons to be optimistic. Even today, the hospitalisation and ICU numbers are very positive. I fully appreciate the lead-in times in planning and delivering events. However, I cannot give a definite timeframe for when this will happen. What I can give is my assurance that I will continue to work with colleagues in the Government and with the sector to bring certainty as soon as possible. I am fully aware that in the case of venues working at reduced capacity, while it is good to have a return to live music, it is not viable. That is why I secured in the national economic recovery plan a commitment that as long as venues are working with reduced capacity and social distancing due to restrictions, the many supports that have been rolled out will remain in place for the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The reopening of the country and the economy has been happening gradually over June and I look forward to further reopening in July and beyond. Tourism accommodation and outdoor dining, tourism attractions and activities have reopened and, subject to satisfactory progress with the health situation, more indoor activities will reopen in July.  The Government has supported businesses through the closure in particular with initiatives such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS and the Fáilte Ireland tourism business continuity scheme and is now assisting them in their reopening. While the CRSS and the tourism business continuity scheme have addressed fixed costs, the EWSS has been crucial in maintaining employment and the link between employer and employee. Its continuation was one of the key asks of the sector and the Government has committed to its maintenance until the end of 2021 in the economic recovery plan. I know the reopening is very welcome but I also know it brings a number of challenges, especially in reconnecting with employees.  Tourism brings employment to many parts of the country that have limited alternative job opportunities. That said, I am aware of the reports of difficulties in rehiring workers. After such a long period of closure it is not surprising there are difficulties restarting, especially if workers have moved location or taken up other employment. I also understand the caution some employees may feel about their safety, as well as concern about potential future closures.  That is why the Government has taken a cautious and staggered approach to reopening to, as far as possible, avoid backward steps. Thankfully, building on the high uptake in vaccination, we are still on track to deliver our plans for July and I hope this will give people confidence to return to work.  Prior to the pandemic, tourism and hospitality accounted for approximately 260,000 jobs and Fáilte Ireland was very active in the issue of skills development in the sector. The tourism recovery task force made a number of recommendations to enhance sustainable employment in the tourism sector to support both its survival and recovery. This includes the development of a national tourism education gateway as a one-stop shop to education for all tourism employees. My Department is working closely with the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to progress these recommendations. As the Deputy may be aware, labour law and workplace conditions are a matter for my colleague, An Tánaiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not believe the PUP is a disincentive to returning to work. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has shown in its recent study that 95% of workers would be better off back at work. The PUP was an effective response to unemployment brought about the pandemic. The best way to secure the future of the industry and workers' incomes is to facilitate a safe and sustainable reopening that secures employment and income in the longer term. The tourism and hospitality sector, as the Deputy is aware, is a large employer. It is not surprising, after such a long period of closure, there are difficulties restarting, especially if workers have moved or taken up other employment. I understand the caution employees may feel about the future and their concern about potential future closures. The best way to address that is to support workers and businesses to help them get back to normal trading.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy said, I am aware staff retention is an issue and am delighted Fáilte Ireland is delivering on a number of strategies and is working closely with the industry, education providers and other State agencies to address the recruitment and retention challenges in the tourism sector. A recruitment for reopening webinar event was delivered on 30 April for tourism and hospitality businesses and more than 1,000 businesses registered for this event. Each business received a toolkit to support the recruitment challenges, including sourcing opportunities. A social media campaign is live for the tourism sector and is targeting jobseekers on both Facebook and Instagram. A schedule of targeted content will run through the summer on Fáilte Ireland's tourism career websites. State agencies, such as SOLAS, through the education and training boards are delivering new sector-specific support, on their skills to advance programmes in conjunction with industry, with a number of higher education institutes continuing to develop new Springboard courses and deliver additional skills. These programmes received funding as part of the human capital initiative to retain and regain qualified staff. I reiterate that labour law and workplace conditions are a matter for my colleague, An Tánaiste, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. He also is keen to make progress on the living wage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I understand Question No. 61 will be taken with Question No. 98, I specifically am asking for the details of the independent arts evaluation organisation tasked with carrying out the monetary and evaluation framework of Galway 2020. Tied in with that, I am asking for details of the legacy initiatives from Galway 2020. I am aware that a meeting was held as far back as November 2020 on the legacy details. Can the Minister update me on that?
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 98 together.The Audience Agency is the independent arts evaluation organisation tasked with carrying out the evaluation under the Galway 2020 monitoring and evaluation framework. The Audience Agency was awarded the contract following a competitive tender process advertised on etenders.gov.ie. The Audience Agency is a registered charity. It is funded by Arts Council England as a cultural sector support organisation. It is an experienced and internationally recognised monitoring and evaluation organisation whose mission is to enable cultural organisations to use data to increase their relevance, reach and resilience. The monitoring and evaluation framework, developed in consultation with stakeholders, including my Department, provides for a review of Galway 2020 project in terms of how it developed Galway’s cultural capacity, delivered the programme rooted in people and place; and the social and economic benefit accruing. The final monitoring and evaluation report, scheduled for delivery in quarter 4 this year, will include results on the number of cultural organisations supported, the jobs created to deliver the programme, new projects commissioned, events held, audience numbers and a breakdown of the total income and expenditure. It is not within the remit of the monitoring and evaluation framework report to carry out an audit of Galway 2020 finances. Galway 2020, as a registered company and charity, complies with all statutory and regulatory reporting requirements set out under the Companies Act 2014 and the Charities Act 2009, including the annual lodging of an audited financial statement with the Companies Registration Office and the Charities Regulator.  On the question of Galway 2020 legacy initiatives, Galway 2020 will, in the coming months, commence a focused stakeholder consultation process with creative, community, business, Government and European stakeholders. This consultation process, together with the report from the monitoring and evaluation framework, will inform the development of a sustainable strategic legacy plan for Galway 2020. This legacy plan is due to be finalised before the end of the year. The remaining €1 million from my Department's overall funding commitment of €15 million for Galway 2020 will contribute to the implementation of the legacy plan.Galway 2020 supported a wide range of local artists and cultural organisations to create, develop and deliver original works. Close to €15 million or 66% of the overall expenditure of €22 million to date by Galway 2020 on delivery of its year as European Capital of Culture has been spent on cultural programme delivery. Over 500 events employing at least 600 artists and other cultural professionals, such as producers, technicians and crew, have been delivered. Cultural project partners are in the process of completing individual post-project evaluations. Artists and cultural organisations funded included Druid Theatre, Branar children’s theatre company, Ealaín na Gaeltachta, Galway Theatre Festival, Blue Teapot Theatre Company, Galway Community Circus, Baboró children’s festival, Trish Forde, Galway Film Fleadh, Ríonach Ní Néill, NUIG Aistriú, Galway International Arts Festival, Macnas, Music for Galway, Galway Dance Project, Máirtín O’Connor, Galway UNESCO City of Film, Galway hospital trust and Galway City Museum. The data from post-project evaluations are being collated to provide comprehensive information on key project deliverables for each artist or cultural organisation, including income and expenditure, numbers employed, numbers of events held, level of audience engagement, partnerships developed, outcomes and possible legacy opportunities. This information will be used to inform the overall monitoring and evaluation framework for Galway 2020. That will be delivered in quarter 4 this year. As an indication of the level of delivery, I can advise that the seven post-project evaluations completed document that 374 artists and other culture professionals were supported to deliver 188 combined live and online performances and Galway Community Circus, as part of its projects, delivered 93 professional and 95 public training workshops.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will supply the information the Deputy seeks in relation to the extra notes. The legacy planning is a key element of all European Capitals of Culture and an important aspect, as the Deputy pointed out, of Galway 2020. Legacy planning involves taking stock of learnings from the delivery of the European Capital of Culture, incorporating the successes and building on these for the future. The Galway 2020 monitoring evaluation report and stakeholder consultation will be initiated later in the summer and will feed into the development of the strategic legacy plan. Galway 2020 is working with a number of upcoming European Capitals of Culture on initiatives, such as the inclusion of projects from Galway 2020 in their programmes, thereby creating additional opportunities for Galway 2020 artists to foster sustainability in their careers and contributing further to meeting the objectives of the European Capital of Culture programme. The performance delivery agreement between my Department and Galway 2020 was signed on 6 November 2018 and addresses the roles and responsibilities of the Department and Galway 2020 in the provision and expenditure of the grant as well as key deliverables and performance indicators attached to the drawdown of the grant. That agreement will expire on 1 July 2021. While this is under discussion, the agreement will likely be extended to year end, at least. On the Deputy's query about costs, I can get back to her. I think she may have another question. I am happy to talk to her afterwards.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of questions there. It will be difficult for me to answer them in the minute available but I am happy to provide the Deputy with all the information she wants and to be as transparent as possible. I absolutely agree about the basic income guarantee for artists. A legacy and lesson to learn from Covid and from what we missed and enjoyed in Galway 2020 will be to support the arts. On the An Post building, the redevelopment of the site is a matter for Galway City Council and An Post. The site is in the city centre and includes the city’s central post office and a number of buildings behind it that housed a former telephone exchange and now defunct sorting and storing offices. One of the vacant buildings in the complex on a laneway off the street was repurposed by the Galway International Arts Festival in 2019 and used as a temporary art gallery. A number of arts organisations participating in Galway 2020 used it for rehearsals. Under the An Post plan announced at the end of March 2021, a property developer will refurbish the existing post office, create a civic space and be free to use the rest for retail and commercial units. It is intended that, while An Post will still own the land, the redevelopment will be on a very long lease.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As part of a €50 million suite of supports for the live entertainment sector, the music and entertainment business assistance scheme opened for applications on 9 June. This scheme aims to support businesses operating solely in the live entertainment sector that do not qualify for other business supports and have been significantly impacted by Covid restrictions. This scheme will see support offered by way of three levels of once-off, flat payments: €2,500 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of between €20,000 and €50,000 with minimum business costs of €3,000 incurred from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021; €4,000 for businesses with a VAT-exclusive turnover of between €50,001 and €100,000 with minimum business costs of €6,000 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021; and €5,000 for businesses with VAT-exclusive turnover in excess of €100,000 with minimum business costs of €7,500 from 1 April 2020 to 31 May 2021. Businesses, whether sole traders, partnerships or incorporated entities operating exclusively within the live entertainment sector may apply. Businesses of musicians and singers of all genres are eligible to apply, as are sound engineers, lighting engineers, audio engineers, stage managers, stage technicians, sound and lighting equipment suppliers, live-streaming equipment suppliers and full-time disc jockeys. The scheme was designed to reach out and provide support for those who have not been supported to date. It should be noted that this scheme is not a horizontal income support and grants are intended to provide a contribution towards business costs. The scheme was developed in consultation with the sector and the eligibility criteria aim to strike an appropriate balance, having regard to other available supports and the need to reach as many professional musicians and crew as possible. To date, just over 300 applications have been submitted for the scheme. Of these, approximately 50 have been approved and three have been unsuccessful. All details in respect of this scheme, including guidelines and the MEBAS application portal, can be accessed on my Department's website.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy and I assure him I am doing everything I possibly can. I come from this background myself and I am very much aware of the need not just for us to hear and enjoy music but for these people to get back to work. It is not just the musicians but the technicians, the crew and everyone behind the scenes. That is one of the lessons that has been learned because a light has been shone on those who work behind the scenes and how they need to be supported. The recent development has been the securing of the number one recommendation of the arts and culture recovery task force in that I have received agreement from my coalition partners and Cabinet agreement to pilot the basic income guarantee. We have to look to the future and place value on artists by looking at how we can support them beyond Covid. The pilot events I am rolling out at present in music are all about establishing that safe pathway back to work. As the Deputy knows, I today announced an event for 3 July, where 3,500 fans will attend, 500 of whom will be healthcare workers, and which will involve antigen testing and reduced social distancing.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. The live performance support scheme is unprecedented. It shows that a sector that never had to reach out before had to reach out, and we responded with €50 million in supports, including €25 million in the live performance support scheme that was announced last week. That will supply thousands of hours of work to thousands of performers and technical staff. On the Deputy’s query in regard to when we will get singers outdoors at those licensed premises, the Deputy may be aware that I have raised with my Cabinet colleagues that those regulations be reviewed because I want to get them performing again. As many Members have said in the House, and I firmly believe it, the best support we can give to our musicians is to get them back performing again, and that is my goal.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The tourism sector has been severely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and the necessary public health restrictions introduced to control it. Since my appointment as Minister, I have been fully engaged with stakeholders in seeking to identify and implement supports to ensure the sector’s survival and sustainable recovery. Until now, the focus has been on the survival phase. The Tourism Recovery Plan 2020-2023, submitted by the tourism recovery task force last year, continues to be an important consideration for me, as well as my colleagues in the Government, as we continue to evaluate additional measures to support the recovery of the sector. It has informed many of the measures introduced to date which support the tourism sector.  The sector-specific measures I have introduced, together with the horizontal supports available, have been critical for helping tourism businesses and employees through the pandemic.  There are recommendations aimed at the stabilisation and recovery phase in the recovery plan, with an emphasis on sustainability. These include the development of a suite of actions to promote the sustainable development of tourism and that these actions in turn will underpin the development of a sustainable tourism policy to be adopted by Government. A sustainable tourism working group set up under the aegis of my Department published guiding principles for sustainable tourism development at the end of 2019. An ambition in it states, "Ireland will seek to be amongst the world-leaders in sustainable tourism practices". Earlier this year, in order to maintain momentum on the sustainable tourism agenda, I reconvened this working group to complete the development of a set of actions that promote sustainable tourism practices which can be implemented prior to a new national tourism policy being developed. I expect to receive the group's final report shortly. It will outline the steps that can be taken to promote sustainable tourism practices in the short term. Following this, I will instruct my officials to initiate the development of a new national tourism policy later in the year. This policy will mainstream sustainability, rather than having it as an additional consideration. I want the recovery in the tourism sector over the coming years to be sustainable in environmental, social and economic terms.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I encourage every Member of this House to slow down and enjoy the wonderful sights across our country, to promote staycations and to support a sector that has been ravaged due to the pandemic. Sustainable development in tourism means using, without exploitation, our cultural and other tourist resources, to preserve them for future use by future generations. This means that tourism can be a positive, as the Deputy would understand, for local communities, as well as being economically sustainable. It means longer stays and tapping into all the resources in a community during those stays. We must seek to realise Ireland's ambition to be among world leaders in sustainable tourism practices. We are well placed to be a world leader. Development of the new policy I mentioned earlier will set out the path for the coming years, which will support sustainable recovery and the subsequent regrowth. The Deputy mentioned Waterford. It has been a leader in sustainable tourism activities, especially the greenway from Dungarvan to Waterford city, which has been an exemplar for other cycle routes across the country. It is a testament to the determination and co-operation locally.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Sustainable low-impact activities, such as that Waterford greenway, provide a high return and show the potential to bring economic activity to local communities such as Kilmacthomas. A week ago, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Bill 2021 got amazing support in this House. It will establish a legally binding framework for clear targets and commitments set out in law to ensure we achieve our national, EU and international climate goals and obligations in the near and long term. Every sector needs to play its part. I am confident that our tourism sector will be a strong participant in achieving these legally binding targets. Ireland's commitment to pursue a climate-neutral economy will help us to realise the ambition that we spoke about earlier to become a world leader in sustainable tourism practices. These objectives are consistent with the EU climate ambition and the United Nations 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Ireland has a reputation for being the Emerald Isle internationally. Sustaining and nurturing this real green image through the adoption of sustainable tourism practices is an important underpinning for the recovery and future tourism growth.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While the aviation sector is of critical importance in terms of the recovery of our tourism sector, the responsibility for aviation falls to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. Accordingly, matters such as the closure of an airline come under the remit of his Department.  As an island nation, Ireland relies heavily on air transportation for tourism purposes. Maintaining and growing direct, competitive and convenient access to the island of Ireland is of critical importance to our tourism sector.  The air access landscape has profoundly changed since the outbreak of Covid-19 and it may be several years before air capacity returns to the levels seen in 2019. For our tourism sector, strong air and sea access links are vital. The restoration of air connectivity will be essential to restoring growth in overseas tourism to Ireland. I am keenly aware of the particular importance of regional connectivity and the importance of our regional airports to the regions they serve.  Stobart Air had the contract for operating Government-supported PSO air services on two routes between Dublin and the airports of Kerry and Donegal. The recent termination of its franchise agreement with Aer Lingus had immediate implications for both PSO services. I understand that the Department of Transport has initiated an emergency procurement process with a view to restoring air services linking Dublin with Donegal and Kerry airports.  The Minister for Transport hopes that this process will be completed by early July with a view to services recommencing by the new operator as soon as possible thereafter. The contract will be subject to a maximum term of seven months and will operate in accordance with EU law.   In light of Government restrictions on travel, load factors on these routes had been very low since the onset of the pandemic.  Accordingly, the interim impact of this event on tourism in the regions of Kerry and Donegal is expected to be very small given that replacement services will be restored in the coming weeks in conjunction with the resumption of international travel on 19 July. I will continue to work closely with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and my colleagues across Government to support the restoration of direct connectivity to and within Ireland.
