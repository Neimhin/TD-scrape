CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As it stands, the legislation putting rent pressure zones in place will expire at the end of the year. Although the zones have not by any means brought rent affordability to where it should be, they have, at least, had an impact in keeping rents in the areas worst hit by rental increases closer to being under control. However, there has been no definitive indication by the Government as to whether it intends to renew the rent pressure zone legislation at the end of the year or under what set of circumstances it would so do. Many people would face enormous rent hikes if the zones lapsed and they are living with that uncertainty. I would be grateful if the TÃ¡naiste would clarify the intentions of the Government in this area.
