CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Go raibh míle maith agat a Chathaoirligh. Tá an-áthas orm fáiltiú ar ais roimh an gcoiste chun tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne a phlé. The Minister of State and I are delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee on strategic priorities for tourism, culture, arts, sport and media. The Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community will address Gaeltacht priorities. Last November when my Department's sectors were among those most seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis, I spoke to the committee about my priorities and the vital importance of these sectors to Irish society, our individual and community well-being and our national economy. I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society. With it, our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead. I am also delighted to see audiences back at arts, culture and event venues and I welcome the full return of fans to our sports grounds. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that there are factors casting a shadow over the recovery, not least the devastating war in Ukraine as well as rising inflation in our economy and internationally. A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, so that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery. I draw the committee’s attention to a number of important developments in relation to these sectors. This year, for tourism, I have allocated an increase of €67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation. The increased funding will facilitate a further €50 million provision to assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until inbound tourism recovers. There is a €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund in 2022 to support marketing strategy and restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Further to the economic recovery plan published last year, the Government decided to extend the VAT rate reduction to the end of February 2023. This extension covers the same goods and services as the original measure, including restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres and museums. I was pleased to announce details of a €50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022. This included a further strand of the live performance supports scheme as well as the €15 million live performance restart grant scheme, which opened for applications in March. The Arts Council provides the vital investment needed to protect artists' livelihoods, support arts organisations, develop audiences and nurture young people’s engagement with and appreciation of the arts. Maintaining the record €130 million allocation for 2022 allows the Arts Council to fund events and festivals in across Ireland while nurturing excellence. From the earliest days of the pandemic, the dramatic realisation of the true intrinsic value of the arts provides an imperative for maintaining funding to the arts. With regard to my Department's capital programme, the programme for Government makes strong commitments for continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure. Ireland's tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits regional development. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. The Department and Fáilte Ireland are continuing to collaborate with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.I am continuing to liaise with the recovery oversight group in respect of the tourism recovery plan and issues affecting the sector. Work is also ongoing on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years and ensure that sustainability is at the heart of recovery in the sector. This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment which includes investment in activity-based tourism. There has been much recent discussion about the costs and availability of key components of the tourism sector, such as hotels and car rental. While I recognise that businesses in the sector are grappling with increased input costs and that increased demand leads to an increase in prices, it is essential that all businesses in the sector are mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its value-for-money proposition as a tourism destination. Evidence of excessive charges and prices for tourists, both domestic and overseas, has the potential to cause reputational damage for Ireland. Furthermore, any negative impact could derail the positive recovery in that sector. We must work together to ensure that our céad míle fáilte and good value continues. The tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable. With the climate emergency as our backdrop, the future we imagine is one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty. Last year, the arts and culture recovery task force submitted its report, Life Worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors. We have made significant progress on implementing the report. I was especially pleased to announce €25 million in budget 2022 for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022, as part of the three-year pilot’s investment of €105 million. Applications closed on the 12 May with close to 9,000 applications received. Under this scheme 2,000 artists and creative arts workers will be provided with €325 per week for three years. I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector and that it will provide an important legacy for our artists. In February, Government also agreed in principle that the Creative Ireland programme will continue for a further five years to encompass the period 2023 to 2027 and will focus on the following pillars: creative youth; creative communities; creative industries; creative health and well-being and creative climate action and sustainability. The report of the night-time economy task force was published in 2021 and contained a number of practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy, with some pilot measures to support new developments in this area. A robust implementation structure has been agreed to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, which has the flexibility to react to new ideas and developments as work progresses. In tandem with these developments, we continue to commemorate in a meaningful and respectful way, the events that shaped the foundation of the state, as part of the decade of centenaries programme. The all-party committee, which I established to contribute to the commemorations programme, is working proactively with me as we come to the closing years of the centenary commemorations, with a number of significant events scheduled over the coming years. It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content. Some examples from budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional €4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which was the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the €5.5 million allocated for the establishment of the coimisiún na meán. I was glad also to be in a position to provide increased funding to the sound and vision scheme which will be allocated this year, to support the production of high quality television and radio content, including a special round to address climate action and climate change. With regard to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I also thank the committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report with regard to the general scheme of the Bill. The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill. To address one of the key recommendations of the report, I established an expert group to examine the possibility of providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. I have now received the report of the group and am considering its recommendations. It is a priority to ensure swift progress of the Bill through the legislative process, with a view to having it enacted as soon as possible. While this is subject to the scheduling of each stage of the legislative process in each House of the Oireachtas, I will urge all Members to work closely with me to expedite its passage, especially against the backdrop of infringement proceedings which are being taken against Ireland in respect of the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive. The enactment of the legislation, without delay, is critical to avoiding significant penalties. In parallel with the passage of the legislation, my Department is working with the Public Appointments Service with a view to shortly commencing an executive search for the key roles in coimisiún na meán including that of online safety commissioner. The establishment of an coimisiún will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to allow me to implement many of the recommendations in the report of the Future of Media Commission, which will be brought to Government shortly. I am sure committee members will agree that all of these measures are critical. I look forward to ongoing cross-party engagement on this important agenda, where I envisage we will require a rolling suite of legislation to address the effective regulation of this hugely important and influential sector. Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and our democracy. As Minister, I will continue to advocate strongly for these sectors as we emerge from a very difficult period. I am happy to take any questions members may have. Is cúis mhór áthais dom deis a fháil labhairt leis an gcoiste inniu.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy, who has raised a significant, highly topical and current issue. As the committee is aware, there are significant cost inflation pressures for businesses, including tourism, at present but nonetheless, as the Deputy has said, Ireland has well-known attractions, many of which are in the Deputy’s own constituency. I think of the beautiful Carlingford which I go to myself and other places which again and again bring visitors back. It is very important that businesses consider both their pricing levels and the added value and extras that they offer to help keep that reputation and that overall good-value proposition and competitiveness. It is important that we attract back customers time and again and that their experience is one where they want to return. On the hotel pricing issue, the 2022 rebound in the Irish tourism sector is very strong and stronger than expectations. It could actually reach two thirds of the 2019 levels. This has been helped by that stronger than anticipated recovery in air connectivity, as the 2022 peak summer access will be back to 90% of 2019 levels.  April occupancy levels in Dublin hotels reached over 83% and the expectation is that the equivalent figure for May will be 90% or more. Dublin is currently seeing at least 10% higher occupancy than cities such as London, Rome or Amsterdam. No one thought that would happen so soon. There is strong customer demand on the ground with a great deal of deferred travel, which is the key part here. There is also the wedding activity, which is putting a real squeeze on available accommodation. Other key domestic factors are also back in play now as we, thankfully, see the resumption of large concerts and matches. We are seeing increasing numbers of those anecdotal reports of excessively high prices in the hotel sector and the Deputy has given examples there in this regard. Whether these reports are reflective of the general market or of the prices that are being sought online for remaining rooms is somewhat moot because, as the Deputy has noted, such reports can have a really negative impact on our reputation as a visitor destination. As I have said, I am very aware that businesses, including tourism businesses, are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors and the hotel-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am just saying that the hotel sector faces a range of challenges, in common with the wider economy, such as the sizeable increase in the cost of key inputs and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining key skills. These challenges are not unique to Ireland. They are shared by many countries around the world. It is very important that Ireland retains its reputation as a value-for-money destination. That reputation cannot be threatened. Value is not just about the price you pay; it is about what you get for the price too.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are two parts to that. There is ongoing engagement with the officials. The hospitality and tourism forum that the Tánaiste and I co-chair will be meeting again. That is a good forum to address the issues. There has been engagement already, but my officials will be meeting with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation tomorrow to consider how value for money can be maintained and how to restrain excessive pricing and ensure that visitors continue to feel that this is a place they want to return in the context of obtaining value for money. The reduced VAT rate applies to a wide range of businesses that need to be considered in addition to the hospitality sector, which are trying to rebuild. They have had a stressful two years. They include catering, restaurant supply companies, cinemas, caterers and museums. The Deputy knows the type of businesses that are on the list. Nonetheless, no potential options should be off the table, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to the protection of the value-for-money perception relating to Irish tourism. That is a critical priority in the years ahead. I think that addresses Deputy Munster's question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There are a number of questions there.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	What I can say on the future of the media commission is that the discussions are ongoing and a number of Ministers are involved in the report. I continue to talk to the Taoiseach about the issue. I would like to see the matter brought to a conclusion shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Senator knows, the commission was established jointly by me and the Taoiseach. It deals with matters that go beyond the remit of my Department, which is the reason a number of Ministers have been involved in key discussions. That process will come to a conclusion shortly. The programme of work regarding coimisiún na meán is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise needed to lead an coimisiún and to carry out the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. That includes managing the transition of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, staff and functions to an coimisiún while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulations. I touched on the matter a little bit last night in the Seanad. The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage an coimisiún is a priority. Work is under way with my officials and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of those staff. I may have indicated this last night in the Seanad. That includes the executive chairperson and an online safety commissioner. The recruitment will be done through open, transparent and effective public competitions.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to the regional co-operative marketing fund, Tourism Ireland promotes regional air and sea access to Ireland in overseas tourism markets. A total of €3 million has been allocated to Tourism Ireland in 2022 for the regional co-operative marketing fund. This scheme will continue to form a very important part of Tourism Ireland's plan. The Senator's next question is on Airbnb.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is on Housing for All.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The officials are working in consultation with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Fáilte Ireland on scoping out the legislative provisions that will be required to underpin the system outlined in Housing for All. This is with a view to bringing forward legislative provisions in this regard later in 2022.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No decision has been made on what the Cabinet might or might not do. Nothing has been decided on that. The first stage will be to bring it to the Cabinet. I am happy to discuss the publication of the report with members. The Senator has said we will bring forward a set of proposals.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No such decision has been taken.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The report covers a wide range. The approach the Cabinet will take has not been decided yet. We are still discussing the report with a small number of Ministers. No decision has been taken on the approach that will be taken.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am always happy to discuss any policy matters with the committee. We will see what will happen upon the publication of the report, but I am always available and I hope the committee members see that from the interaction-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am happy to discuss any policy matters with the committee members. Regarding local media, I am conscious of this matter. Another reason to move ahead with establishing coimisiún na meán concerns the supports needed for local media.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is a matter I have been considering for some time, but I received the expert group report just this morning. I will have to give it close consideration. The Senator's question is timely. As the Senator can imagine, it is a substantial report because it is a detailed body of work. I am now going to examine the recommendations in detail. In that context, I will be consulting my Cabinet colleagues and the Office of the Attorney General in considering whether and what amendments are required to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil, as I said. Therefore, the report is with me as of today.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I intend to publish the report.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I missed the Senator’s last question. I apologise.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will take the question on the Future of Media Commission first, because I have already addressed it. It is our intention to publish that shortly. We are having final meetings about it with the Ministers. As for the basic income for artists scheme, it is the case that I have no statutory function in social welfare means tests. That is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. The participation of artists with disabilities is a matter that I take very seriously. I have sought to ensure that all artists, including those who have a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot. Helplines were established for them so that they could see if they would be impacted. We are encouraging everyone to apply. A key research question that will arise from this entire basic income scheme process will be around the impact that such a payment could have on artists with disabilities. To that end, I was determined since the outset of the basic income for artists scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate. We therefore worked closely with the Department of Social Protection to enable their earnings to be treated as earnings from self-employment and to be taken into account in respect of the earnings disregards that apply to many social welfare payments. That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income that a person in receipt of social welfare payments earns from employment. Not all disabled artists are on social welfare supports, but for those who are dependent on income supports, the issue to which we have referred relates primarily to the manner in which social welfare schemes assess income from other sources. Again, eligibility for social welfare is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, this is all shining a necessary light on this. This will be a key piece that will arise from this research pilot scheme. We have done everything possible to encourage them, as far as we could within the constraints of not being the Minister for Social Protection, in terms of trying to get the basic income for the arts over the line. Of the approximately 9,000 applications that we received, 6.9% of those are from people with a disability. They will therefore be represented on the scheme. They definitely will have a chance to feed into and to be part of the research. I am sure that like other artists, some will be on the control group as well. I have done what I can within the constraints of the scheme and given the fact that I am not the Minister for Social Protection but Minister with responsibility for arts.  In relation to the night-time economy, I acknowledge what the Senator is saying about taxis and how it is not sustainable to have one person in a taxi. On the issue of the eight proposed bus routes, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very supportive of any developments there and in the night-time economy sector. His Department, as well as the various transport agencies, are on the implementation group. I agree fully with the Senator. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is determined to get that done too, from a sustainability point of view.  RTÉ is not funded by the Exchequer, but by licence fee receipts. Therefore, that is a matter for RTÉ to decide on. A portion of the funds from the recent sale of land by RTÉ have been ring-fenced for digital. I think that may include the RTÉ Player. It will also go towards the paying down of debt. I think I have addressed all of the Senator’s questions. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I believe that a portion of the fund from the sale of the land has been ring-fenced by them for the digital and that will include the player.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are engaging with it all of the time. There is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow between our officials, Fáilte Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC. Although the VAT reduction applies to a wide range of businesses, no potential options should be off the table when it comes to protecting our reputation as a value for money tourism destination. That is a critical priority for the years ahead. The demand right now is slightly related to a deferral of many travel plans. It cannot be taken for granted that as we go into the shoulder season and into next year everything will be as it was this year. A lot of people postponed holidays who did not see their families and all of that is coming to a head as we approach summer 2022. We need to be cautious and my officials will be communicating that in the meeting tomorrow.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The basic income pilot for artists will not be means tested because it is not a social protection support. Instead it is a payment in recognition of the time spent in creative practice. We are trialling the basic income pilot and one of the key characteristics of it is that it is not means tested. It will be randomised but it will be proofed to make sure there is proper geographical representation and diversity of arts, population, gender and all of that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As the Deputy knows, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening. I welcome the fact that as we speak the chief executive is up before the Committee on Transport and Communications and a lot of those issues might be teased out there. Dublin Airport is a regulated entity and the Commission for Aviation Regulation is an independent regulator for charges at the airport. It also sets out a comprehensive range of quality standard targets, including on security times, to ensure a high quality service for passengers at the airport. The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling so far short of the service that our citizens, tourists or visitors should expect at our largest State airport. The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers. As the Deputy knows, ministerial level meetings have been held since the security delay issues first emerged at the end of March and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, met the authority earlier this week. They have requested that the DAA report back within 24 hours on solutions that can be put in place as we approach a bank holiday weekend, which is a pinch factor. Up until last weekend queue times had improved on those experienced by passengers at the end of March, with over 90% of passengers getting through security in less than 45 minutes but what we saw last weekend is not acceptable. As the Deputy said, it has a real risk of doing severe reputational damage to our tourism. I have written to the chief executive of the DAA to express my concern and I hope that the recent engagement with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will see immediate solutions put in place because we need that to happen. I am waiting to welcome with open arms the assurances of the smooth operation of Dublin Airport because that is key, as the Deputy has said. What people are seeing on social media and in our newspapers risks doing huge reputational damage to us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I see what the Deputy is saying. That would be more the remit of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, but I will bring that to their attention and suggest that they engage with the DAA on that specific issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the hop-on, hop-off bus, we have engaged with Fáilte Ireland about this. I would like to see the possibility of local transport and tourism transport working together not only for what the Deputy is suggesting but also, for example, because there is major potential at the Cliffs of Moher, too, that would serve the locality as well as providing for tourists.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My initial reaction when the Deputy started the conversation by talking about car rental was to say that we need to move to more sustainable modes of transport, but that is exactly where the Deputy is going with that. Regarding car rental, my officials have written to the Car Rental Council of Ireland seeking a meeting to highlight the negative impact on tourism at present. Regarding the sea way, I understand Fáilte Ireland is aiming to complete by the end of the third quarter of this year the procurement process to engage consultants to work with the agency on this project, but I can get my officials to refer back to the Deputy with details about that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have been engaging with the stakeholders on this and I expect to have something shortly on it. We are in the final process of extensive engagement on that. I will not announce what the decision is, but that has been ongoing between the officials and the tourism agencies. Some €5 million in additional funding was secured in budget 2022 to begin the preparations for this project. I hope to bring proposals to the Government in the coming weeks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Regarding the basic income for artists pilot, I thank the Acting Chairman for his support for that. I share his enthusiasm for the widest possible participation in it. I also agree with his comments on TG4. I was very happy to increase its funding significantly in the past two years. On the VAT on live performances, currently, artists and live entertainment event workers benefit from a favoured VAT regime but for shows or events where food and drink are not served, VAT is not charged. A lower VAT rate is already applied to tickets for cinemas, theatres, some musical performances, museums and galleries' exhibitions. I understand one of the issues raised by some representative industries is that musicians and performers charge 23% on the fees they charge. There is push on the sector to reduce this amount. I hear their point of view on this and I will make sure I raise it with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for consideration. Regarding short-term lettings, peer-to-peer platforms like Airbnb are an important part of the tourism accommodation mix but we need a range and choice. At the end of the day Housing for All identified short-term lettings as a housing constraint in urban areas especially. Therefore, getting the balance right is key and there will also be stakeholder engagement along with the way.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Tá an ceart ag gach bean agus ag gach fear go gcaithfear leo le dínit agus le meas. Tá timpeallacht tuillte ag gach oibrí, ina gcaitear leo le dínit agus le meas agus nach ndéantar leithcheal orthu, is cuma faoin gcomhlacht ina n-oibríonn siad nó lena bhfuil siad ar conradh. Creidim go n-aontódh sibh go léir leis sin. Every woman and every man has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. All workers, regardless of the company they work for or who they are contracted to, deserve an environment where they are treated with dignity and respect and are not subjected to discrimination. I believe all the members would agree with that. Ensuring a safe and respectful working environment for everyone working in the arts and in the creative industries is one of the most important issues I have engaged with as Minister. Every person has the right to dignity in the workplace. Damaging behaviours such as bullying, harassment and victimisation will not be tolerated across this sector. Over the past number of years, report after report points to unacceptable behaviours in the arts and creative sector right across the spectrum from inappropriate language and insults to sexual assault and violence.The fact that similar behaviours have emerged in other sectors is cold comfort and I believe it is my responsibility, as Minister with responsibility for culture and the arts, to take action to ensure that such behaviours in the creative sectors are consigned to history. In this important area of work, my Department has partnered with the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI. I am providing funding to the ITI which to date has amounted to €400,000. The ITI has been working in this area since 2017 to undertake extensive research and analysis, assist in the drafting of that, which will respond directly to the key issues, and work with my Department to implement those policies in an effective way that will, I hope, make a real and lasting difference to anyone working in this sector. Last year, the ITI undertook a landmark survey of the arts and culture sector, the results of which led to the launch of the Speak Up: A Call for Change report in November, with five important recommendations. Each of the five recommendations has a range of actions, all of which have been progressed by my Department, in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with agencies, Screen Ireland and the Arts Council. The recommendations include short-term actions, practical initiatives and the longer term challenge of changing mindsets, behaviours and culture. Overall, in working through these recommendations and associated actions, I consider that there must be a fundamental change at a systemic level, which requires a change across society. In helping to achieve this, a comprehensive awareness campaign is under way in combination with practical initiatives, such as bystander training, to effectively tackle sexual and gender-based negative behaviours on the ground. For the past year and a half, I have funded Minding Creative Minds to provide a range of counselling and advisory services to the creative sector, free of charge. Some €530,000 has been allocated to date for this very valuable service and I will continue to fund this into the future. The Minding Creative Minds service is a 24-7 confidential mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and is delivered by Spectrum Life. Over the past six months, my officials have been working closely with Minding Creative Minds to expand its existing services and to incorporate some of the recommendations contained in the report, namely, offering specialised support for victims. Minding Creative Minds is in the process of road-testing these additional services to ensure that practices are up to the necessary standard. I expect this work will be completed shortly and that I will be in a position to make announcements soon. It is very important, in such a sensitive area, that the services are adequately tested before they are rolled out to the public as each and every case may represent a traumatised individual. Appropriate consideration for the victims of these damaging behaviours is vital. Resourcing availability of information is another key focus of the work under way and the Irish Theatre Institute has been working on developing a new website which will incorporate elements of all five recommendations, and will have relevant resources and information available, including sectoral codes of behaviour, policy documents and other toolkits for artists and arts organisations. It will also have an online register whereby organisations can formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to its implementation. This should help to build awareness and transparency across the sector. Screen Ireland is collaborating with the Arts Council to develop bystander intervention training, which should be ready to roll out next month. Screen Ireland is also developing a suite of dedicated online training tools for arts organisations, artists and arts workers. These include self-led training, free of charge, in bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias. There will be additional bespoke elements for particular areas, for example, intimacy co-ordination for stage and screen. It is intended that these will be self-led. It is planned that the basic self-led modules, such as bullying and harassment, will ultimately become compulsory for workers in all organisations receiving grant funding from the Arts Council and Screen Ireland. The Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also introducing a new condition of funding for all recipients of grant funding whereby they must confirm that they have taken all necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour on behalf of a board member or staff members. In the meantime, I continue to engage with stakeholders and all interested groups, as do officials in my Department. I have had many meetings that have been helpful to me and, in particular, I recall Fair Plé telling me that I was the first Minister to engage with it. Most recently, I had a very constructive meeting with members of Safe Arts of Ireland, some of whom gave evidence to this committee. I assured them that I would continue work to implement Speak Up: A Call for Change and would keep them updated in the coming weeks and months. I am pleased that the committee has taken a strong interest in this issue and am happy to take questions from members. Tá dul chun cinn maith déanta again. Tús maith leath na hoibre ach tá bóthar fada le siubhal againn fós. Tá súil agam go mbeidh muid ag taisteal le chéile. We have made good progress but we still have a long road to travel. I hope we will do this together.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Senator is referring to the education system.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In any context, we have to ensure there is safety in the workplace. For example, great work is being done in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, where education and tuition are being provided in traditional Irish music and Comhaltas is the main body doing that. I look forward to the return of the Fleadh in Mullingar. Following the launch, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, which is directly funded by my Department, welcomed the Speak Up: A Call for Change initiative as a timely report and Comhaltas stated its mission as being all-embracing and inclusive of everyone, regardless of race, religion or ability. Comhaltas has its Cothromaíocht: Respect, Equality, Opportunity programme, which details statistically its status in regard to gender balance throughout the organisation. It outlines the delivery of a range of training and mentoring supports, which are vital, as well as resources designed to advance a positive and lasting culture of respect and dignity throughout Comhaltas, which really is an education setting. I welcome that. Comhaltas updated me on that as recently as 13 May. It reported that it had delivered a wide range of training, including modules on a positive working environment and on its gender mainstreaming strategy, as well as reviewing and upgrading its websites and social media platforms.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is important that there should be a place where people can go to register their complaints anonymously and have a sense that they are being taken seriously. This is an initiative that Safe Arts of Ireland talked about and it referred to similar facilities being available in some of our third level institutions, as I know from my engagement with it, and UCD in particular must be noted in this regard. Safe Arts of Ireland has asked for a new independent body to which complaints can be made by non-contracted workers, contracted workers and artists. My Department has been working on this for some months now in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with Minding Creative Minds.Progress is being made, and I am hopeful I will be in a position to make an announcement on that issue in the summer. As for the matter of investigation of allegations of assault, sexual assault and rape, An Garda Síochána is the civil authority in the State for policing and investigation, and that should not change. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has reported that every Garda division in the country now has a divisional protective services unit with specially trained officers available when victims of domestic or sexual violence present to the Garda. As for a place where people can go to register complaints anonymously, I have a sense that that is being taken seriously. It is being progressed in my Department.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Through the helpline, we hope that experts will be there. We are working on that. As I said in my speech earlier, in anything we have to do we have to be acutely aware of the fact that we are potentially dealing with traumatised individuals, so we have to test everything before we roll it out. Everything is being considered.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Arts Council has informed my Department that recipients of funding must, as a condition of grant receipt, comply with all applicable requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005. They must have in place appropriate policies dealing with workplace bullying and harassment. In line with the Arts Council equality, human rights and diversity policy, and in compliance with the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015, they must avoid any form of discriminatory practice and have regard for the need to promote equal opportunities in the area of work. In the event of any board member or member of staff having behaved illegally, wrongfully or inappropriately or in breach of relevant policies and procedures in respect of any person, or in the event of the grant recipient becoming aware of any allegation or complaint that any board member or member of staff has behaved in such a manner, the grant recipient must take all necessary actions in respect of such board member or member of staff to ensure absolutely the safety and protection of such persons and members of the public. The Arts Council will carry out the compliance checks.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will have to come back to the Deputy on those exact details. As for the progress that has been made, I hope, by way of progress next month, to be able to launch a range of actions. What I can tell the Deputy about the website is that it will incorporate a code of behaviour, which I think I referred to in an earlier contribution, that organisations in the sector will be asked to adopt voluntarily. The code will include the following broad key principles: zero tolerance of the seven damaging behaviours, along with policies and procedures to maintain the code; published procedures for accepting complaints of damaging behaviour from individuals while protecting them from reprisal or retaliation; timely investigation and resolution of complaints of damaging behaviour; and awareness-raising of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace and roll-out of training using free training resources, ultimately to all workers in the organisation. In due course it will be expected that all organisations that receive or hope to receive funding from the State will adopt the code of behaviours. That is one element of the website that I can share with Deputy Munster. The dedicated website will also incorporate a dignity-at-work toolkit containing comprehensive information on supports and resources for all arts workers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The main step is that continued funding would require grantees to self-certify that they have not had an allegation of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment upheld against them for which a current disciplinary warning or sanction is in place. As Minister, I assure the committee that it is my firm policy intention that organisations that are not found to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams. Damaging behaviour is simply unacceptable. While I fully expect organisations across the sector to embrace this agenda and to respond proactively to the matters raised in the survey, I wish to be crystal clear that where that is not the case, funding is at risk - full stop.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I see what Deputy Munster is saying. That might be well worth considering. As I said, my commitment to this is crystal clear.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Does the Deputy mean the relevant funding agency for-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If, for example, it is the Arts Council that provides the funding, that will be the body in charge. It is whichever body provides the funding. It depends on which body administers the funding.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Conditionality of funding and dignity at work policy are of the utmost importance. I have been engaging with the various organisations attached to my Department. I have made it crystal clear that I am very committed to this. As I said, I am making it crystal clear that funding is at risk unless this is adhered to. The vast majority of funding of the arts sector, as Deputy Munster will know, is disbursed by the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions. Both agencies have already been very clear in their approach to dignity at work and expectations that dignity at work policies are required for continued funding. They have known from their very first engagements with me early on that I am absolutely committed to this. The Irish Theatre Institute and my Department will continue to work with both agencies on this matter.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank all members who have commended the work of our Department but the people who deserve credit here are the women who have spoken up so bravely. It was striking. The bravery was remarkable during my engagement with them and I commend them. Things are changing because they spoke up and engaged with us. I mention also the survey done by the Irish Theatre Institute. I want to take a moment to praise these women and commend them on their bravery. I have heard their voices as they bravely told their stories of discrimination and sexual harassment and that is why we are absolutely committed to it. It is a priority. Senator Warfield asked whether we were as rigid as the Arts Council. It is worked into our service level agreement so that absolutely is the case. I do not have the numbers here for those who accessed Minding Creative Minds services but we can come back to him on that. On further surveys, the speak up survey was really the first of its kind. It was made possible because it was funded in its entirety by the Department and carried out by the Department's partners. Since the publication of the report in November, it has been my intention that further surveys will be carried out in line with recommendation five of the report. I will provide funding accordingly. We are already discussing the next round of research. One of the issues will be the marketing of the survey. My officials will be proactive in seeking the assistance of resource organisations such as the national campaign for the arts, in encouraging as many people in the arts and creative sectors to complete the survey. I see the potential in the basic income for the arts pilot as a research project. It might throw up some interesting data on this because it will give artists the independence to say "No". That might come out of the research. They might say they were not comfortable working in a particular area. We can then delve deeper into that. There is potential in the basic income that might reach out to more people in the sector. I think they were all the issues.
