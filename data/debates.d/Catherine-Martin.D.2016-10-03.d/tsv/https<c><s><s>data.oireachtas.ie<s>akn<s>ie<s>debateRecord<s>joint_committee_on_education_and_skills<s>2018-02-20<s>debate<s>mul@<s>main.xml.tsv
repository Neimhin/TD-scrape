CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations. I was a post-primary teacher for 20 years and am a former member of the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland, ASTI. In my experience as a teacher I have worked side by side in the classroom with teachers who received unequal pay for the work they did. That was not right. It will remain an uphill battle for Government to recruit or retain teachers when that fundamental injustice is being done to young teachers. The entire teaching profession has been devalued in recent years. Where we were once a nation proud of our education system, we are now educating children to force them to emigrate. Why would they want to teach in those conditions? Why would anyone want to teach side by side with someone like me who has been there for 20 years and get treated differently? New teachers come in full of new ideas, new initiatives and energy, and willing to do all of the extracurricular activities and more because they are new. What is happening in our education system is appalling. What are the witnesses' opinions on the Minister's brainwave to incentivise certain subjects, as reported in The Irish Times in early January of this year? That is further inequality within teaching when we are trying to address shortages of teachers due to inequality. What are the professional opinions of the witnesses on that? On the subject of retired teachers coming back into the classroom, are they Garda vetted? As a member of the Teaching Council, I was asked three years ago to get Garda vetted because I was not initially when I qualified. I had no problem doing that. It is what is done. Are the retired teachers Garda vetted? What safety is there for our children? In respect of the post-primary oral exams, do we know if principals have been forced to say "no" to teachers looking for experience as an oral examiner? It helps a teacher to be an oral examiner. I would say it is crucial and every teacher should do it once to help their students prepare for the junior or leaving certificate. Have principals agreed to release teachers and are they just dreading that oral exam fortnight? Have students been surveyed on the impact of teacher shortages on them? In regard to the whole-school evaluation in management, leadership and learning, WSE-MLL, perhaps we should be suggesting to the inspectors it is time they added to those questionnaires that go out to parents and students as well as the three-day intensive inspection of teaching practices. What impact do teacher shortages and the lack of supply have on the education of students and what impact is it having on schools? Maybe that is a question that should be on the whole-school evaluation if we are going to be talking about quality education.If we gave feedback to the Minister it might make him act on it. Should a different salary scale apply in Dublin and possibly other cities? I know many recently qualified teachers in both primary and secondary schools. They have completed their first year and have got a permanent job in year two. They are saying, "That's it. I'm out of here because I have no quality of life. I'll have to leave my permanent job." The decision is whether to leave the country or to go to a different part of the country, but they have to throw away a permanent job. Should something be done there? I would be interested to hear the witnesses' different opinions on that.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mr. Ó Ruairc mentioned in his presentation that 100,000 are on the register. How many of those 100,000 are teaching in schools today? For those who have left and wish to come back, I know the one dread in a teacher's life is if he or she has missed the deadline to renew his or her registration. It is quite laborious. Thankfully, it never happened to me but I saw what teachers had to fill out, the transcripts, etc. Would there be any sort of leeway, if a teacher was on sick leave or wanted to come back having emigrated, to make it easier so that the teacher would not have to face the incredible amount of documentation that has to be gathered if he or she is considering returning to the teaching profession in Ireland? I forgot to ask Mr. Paul Byrne a question on job sharing. Teachers feel frustration about it and it might be a disincentive to staying.When teachers apply for job-sharing and it is granted by the school, often it is so that they can spend time with their children or some other personal reason. They might say that they need perhaps three afternoons off so that they can pick up their child after work. School A has no problem with allowing for it in the timetable but school B will say that the teacher is on every afternoon for the year. The principal says the timetable threw it up and that it was outside his or her control. Is there a standardised system that could be given to principals and deputy principals? I know some teachers who are considering leaving the profession or taking early retirement because their request was not granted and they perceive an injustice as other schools seem to be able to handle it no problem. Gabhaim míle buíochas as an gcur i láthair faoin nGaeilge inniu. Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, tá fonn ar an Aire tosaíocht a thabhairt do mhúinteoirí STEM. Cén tionchar a bheadh ar a leithéid de ghníomh ar na Gaelscoileanna?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	May I reply to some of the comments made by Mr. Byrne?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would like to make two short points. Mr. Mulconry summed up the strategy brilliantly. Principals are overstretched and under-resourced. We regularly hear young teachers saying they will never become principals. When they walk into the principal's office, they cannot see him or her because of all the paperwork. Mr. Byrne mentioned that many teachers are saying "No" to oral examinations. Much of the training for examiners happens in late January or early February. Has a problem presented itself this year? Will there be a crisis for those examinations this year? I am curious about the guarantee that every single substitute teacher has been vetted. I do not know how that can be guaranteed. Is there a procedure or a process whereby a principal does not allow a retired teacher back in?I am not saying all of this to tackle the schools. I am just saying this could be a way to get around the Minister and encourage him to say there is an issue. In no way am I saying anything to tackle the schools on this issue. Is that what it will take, if the Minister feels there is not a guarantee on vetting? I want to clarify that that is the angle I am coming from. It is obvious that the issues of people working in an unequal system and equal pay for equal work are not a priority for the Minister. Do we have to approach the matter from a different angle? That is the only reason I raised the issue.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I fully understand that a principal would say "no" due to a shortage of teachers, and more principals are doing so. Are there enough examiners for the oral and practical examinations this year? Has that information been ascertained yet? A lot of the training of examiners takes place around now, and therefore principals should know how many people have volunteered to train as an examiner.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No. I agree wholeheartedly with the statement made by Mr. Mulconry.
