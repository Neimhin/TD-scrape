CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Táim an-sásta a bheith anseo inniu ag labhairt leis an Teach faoin turasóireacht. I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad about the plans for supports and incentives for the tourism and hospitality industry for 2021. In 2019, before the pandemic had wrought its affects on Irish society, tourism was worth more than €9 billion in total to our economy from overseas tourists and the fares they generated together with domestic tourism. The industry supported 260,000 jobs across the country both in remote rural areas as well as in our towns and cities. Since the advent of Covid-19, and the consequential and necessary public health measures, many of these jobs have been lost or are surviving with State support and income from the sector is a fraction of what it was in 2019. I am very aware of the toll that the pandemic and the restrictions are continuing to take across the sector and, most importantly, on the people working in the industry. It was critical, therefore, that the Government recently extended the economy-wide supports for businesses and employees until the end of June. As Senators will be aware, the Government has also committed that there will not be a cliff-edge end to the supports that are currently in place. We remain committed to supporting tourism through this difficult period, and to working towards reopening and recovery. In that regard, the Government will soon publish a national economic recovery plan, which will outline how we will help people return to work, support sectors that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic and how emergency supports will be phased out. Crucially, as part of that plan, along with my colleagues in government, we will consider more targeted measures to help reboot those sectors such as tourism that will face particular challenges during the recovery phase when the economy reopens. While we collectively continue to experience the dreadful impact of this pandemic on life, society and the economy, there is cause for cautious optimism as the roll-out of the vaccination programme gathers pace. Reopening tourism businesses and managing the recovery in a way that is economically viable, safe and attractive for tourists and local communities will require co-ordination at a level not seen previously. The roadmap to recovery will require flexibility, agility, investment, innovation, and a commitment to a strong collaboration with the industry. Horizontal support schemes such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS, and rates waiver have been worth hundreds of millions of euro to the broader tourism and hospitality sectors. Outside of that, I have allocated a record level of funding to tourism, which has allowed me to introduce measures specifically aimed at assisting the tourism sector, such as the €55 million business continuity scheme launched on 1 February by Fáilte Ireland to help strategic tourism businesses survive the pandemic and drive recovery. This scheme will contribute to the fixed costs of identified tourism businesses that are not eligible for the CRSS to support their survival. It will provide an equitable level of payment to the CRSS for qualifying businesses and the first phase will cover businesses such as tourism attractions, activity providers and caravan and camping sites. The VAT rate for the sector was reduced to 9% to help improve the competitiveness and viability of businesses. Two separate funds of €10 million each were introduced for coach tourism operators and the Ireland based inbound agents business continuity scheme in the last quarter of 2020. In addition, €8 million in restart grant funding was provided for bed and breakfast premises. Funding of €5 million has also been provided for upskilling training and to improve digital presence. A €26 million adaptation fund has been provided for the tourism sector to adapt their premises to meet Covid-19 safety requirements. Survival is the first part of the Government's response for tourism. Recovery must come next. I will continue to keep all options open for supporting the recovery. Last September, the tourism recovery task force submitted a recovery plan to me which set out a number of recommendations aimed at helping the tourism sector to survive and recover from the pandemic. The plan has been a very important input into my thinking on the sector and has influenced a number of the measures I have adopted.  I subsequently appointed the recovery oversight group in December to monitor the implementation of the recovery plan. The oversight group was ably chaired by Nóirín Hegarty and she presented the group's first report to me on 15 February. The report highlights a number of areas on which it recommends the Government should focus its attention. I brought this report to the attention of my colleagues in government to ensure they are fully up to date with the position on tourism as we prepare the national economic recovery plan. A number of the areas highlighted by the group have already been addressed in our new Covid plan, The Path Ahead. In addition, my officials will continue to engage with tourism agencies and colleagues across government in pursuing progress on specific recommendations. I will keep the content of the report under review, together with the initial recovery plan produced by the tourism recovery task force, as the situation evolves. Last October, the Tánaiste and I convened the hospitality and tourism forum to provide a platform for structured engagement between the hospitality and tourism sector, the tourism agencies and relevant Departments. The forum enables the Tánaiste and me to engage with a wide spectrum of industry stakeholders to assess the continuing impact of the pandemic, help improve understanding and responses to the crisis and discuss ideas for recovery measures, thus assisting the Government in formulating its ongoing response to the crisis. I was pleased that the Taoiseach also attended the most recent meeting of the forum earlier this month to hear at first hand of the devastation this pandemic has brought to our tourism sector and the many challenges the industry now faces. I am committed to mapping a pathway for the recovery of the sector and I will continue to work with all stakeholders in that regard. It is recognised that during periods of closure the tourism and hospitality sector is losing skilled staff to other sectors. The tourism recovery task force identified that retaining tourism jobs and skills will be vital to tourism's recovery and implementing an upskilling and reskilling programme can mitigate the significant damage the crisis is having on the sector. In this regard, supporting the retention will be assisted by measures such as the funding of €5 million provided in budget 2021 for upskilling training and to improve digital presence. The tourism and hospitality careers oversight group is a collaborative approach by stakeholders, including industry bodies, education providers, Departments and State agencies, to addressing skills shortages in the tourism sector. The group is finalising a new plan which includes input from members and a review of its collaborative framework, and takes into account recommendations from the tourism recovery task force. The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Simon Harris, and the Minister of State with responsibility for skills, Deputy Niall Collins, recently announced two new skills programmes to assist the hospitality and tourism sectors with Covid-19 challenges and ensuring they are ready for reopening. Looking ahead to the summer, indications are that there will be a strong domestic demand for tourism services when it is safe to open up.Recent CSO figures show that almost 70% of people intend to take a holiday in the Republic of Ireland in 2021. While this news is encouraging, I am very conscious that the tourism sector relies heavily on international tourism. The industry wants certainty around when international visitors can visit, but it is not helpful to speculate on specific dates at this point. The path ahead makes clear the criteria which are most important when considering the easing of travel restrictions. These are the prevalence of the disease and the attendant reproductive rate, reducing hospital and critical care occupancy to low levels to protect the health service and allow for the safe resumption of non-Covid-19 care, ongoing and steady progress in the vaccination programme such that the most vulnerable are protected through vaccination, and emerging information on variants of concern. International travel is critical for tourism, with overseas visitors accounting for 75% of the revenue generated by the sector prior to the pandemic. At this point, the Government’s overarching and primary policy objective on inbound international travel is to minimise the introduction of new cases of Covid-19 to the State from other locations. A senior officials group continues to review the situation fortnightly. This group, having regard to the developing epidemiological in the State and internationally, the evolution of tests and technologies, and progress been made in the vaccination programme, will make every effort to reopen international travel at the earliest possible opportunity. Unfortunately, inbound international tourism is not possible at present given how the pandemic has evolved. It is too early to say when it might resume, but I look forward to seeing people back visiting our country when it is safe to do so. At a meeting of EU tourism ministers on 1 March I urged the European Commission to consider initiatives to facilitate the resumption of safe international travel. In that regard the proposal for a regulation on digital green certificates announced by the EU last week is a welcome development. It is vital, however, not to raise hopes about a quick return to international tourism. Most EU member states are still working hard on their domestic messaging to encourage citizens to stay the course with restrictive measures, many of which remain necessary pending the roll-out of the vaccination programmes. The priority in Ireland is on regaining and maintaining control over the disease and preventing a further wave of infection later in the year until vaccination can offer a widespread population level of protection. The EU’s proposal of a common framework for the issuance verification and acceptance of certificates relating to vaccination, testing and recovery requires careful consideration. The proposal is expected to be discussed at the European Council meeting of leaders later this week and will be examined in detail by relevant Government Departments. It is too early, therefore, to comment in detail on that proposed framework. I wish to assure the Seanad that I am fully aware of the great challenges faced in tourism and that I will continue to work with my colleagues in Government to ensure the sector is given every possible support to enable it to emerge intact from the pandemic and to build back in a more resilient, digitalised, greener and sustainable way. We will do that as we have done since I became Minister, which is in constant consultation with the stakeholders.
CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their statements today and the passionate support demonstrated for the tourism industry. As Minister with responsibility for tourism, allow me to re-emphasise that I am acutely aware of the devastation that Covid-19 is inflicting on the sector. I am also very aware of the havoc it has caused for the hundreds of businesses and thousands of workers in one of our most valuable indigenous industries. In my many engagements with tourism stakeholders we continue to focus on key supports for survival and recovery. My colleagues and I across the Government have reiterated there will not be a cliff-edge end to the supports currently in place. I will do my best in the time allocated to answer as many specific questions but if I do not get to one, Senators should feel free to contact me and I will get answers to any Senator making that request. Senators Garvey and McGahon raised the question of sustainable tourism. My immediate focus is on the survival of our tourism sector but we must begin planning for recovery and rebuilding when the time is right. I absolutely agree with Senators that there is an opportunity here to address sustainable tourism development in a much more meaningful way during the recovery and rebuilding phase following this crisis. Sustainable development is about using without exploitation our natural, cultural and other tourism resources, preserving them for use by future generations. It also means tourism should be a positive for local communities, as Senator Garvey mentioned, tapping into and supporting local food producers. It makes sense, as well as being economically sustainable. With that in mind we must seek to realise Ireland's ambition to be among the world leaders in sustainable tourism practices. As Senator Garvey indicates, biodiversity can play a significant part in tourism. A sustainable tourism working group was established prior to the Covid-19 outbreak and it produced a set of guiding principles for sustainable tourism development in Ireland. I have now charged this group with the development of a suite of actions that will promote sustainable tourism practices. The implementation of these actions, along with the guiding principles we have produced, will underpin the advancement of a new tourism policy that will mainstream sustainability. In due course and when the time is right, officials in my Department will initiate the development of this new national tourism policy. Senator Keogan asked what progress has been made in supports and I outlined earlier some of those supports, including: the €55 million business continuity scheme; the reduction of the VAT rate to 9%; two separate funds of €10 million for coach tourism operators and the Ireland-based inbound agents business continuity scheme; an €8 million restart grant; €5 million for upskilling; and a €26 million adaptation fund. There are also horizontal supports such as the Covid restrictions support scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme and rates waivers worth millions of euro to the broader tourism and hospitality sectors. The tourism recovery oversight group presented its report to me early this year but the tourism recovery task force included representatives from the hotel and hospitality sectors. Senators Casey and Wall mentioned the stay and spend scheme, which was set up late last summer to provide targeted supports to accommodation and hospitality businesses most affected by continued restrictions. At the time the scheme was devised and launched, there appeared to be a steady downward trend in infection rates and there was an expectation that at the very least there would be a partial reopening of the sector that could be sustained. It was set up by my colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and it was an innovative approach to incentivising spending on the tourism and hospitality sectors. Public health conditions that were beyond our control have clearly prevented that and the stop and start nature of the pandemic, along with its unpredictable consequences, resulted in the scheme being completely underutilised.There are effective supports in place. I mentioned the CRSS and the €55 million for strategic tourism businesses. This specific scheme should be reviewed, as provided for when it was launched. The review of the scheme was a recommendation of the recovery oversight group and I have urged Cabinet colleagues to give serious consideration to this and other recommendations of the report to facilitate the reopening of the sector. Senators Cassells, Blaney and Burke mentioned the pathway and when sectors will be able to open and have that information. I am conscious that the hospitality and tourism sector wants certainty around this but I cannot give specific dates at this point. Covid-19 Resilience & Recovery 2021: The Path Ahead, which we published recently, makes clear the criteria which are most important to consider regarding the easing of restrictions. Those criteria are: the prevalence of disease and the attendant reproductive rate; reducing the hospital and critical care occupancy to low levels to protect the health service and to allow for resumption of non-Covid care; the ongoing and steady progress of the vaccination programme; and emerging information on variants of concern. I will continue to engage with sectoral stakeholders on this as we move towards the summer. I want the sectors to reopen as soon as it is safe to do so. The Government is absolutely committed to developing a clear roadmap for return and we will meet in advance of 5 April to review the restrictions. Senator Keogan mentioned the vaccination roll-out. We are prioritising that roll-out. We are only constrained by supply and are working to increase that supply. Projected deliveries in April to June give us some optimism that we should be able to hugely expand the programme. I am sure everyone here would agree that would be very welcome. The Senator also asked what exactly has been implemented from the report. There has been the extension of EWSS, the introduction of CRSS, the Fáilte Ireland inbound agents and coach tourism operators schemes, the tourism business continuity scheme, the rates waiver, tax warehousing and, as I said, the 9% VAT which was agreed in the last budget. Senators Carrigy, Cassells and Wall mentioned the outdoor scheme with Fáilte Ireland working with assistance from local authorities to help this industry. The pandemic has triggered discussions around reimagining our cities and towns as better places to live, work and visit. Local authorities and State agencies have been responding to this promptly and thoroughly. Public health guidance is likely to place restrictions on capacity across tourism and hospitality for the foreseeable future, with a much greater focus on utilising outdoor settings and public spaces to best advantage. That is something I am doing within the arts and culture sector as well. Fáilte Ireland is considering how best it can support outdoor dining experiences in consultation with local authorities. This includes proposed outdoor dining and urban animation schemes. The subject has got a lot of attention. No final decisions have been made regarding the outdoor dining scheme. With further regard to the infrastructure, licensing and planning challenges that exist with the use of outdoor spaces, Fáilte Ireland is exploring options for combining funding for individual businesses with support for local authority-led initiatives. Details have yet to be finalised. I assure Senator Dooley that I am fighting my corner for the tourism and hospitality sector. On businesses seeking the extension of closing dates of certain schemes, I ask the Senator to provide me with the details. I was interested to hear Senator Casey's reports from times past and the 200 years of his hotel. As I said recently to the industry, tourism has seen many challenges but nothing on the scale of this pandemic. It is unprecedented and is the most difficult period ever. We are committed to supporting the sector through reopening and beyond. We will do all we can to get international tourists back again when it is safe to do so.  Senator Mullen referred to State aid. Tourism and hospitality businesses are the main beneficiaries of CRSS, with roughly 60% of the total going to that sector. There are many other supports, as I set out earlier, and Government will continue to review those supports to allow businesses to trade when it is safe to do so. Senators Casey and Mullen mentioned international travel, and I have covered that. Senator Dolan spoke of cycleways and greenways. Obviously, as I am from the Green Party it makes absolute sense to me. As I responded earlier to Senators McGahon and Garvey, this is the kind of low-impact sustainable tourism that makes sense and which we need to develop for the future, for international and domestic tourism. On the query about tourism officers' funding and other queries, I will come back to the Senator on that. I agree with Senator Conway on the need to extend the season and to disperse business across the country, and to extend that regional and seasonal tourism. This will be a key part of sustainable tourism. With regard to the successor to The Gathering, the Senators will be aware the programme for Government incudes a commitment to the Year of the Invitation initiative, which could play a really important role in rebooting tourism. It needs to be done at the right time. My officials are looking at how best to do that. Senator O'Loughlin spelled out very clearly so many of the appeals of Kildare. As the Senator said, I am very familiar with north Kildare as I have family there, and I am somewhat familiar with south Kildare. The Senator has whetted my appetite to get there as soon as possible and I look forward to that. On Senator Blaney's comments, as a proud Ulster woman I have had the pleasure of visiting Donegal. What a beautiful county it is. I will happily take the Senator up on his offer and take my family with me. My children have not yet visited Donegal and I look forward to bringing them there. I am a frequent visitor to Sligo, where I have family, so it is just a hop over to Donegal. Reference was made to Shannon Heritage. My colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, is well aware of the challenges faced by Shannon Heritage, which is part of the Shannon Group. I understand that his Department has been able to provide some supports to them. In addition they are eligible for the Covid restrictions support scheme, CRSS, and the employment wage subsidy scheme, EWSS. As with other attractions I am aware that Shannon Heritage wants to open as soon as possible and I want that for it too. I absolutely agree with Senator Blaney on the need to invest in areas of great beauty such as Donegal. It has massive tourism potential and it just needs that investment, such as the investment in Sliabh Liag, Malin Head and the Wild Atlantic Way. We will look at the potential of future projects. With both of us having served on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, I know only too well of the many amenities that Senator Ward has talked about. In marketing Dublin pre-pandemic, Tourism Ireland drew attention to its proximity to nature in the many villages and communities the Senator has outlined, in north and south Dublin. It will be even more appealing in the future. Senator Crowe suggested a great idea for online training for chefs. The skills shortage, as I outlined in my speech earlier, is a massive issue. I know this from my engagement with the sector. This is why funding of €5 million was provided in the budget in 2021 for upskilling and training, and to improve the digital presence. With regard to Senator Burke's comments on the connectivity right across my sector, it is often said that there are so many sectors under my remit. To me it makes perfect sense and culture, arts and tourism are a really good fit. On Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, I have a mini comhaltas ceoltóirí in my house every Thursday when my children do harp, mandolin and button accordion by Zoom. It works. I am very aware of the rich heritage of Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann and tapping into that. Indeed, when I speak of the connectivity right across my sectors, I will be making that connectivity part of my upcoming Department strategy.
