CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When does the Government intend to deal with the urgent need for State assistance for homeowners residing in defective buildings? Such assistance was recommended by the report of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last week, entitled Safe as Houses? Moreover, as the Taoiseach is aware, similar assistance was recommended in a motion brought forward by the Green Party and passed by the House last June. I am aware of at least three multi-unit developments in my constituency of Dublin Rathdown where residents, through absolutely no fault of their own, are facing repair and building works bills of between €7,000 and €30,000. Some are facing the threat of legal proceedings for the amounts, which it is claimed they owe. It is so unfair. These homeowners and families believe their nightmare and plight is being ignored and forgotten. They believe the Government does not care about their horrendous predicament and they are desperately looking to Government and seeking help, protection and assistance. When does the Government intend to tackle this protracted problem effectively? Does the Government intend to implement practical measures such as tax relief for these homeowners? Does the Government intend to set up a redress scheme for such homeowners, as identified in the committee report last week?
