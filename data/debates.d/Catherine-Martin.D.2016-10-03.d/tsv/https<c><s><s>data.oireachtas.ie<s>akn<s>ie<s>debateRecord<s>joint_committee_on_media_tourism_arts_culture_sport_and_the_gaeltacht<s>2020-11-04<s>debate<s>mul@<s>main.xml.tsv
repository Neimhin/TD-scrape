CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an cuireadh teacht anseo inniu. Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith anseo chun labhairt faoi tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne agus ár bhfreagra ar an bpaindéim Covid. I intend to address the committee on matters relating to tourism, culture, arts and media while my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, will address matters related to sport and the Gaeltacht. The sectors under the aegis of my Department are among the most severely impacted by the global pandemic and associated public health measures. Unfortunately, as the pandemic continues, we are likely to continue to experience these significant and negative impacts.As such, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to address the committee on the important challenges facing our sectors and to open a dialogue on the strategic priorities for the Department as we turn our faces to the future and to recovery.  Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are integral parts of the fabric of our society and our democracy, supporting a wide range of economic activity as well enhancing our physical, mental and societal well-being. Central to the operation of these sectors is the coming together of people, whether to enjoy a cultural event, watch a match or enjoy a meal or night out. The combined portfolio of tourism, culture, the arts, the Gaeltacht, sport and media speaks to who we are as a nation and how we identify ourselves.  The Covid-19 crisis has challenged all of our core presumptions and values and made us reflect critically on the importance of these sectors to our nation. It is no longer possible for us to come together for a cultural, sporting or social event. The flow of visitors we normally welcome from Europe, the US and beyond is not with us. More than ever, we require high-quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content. Our focus has been on the collective effort to protect the vulnerable in our society, on keeping our health and social care services operating and on preventing further disruption to childcare and education. All of this also reflects who we are as a people, a society which cares about its most vulnerable, and we should never lose sight of this. It has come at an enormous cost for the sectors for which I and the Minister of State have responsibility.  I will take a moment to set out the impacts of the pandemic. There has been a collapse in international tourism which the OECD estimates will be to the order of 80%. We have experienced the loss of all overseas tourism since March. The impact of social distancing measures and the limits on gatherings required to protect public health have also significantly diminished the domestic tourism and hospitality sectors. Fáilte Ireland estimates that some 40% of tourism businesses have not reopened since the first lockdown in 2020.  Cultural venues and events were among the first to be closed in our response to the pandemic and will undoubtedly be among the last to reopen. This continues to have a devastating impact on performance opportunities, displays, festivals and concerts, impacting on our opportunities to experience culture and performance as well as employment and economic activity in the sector. The impact of the pandemic on the arts sector extends well beyond artists. It has also affected crews and the wide range of people it takes to put on live performances in venues and at festivals.  Sport, which is central to the lives of many people in Ireland, has been similarly impacted with restrictions on spectators, and curtailed activity generally, severely impacting on revenues. The commercial sports and leisure sector has also seen its activity cease as we moved to level 5 of the Government’s plan for living with Covid-19.  Across the Gaeltacht, businesses and communities alike have suffered a significant reduction in economic activity, tourism and educational visitors as a consequence of Covid-19. Many are now facing the double impact of Brexit. I am very conscious that this will pose a further risk for the language as it may result in more native speakers leaving our Gaeltacht regions.  The media sector, which has played such a critical role in supporting and disseminating public messaging about the Covid-19 response, has been especially hard hit by reduced advertising revenues. It is ironic that this has come at a time when there has never been a greater need for trusted news sources.  Over recent months, I have been working with Government colleagues to ensure that we are addressing the crisis in our sectors head on and sustaining, protecting and enhancing resilience where we can. Across government, we continue to invest heavily in protecting incomes through the pandemic unemployment payment, in protecting livelihoods through the employment wage subsidy scheme and, most recently in the budget, in protecting businesses through the Covid restrictions support scheme. Given the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on our sectors, these universal supports continue to form a critical part of our response. The VAT cut, the tax debt warehousing extension and the rates waiver are also essential in helping sustain businesses across our sectors.  Engaging with our sectoral stakeholders has been an essential part of our response to the pandemic and it is critical that we, as policymakers, listen closely to the voices and experiences of artists, cultural workers, tourism businesses, sporting bodies, the media and our Gaeltacht communities.Task forces made up of sectoral experts have been set up to direct our responses and set us on the path of recovery for the tourism and arts and culture sectors. Informed by these engagements, I have introduced a range of sector-specific measures. While it is not possible to go through them all in detail in this opening statement, I will highlight a number of very significant support measures. The Arts Council has seen its funding allocation increase by €25 million over its initial budget allocation in 2020 and has been allocated a total funding provision of €130 million under budget 2021. This additional investment empowers the Arts Council to help artists, arts workers and arts organisations get through the crisis and ensures that they will still be there to play their part in the national recovery. This funding will help protect jobs and livelihoods, while also supporting thousands of artists in creating new work during and after the pandemic. It will focus on enhancing the resilience of the sector, while also looking to find new ways of reaching audiences in person and online. Live entertainment has also been significantly impacted by the pandemic, as attendance at concerts, festivals and events is either severely curtailed or no longer permitted under the five levels. To that end, I am providing €50 million in funding to support live entertainment in 2021, which will include significant support measures for the commercial entertainment sector. A key pillar of this support package is the extension of the pilot live performance support scheme from the 2020 July stimulus, which will incentivise venues, producers and promoters of live performances to plan new productions and to employ workers in the cultural and creative sectors. Earlier this week, I announced the outcome of the pilot which aims to see up to 58 performances being staged over the coming months, providing much-needed work for artists, entertainers and those who work in the sector. We are also working with our national cultural Institutions and cultural spaces across the country to ensure they can operate safely under the Government's plan for living with Covid-19. These spaces and their collections are vital for the well-being of our communities. The work of curators and cultural practitioners in bringing them to life online over the pandemic has been truly exceptional. For tourism, my immediate focus is on helping the sector to survive the Covid crisis and the recovery plan produced by the tourism recovery task force is a valuable contribution to my thinking in this context. In response to the recommendations, I strongly advocated for additional supports as part of budget 2021 and was pleased to support the Government's announcement of a new €55 million support fund for strategic tourism businesses and €5 million for training and digitalisation support in the sector. These measures will complement the EWSS and CRSS and the restart scheme. The Government has also responded to the call from the industry and reduced the VAT rate in the sector to 9%, which will enhance viability and competitiveness. While it may take a while for the benefits of the VAT cut and the stay-and-spend tax credit to be felt, they will be important supports when we open up again. All of the budgetary measures will build on the €26 million adaptation grant for the tourism sector and the €10 million supports for international coach tourism announced in July. Throughout the crisis, my Department has worked with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and media stakeholders to assess the impact of the crisis on the sector. To mitigate some of the worst effects, the BAI agreed to waive its broadcasting levy for the first half of the year for the independent radio sector and I have secured additional funding to offset this. More significantly, and in recognition of the importance of the public, commercial and community media in disseminating public health messages, additional funding has been provided for the sound and vision scheme, with an additional round valued at €2.5 million for commercial radio, a €750,000 round, and the current round that will distribute €4.5 million to the audiovisual sector, boosted by an additional €2 million in Exchequer funding under the July stimulus package. Well-being is a core principle underpinning the living with Covid-19 plan, and it will be fundamental to public confidence and resilience as we emerge from and manage the crisis over the longer term. Well-being is also at the heart of our programme for Government and is a central pillar to my Department's policies, with the arts and culture, sport, the Irish language, the media and tourism all contributing to our national and individual well-being. From that perspective, I consider it vital that we lift our heads and proactively plan for recovery, a recovery which will come and for which I want these sectors to be in the best position they can be to resume activity. For tourism, my overall objective is to facilitate recovery and future growth that is sustainable from an environmental, social and economic perspective. Central to this will be a three-year survival, stabilisation and recovery programme based on the recommendations of the tourism recovery task force.Additionally, I intend to initiate the development of an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable tourism policy that will further set our direction over the coming years. We will continue to develop our national tourism product, including through strategic investments under the national development plan and for activity-based tourism, being conscious of the ancillary economic benefits from such investments in often isolated locations.  The arts and culture task force has also set the direction for recovery in that broad sector. The task force has completed its deliberations and I intend to bring its final report to the attention of Government at the earliest opportunity. I will work closely with sectoral stakeholders and colleagues in government on the implementation of its recommendations.  There are strong links between commercial and State-supported cultural activity with artists and other cultural workers often moving between both during their careers. As such, ensuring we continue to support our cultural workers ensures a vibrant commercial sector in the future. The Arts Council, which, as I mentioned earlier, has received significant additional funding for 2021, will also play a central role in ensuring that artists and arts workers will get through the crisis, will continue to create and will be in a position to return to live performance when we are again able to gather together.  An allocation of €8 million has also been made to the National Concert Hall, NCH, for 2021 to allow for the transfer of the National Symphony Orchestra from RTÉ. This will be a significant step towards the objective of enabling it to be established as a world-class orchestra which will, with the NCH, provide a creative and imaginative programme strategy that will greatly enhance the offering of the combined organisation to the public. Our work with the live entertainment sector is also turning towards the future, and I intend to support the development of guidance for venues in how to manage the return to live performances as well as the bespoke funding scheme announced in budget 2021. The work of the night-time economy task force, due to report at the end of the year, will create a renewed vision for night-time culture, informed by the experience of the crisis but also providing a long-term perspective on what our cities and towns should offer their citizens and visitors in terms of cultural and entertainment options. Creativity and resilience often go hand in hand and, under the Creative Ireland programme, my Department has invested significant additional funding of €3.9 million to support artistic and creative operators to produce creative content and deliver creative initiatives. More broadly, new funding has also been directed towards the creative sector in support of public resilience and well-being initiatives. For example, the rapid roll-out of the creativity in older age scheme in July has seen the deployment by national organisations and local authorities of a series of projects worth more than €500,000 by creative practitioners, supporting older people in community and healthcare settings nationwide.  The Creative Ireland programme is also currently working closely to support Healthy Ireland on the Government’s recently launched community resilience campaign, Keep Well. This will see significant additional funding provided by Government to local authorities to support creative operators in delivering a range of initiatives to support individual and community creativity in the arts, culture and heritage. My Department is also working to enhance resilience and support the creative industries, including the audiovisual sector. We will continue to implement the audiovisual action plan over the coming years, as well as supporting Screen Ireland and its subsidiary, Screen Skills Ireland, to build and support a world-class industry in Ireland.  In terms of media, I was pleased to provide additional funding to TG4 in 2020 and 2021, as well as providing additional funding of €2 million for the sound and vision scheme in 2020. These initiatives are helping to build quality output for TV audiences in Ireland and beyond, as well as critically supporting the independent production sector. As I mentioned earlier, we were also in a position to support the broader media sector through various BAI measures, including the initial waiver on the broadcasting levy for the independent radio sector. While addressing the immediate needs of the sector, there is important work to be done on addressing the future of media in this country. The Future of Media Commission has been established and held its inaugural meeting last week. This commission will, through engagement with key stakeholders, help inform future media policy. I will also be actively engaged in ensuring the safe passage of the online safety and media regulation Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas over the coming months.  As Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, I am firmly committed to supporting these sectors as they navigate through the unique and difficult challenges the Covid-19 crisis presents. I will continue to do everything possible to ensure they remain viable through the crisis and resilient in recovery and to seek out new opportunities and a longer-term vision so that they can thrive once again when this crisis passes. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, to speak to the Irish language and sport.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. I am glad that the live performance support scheme has been well received. It is a pilot scheme of €5 million, with €50 million to be launched to help next year. On the Deputy's query about the CRSS, which falls under the remit of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, and those who do not have fixed premises, the live performance support scheme was designed to bring them in. The scheme is designed to get those lighting and sound engineers working by providing opportunities for shows to go ahead. That is partly the reason that scheme was designed, to complement the CRSS, which provides support to venues in particular. Was there another question the Deputy wanted answered in that time?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Again, we have the business continuity scheme, which complements the CRSS. It is something we can look at. The adaptation grant fund has been designed to mitigate the costs incurred by tourism-specific businesses. For Fáilte Ireland to identify tourism businesses in the application process, a set of eligibility criteria for each business category was developed. Under those criteria, only restaurants and cafés with a wine retailer's on-licence or special restaurant licence were eligible to apply. Many small independent cafés serving a mainly local population are not deemed, therefore, to be predominantly tourism businesses. That is the issue there. Operationally, it might be difficult to identify all businesses, such as cafés, that would be eligible. These businesses are eligible to apply for other Government-funded Covid-19 support schemes, including the restart grant plus.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can get my officials to arrange a meeting if the Deputy wants me to.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am in the process of arranging that meeting with the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland. I believe it is in the middle of November that that meeting is actually scheduled for. I have also met in recent weeks with RTÉ, Virgin Media Ireland, TG4 and news brands. Regarding the query about the support of local media, and the Deputy mentioned Kerry, I would know myself, and the Chair would know, from when we were growing up how the local newspaper is the newspaper that sits on the coffee table for the week. I know that local radio is the first thing that is turned on in the morning. For me growing up, it was Northern Sound, the Anglo-Celt and The Northern Standard. Such media are the linchpin of a home and are the very sources of information only that some people in communities turn to. That local print and local radio are fundamentally important to our society. In recognition of that, the Taoiseach and I nominated to the Future of Media Commission Ms Siobhán Holliman, who has worked as deputy editor of the Tuam Herald but also has experience in Galway Bay FM and MidWest Radio. We have definitely seen through the Covid crisis how important trusted sources of media are. They are actually more important now than ever before. That is why the work of that commission is important when it looks at the funding and keeping such sources alive. In the shorter term, the BAI waived levies for the radio sector early this year in acknowledgement of the financial crisis that we are facing. I also gave additional funding of €2 million to the BAI's sound and vision fund under the July stimulus package, which will help support local radio and television production. I am conscious that supporting local media through advertising is hugely important and it helps deliver important safety messages to people whose medium of choice is that local newspaper or the local radio station. It helps to support and sustain that vibrant local media sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The commission is to be seen as an expert group rather than a representative group. Ms Siobhan Holliman is a recent appointment. She is in place in her capacity as an expert but she is also a member of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ. She is in place in her expert capacity.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We gave the matter consideration. As I mentioned at the time, the commission is really an expert group rather than a representative group. It is about having expertise in the group on the commission.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is the first half of this year. I want to make a comment on the issue of unions. I guarantee Deputy Munster that the Future of Media Commission will consult widely with everyone, including all stakeholders.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	They will be consulted. On Deputy Munster's second question on the levy, it relates to the first half of 2020.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We will consult the BAI on other ways of supporting the radio sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The waiver relates to the first half of 2020. We will engage with and consult the BAI about how best to support the sector.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	No, not yet.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will check. I want to get Deputy Munster the exact detail. The announcement will be made shortly. It is for the current period, but the announcement has not been made yet.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is this year. I will also be getting quarterly reports from the BAI on the radio sector. The BAI is currently running the scheme. The authority will announce results in the coming month or so. That is for the current period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Deputy asking about the exact months? I said in the announcement that it was the current period.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Will Deputy Munster repeat the question?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	If the question relates to travel to a recording studio, that is a matter to which I can give consideration.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, absolutely.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is Deputy Munster talking about the allocation of €263 million?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Government committed additional funding of €262 million for sector support in my Department in 2021 over and above the initial 2020 allocation. Along with the additional funding of €183.445 million already provided in 2020 to support these sectors, the figure represented a total allocation of €445 million across 2020 and into 2021 to assist the sectors. They were among the first to close and the last to return. I believe it is clear that the funding shows the commitment and ongoing support for these sectors.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As well as the additional funding, €183.445 million had already been provided in 2020 to support these sectors. Additional funding of €262 million was provided for the sectors supported by my Department in 2021 over and above the initial 2020 allocation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will have to get Deputy Munster the exact figure for the Covid allocation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The aim of the pilot live performance support scheme is to assist commercial venues, producers and promoters of live performance to provide employment to the workers in the creative industries. That is the very reason we designed it. The pilot scheme, with funding of €5 million, is to inform us on how we will then do the next one, for which I secured €50 million in the budget. The main objective of the scheme is to provide employment opportunities in the ticketed performance sector, allow commercial organisers of live performance to commence preparations immediately and for productions to go ahead in the near future while also complying with public health protection measures. The Senator asked about eligibility for the scheme. To be eligible for the scheme, a promoter is required to have a proven track record of live performances undertaken in the past three years; a plan to hold a live performance event that will commence in 2020; provide three years of financial accounts; be tax compliant; not ordinarily in receipt of funding from the public sector but provide evidence of matched funding required at this stage. This pilot scheme was the first of its kind. It was developed following close consultation with the sector and it will inform future similar schemes. In helping these events to go ahead, it will help employment also.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That which-----
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I can guarantee to the Senator that the Department would only give out the money if the event is going ahead. We will be watching that space very carefully because it is essential that those involved in this industry get the opportunity to work again.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Arts & Culture Recovery Task Force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is one report and I have received it. I will be giving it consideration this week and then bringing it to the Government. The Senator might be thinking of the statement I made at the previous committee that I had asked them to give me a list of their priorities ahead of the budget but that was not an interim report. As they had only set up at that stage I asked them to consult with me but the final report has just arrived. I will be examining it and then bringing it to the Government.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Very shortly.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to circuses, the Arts Council supports and funds them. Regarding the live entertainment, we will be seeing the invoices so that will be the proof. The stay and spend initiative will be in place until the end of spring. Being in level 5 shows the seriousness of the current health situation but we are hopeful that it will be of benefit when people come out of those restrictions. It is essential that we have the supports in place for when these businesses emerge from level 5, and part of that exit strategy is the supports that will be in place.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It has not been considered yet. The stay and spend initiative came about in consultation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. It is something we can examine.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I gave that commitment. I believe that meeting will happen on 16 November. I absolutely appreciate community radio. LMFM and the other station, Northern Sound, in Carrickmacross, are the stations one listens to. I will address a meeting of Craol, the community radio group, this Friday, so I very much appreciate the value of local and community radio. The BAI provided €750,000 for community radio in recognition of their value. Community radio is fundamental to our local communities, especially those in rural Ireland. Turning on the local radio station was the first thing we did in the morning. It is the only one on which we rely. There have been 30 centrally co-ordinated campaigns on Covid since March. More than half of those have included local print and almost all included local radio. I intend to ask for an analysis of the advertising spread by Government in terms of Covid-related media messaging to allow us to understand more about the spread and breadth of Government advertising and how it can feed into radio.The Deputy has given me a heads up on the questions they will be asking at that meeting on 16 November and I look forward to engaging with them.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Senator might have to come back to me on some of them. On the national cultural institutions, it has been very difficult for them. As I said, the public health restrictions and our being in level 5 are a recognition of the crisis we are in. I would very much like to see the galleries open but it is about keeping as many essential services open as possible. That is where we are at in the current level. They have been very innovative in putting material online. On the question on amateur drama, €250,000 is available to that sector in 2020 through the Arts Council.  There are four vacancies on the boards of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and RTÉ. Under the Broadcasting Act 2009, these vacancies fall to be filled by me but upon recommendation from this committee. The process of the appointments was delayed because of the general election and then the establishment of this committee. I intend to write to the Chairman this week inviting recommendations from this committee for those boards. The online safety and media regulation Bill is a very large one that will require detailed consideration, particularly by this committee. Pre-legislative scrutiny of it will be essential given the fundamental issues involved. It will come before this committee. I cannot give an exact date for that but it will be in the coming months. 
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The different platforms and all those issues related to online platforms will be looked at. I am aware of the issue concerning golf tour operators. I received communications from them. We will examine in the Department if the support scheme I announced in the context of the budget is something that can help the golf tour operators. The Senator asked another question.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I hope to establish that in the very near future. I am currently considering its membership.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is the Deputy referring to a three-year plan for the tourism sector?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The report is based on a three-year recovery plan.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That was for the tourism task force.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Would the Deputy like that approach for all of them?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Okay. The arts task force has already issued its report to me, so I cannot change it at this stage. Everyone is looking at survival and the recovery period, so we are looking beyond Covid. Intensive stakeholder engagement is happening in the process on the night-time economy task force. We are meeting the representative group for musicians and performers early next week to get feedback on how supports can reach the exact group of musicians to whom the Deputy referred.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am liaising with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on that, given that it is something that impacts both Departments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said, I look forward to engaging with representatives of local radio on 16 November. The €50 million live entertainment scheme I announced in the recent budget is designed to help the exact cohort of musicians the Deputy is talking about. My aim is to support all sectors. There are musicians now reaching out for funds who have never had to do so before. That is why we made that unprecedented funding available for them, a sector that we never had to fund before. We are currently in level 5 and that is why the restrictions are so hard. It is a reflection of the emergency that we are in. It is about providing a basket of measures to keep us safe. I have a lot of areas under my remit but churches are not one of them. I absolutely understand the need for the solace that they provide and it is something that we, as a Government, need to look at, especially as Christmas time approaches. It is not under the remit of my Department but, as a member of the Government, I will raise those concerns. I sing in my local church choir. Would it not be great to hear Christmas carols?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We have to do what is best for our health. It is about trying to find that balance. The numbers have been improving in recent days. We have to be guided by the experts as to what will keep our people safe.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Future of Media Commission had its inaugural meeting last week. When it was announced by the previous Government it was a different type of commission. We have broadened it out. The previous commission was for public service only. The wider commission encompasses all media which, I am sure the Senator will agree, is vitally important because it has to be tackled because of the changing ways in which people access news and information. I totally value local newspapers and I intend to ask for analysis of the advertising spread by the Government on Covid-related media messaging so we can understand more about it and see whether there is a way to support local newspapers. Recently, I met news brands to discuss their concerns about revenue. The NUJ recovery plan has been referred to the chair of the Future of Media Commission. With regard to RTÉ, I am liaising very closely with it and NewERA on the issue of RTÉ's finances.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the session musicians to whom the Deputy referred, I will meet the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, again next week. I will also meet sound technicians and others who work behind the scenes to make a performance happen. The purpose of the pilot scheme I initiated with €5 million was to reach those musicians, get them working again and provide supports for the crews as well as the artists. The scheme is for artists and arts workers. I am trying to engage as extensively as possible to reach them all. There are people seeking support who never thought they would have to do so. My goal is to reach as many of them as possible. It is through the extensive engagement that we will find ways to do that. As the Deputy can appreciate, the development of the pilot scheme of €5 million into a €50 million scheme for next year presents great opportunities to give support. The Covid response support scheme, CRSS, is a complementary scheme and these schemes work hand in hand. I hope I will be able to cover any areas that are not covered by the CRSS. As I say, it is about reaching as many people as possible to make sure we can put on the great performances again that we all love. On music tuition and the comparison with sport, the latter takes place outdoors whereas music tuition is held indoors. My children are doing piano lessons by Zoom. It is something they missed in the first lockdown but tuition is happening now. We are engaging with the Department of Education to ensure there is greater clarity. I do not have any specific role in this area but I am involved in cross-departmental work to see if we can get clarity on it. On local media, as I have stated previously, I recognise the value of and need for supports for the local media and I will meet the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, in November.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is an issue for the Arts Council to decide. As I have said here, the Arts Council has said that people are seeking funding and applying for bursaries who never had to previously. It is similar with the live performance support scheme. As we said at the budget, it is a sector that we never had to engage with. It is a first for us and it is a first for them. That is why that live performance support scheme is something new for the sector. The Arts Council itself will conduct that engagement.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the template and the criteria, yes.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	We are engaged in it as well. For example, I asked that DEIS schools be very much considered in the programme since I came in because I want those in disadvantaged schools to be looked after. There is an increase in that as well. Creative schools is funded by us and matched by funding from the Department of Education.
