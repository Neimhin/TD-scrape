CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Considering the grave extent of incompetencies and mistakes made to date by Tusla, can the Minister, Deputy Zappone, confirm whether or not similar mistakes of this magnitude have been made by Tusla, and whether or not Tusla made this mistake in respect of any other members of An Garda Síochána, or persons who are not members of the force? Is this an isolated incident? Or have other individuals - be they members of An Garda Síochána or not - been adversely affected by such appalling false allegations? If there are other cases, what supports can be given to these individuals and their families? Apart from the investigation that the Minister announced yesterday, what immediate steps have been taken to safeguard against this ever happening again? Surely there is no need to have to wait for the findings of an investigation or inquiry to assure the public that immediate steps are in train to ensure that this never recurs.
