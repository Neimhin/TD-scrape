CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators for their engagement on the Bill last week. Is Bille tábhachtach é an Bille um Fhorais Chultúir Náisiúnta (An Ceoláras Náisiúnta) (Leasú) 2022. It represents a crucial step forward in the journey of the National Symphony Orchestra, the choirs and the National Concert Hall. It is a critical part of the National Concert Hall's ambitious vision for the development of symphonic music, with the restored symphony orchestra taking its place in a 21st century concert hall. The legislation will also help to support the concert hall's efforts to return the orchestra to full strength by embedding it and the choirs into the corporate structure of the concert hall. The amendment to increase the limit of the State indemnity is a necessary measure that will support our cultural institutions to continue to present exhibitions of international quality to the Irish public. Gabhaim buíochas less na Seanadóirí as a mbreithiúnas ar an mBille seo. I look forward to commencing it in its entirety as soon as possible after its enactment.
