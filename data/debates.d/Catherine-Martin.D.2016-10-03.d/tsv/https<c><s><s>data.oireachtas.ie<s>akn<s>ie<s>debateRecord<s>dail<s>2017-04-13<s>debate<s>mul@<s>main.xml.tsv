CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	This question relates to the capital plan 2016-21 and its use of the word "sustainability". It is often the case that despite the prolific use of the word "sustainability" throughout the document and particularly in the fiscal and policy context section, it seems to primarily and solely incorporate what could be termed fiscal sustainability rather than a wider definition which might include concepts such as environmental sustainability. Will the Minister outline for the House what role he believes environmental sustainability plays in the provision of capital expenditure as an underlying base concept and not just a discrete section of the capital plan?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	While I appreciate that the capital plan features a number of measures to tackle climate change and deal with environmental sustainability, regrettably, environment is still considered a "selected driver" of long-term public investment requirements. The importance of climate change within the Government's capital plan is currently considered as only requiring intervention in respect of energy efficiency, renewable energy and flood prevention, despite the fact that both the Climate Change Advisory Council set up under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have advised that what is needed is "a major societal and economic transformation". The Environmental Protection Agency today delivered the catastrophic news that we will fail to meet our 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and that we are completely off target for our low-carbon transition by 2050 set out in the climate change Act. While this is first and foremost an environmental disaster, it also has the potential to be an economic one which would have a major impact on our fiscal sustainability. How is the Minister's Department preparing for the possibility of up to more than â‚¬5 billion in fines if we do not hit our emissions targets, a possibility which seems all the more real after today's news? Failure to meet these targets will have a serious impact on the economy and must be accounted for in the public purse. Where will the Minister find this money?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With respect, the report today from the EPA would suggest there is a huge gulf between the Government's words and the Government's action when it comes to climate change. It appears to me that the Government has reached a crossroads. It can accept the fact that, without a major turnaround in policy, we will not meet our emissions targets, which needless to say, for the sake of our children and grandchildren, is a road which should never be travelled, but in which case, for prudent fiscal responsibility and sustainability, the Minister's Department needs to provide a comprehensive plan as to how he will account for the money for significant fines imposed on the State for not meeting these targets. Alternatively, the Government needs a paradigm shift in how it thinks about sustainability. Environmental sustainability must not be confined only to the Department of the Minister, Deputy Naughten. Our public expenditure needs to be on sustainable infrastructure, for example, on the six cycleways proposed for Dublin instead of 1,500 km of roads, as IBEC has proposed. We are on a continuous upward trajectory on emissions, when we really need to be going in the opposite direction. Which will it be? Will we hit our targets or will we not? Does the Minister have an expenditure plan for either scenario?
