CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe atá i láthair inniu as an bpictiúr soiléir atá léirithe acu i dtaobh céard atá i gceist le hoideachas a chur ar fáil ar na scoileanna oileánda. Aontaím le Bríd Ní Dhonncha go bhfuil an scoil i gcroílár gach pobal, go háirithe ar na hoileáin. Muna ndéanfaimid beart de réir briathar san Oireachtas, agus má ligfimid ár maidí le scruth seachas bheith ag díriú ar thábhacht na Gaeltachta agus ar thábhacht na scoileanna seo, beimid uilig ciontach as slad a dhéanamh ar anam agus ar chuisle an náisiúin seo. Céard is féidir a dhéanamh chun múinteoirí óga a mhealladh agus a choimeád ar na hoileáin? An bhfuil maoiniú le haghaidh taistil i gceist? An bhfuil níos mó teagmháil agus taistil idir na hoileáin ag teastáil? An bhfuil deacrachtaí leis an idirbhliain a chur ar fáil sna meánscoileanna? On Mr. Gilmore's dealings with the Department of Education and Skills and the Irish and bilingual grants, what is the Department's reason? I do not understand why these schools are not getting them. Ms McHugh's submission mentions that Gairmscoil Mhic Diarmada on Arranmore does not have a school completion officer. Why is that? Do I presume that they do not have a home school liaison officer either? Those two roles are crucial. Regarding granting independent status to Coláiste Naomh Eoin, I do not know the reason that has not been granted. I refer this to the delegates. I am a teacher myself. It must be nightmarish dealing with it from an administrative point of view. In the day-to-day role as a teacher that is the first thing learned off by heart for the most basic of things. I still know my teaching roll number. It is beyond ridiculous. I do not know how a principal is expected to run a school without that independent status or being able to have reports and exams electronically.I know from my experience as a teacher that the Department of Education and Skills is constantly saying that we must move with the times yet here is a school being prevented from doing so. It is being pulled back all the time. What is the Department's defence for that?
