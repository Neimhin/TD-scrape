CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I do not know where to start. I thank the delegates for attending.  Table 3 screams at me, as I am sure it does for everyone. As Mr. Condon stated, ten of the 16 posts are in child and adolescent psychiatry in places such as Cork, Sligo-Leitrim, Carlow-Kilkenny, Donegal and Longford-Westmeath. We are failing the children affected and their families. Everyone agrees that there is a problem in recruitment and retention and that the HSE has recognised the deficits, but who should the committee invite in order that we can tell them that not enough is being done and to, please, do more for the families affected? It is not good enough. What can be done to accelerate the lengthy recruitment process? The CAAC meets ten times a year. Mr. Condon stated he would sign approvals within 72 hours but that he would then have to wait for the CAAC to meet, which could take one month.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is there anything we can do about that process of waiting for CAAC to meet? Does it need to meet more than ten times a year? Would that speed up the process? I see that psychiatry has one of the highest percentages of non-permanent consultant posts, at 20%. Why is this? What differentiates mental health from other branches of medicine? Professor Frank Keane's report mentioned that a contributing factor to the crisis was the way the jobs were advertised. Has the job description improved? With this timeline of recruitment, there seem to be delays at each stage. It is the most complicated process.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is like a roller-coaster. We are brought back to where we started. How does that compare to international best practice?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Professor Murray agrees and has said before that it may need to be reviewed. What is frustrating is that it seems to take coming into this meeting to see that it needs to be reviewed.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Has Professor Murray started the review on this?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	When will that conclude? Is there a timeline?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Deputy Buckley raised the retirements that are coming down the line and Professor Murray said we can do better in anticipating retirement and that we should probably ask people if they are considering retiring or to give a year's notice. I cannot believe we are not doing that already. It is not rocket science, with all respect. It is an unnecessary failing that can be avoided.
