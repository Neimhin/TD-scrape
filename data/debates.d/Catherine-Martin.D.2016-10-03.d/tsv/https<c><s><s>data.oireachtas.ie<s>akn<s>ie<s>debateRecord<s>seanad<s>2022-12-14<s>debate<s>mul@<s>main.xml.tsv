CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí as cabhrú leis an mBille seo a chur chun cinn go pras. As I have outlined previously, this is a technical enabling Bill but its outcome is important in that it allows for the continued funding of Fáilte Ireland's work in the area of tourism product development. I look forward to working alongside Fáilte Ireland as we continue to further the development of Ireland's tourism offering.  As Senator Garvey said, I am the Minister with responsibility for tourism but I am also a green Minister and deputy leader of the Green Party, which I would never forget. I am working on the development of a sustainable tourism policy and I see amazing opportunities ahead as we emerge from Covid. My engagement with the industry tells me that stakeholders want to embrace sustainability and put the green into our Emerald Isle. We have so much to offer here in terms of slow tourism and long stays but we must make sure that the protection of our environment is at the core of what we do. This new tourism policy will seek to support sustainable economic development in communities throughout the country while protecting our environment and natural resources. It will also aim to promote a greater spread into the regions and encourage longer stays. I will raise the concerns articulated by Senator Garvey, some of which are the responsibility of Fáilte Ireland while others are under the remit of local authorities.  I acknowledge the concerns of Senator Cassells regarding accommodation. We are in the middle of what is, by some distance, the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the State as we give refuge and shelter to those who are fleeing the most horrific circumstances in Ukraine. However, as I said last week in this Chamber, I am very aware of the concerns relating to the wider tourism industry and am engaging on a consistent basis with the sector. My officials and myself are also engaging with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Across the board in government, we are working urgently to source alternative accommodation from agencies, NGOs, and local authorities. I am cognisant of the need to ensure tourist accommodation is available before the peak tourism season begins. That said, we are resolute in our solidarity and support for Ukraine.  Senator Carrigy expressed a similar concern with regard to accommodation and also referred to the VAT rate in the tourism sector. As I have said previously, the latter is something that we will keep under constant review. We may have to make a call on it in the new year. I thank Senator Boyhan for his kind words.
