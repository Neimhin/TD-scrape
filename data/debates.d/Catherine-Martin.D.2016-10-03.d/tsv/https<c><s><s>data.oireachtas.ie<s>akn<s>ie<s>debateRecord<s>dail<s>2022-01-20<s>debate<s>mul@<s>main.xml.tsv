CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together. I will begin by thanking the members of the Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for their work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. The report of the joint committee demonstrated the importance of pre-legislative scrutiny, and Oireachtas committees, to the parliamentary and democratic process. I am conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online, that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU-wide basis, and of questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the online safety commissioner. In light of the recommendations of the joint committee in its pre-legislative scrutiny report, I am examining how these difficult issues can be addressed. As I announced last week, I will shortly establish an expert advisory group to report within 90 days on these matters, with recommendations for how best to address them. I intend to announce the membership of the group in the coming days. Following the report of the group, I will consider whether and how to give effect to any recommendations through amendments to the legislation on Committee Stage. Regarding the establishment of coimisiún na meán, it is essential that it has sufficient staff with experience and skills at the appropriate level in order to effectively carry out its regulatory functions. As Deputies will be aware, the commission will have an expansive remit. In the first instance, it will take on the current functions of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland in regulating both television and radio broadcasters. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill provides that the commission will also be responsible for the regulation of video on-demand services and, through the online safety commissioner, for oversight of the new regulatory framework for online safety. The commission will also have roles in respect of the protection of children, research, education, media literacy and journalistic and creative supports. In carrying out these roles the commission will support and promote an open, trusted and pluralistic media and online environment. Given the importance of the functions and role of the commission, the Government has approved its establishment on an administrative basis prior to the enactment of the Bill. While the Commission will ultimately be funded through levies on regulated services, I secured €5.5 million in budget 2022 for start-up funding to support the establishment of the commission. My officials are working with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to start the process of recruiting key staff for the commission. Funding and commencing the recruitment process in advance of the formal establishment of the commission will enable these personnel to hit the ground running and ensure that operations commence at the earliest possible date following the enactment of the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The expert advisory group will be examining a proposal that will raise complex legal and practical matters, as I mentioned earlier. For example, in one context there is the complexity in the Irish constitutional and legal context of upholding fundamental rights and respecting due process requirements for complainants, online services and the uploaders of content subject to complaint. From a practical perspective, there are questions regarding the design and resource implications. For that reason, the expert advisory group I will announce in the coming days will need to be able to draw from a wide and diverse range of expertise and experience. I am seeking: legal expertise, especially in the complexities of regulating the online world; knowledge of and expertise in the operation of complaints systems in other contexts; experience in the protection of children's rights in an online environment; and knowledge of and expertise in practical requirements, such as resourcing and organisation required to operate an individual complaints system.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Disinformation is primarily being dealt with through the EU code of practice on disinformation, which is linked to the forthcoming digital services Act. Deputy Naughten is aware that this is still under negotiation. On the question of getting it right, this commission must have real teeth, as it does, including powers of investigation, search warrants, fines of up to €20 million or a percentage of turnover, whichever is more. There is also the possibility of criminal liability and the taking down of the platform. On the timetable, I hope to move as swiftly as possible with this. It will be initiated in the Seanad and I have written to the committee, of which Deputy Munster is a member, to ask for time for the Bill to be considered. The recommendations of the expert advisory group will be taken account of on Committee Stage. I hope that will help speed up the process. On the EU-wide base, the major issue is the 450 million people that we would represent if the platform is based in Ireland, as we would be the country in charge of that regulation. That is why all eyes are on us.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value the sector brings to all Irish citizens and how art is an inherent part of Ireland's cultural identity. The importance of Irish culture, art and productions as a whole cannot be understated. It contributes to individual and societal well-being, as well as contributing to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. I was delighted that as part of the national economic recovery plan I secured a commitment from Government to prioritise the development of a basic income pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. Funding for the basic income for the arts pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for budget 2022 and I allocated €25 million to launch the pilot scheme this year.  Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department held a stakeholder consultation last month on the basic income for the arts to provide the arts sector, those working in it and resource bodies and representative organisations with the opportunity to engage with the policy development and share their views. Over 150 participants from 50 artists and arts worker resource and representative bodies came together to discuss the proposal and provide their views and feedback to me and my Department. This included three participants from the MEAI. Following the forum, I launched a public consultation on the pilot basic income for the arts on Thursday, 6 January. The consultation will remain open until 27 January. The purpose of the online consultation is to ensure that the public, artists and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to the policy development of the pilot scheme and to offer suggestions from their experiences as artists, art workers and members of resource organisations on key issues, such as scheme objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities. To date, the public consultation has received over 500 submissions, reflecting the significant level of interest in this new policy intervention.  I am aware of the feedback received from the organisation referred to by the Deputy and there will be a stream for developing artists but it will be for a smaller number of individuals than the practising artists and creative art worker streams. It is important to include a number of developing artists in the scheme in order that the research programme can determine the impact of a basic income at all stages of career development.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My entire approach to the pilot scheme is that, by its nature, it is a research project. I do not intend it to be exclusive, but rather as inclusive as possible. It is a three-year research project to determine the impact of a basic income on artists and arts workers. As part of that research, we will need to determine what impact a basic income will have on the entire life cycle of artists from the point when they begin their careers to the point they retire. On that basis, it is critical that we include emerging artists. I do not wish to exclude emerging artists. It is critical that they are included in order that we know how this will impact those at the start of the journey up until they become a practising artist. On supports, earlier today I am glad to say that I announced a new music and entertainment business assistance scheme. It is part of a suite of measures. The grant will be paid for six months from January until June. It is a scheme that is simpler and easier to access. It is for self-employed performers, sole traders and businesses in the music industry.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. The opinions of the MEAI are, as I said, included in the over 500 submissions I have received and will be considered by the Department. The fairness to which the Deputy referred is at the heart of the scheme. It is important to note that applications for the basic income for artists, BIA, scheme will involve a non-competitive process. Therefore, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria he or she will be included in a randomised selection process. I wish to again state that this is a pilot research project and we hope to learn from it. There was strong support at the stakeholder forum that new and emerging artists should have access to the scheme and be in a position to focus on their practice from the outset of their careers.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Ag teacht leis an treoir athbhreithnithe um sheirbhísí meán closamhairc, foráiltear sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne a foilsíodh le déanaí go bhféadfadh coimisiún na meán tobhach ábhair a ghearradh ar sheirbhísí teilifíse agus físe ar éileamh atá ar fáil sa Stát chun tacú le léiriú cláir chlosamhairc nua i réimsí éagsúla lena n-áirítear an Ghaeilge agus cultúr na hÉireann, athrú aeráide, agus comhionannas, éagsúlacht agus cuimsiú. Forálann an Bille freisin go n-úsáidfí íosmhéid de 25% den mhaoiniú a bhaileofaí sa tobhach ábhair le haghaidh léiriú chláir Ghaeilge. Ní bhainfeadh aon tobhach ach le hioncam a thuillfí laistigh den Stát agus ghearrfaí é go cothrom ar gach seirbhís a dhíríonn ar mhargadh na hÉireann, rud a chiallaíonn go mbeadh soláthraithe seirbhísí meán in Éirinn ar nós RTÉ agus Virgin Media faoi réir an tobhaigh. Ina theannta sin, bheadh seirbhísí in Éirinn agus seirbhísí atá lonnaithe san Aontas Eorpach i dteideal iarratas a dhéanamh ar an gciste um léiriú ábhair a bhunófaí mar thoradh ar an tobhach. Bheadh rioscaí chomh maith le buntáistí ann mar gheall air seo agus dá réir sin, ní chuirfí tús leis na forálacha tobhaigh sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne ach amháin sa chás go léireofaí i dtaighde déanta ag coimisiún na meán go mbeadh tabhairt isteach tobhaigh den sórt sin ina fhoinse maoinithe cothrom agus inmharthana d’ábhar Éireannach. Tuigim go bhfuil údaráis na Fraince chun oibleagáidí infheistíochta a fhorchur ar sheirbhísí sruthaithe ar nós Netflix agus Amazon. Ar mhaithe le comhsheasmhacht agus trédhearcacht socraíodh gurbh é tobhach ábhair an cur chuige is oiriúnaí don cheist i gcomhthéacs na hÉireann. Ar nós na scéime fuaime agus físe atá ann faoi láthair, ligfeadh an múnla atá beartaithe sa Bhille um Rialáil Sábháilteachta agus Meán Ar Líne do léiritheoirí dul san iomaíocht le haghaidh maoinithe ar bhonn trédhearcach agus iomaíocht de réir chritéir oibiachtúla. Ní bheadh sé seo amhlaidh maidir le hoibleagáidí infheistíochta, ina mbeadh cinntí maidir le cineál an ábhair a bheadh le maoiniú le déanamh ag an gcuideachta faoi réir na hoibleagáide infheistíochta.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Mar eolas, i mí an Mheithimh 2021, d'fhoilsigh Rialtas na Fraince foraithne inar leagadh amach na hoibleagáidí atá ar sheirbhísí físe ar éileamh ar nós Netflix, Amazon Prime Video agus Disney+ maidir le saothair Fhrancacha agus Eorpacha a mhaoiniú. Sonraítear san fhoraithne go bhfuil ar sheirbhísí síntiúis ar a laghad 20% dá n-ioncam bliantúil sa Fhrainc a chur ar fáil d'fhorbairt léiriú scánnánaíochta nó closamhairc ó thíortha Eorpacha nó ón bhFrainc. Is fiú a lua go bhfuil oibleagáidí i bhfeidhm cheana féin faoi chreat rialála reatha na hÉireann maidir le craoltóirí. Mar shampla, caithfidh craoltóirí 10% den am craolta nó 10% den bhuiséad clár a leithdháileadh ar léiriúcháin neamhspleácha. Maidir le hoibleagáidí infheistíochta ar sheirbhísí físe ar éileamh, ar mhaithe le comhsheasmhacht agus trédhearcacht, socraíodh gurb é tobhach ábhair an cur chuige is oiriúnaí don cheist i gcomhthéacs na hÉireann, mar a dúirt mé cheana. Ar nós na scéime fuaime agus físe atá ann faoi láthair, ligfidh an múnla atá beartaithe sa Bhille um rialáil sábháilteachta agus meán ar líne do na léiritheoirí dul san iomaíocht le haghaidh maoinithe ar bhonn trédhearcach agus iomaíoch de réir critéir oibiachtúla. Ní bheadh sé seo amhlaidh maidir le hoibleagáidí infheistíochta ina mbeadh cinntí déanta maidir le cineál an ábhair. Ina theannta sin, faoi dhlí an AE, ní féidir oibleagáid infheistíochta a thabhairt isteach bunaithe ar chraobh léirithe faoi leith san Eoraip. Is féidir liom níos mó info a chur ar fáil don Teachta.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Leanfaidh mé ar aghaidh mar ní raibh mé críochnaithe. Má tá aon eolas breise ag teastáil ón Teachta, cuirfidh mo Roinn é ar aghaidh chuige. Faoi dhlí an AE, ní féidir oibleagáid infheistíochta a thabhairt isteach bunaithe ar chraobh léirithe faoi leith san Eoraip. Is féidir oibleagáid a thabhairt isteach chun ábhar a léiriú nó infheistíocht a dhéanamh in ábhair i dteanga áirithe, mar atá ann sa Fhrainc, faoi chásdhlí an AE toisc gur cuspóir chun leasa chách é teanga oifigiúil ballstáit a chaomhnú agus a chur chun cinn. Mar a dúirt mé níos luaithe, cinntíonn ár gcur chuige maidir leis an dtobhach ar léiriú ábhair cheana féin go gcaitear ar a laghad 25% den airgead a bhailítear a chaitheamh ar léiriú ábhair Ghaeilge. Is fiú a lua chomh maith go gcaithfidh aon oibleagáid infheistíochta a bheith le haghaidh léiriúcháin ó thíortha Eorpacha agus ní gá go mbeadh ábhair Éireannach i gceist. Is dócha go gcomhlíonfadh go leor soláthróirí móra atá bunaithe san AE atá ag díriú ar Éirinn an riachtanas seo cheana féin tríd a n-infheistíocht reatha. Mar sin, is dócha nach mbeadh beart den sórt sin ina bhuntáiste d'Éirinn.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Thanks are due to the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Tourism, Culture, Arts, Sport and Media for their extensive work on the pre-legislative scrutiny report on the general scheme of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill. This included 33 recommendations, which shows how complex and important this legislation is. One of those recommendations was that an individual complaints mechanism for harmful online content be provided. This is a matter I have been considering closely for some time. The issue of providing for avenues of redress in terms of individual pieces of content in the online world is complex. The approach in the development of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill to date has been to provide the online safety commissioner with the power to require that regulated online services have effective complaints mechanisms in place with full powers of audit and investigation provided to the commissioner in that respect. The Bill also provides for a super-complaints mechanism whereby nominated bodies may notify the commissioner of concerns regarding a designated online service's compliance with an online safety code or relating to the availability of harmful online content on a service.  I am very conscious that the introduction of an individual complaints mechanism raises a number of complex practical and legal issues, including in terms of the sheer volume of content online. I am also conscious that Ireland will be regulating a number of services on an EU-wide basis, which involves regulating on behalf of a population of 450 million, and of questions relating to due process requirements and how quickly decisions could reasonably be made by the online safety commissioner. In light of the recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee, I am examining how these issues can be addressed. I announced last week that I will shortly establish an expert advisory group. I hope the membership of the group will be announced in the coming days. This group will report on this matter within 90 days with recommendations as to how best to address this issue. Following the report of the group, I will consider how to give effect to any recommendations through amendments to the Bill.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	It is exactly for all of those reasons that I have established this expert group to examine the proposals. There are significant complex legal and practical issues in this area. For example, in the constitutional and legal context, there is the complexity of upholding fundamental rights and respecting due process requirements for complainants, online services and the uploaders of content that is the subject of a complaint. I direct the Deputy to the binding codes and the real teeth this commissioner will have. Provision is to be made for fines of up to €20 million or 10% of turnover, whichever is greater, for criminal liability for those involved, search warrants and the blocking of platforms. Within the expert advisory group, I hope to have the legal expertise required, particularly with regard to complexities of regulating the online world; knowledge of, and expertise in, the operation of complaints systems in other regulatory contexts; experience in the protection of children's rights in an online environment; and knowledge of, and expertise in, the practical requirements, such as resourcing an organisation required to operate an individual complaints system. That is what I hope to have in this expert group.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	That is the intention. I spoke previously about the detail and real teeth of this commissioner. We have already started the recruitment process for the commissioner, in parallel with the progress of the Bill through both Houses. I will be initiating the Bill in the Seanad, and I have written to the relevant joint committee in that regard. That we have started the recruitment process for the online safety and media commissioner shows how seriously this Government is taking this issue. This Government and I will always seek to protect children online rather than the technology companies. This is about safety online, and that is where our focus is.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I must clarify that policy responsibility for the core issues at the heart of this matter, namely, the protection of architectural heritage, urban regeneration and planning legislation, rests with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. Implementation of such policies on the ground falls, to a great degree, to local authorities, which in this instance is Dublin City Council. The local authorities have particular responsibilities and powers under the planning Acts regarding the safeguarding of protected structures, such as the Iveagh Market, and development proposals affecting such structures. Our heritage and cultural offering, including our built heritage, is an important underpinning of the wider tourism offering, but any possible role for my Department or the tourism agencies regarding the Iveagh Market might only arise, once any legal issues have been resolved, at a later stage in the process, should a tourism-related development be proposed or advanced. This question from the Deputy concerns my responsibility in this regard in the context of tourism. In that case, in line with its tourism development functions, Fáilte Ireland could consider the proposal and any possible agency supports. My Department's role concerning tourism lies primarily in the area of national tourism policy development and in securing resources to assist the tourism agencies, Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland, in implementing that policy. Accordingly, the development and enhancement of our tourism product offering and related funding decisions are operational matters for Fáilte Ireland. Commenting more generally on the role of heritage and culture as part of the overall tourism offering, Fáilte Ireland has advised that prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic more than 70% of overseas tourists to Ireland visited sites of historical or cultural interest. Accordingly, to develop more participative experiences that bring local culture and heritage to life, Fáilte Ireland has prioritised capital investment in projects that will deliver innovative and interactive experiences in which our visitors can immerse themselves. With specific regard to Dublin and Fáilte Ireland's supports to enhance the city's heritage and cultural offering, examples include the Dublin surprising stories small grants scheme. This is offered in tandem with continued support by Fáilte Ireland for tourism issues in Dublin.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In her absence, I commend Deputy Bríd Smith on the work she is doing on this issue. Again, I remind Deputy Boyd Barrett that the policy responsibility for the core issues at the heart of this matter, namely, the protection of architectural heritage, urban regeneration and planning legislation, do not lie with my Department but with that of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Any role for my Department or the tourism agencies regarding the Iveagh Market would come at a later stage in the process, once any legal issues have been resolved, if a tourism-related development is proposed or advanced. The role of my Department comes later, once the legal issues have been resolved.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The Department held the remit for heritage before I became the Minister, but that responsibility has now moved over to the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. I am looking at Deputy Bríd Smith's question before me and it directly relates to the tourism aspect. My role does not come into play until the legal issue is worked out. As I said, the architectural heritage responsibility rests with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, while urban planning and development policy is primarily a matter for local authorities. County and city development plans are drawn up by the local authorities in accordance with their functions under the Planning and Development Acts. I reiterate that the heritage responsibility is no longer with my Department but with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 78, 81, 99, 100, 120, 127, 128, 130 and 152 together. The number of questions on this issue goes to show the interest in and support for our arts in this House, which I welcome. As Minister with responsibility for arts and culture, I am conscious of the value that this sector brings to all Irish citizens and how art is an inherent part of Ireland's cultural identity. The importance of Irish culture and art and Irish productions as a whole cannot be overstated. They contribute to individual and societal well-being, as well as to Ireland's reputation as a country with a rich cultural history and output. The intrinsic value of culture and the arts to society has been particularly evident during the pandemic. I was delighted that as part of the economic recovery plan, I secured a commitment from the Government to prioritise the development of a basic income pilot scheme for the arts and cultural sector. This was the number one recommendation from the arts and culture recovery task force. Against this backdrop, and my own experience of the arts, funding for the basic income pilot scheme was a key priority of mine for budget 2022 and I secured €25 million to launch the pilot scheme this year. The basic income for the arts will allow artists and creative arts workers to focus on their creative practice and to help support the arts as they recover from the devastating impact of the Covid pandemic. Stakeholder engagement has been central to my Department's response to the pandemic. As the Deputies are aware, my Department held a stakeholder consultation last month on the basic income for the arts, to provide the arts sector, those working in it and the resource bodies and representative organisations with the opportunity to engage with the policy development and share their views. Over 150 participants from 50 artists and arts workers resource and representative bodies came together to discuss the proposal and provide their views and feedback. Following the forum, I launched a public consultation on the pilot basic income for the arts on Thursday, 6 January. The consultation will remain open until 27 January. The purpose of the online consultation is to ensure that the general public, artists and those working in the arts and culture sector have the opportunity to contribute to the policy development. To date, we have received over 500 submissions on the public consultation. It is important that we get their suggestions from their experiences as artists, arts workers and members of organisations on the key issues such as the scheme's objectives, eligibility criteria, supporting emerging artists and participant responsibilities. The selection process, application details and rate of payment for recipients of the basic income for the arts pilot scheme will be finalised following the stakeholder engagement and online consultation. However, I can confirm the following. Participation in the scheme will not be based on a means test. It will be a non-competitive process and, as such, once a person satisfies the eligibility criteria, he or she will be included in a randomised selection process. A number of unsuccessful applicants will be invited to participate in a control group to facilitate a comprehensive ex post appraisal of the pilot in due course. Proposals for the parameters of the scheme will be finalised in light of the stakeholder engagement. Eligibility will be based on the legal definition of the arts as contained in the Arts Act, namely, that "arts" means any creative or interpretative expression, whether traditional or contemporary, in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes. There will be a number of ways of demonstrating eligibility, including but not limited to membership of a relevant representative or resource organisation. Applications will be through an online portal. The intention of the pilot scheme is to study whether a basic income contributes to ensuring the arts sector remains intact, provides artists and creatives with the opportunity to increase their practice, minimising the loss of skills and contributing to the sector's gradual regrowth, with ongoing benefits, social and economic, local and national. On the timeline for the launch of the pilot, the Deputy will appreciate that this is a major policy intervention requiring significant resources to develop a coherent policy and to operationalise. This is a significant undertaking and work is ongoing to develop the online portal and review the hundreds of submissions received on the topic. I have always stated that my ambition is to open the scheme for applications in the first quarter of 2022 and that remains the case. Once applications have been received, these will need to be assessed for eligibility and I expect that process would take at least six to eight weeks depending on the volume of applications. On that basis, I would expect to see the first payments issue in April. That timeline could be subject to change if the volume of applications is very high.However, I reiterate that the basic income for the arts scheme is a key priority of mine and we in the Department are devoting as many resources to it as possible to ensure that we reach our goal of opening for applications in the first quarter.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The basic income for the arts pilot scheme will bring new life and support to the arts and cultural sector and I hope it will provide an important legacy for our artists and creatives. In addition to this measure, I have also secured continued investment of €130 million for the Arts Council in 2022. Combined, these measures will significantly contribute to the development of the arts in Ireland.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will revert to all of the Deputies.
