CatherineMartin	Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Ruane for tabling amendments Nos. 145 and 146 regarding the definition of cyberbullying in the Bill. The current definition in section 44, inserting section 139A into the Broadcasting Bill 2009, was arrived at through extensive consultation and engagement with the Office of the Attorney General.It refers to online content by which a person bullies or humiliates another person and subjects that definition to a risk test regarding risk to a person's life or risk of significant harm to a person's physical or mental health where the harm is reasonably foreseeable. The proposed amendments would have the effect of replacing the current definition with a narrower definition focused on repeated abusive behaviour and to subject that definition to a reasonable person test. In this regard, I believe that the content intended to be covered by the amendment is covered by the category of offence-specific content which refers in turn to the updated offence of harassment under the Harassment, Harmful Communications and Related Offences Act 2020, Coco's Law, under section 45 of the Bill inserting Schedule 3 into the 2009 Act. The category of harmful online content regarding cyberbullying is intended to be broader than the matters covered by Coco's Law but subject to the risk test. I do not believe it would be desirable to limit the definition of cyberbullying in this manner and I do not propose to accept the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I understand the Senator's concerns but I believe the provision is sufficiently precise to avoid the issues she raised. It was done with extensive consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. It was considered in-depth during drafting. Therefore, I will not accept the amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The effect of amendment No. 147 would be to insert another category of harmful online content regarding disinformation. I do not propose to accept the amendment for a number of reasons. Disinformation and false information intended to mislead is being tackled on an EU-wide basis through a number of mechanisms, including the Digital Services Act, political agreement on which was agreed on Friday, 22 April. The Government has decided that Coimisiún na Meán will be the digital service co-ordinator which is the primary regulator under the Digital Services Act. My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has led Ireland's negotiations on the Digital Services Act.  The EU code of practice on disinformation is a Commission initiative which has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players to sign up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act. In addition, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in DCU and which has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. While I note the intent of the amendment, the matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the Digital Services Act in Ireland. I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage. Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, Coimisiún na Meán would act as the primary regulator termed the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act. It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and the approaches of Coimisiún na Meán and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. The Digital Services Act is still undergoing negotiation on a number of technical matters. The final text of the regulation is not available. Should the code of practice on disinformation evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the Digital Services Act, as proposed by the European Commission, I would expect that Coimisiún na Meán would have a role to play in its capacity as the digital services co-ordinator. There is a very specific problem with disinformation which is designed to influence the results of elections and referendums as these processes are at the heart of our democracy. The Minister for Housing, Local Government, and Heritage asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals for inclusion in the Electoral Reform Bill around the protection of our electoral process against disinformation, with a view to bringing amendments to that Bill which, I understand, is due to commence Committee Stage in the Dáil next week.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On the Senator's query, there would be no need to revisit this legislation because the Digital Services Act will provide for it itself.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank Senator Ruane for her amendment regarding a role for the Oireachtas joint committee in requesting that an coimisiún consider making a proposal for a new category of harmful online content. As it stands, the Bill provides at section 44 - inserting sections 139B and 139C into the Broadcasting Act 2009 - that it is within an coimisiún's sole discretion as to whether it considers making a proposal to the Minister for a further category of harmful online content. No specific role is provided for the Minister, the Government or indeed the Oireachtas joint committee at that point of the process. The reason for this was to safeguard the independence of an coimisiún, particularly regarding a matter as sensitive as proposals for further categories of harmful online content, and to ensure that the process for making a proposal under these provisions was separated from the political process. In this regard, the directive sets a high bar regarding the independence of regulatory bodies and requires member states to ensure that they are both legally distinct from the government and functionally independent of their respective governments and of any other public or private body. In light of these considerations, I am not proposing to accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendment. The amendment would require an coimisiún, when undertaking a public consultation on a proposal for a new category of harmful online content, to publish the draft proposal four weeks before the consultation begins and to require that such a consultation should be at least four weeks. I do not propose to accept the amendment as it appears to be overly prescriptive. In the first instance, it would be more usual for a public body to give notice that a public consultation was commencing, rather than that a public consultation would commence within a specified time. I do not see the value in an coimisiún publishing a draft proposal for a new category of content without at the same time or shortly thereafter commencing its consultation period on the proposal. I also do not foresee circumstances where an coimisiún would seek to artificially foreclose or artificially shorten a public consultation.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	The amendment would provide that where an coimisiún has submitted a proposal for an additional category of harmful online content to the Minister, the Minister may request that an coimisiún reconsider or review the proposal. The relevant section in the Bill as initiated provides that the Minister may request that an coimisiún review the proposal. I do not accept this amendment as I do not see a substantial difference between the meanings of reconsider and review in this context. It is difficult to see how an coimisiún would reconsider a proposal without also reviewing it.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senators. In terms of amendment No. 164 regarding a minimum age requirement for children, it is important to acknowledge that there is a very real issue with young children accessing online services that simply were not designed with them in mind. It is an issue that I am particularly aware of both as a parent of young children and as chair of the National Advisory Council for Online Safety, which recently released a comprehensive report on children's online safety. Finding workable solutions in this area raises a number of complex issues, including privacy and data protection matters that would need to be resolved before a solution could be effectively implemented. In this regard, it is useful to note that an EU-funded pilot called euCONSENT is in development. The pilot aims to deliver a system for online age verification and parental consent, which balances the rights of children and the need to protect them from online harm and age-inappropriate content. The outcome of this pilot will inform any approach taken to this issue at an EU and national level. While I cannot accept this amendment, I will be asking an coimisiún to look at this issue as a priority in conjunction with the Data Protection Commission and to identify potential options and solutions to dealing with this complex issue. Not everything can be dealt with in a single item of legislation, but what matters is that we put the framework in place. Regarding amendment No. 163, I note that section 139K of the 2009 Act, as inserted by this Bill, provides coimisiún na meán with the power to create binding safety codes to ensure "that service providers take any measures in relation to commercial communications on their services that are appropriate to protect the interests of users of their services, and in particular the interests of children". Further to this, section 139K specifically provides that, in respect of providers of video-sharing platform services, that an coimisiún shall make online safety codes requiring those providers to comply with the requirements of Article 9(1) of the revised directive in respect of advertisements directly placed by the provider and user-generated advertisements. This includes a long list of requirements, including regarding the protection of children. As such, given the extensive provision already in the Bill for the regulation of online commercial communication, I will not be accepting this amendment. I understand the intention of amendment No. 165 in seeking to clarify that the definition of age-inappropriate content used in the Bill should not preclude educational material. However, I do not believe that this provision would have this effect due to its framing with regard to the capabilities, development, rights and interests of children. Accordingly, I am not accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	With regard to amendment No. 163, as I said, there is provision in section 139K of the 2009 Act specifically in respect of providers of video-sharing platform services. We know the coimisiún shall make online safety codes requiring those providers to comply with Article 9(1) of the revised directive, which has an extensive list of requirements, including the protections for children. With regard to amendment No. 164, as I said, it really is a complex issue. I agree with the intent of the Senators' amendment but I do not believe it hits on a workable solution. As I said, there are active moves at the EU to identify practical solutions to these matters. In addition to this, last week, the European Commission proposed a new regulation on combating child sexual abuse. As part of this, the Commission foresees an obligation for certain online services to conduct risk assessments and take risk mitigation measures in respect of age verification. Therefore, work is being done in that regard but I do not think this is a workable solution in this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	These amendments would require an coimisiún to have regard to a number of legislative instruments when designating a relevant online service to which online safety codes may be applied. Amendment No. 166 would appear to duplicate provisions already in law and, as such, I do not accept the amendment. As I stated earlier in this debate, section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún will already be subject to provisions of that Act. As I said only yesterday in this Chamber, I would expect that an coimisiún would not only comply with section 42 of that Act but also, in accordance with the spirit of the Act, demonstrate a culture and practice of respect of human rights. With regard to amendment No. 167, I understand the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was ratified by the State and entered into force in 2018. Accordingly, similar to other UN conventions that have been ratified and entered into, the State is legally bound to the obligations set out in the treaties. I do not see the rationale for inserting a reference to the UNCRPD in the context of the designation process. The effect of amendment No. 168 would be to require an coimisiún to have regard to the web accessibility directive when considering whether to designate a relevant online service. However, this directive only applies to public bodies and as such, its legal relevance to the designation process would be unclear. As such, I cannot accept this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 169 would have the effect of requiring coimisiún na meán to deposit a record of consultations undertaken prior to the designation of a relevant online service with the Minister and to lay it before the Houses of the Oireachtas. I understand amendment No. 71 sought to achieve a similar effect. As referenced by the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, in response to that amendment, it is not usual practice to lay internal records of the processes and activities of public bodies before the Oireachtas, nor for the Oireachtas Library to store such materials. I understand the intention of the amendment is to ensure an coimisiún is transparent in respect of those persons it seeks to consult. However, as a public body, an coimisiún will be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability requirements, including to the joint Oireachtas committee. The principle of transparency is satisfied by the requirement for the commission to be accountable to the Oireachtas. As set out in the Bill, the executive chairperson and the commissioners will be accountable to the joint Oireachtas committee in respect of their functions, while the executive chairperson will additionally be accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts in respect of the finances and value-for-money practices of an coimisiún. The decisions of an coimisiún as regards the making of media service codes, rules and online safety codes are also subject to a clear public consultation process. Furthermore, details of those decisions must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, where they may be subject to a negative resolution procedure. As a regulator, an coimisiún will necessarily be in contact with regulated entities on a regular basis regarding the regulation of those entities. I expect an coimisiún to undertake all such contact appropriately and to be transparent in how it does so. Accordingly, I do not intend to accept the amendment. Amendment No. 170 would require the contact details of the person or persons designated as responsible for online safety at the named service to be entered into the public register of designated online services. Under section 139J of the Broadcasting Act 2009, as inserted by this Bill, an coimisiún is required to maintain a register of such services, which shall include the address of the provider and any other information the commission considers appropriate about how the provider may be contacted by members of the public. This provision will achieve a similar effect to the Senator's amendment. Therefore, I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As I said in relation to the principle of transparency, when it comes to the making of the media service codes and rules and the online safety codes, they are subject to a clear public consultation process and must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas so I see that transparency there. The regulator by its very nature must be able to engage on an ongoing basis with the entities it regulates, without an unnecessary or undo administrative burden. There are practical considerations here. We have struck the right balance, so I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In compelling an coimisiún to make online safety codes, amendment No. 171 would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisiún in when and how it exercises its regulatory duties through the creation of online safety codes. I refer to our debate yesterday, which was on the similar subject of media service codes. I reiterate that the purpose of establishing the independent regulatory body of an coimisiún under this Bill is to delegate the exercise of powers from the Oireachtas to that body in accordance with Article 15.2.2 of the Constitution. That a body delegated such powers has discretion in the exercise of such powers within the strictures of legislation is appropriate. It is in the spirit of the provisions on the independence of regulatory bodies in the revised audiovisual media services directive, AVMSD. In addition, changing the word “may” to “shall” in those provisions would create a mandatory obligation in every instance which, given the breadth of the provisions, may create a problem. Changing this to a mandatory obligation from a discretionary imperative, which is what the word "may" implies in this context, would mean that an coimisiún could be challenged for not having made a code about any particular issue that is standard or practice of these service providers. Given the breadth of these provisions, this is potentially significantly problematic. If we go down this road, we would likely need to significantly limit the range of matters that may be addressed through online safety codes to a small and exclusive list that would no doubt rapidly become out of date. I will not be accepting the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I recognise the objective behind these amendments, which is to specify that an coimisiún may protect the health of children by regulating, through online safety codes, commercial communications relating to certain products, including foods high in fat, sugar, salt, as well as alcohol and gambling products. In this regard, I note that an coimisiún already has this power under the Bill and, in particular, in relation to the regulation of commercial communications on video sharing platform services, which must abide by the provisions set out in Article 9(1) of the revised audiovisual media services directive. However, in taking any action in this area, an coimisiún would be guided by the policies of the Department of Health, which is responsible for public health policy on these matters. I see the merit of specifically referencing the public health interests of children in this section. For this reason, although I am rejecting amendments Nos. 173 to 177, inclusive, I would like to return to them on Report Stage once I have engaged with the Minister for Health. On amendment No. 177, I note the reference to milk-based formula and remind the Senators that I have committed to examining issues as to the advertising of such products in advance of Report Stage. However, on amendments Nos. 175 to 177, inclusive, I note that just referencing programmes would not cover the range of user-generated content available through designated online services nor would it cover those commercial communications placed directly by the service provider. I cannot accept amendment No. 183 as I believe the wording in subsection 1 of the amendment is not specific enough to achieve its intended objective and that the issues regarding the use of personal data of children in subsection 3, while worthy of attention and concern, are a matter for the Data Protection Commission. If a provision in the Data Protection Act has not been commenced, the issue that arises is the commencement of that provision by the Minister for Justice, not repeating those provisions in another Act, one that deals with content regulation and not data protection. As to subsection 2, I am examining this issue in relation to the other amendments in this grouping. In conclusion, I do not accept amendment No. 183, but I will examine the other amendments in this grouping before Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I still believe that we are dealing with different regulators. The use of personal data of children is subsection (3) of the amendment. It is worthy of attention and concern, but it is a matter for the Data Protection Commission. The regulator that we are setting up in this Bill deals with content regulation and not data protection. This is an issue for the Department of Justice and for the Data Protection Commission, so I am not accepting this amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I cannot accept this amendment. As I said previously, it would have the effect of limiting the discretion of an coimisiún in when and how it exercises regular duties through the creation of online safety codes. I have explained my reason for not accepting amendments of this kind in previous discussions around amendments grouped with amendments Nos. 133 and 171. I am not proposing to accept this amendment either.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In the first instance, I would suggest that amendments Nos. 179 and 180 would be more appropriate to amending section 139M of the Bill, rather than amending section 139K. Amending section 139M already provides for a range of matters that an coimisiún must have regard to when preparing online safety codes. On the intention behind amendment No. 179 and, in the first instance, the proposed inclusion of section 42 of Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 is a matter which must be considered by an coimisiún in the preparation of online safety codes. As I noted before, this would appear to duplicate provisions already in law. Section 42 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 provides that a public body shall have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and protect human rights. As a public body, an coimisiún would already be subject to the provisions of that Act. Similar to other UN conventions that have been ratified and entered into, the State is legally bound by the obligations set out in the treaties. I do not see the rationale for specifically referencing the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in context of making online safety codes. Further to this and regarding the web accessibility directive, as I said, this directive only applies to public bodies and, therefore, its legal relevance to the making of online safety codes is unclear. Therefore, I do not intend to accept amendment No. 179. On amendment No. 180, in the first instance, I note that under the amending section 139(1)(b) that an coimisiún shall consult with any person it thinks appropriate in advance of making an online safety code. While, in practice, this will be a matter for an coimisiún, I would see this as covering the persons referenced in the amendment. In addition, I would see it as inappropriate to single out persons with expertise in a limited field who must be consulted. This may give rise to the impression that the views of those persons should be held in higher regard than those not explicitly referenced. It would also be impractical and quite difficult to provide for an exhaustive list of such persons who must be consulted in advance of making an online safety code. Generally, however, it is the expectation that there will be a strong culture of consultation with relevant persons and stakeholders when it comes to the creation of regulatory codes. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 180.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 183a provides that an coimisiún should have an online safety code requiring that designated online services seek to minimise the risk of harm arising from the spread of disinformation. I do not propose to accept the amendment for a number of reasons.Regarding disinformation, this kind of content is being tackled, as has been acknowledged by the Senator, on an EU-wide basis through a number of mechanisms. These include the Digital Services Act, DSA, on which political agreement was reached on 22 April 2022. The Government decided that coimisiún na meán will be the digital services co-ordinator, which is the primary regulator under the DSA. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department have led Ireland’s negotiations in this area. There is also the European Commission's code of practice on disinformation. This is a Commission initiative that has involved a range of online platforms, leading social networks, advertisers and advertising industry players signing up to self-regulatory standards to fight disinformation. It is the Commission's intention that the code will evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the DSA. Additionally, the Commission has also established the European Digital Media Observatory, which has a hub in Dublin City University, DCU, and this body has been tasked with monitoring the implementation of the code. While I note the intent of the amendment, this matter will be addressed by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and his Department in the context of the legislation necessary to give effect to the implementation of the DSA in Ireland. I do not believe it would be useful to cut across this work at this stage. Senators will be aware that in March the Government decided that once established under the Bill, coimisiún na meán would act as the primary regulator, termed the digital service co-ordinator, under the DSA. It made the decision in light of the clear synergies between the objectives and approaches of coimisiún na meán and the digital services co-ordinator, including taking a systemic approach to dealing with online safety and platform regulation and similar resourcing needs and expertise for implementation and enforcement. The DSA is still undergoing negotiation regarding several technical matters. The final text of the regulation is not available. Should the code of practice on disinformation evolve into a co-regulatory instrument under the DSA, as proposed by the European Commission, I would expect that coimisiún na meán would have a role to play in its capacity as the digital services co-ordinator. As I indicated, there is a specific problem with disinformation designed to influence the results of elections and referendums as these processes are at the heart of our democracy. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has asked the Attorney General to prepare proposals for inclusion in the Electoral Reform Bill 2022. On amendment No. 187a, similar to amendment No. 183a, I do not propose to accept the amendment because, as previously set out, disinformation is being tackled on an EU-wide level through the mechanisms outlined. I do not want to unintentionally work at cross purposes with those mechanisms or with the work of the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The same reasons apply to amendment No. 192a in the context of my responses to amendments Nos. 183a and 187a. I am not proposing to accept these amendments.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, the purpose of the Bill is not to implement the DSA regulation in Irish law but, among other things, to create a regulatory framework for online safety and to establish a regulator to enforce that framework. The Government has decided, as I said, that coimisiún na meán will be the digital services co-ordinator under the DSA and that further legislation will be brought forward to provide for that and build upon the regulatory framework for online safety in that respect. My officials are part of a working group with officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which meets weekly on the DSA. This is happening.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	To clarify, an coimisiúin will not have a role in the investigation or prosecution of individuals for offences specified in the criminal code. That is the role of An Garda Síochána. The role of an coimisiún is to implement a regulatory framework to minimise the availability of online content by which those offences listed in Schedule 3 of the 2009 Act, as inserted by the Bill, can be committed. The effect of this amendment would be to require that an coimisiún determines whether aspects of the regulatory framework are necessary and proportionate for an investigation or prosecution, which is a matter outside of its competency. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Senator for the amendment. The purpose of the Bill is not to prohibit the use of technologies by providers of designated online services and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. The technologies referenced by this amendment have legitimate uses. In particular, the reference to “encryption backdoors” would appear to prohibit the use of any encryption which is not end-to-end encryption
by a provider of a private communications or online storage service. This would be highly disproportionate. It would have significant unintended consequences, especially for providers of business-to-business technologies such as various videoconferencing solutions which, for very good reasons, may be encrypted but not end-to-end encrypted. I will, therefore, not accept the amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to clarify for the Senator that videoconferencing is included in the Bill but it will not be covered by the Digital Services Act.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I note the points the Senator has made in respect of the Digital Services Act. As she will be aware, the Digital Services Act, which is a proposed regulation rather than a directive, of the EU, is currently under negotiation between the EU institutions. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is leading on this. The Digital Services Act, as a horizontal legislative instrument, will address a wide range of issues, from illegal and harmful online content to consumer rights issues such as availability of illegal goods on online platforms. It will introduce a new systemic regulatory for very large online platforms that will be overseen by the European Commission. I understand that provisional political agreement between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, representing the member states, was recently reached, subject to further technical discussions and amendments. As such, the final text of the Digital Services Act has not been formally agreed and is not yet available. A key feature of the Digital Services Act will be the appointment of a digital service co-ordinator. As I stated, in March the Government decided an coimisiún na meán will fulfil that role. A programme of work is now under way, led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to identify the appropriate resources necessary for an coimisiún and the legislative measures necessary to implement the Digital Services Act into Irish law. Although the Digital Services Act, as an EU regulation, will have a direct effect on Irish law, it has become increasingly necessary to provide legal scaffolding in domestic law to give effect to provisions of regulations, particularly regulatory provisions. For example, there is a need to provide for the designation of competent authorities or for penalties and enforcement mechanisms for infringements of a regulation. Although the Digital Services Act is forthcoming, the requirement to transpose the revised audiovisual media services directive, which we are doing through the Bill, remains. In light of the infringement proceedings under way against Ireland for a failure to transpose the Bill, it is important that we transpose the directive as soon as possible to avoid fines. Moreover, given that an coimisiún will also fulfil the function of the digital service co-ordinator under the Digital Services Act, it is important that we put that on a formal legislative footing as soon as possible. In establishing an coimisiún and setting out a regulatory framework for online safety and a robust and fair enforcement and investigation mechanism, the Bill is establishing the scaffolding to which I referred, as well as the structures to support future and forthcoming legislation, including the Digital Services Act. In this regard, the Bill will assist in the implementation of the regulation and it will not, therefore, hinder it. I do not accept the amendment, but I have noted the Senator's points and will reflect on them.
