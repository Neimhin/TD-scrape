CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will be happy to withdraw amendment No. 9. My amendment No. 11 would define a student union as an independent body representing students. The concern is that it must be recognised by the institute to be a student union, as per the Government amendment. The student union should be an independent body elected by the students, as there is a risk it could be left out of procedures if it is not something recognised by the institute.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am still not content with the Government's definition of a student union. It could lead to a position where a student union exists and is accepted and elected by students but ignored by an institute. It is a key point. I am still not convinced by the Government's definition of student union.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I wish to raise an issue relating to definitions in section 2 on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 20:In page 19, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:"(iii) contributes to the promotion of the economic, cultural and social development of the State,(iv) respects the diversity of values, beliefs and traditions in Irish society,(v) promotes critical and free enquiry, informed intellectual discourse and public debate within the technological university and in wider society.".This is to address the functions of the technological universities as set out on page 19 of the Bill, and that we try to promote critical thinking in public debate. Diversity of debate and values are key aspects of third level education and I see them as core. The language used in section 22 outlines the functions of the universities as collaborating with business, enterprise, professions, the community and related stakeholders in the region to ensure that in so far as possible innovation activity and research undertaken by technological universities will reflect the needs of those stakeholders. This is in direct contrast with the weak language on page 20 on promoting broader aims. The language regarding critical thinking, diversity, free speech, and the economic, social and cultural development of the State is only "where practicable" rather than "in so far as possible". The amendment is to place more emphasis on these being key and core aspects of third level education.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	In reply to what the Minister of State said on amendment No. 20, I see the provision in section 22(k)(iii) which states "where practicable in the performance of its functions". This is my exact point. I believe this is weak wording and I wanted to place a bigger emphasis on it as being a core part of the university. My issue is with the language in section 22(k)(iii). I knew it was there, but I have an issue with the weakness of the language as I feel it should be a core function of a university.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I will withdraw amendment No. 20 on the basis of what the Minister of State has said.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	On a point of clarification, the Minister of State indicated she will engage with Deputies on this matter. When or how will this be done? Will she appear before the committee again?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I agree with Deputy Burton that a definition of the term "citizens" is required. In the same way, a definition of the term "community" is also necessary as it is used frequently in the text. I do not know whether that should be noted or if I need to make a request to that effect.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 20, line 28, to delete "where practicable" and substitute "promotes".
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 37:In page 21, to delete lines 21 and 22 and substitute the following:“(i) be established following consultation with trade unions and staff associations representing employees of the technological university where the matters in dispute relate to staff, or with the student union where the matters in dispute relate to students,”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 39:In page 21, line 26 after “appropriate” to insert “as agreed by all parties listed at subparagraph (i) above”.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Is it the case that the amendments we have withdrawn will be engaged with by the Minister of State and her officials?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	There is currently no protection for student academic freedom in the legislation. That is why I tabled this amendment. I may table an amendment on Report Stage to protect collective academic freedom.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I want to press my amendment.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I am sorry, is that the amendment on greater student representation on the governing body?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Amendment No. 44 is ruled out of order, is it not?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	Yes, but on amendment No. 43 I want to bring a query to Report Stage. Will there be four academic staff on these larger governing bodies of 15 to 26 members? I would also like to ask about the need for community representatives on the governing body. I know in Waterford Institute of Technology there is a counsellor on the governing body to represent the community. I will be raising that on Report Stage.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	My amendment, No. 44, was ruled out of order but my other amendment, No. 47, is quite similar to Deputy Funchion's but has not been ruled out of order while hers has been.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I move amendment No. 47:In page 22, line 35, to delete “at least one but not more than 2” and substitute “at least one but not more than 3”.
