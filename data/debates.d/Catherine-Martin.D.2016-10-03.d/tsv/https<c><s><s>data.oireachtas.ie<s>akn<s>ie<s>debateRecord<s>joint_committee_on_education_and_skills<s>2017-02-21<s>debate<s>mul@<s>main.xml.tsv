I thank the delegates so much for their detailed presentations. I commend them on their excellent work on children's mental health, which represents such a vital field. I, for one, welcome that, finally in recent years, the spotlight is on our children's mental health and on placing it front and centre in education. I have just a few questions. Mr. King is a great advocate of mindfulness and has an excellent knowledge base. Is he in favour of his programme being integrated into the school system or rolling it out in general? How does he envisage this happening? At what age should we start teaching mindfulness? What standard of training do teachers need? Is there a certain qualification? Is mindfulness suited to all children or not? Is there a danger also? Do we have to be very careful about how mindfulness is delivered in our schools? It is very important that schoolchildren receive support with mental health issues but sometimes the teachers are forgotten about. How can we support our teachers? If we are talking about positive mental health in our schools, what is the position on the whole school staff and community? How do we encourage and ensure positive mental health among them? At the beginning of Dr. Bates's submission, he referred to post-primary schools. Does he work with primary schools? If not, why? Is it a matter of resources? I am curious about that. Do schools refer students for the wonderful supports that Jigsaw provides? If so, how is it done? Is it done by the principal, a specific teacher or guidance counsellor? Is there any way of monitoring an identified child when they leave school, or is the child suddenly left without the supports? Can students always access the external supports they need? Does it vary according to the luck of the draw based on where one lives in the country? Are there considerable waiting lists for the supports? Mr. Hussey referred to the aesthetic engagement that is not available in our schools. Is there potential to provide that in our schools? I think specifically of the new junior cycle and the short courses. I have taken on board what Mr. Hussey said on the need for delivery by experts in the field. Can short courses be designed and given in certain schools? Should we be considering this? The NCCA has a short course on artistic performance but does it take on board any of the expertise to which Mr. Hussey referred regarding aesthetic engagement?
