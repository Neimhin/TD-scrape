CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witnesses for their opening statements. I taught in a DEIS school for 16 years. In my opinion, home school liaison links in well with the Education Welfare Office. The school completion officers are the unsung heroes of any school. The teachers see the benefits in the classroom but a lot is done behind the scenes and in the community around the parents' room. I commend the incredible work being done, as well as the strengthening of families. The demand for participation is indicative of the success of the programmes for families in need. I will open the meeting to members and will then come back to the witnesses for answers.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the witness and call Deputy O'Sullivan.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	I thank the Deputy. We will now take answers to those questions.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Does Ms McCafferty wish to add to that?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Do Mr. Shiel and Ms Kelly have anything to add? I think Deputy O'Sullivan was looking for some information from the Department.
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	Would Mr. Noel Kelly or Ms Maria Tobin like to respond?
CatherineMartin	Acting Chairman (Deputy Catherine Martin)	2016-10-03	None	There are 416 home-school community liaison teachers in 530 schools. Can the officials from the Department indicate what is the maximum number? Does it mean home-school liaison teachers share schools? The education welfare officer is integrated into the system but what is the maximum number of schools of which an education welfare officer is in charge? How does it work? Is there an overload and, if there is, what are the plans to address it? I commend the work on a successful transition from primary to second level but if a student breaks a generational cycle in their family, gets to leaving certificate and does well, what happens next? Do we need to look at supports for the transition from second level to third level? Do the witnesses agree that children are slipping through at this stage and, if so, are there any plans to address it? The goal is to get children to benefit from a school education but with our one-size-fits-all curriculum it is hard to captivate a child. Is this something we need to examine? Do we need to look at the apprenticeship scheme in Germany as an option? Is there any language barrier in this area? We have very rich, diversified, international communities in our schools and this is something we must treasure and embrace. Are there enough supports for teachers? One might need to explain to a family that both the parents and children can benefit from this but what supports are provided where there is a language barrier? What do the teachers feel about DEIS inspections? Have they experienced them? Has the Department gathered any data about what might be working well or what supports and resources may be lacking?
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	I would like to say very well done on all the witnesses' achievements at the WorldSkills 2017. We are very fortunate to have such fine ambassadors like the witnesses show-casing their talents and skills on a world stage. I think the witnesses are doing fantastic work promoting apprenticeships and traineeships. I am curious to know whether the witnesses felt they got enough encouragement and support from career guidance counsellors in school in taking up apprenticeships. I would like to ask Ms Leahy what can be done to get more women involved. Perhaps the gentlemen might have something to say as well. Mr O'Toole mentioned the need for social media promotion and I would like to congratulate him on the website apprenticeship.ie and the reach of 100,000 on Facebook. Well done on that. It is great to see the progress that is being made.
CatherineMartin	Deputy Catherine Martin	2016-10-03	None	As Deputy Byrne said, that is why we have to build on the witnesses' successes here and, as legislators, try to change things to make sure that every school is promoting apprenticeships and traineeships.
