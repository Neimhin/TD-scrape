I regret I had to rule out of order the matter submitted by Senator Gallagher on the ground that it is a repeat of a Commencement matter raised on 17 May 2018. Senator Conway may give notice on another day of the matter that he wishes to raise.</p>

            <p eId="para_15">I thank the Leas-Chathaoirleach for choosing this matter and the Minister of State for attending. We know it off by heart at this stage so there is no need for me to go into the details again. I have had a number of cases on this motorised transport grant, particularly because I come from a rural constituency where there is no public transport and people need to bring their family members to appointments and take them out for therapy, etc. The withdrawal of this grant in 2013 has caused great stress, trauma and difficulties to these families. There was a guarantee given that it would be replaced with a new scheme in October 2013. We are now in July 2018 and nothing has happened since.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> I have raised it continually during my time in the Dáil and in this House. I am raising it again now because of an issue I am seriously concerned about. I refer to a woman whose husband is quite ill. He is in hospital and she is bringing him to appointments a couple of times a week. Cars are breaking down on numerous occasions on the way to those appointments. This woman has saved the State thousands of euro by caring for her husband and she will not allow anyone else to care for him because he has brain damage, epileptic seizures and depression as well as word-finding, memory and understanding problems. It really is a humanitarian issue at this stage. I am not blaming the Minister of State but I hope he can report some progress and that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. </p>

            <p eId="para_17">I thank and commend Senator O'Mahony for raising this important issue. I also commend his determination and perseverance on the motor transport grant proposals. I am happy to update this House on the progress of the health (transport support) Bill. The Senator will be familiar with the background to the closure of the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes in February 2013. Following the closure of the schemes, no further motorised transport grants have been payable. The Government, however, decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new transport support scheme, and associated statutory provisions, should be progressed by my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> The Government directed that the Health Service Executive, HSE, should continue to pay an equivalent monthly payment of up to €208.50 to the 4,046 people in receipt of the mobility allowance, on an interim basis, pending the establishment of a new transport support scheme. I welcome that. These 4,046 people are getting the €208.50 each month. The bottom line, though, is that Senator O'Mahony is right. A Programme for a Partnership Government acknowledges the ongoing drafting of primary legislation for a new transport support scheme to assist those with a disability to meet their mobility costs. The health (transport support) Bill is on the list of priority legislation for publication in the spring-summer session 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> There is some light at the end of the tunnel. I confirm that work on the policy proposals for the new scheme is at an advanced stage. The proposals seek to ensure there is a firm statutory basis to the scheme's operation, there is transparency and equity in the eligibility criteria attaching to the scheme, resources are targeted at those with the greatest needs and the scheme is capable of being costed and is affordable on its introduction and on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_20">I recently brought a memorandum to Government for a new transport support payment scheme. Following consideration of the matter, it was decided to withdraw the memorandum from the Cabinet agenda on 8 May last. I intend to revert to Government in due course with revised proposals reflective of the discussion at Cabinet. While not wishing to breach Cabinet confidentiality, the view in government is reflective of Senator O'Mahony's view, namely, that we need to ensure that adequate funding is available for this scheme hence the debate and the delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> It is important to note that the disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme operated by the Revenue Commissioners remains in place. Specifically adapted vehicles driven by persons with disabilities are exempt from payment of tolls on national roads and toll bridges. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has responsibility for this scheme. Work is ongoing in various Departments, agencies and transport providers on how access to public transport services can be further improved. Under the national disability inclusion strategy, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the continued development of accessibility and availability of public transport for people with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> Senator O'Mahony has on many occasions raised the issue of inadequate access to public transport, particularly in rural areas. I am aware of the stress this is causing for families and I hope to be able to report progress soon on the transport support payment scheme.</p>

If not, this matter will run into the sand. I do not propose to add to the speculation about an election or the supply-and-confidence agreement. This scheme is committed to in the programme for Government and it needs to be delivered. Can the Minister of State indicate a timescale for when he will bring a memorandum to Cabinet for consideration and approval?</p>

            <p eId="para_24">In regard to the memorandum, I am considering three options. I know exactly what I want in terms of this scheme. I am sure Senator O'Mahony would agree with my proposals. I was not happy with what was proposed at Cabinet and I undertook to consider other options in terms of funding. My preferred option is the most expensive. There is a problem in that as we approach the Estimates process, there are other groups, such as senior citizens with disabled adults seeking residential care, in respect of which I am seeking approximately 400 additional places in 2019. The assessment of need issue is also on the table and families with young children with disabilities are also demanding funding. There are competing needs for funding. As far as I am concerned, the Government committed to the introduction of this scheme in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> I take the Senator's point about transport issues in rural Ireland, the stress this is causing for families, the amount of work these families do and the savings that accrue to the Exchequer as a result of that work. In answer to Senator O'Mahony's question, I hope to bring the memorandum to Cabinet before the summer recess, and at the latest, early September. As I said, I am currently considering three options and I will decide in the next week or two which option I will bring to Cabinet. I hope I will achieve the objective of bringing it before Cabinet before the summer recess but, if not, I will do so early in September.</p>

            <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_28">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, to the House to discuss the issue of a migrant worker who has been exploited by an unscrupulous employer. As there has been a huge amount of correspondence with the Department of Education and Skills on this matter I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with it. I welcome Mr. Porfireanu and his wife to the Public Gallery. I know from my background as a trade unionist that this case is not unique but it raises serious issues concerning the award of public contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> Mr. Porfireanu successfully made complaints to the Rights Commissioner Service under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 and Terms of Employment Information Acts 1994 to 2001 relating to his employment with this contractor. The contractor appealed those decisions to the Employment Appeals Tribunal, which upheld Mr. Porfireanu's awards in March of last year. The value of these awards is €14,246, which is a sizeable sum, the vast majority of which is unpaid wages. When this exploitation took place, Mr. Porfireanu was employed by P.J. McLoughlin &amp; Sons on publicly funded projects in Coolock and adjacent to this House at the National Gallery. Attempts to contact the contractor to ensure he fulfilled his obligations to Mr. Porfireanu were met with frustration. Despite repeated attempts to discuss the matter throughout last September, no reply was forthcoming. Mr. Porfireanu was forced to engage a solicitor to seek judgment for registration in the Circuit Court and subsequently an execution order to the sheriff to seek to enforce the court order. The original award and subsequent judgment remain undischarged.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> I refer to section 5.3 of the public works contracts, which provides that contractors must observe employment law and legally binding determinations of the Labour Court. The contractor self-certifies using standard form MF 1.13 that it is compliant in this regard. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that this was not respected in this case. Section 5 of the public works contract reflects the agreements reached on outsourcing in section 20 of the Croke Park agreement and section 3.3.5 of the Lansdowne Road agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> We should not accept that this contractor can be awarded public contracts and operate on those same contracts while failing to respect or comply with the decision of the State industrial relations processes and subsequent Circuit Court judgments. This contractor is currently engaged as the main contractor on two Department of Education and Skills projects in Westmeath and Kildare, namely, Curraghmore national school in Mullingar and the Mercy Convent primary school in Naas. The Minister of State will not disagree that Mr. Porfireanu, who is with his family in the Gallery, has been waiting too long to receive money that he worked hard to earn. This is an example of a migrant worker working here legally and being exploited by an unscrupulous employer, one which continues to be rewarded by the Department of Education and Skills. It is bad enough that this employer refuses to discharge an award of the State industrial relations mechanisms and is in violation of a Circuit Court judgment relating to that award but it is considerably worse that he is able to flout the terms of the capital works contracts.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> Is the Minister satisfied with the current methods for ensuring that contractors awarded State contracts respect our industrial relations processes and does he have plans to ensure that contractors such as P.J. McLoughlin &amp; Sons do not obtain State contracts while violating the rights of workers like Mr. Porfireanu? Also, will he help this man who is owed €15,000? P.J. McLoughlin &amp; Sons continues to be awarded contracts by the Department of Education and Skills despite the fact that it is flagrantly in violation of judgments of the Labour Court. To be honest, it is but one of many such companies but the Minister of State needs to do something concrete to help this man to restore his confidence in this State. Mr. Porfireanu has done everything possible to try to get justice but the State has failed him on every occasion.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I thank Senator Gavan for raising this matter and I acknowledge his work in respect of workers' rights. I also welcome Mr. Porfireanu and his family to the Gallery.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> As Senator Gavan will be aware, a building project is a complex contractual arrangement between the client, the main contractor, specialist subcontractors, domestic subcontractors, suppliers of materials, suppliers of plant and so on. In general, all subcontractors employed on education sector building projects are employed directly by the main contractor or indirectly by the main contractor through subcontractors. As provided for in legislation, it is a matter for all subcontractors to agree terms and conditions and a schedule of payments with the main contractor as their direct employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">As these contracts involve contractual matters between private companies, my Department has no authority to intervene in these matters. I have checked this point. The Department, as funding authority, is not necessarily the employer under the public works contract on schools building projects. Where the Department does not own the site, the school management authority is normally the employer for the purposes of the public works contract. Many projects are devolved for delivery to outside agencies, such as education and training boards, the National Development Finance Agency, local authorities, etc. In these cases the devolved agency would normally be the employer for the purposes of the public works contract. Also, in respect of non-compliance with relevant employment law, enforcement and prosecution falls under the remit of the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. Where the Department of Education and Skills becomes aware of issues of tax compliance or social welfare fraud, such matters are referred to the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or both, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> The Department has taken a number of steps to deal with the use of bogus self-employment contractors on schools building projects. It has appointed an external consultant, Contractors Administration Service, CAS, to conduct random audits on schools building projects. Should irregularities be uncovered in terms of non-compliance with relevant employment law, enforcement and prosecution falls under the remit of the WRC and the Department reports any discrepancies found to it. If the audit uncovers any other matters of concern regarding tax compliance or social welfare fraud, such matters are referred to either the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or both, as appropriate. My Department does not have the statutory powers to investigate such complaints. This rests with the WRC, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection or the Revenue Commissioners, as appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> It is worth drawing attention also to the advice on the WRC website on enforcement of decisions that "If an Employer/Respondent (Employer) fails to carry out a decision of an Adjudication Officer of the Workplace Relations Commission, or a decision of the Labour Court arising from an appeal of an Adjudication Officer's decision, within the prescribed time, an application may be made to the District Court for an order directing the Employer to carry out the decision."</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> I do have sympathy for any subcontractor or worker who is not paid either appropriately or what is due. I have held detailed discussions with officials of my Department on this issue. We are bound by legislation and criteria laid down by the Department. I have no problem with meeting the particular family with the Senator. I would be delighted to do so because I know the Senator does a lot of work in the area of workplace relations. I am not afraid to acknowledge that. I am not too sure what I might be able to do but I would be prepared to meet the family to see if we could go further on this issue. It does concern me. </p>

            <p eId="para_39">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I acknowledge that he has a record for protecting workers. I know where he comes from politically and I respect that. I welcome the offer to meet Mr. Porfireanu. I will take the Minister of State up on that and make an appointment. We will make it happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> In respect of the reply he has given me I have two points to make, which I think the Minister of State already sees. This involves the main contractor, namely, P.J. McLoughlin &amp; Sons. The Department is awarding contracts to a main contractor which has left this man short of €15,000 in wages and it has disregarded every State body in respect of that. The Minister of State pointed out the ability to go to the District Court but we have already done that. The sheriff has said she cannot intervene because several companies are registered at the address so she does not know whose property she is taking. We have exhausted the procedures. I have one suggestion on which I hope the Department could act as it just means getting it to move slightly and that is to write to the employer asking it to comment on the status of this case. The Minister of State could write from the Department of Education and Skills saying this has been brought to his attention and he would like to understand why this award has not been carried out. Something like that could actually help. I welcome that the Minister of State has offered to work with me on this issue. Let us set up an appointment and see if we can get justice for this man.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I mention an issue that has been raised in this House before, namely, the increase in energy prices that will affect everyone, but in particular 1.2 million households, come September. This announcement was made by Electric Ireland. We will see increases of up to 6.2% in the residential sector. What this means is that householders will be nearly €110 per year less well off. These are hidden taxes for individuals. When energy prices increase, we do not necessarily see an increase in income, or an increase in social welfare payments. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul announced last year that half of the people living in consistent poverty went without heating at some stage last year. Many of us who canvassed during the winter, going door-to-door, will have met many elderly people who go to bed at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. to avoid having to put their heating on in the evenings. This is something we must address. This is especially important as these price rises are coming in in September, a time when parents are under a lot of pressure to pay out for children who are going back to school. There is the cost of uniforms and books and the payments to schools to subvent the very low capitation levels. This is something we need to discuss so I call for a debate on energy prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> The second issue I would like to raise is unemployment levels. We know unemployment levels are at an all-time low. The National Economic and Social Council is trying to focus on the reason people find it difficult to transition from social welfare benefits to employment. It has noted that unemployment levels remain consistently high in many communities around the country, especially in disadvantaged areas. We need to invite the Minister to the House for a debate, particularly on how people can transition adequately and fairly from being in receipt of State payments to being able to contribute to the workforce.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">What I am talking about is extending the nomination process in order that there is an alternative route outside of the political system. It is something that we might have a debate on with the relevant Minister after the summer break. I am sure whoever is sitting in my seat will not mind taking up the issue on my behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> Last night we had what can only be regarded as a disgusting shambles. A Bill was brought before the House and we understand from those who oversee these things that there is difficulty with it. Somebody was shouting about Ireland being independent and all of that. Is this Bill likely to end up before the European Court of Justice at some stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_62">What happened last night was outrageous. It is even more outrageous that we are going to try to drive on. I said it was the Minister's Bill, but it is the Leader's Government that will face the wrath of history for what it is trying to do here. It really needs to step back and look at what is going on around it. No support is worth that price, that it would sell its soul.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I raise the issue again of the Versatis patches. The Cathaoirleach will know I have raised this issue many times in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">I recognise that there has been something of a rowing back on this matter and that some adjustments have been made. While I welcome those adjustments, there are still thousands of people in chronic pain who really need Versatis patches. I want to give the House an idea of the plight of one of these people. Her name is Anne-Marie. She is 49 years of age. She says she has had rheumatoid arthritis since 1975. Over the years, her condition has become chronic and she has had almost 40 surgeries, 13 of which involved joint replacements. She has had both hips, both knees, both shoulders, both elbows and several knuckles replaced. Most recently, she has had revision surgery on her shoulder. The other procedures included orthopaedic surgery, gall bladder surgery and so on. She was only five years of age when she found out she had rheumatoid arthritis. Given the amount of surgery she has had over the years and all the wear and tear on her joints, she had pain every single hour of every single day. Given that she had been on opiates long-term, they do not work. The Versatis patch gave her a great deal of relief when she was on it. She has severe back and shoulder pain. In recent days, she has begun to suffer from hip pain again. She also has problems with her kidneys and eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> For someone like that to be left in chronic pain, though she gets relief from the Versatis patches, cannot be right. I am appealing to the Minister to give us an update or status report on Versatis patches. I have asked many times for the decision to withdraw Versatis patches from the medical card scheme to be reviewed. It is now time to review it. We are many months into the blunt decision made. I call on the Minister to come to the House to have a debate on this and to provide a true and accurate update on the situation relating to Versatis patches.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to defer consideration of the resumed Committee Stage of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill. Anyone who was in the Chamber last night or who was observing the debate would have been struck by the extraordinary and somewhat farcical nature of the debate. Those of us who were engaged in tabling amendments in good faith – I have tabled 20 amendments to the Bill – asked the Minister whether he had sight of the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, report. We know the report expressed significant concerns about the Government proposals in the Bill. I was able to read into the record of the House certain excerpts from the as-yet-unpublished GRECO report. At least, they are purported to be excerpts because no one can be sure what it is and we have not seen it yet. The Minister made the extraordinary statement in the House that he had not seen the report. It was unclear whether or how many people in his Department had seen it. He said he had not yet brought it to Government. He said he would seek Government clearance to publish it at the earliest opportunity. When we pressed him, the Minister said there would be a Cabinet meeting tomorrow, Thursday. We understood this to mean that he would be able to seek clearance from Government tomorrow to publish the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business. It is reasonable to suggest to colleagues that we should not be asked to legislate in the dark. We should not debate amendments without knowledge of the full content of the GRECO report or without full knowledge of what the Minister's response will be when he eventually sees the report. It is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. The House will sit late again tonight. We were here until 11 o'clock last night. We got to amendment No. 3 because of the issue surrounding the GRECO report. If we were simply to defer consideration of the resumed Committee Stage from today to enable us to have sight of the report when it is eventually republished, then we would be able to move things on far more swiftly and without the controversy that arose last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> It is extraordinary for the Minister to state that a report is out that he knows of by a reputable Council of Europe body, the Council of Europe Group of States against Corruption. The group has expressed or is reported to have expressed significant criticism about the Government proposals. The excerpt I have is up to date as of 31 May this year. Yet, the Minister has said he has not read it and only intends to seek clearance to publish it at the earliest opportunity, when we are halfway through Committee Stage. We understand that the Minister wishes to have Report Stage next Tuesday, in less than a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> It is utterly unsatisfactory to ask us to debate and draft amendments in this setting. I appeal to colleagues with any sense of decent and efficient procedure in this House to support the amendment to the Order of Business today. I am grateful to those who supported it yesterday. It is reasonable to request that we would not be asked to continue the debate on Committee Stage without sight of the GRECO report. It is an important report that appears to be in the hands of many people. Some of us have excerpts from it, but the Minister does not yet appear to have read it.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">While we are debating important issues, there are many families, especially in my constituency, who have no water at the moment. Since last Saturday afternoon, the entire community of Fanore in north Clare has had absolutely no water – not a drop, not enough water for people to wash their hands. In the past 24 or 48 hours, the people of Ballyvaughan in County Clare have been in a similar situation whereby they have no water. They do not even have water to wash their hands either. I acknowledge and respect the effort that has been made by engineers and other staff of Clare County Council to resolve these problems and make water available. However, I have no regard for the atrocious behaviour of Irish Water. People from the villages of Fanore and Ballyvaughan have contacted Irish Water in the past 48 hours. They have been told by the help desk or call centre that Irish Water did not know there was a problem or water shortage in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> I am a Member of the Oireachtas and I live in north Clare. Yet, I have had no communication of any kind from anyone in Irish Water to indicate what is going on or to outline the timeline for resolving the problems. That is totally and utterly unacceptable. The time has really come for every county to have an office with Irish Water written over the door where people who are paying for water, either through taxes or rates, as is the case with commercial interests, can walk in or ring up and discover the problem with their water pressure or the reason there is no water in their taps and when the supply will be restored. I am asking the Leader to summon Irish Water to the House today to explain to Members of the Oireachtas exactly what is going on. The audiovisual room is downstairs. The officials can come in. They held clinics here for long enough. We have not seen sign nor light of Irish Water for the past two weeks since a crisis has developed in water.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">We have all been enjoying the unprecedented good weather recently. I want to mention the unsung heroes who once again keep us safe on a day-to-day basis. Just as it was during the bad weather we witnessed some months ago, the emergency services have been handling several weather-related crises of late. The fire services are dealing with unprecedented gorse and grass fires. The Irish Coast Guard is being called on multiple times each day as those swimming in the sea get into difficulties. The health services are dealing with people who have suffered bad sunburn and heatstroke. There are more cyclists and motorcyclists on the roads, which ensures that our first responders are kept busy.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> Last week, I was contacted by Irish Water Safety informing me that the lifeguard station at Claycastle Beach in Youghal – I imagine the Leader is familiar with this – was broken into and lifesaving equipment was stolen. The station was vandalised and sprayed with fire extinguishers. Lifeguards up and down the country are exceptionally busy. They are under immense pressure with the good weather and now they have to contend with thugs who would seek to destroy this vital equipment that is needed to save lives. I call on the Leader to convey to the Minister for Justice and Equality the need to look after these people as they look after us. I would like an update on when the Life Saving Equipment Bill will proceed to Committee Stage. As we know, there has been great cross-party support for the Bill. It would be great to see it back before the House soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">I want to raise the issue of hotel workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The Leader might recall that a couple of weeks ago I raised the fact we intended to have a meeting. We had that meeting yesterday and I thank colleagues who attended. We had a very good attendance from all parties except one. Unfortunately, nobody from Fine Gael was able to attend, which was a huge disappointment to the SIPTU delegation and the hotel workers who came along. </p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I ask for a debate specifically on the issue of the VAT rebate and the €500 million we subsidise hoteliers with each year. I want to raise it because the money should be going to health and housing. If we accept that the money has to keep going to hotels, at the very least the Government should insist that the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, engages with workers. Standards in the vast majority of hotels are plummeting. Only one hotel in Cork - the Imperial Hotel - still deals with workers on a collective bargaining basis. There is only one such hotel in Limerick, which is the South Court Hotel. The vast majority of hotels, under direct instruction from the IHF, do not deal with unions nationally or locally and do not attend the Workplace Relations Commission. As a result, we have standards like this. We heard from one of the workers yesterday in one of the biggest five-star hotels in the country that on an eight-hour shift she has to clean 30 rooms on her own. It is the industry "standard" that is being applied. We have minimum wage jobs. We got to the bottom of the skills shortages we hear about with regard to chefs. The average wage of a chef in Ireland is €10 an hour. Even the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation has acknowledged that the problem of the skills shortage arose because the industry will not pay the necessary rates of pay. </p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I am asking for a debate because the Government has another opportunity to do the right thing. It has consistently failed to do it in previous years despite it being highlighted by me and others. The right thing to do is to tell the industry that before it is given the subsidy of €500 million it should sit down and engage and work out a sectoral employment order to raise standards and conditions for everyone in the industry. I ask that we have that debate as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">I want to highlight the alarming state of affairs which results in tens of thousands of roadworthy vehicles being prematurely scrapped every year. It is a growing phenomenon. The rate at which it is happening this year means there will be a 129% increase on the number of vehicles scrapped last year. The big concern is it is not driven by a road safety issue <i>per se</i>, because all vehicles on the road have to have a certificate of roadworthiness, but by the fact insurance companies are universally refusing cover or quoting exorbitant premia for vehicles that are ten years old or older. The consequence is it is not economically viable to insure them and people have to replace their vehicles. Something stinks in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> From an environmental point of view, it takes a lot of energy and carbon emissions to produce a vehicle. We have an NCT system in place to ensure vehicles are roadworthy. If we accept a vehicle is roadworthy, we have to be concerned if cars are being put off the road by insurance companies because it does not suit their agenda.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">There is another issue. Many people who have older vehicles cannot afford to buy newer vehicles. In rural Ireland a car is not a luxury, it is a necessity because we do not have public transport. When many youngsters get their first car, they get an older vehicle. The issue has to be examined. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has to look into it and he needs to come to the House. I would like him to investigate if there is collusion between the big insurance companies and the motor manufacturers because this seems to favour the motor manufacturers.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Another issue, which has been well highlighted, is the number of imports from the UK. If people are replacing their second-hand vehicles with imports, VRT is not generated by the State. </p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Conor Faughnan comments on motoring matters on behalf of the AA on the radio and in the media all the time. He represents the AA, which is a big player in the insurance industry. I would like him to set out that there will be no impediment to people with vehicles that are ten years old or older obtaining insurance from his company at least and to shine some light on what is happening here. </p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I compliment <i>Autobiz</i>, which is the motor trade monthly magazine, on fighting this campaign because it is not good for local economies. There are serious questions to be answered. </p>
          <p eId="para_91"> A series of insurance issues have been raised in the Chamber in recent weeks. I would like the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, to come in and deal with them.</p>

          <p eId="para_92">I second Senator Bacik's amendment. She made the arguments extremely well. I point out to the Government that the GRECO report will not go away. It will land with a splat and the criticisms will be out there to be reckoned with.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I refer to comments the Taoiseach made in New York about the media. He was perhaps a little ill-advised to align his views with those of President Trump but when he said the media was not interested in the truth but in the story he was 100% right. I laughed when I heard them all twittering and screaming on RTÉ radio this morning about it. It was a complete nonsense. The media get into hysteria at the slightest criticism of them. From my experience, they lie and lie and lie again. During the presidential election RTÉ, the national broadcaster, allowed a woman to say on air that I advocated parents having sex with their own children. <i>The Sun</i> newspaper said I abused the Seanad to get passports for lovers. Both were absolutely damnable lies and I could give the House 20 or 30 other lies. They were not interested in the truth; they were interested in the story and they did not give a damn if they lied. I am one of the few people prepared to stand up and say this. I know the media will gut me over it but that is the way they behave. I have to laugh at them getting into a hysterical twitter because the Taoiseach said they are interested in the story and not the truth. The other thing is he said it at a private lunch. There is no such thing as a private lunch nowadays because people have their telephones out and they are recording and filming and all the rest of it. It is all right for somebody like me who does not give a damn what he says because I always try to tell the truth and I do not care whether it goes down well or badly. </p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I will also address the point raised by Senator Craughwell about the presidential election and the nomination process. He is 100% right. The political parties have it all sewn up. It is grotesquely wrong and unfair, and militates against the private individual. At the Constitutional Convention, I got a motion through broadening it and allowing the ordinary people of Ireland to have a say in the process. It went through by 98% of the vote, by far the highest of any vote in the Constitutional Convention. The Government has ignored it. It is about time we look at the Presidency and revise both the nomination procedures and the financial provisions which also favour the political parties over the private individual. The citizens of this country are entitled to a fair whack.</p>

Climate change is something we are all very concerned with. Over the next 18 months the airport will bring down its electricity use by over a third, which is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> There was a report on small breweries in <i>The Irish Times</i> today. Their drinks have become popular, especially in local pubs. It is alleged that the bigger breweries are paying publicans not to stock a large supply of drinks from smaller breweries. I have been contacted by a local brewer in Limerick who is concerned. The commission investigated the report and said this is not happening. My local brewer does not agree with the findings. Local brewers are coming up against a brick wall trying to get some local pubs to stock their goods.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I was appalled at the revelations at the Committee of Public Accounts yesterday that Sammon Contracting received 98% of the payment it was owed under the public private partnership contract but none of the payments were passed on to the subcontractors. Ever since the umbrella company Carillion collapsed earlier this year, this has been a mess. Carillion collapsed, Sammon went into examinership and these contractors were never paid. This is nothing short of disgraceful. Where is the accountability? The contractors deserve good pay for good work. They worked hard for it and they should not lose out. They have families and employees to support and a future to protect, and we have to do something.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> I am utterly disappointed with the news that yet again, Carlow has been left at the bottom of the list to have promises delivered. While contractors are now in place at two Wicklow schools and one Wexford school for work to be completed in September, Carlow was scheduled for December. I have spoken about our case for a long time and it is frustrating to see Carlow left with a longer timeframe, despite 90% of the school being complete. A December completion date is better than none but it is unfair on the new secondary school students to have to uproot halfway through their first year in a new school and a new system. I am not happy with any of this. I want the Minister for Education and Skills to explain how we can pay someone for a job not done. This is taxpayers' money and there are subcontractors who have not received a penny.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">I will follow on from the theme raised by Senator Conway on the issue we have with water restrictions. We have had an exceptionally dry period over the past four or five weeks and the knock-on effect of the dry period is that wells and water systems throughout Ireland are under pressure. In my part of the world places such as Nohoval and Robert's Cove are under pressure, as are major towns such as Clonakilty where there were water restrictions last night from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. This will be a big issue. Having water restrictions in place in early July means we will have at least six to eight weeks of real water issues in my part of the world. Traditionally we are used to having an issue in August if we have had a dry summer. This is six weeks earlier than ever anticipated. I am very concerned about what will happen, not alone with regard to our tourism trade and busy towns but also the agricultural community, which depends on water for very obvious reasons as they have to feed their animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> This is a crisis we have to manage over the next eight or nine weeks. I do not see any major change in the weather going forward and a long-term plan has to be put in place to ensure water systems can survive the next eight or nine weeks. At present we are sending tankers to many of these places. Clonakilty and Nohoval have received tankers. These tankers are augmenting the supply, which is very positive. We need to put in place a real campaign to start monitoring water and to ensure there are no leakages. We must also ensure there is no waste of water. The public needs to be informed on an hourly basis on the water levels required in order that we can actually survive the next five or six weeks. In the long term, we need real investment in these places to ensure we have a water supply in order that these towns can develop and, more importantly, the water systems required for the future are put in place so that when we have dry weather like this, we will not have the crisis we have at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">On another issue, yesterday I voted to support the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill being debated and I will do the same today. The reason for it is not that I have been captured or bought by any politician or Government Minister. I do it because I firmly believe it is the right thing to do. International comparisons should be used, and all of the international non-legal research that has been carried out by academics who are not linked to the legal profession has shown that having a lay majority for judicial appointments works. It works in England and Scotland, where the chair is independent. It is the right course of action to take.</p>

I would be very surprised if GRECO has changed its viewpoint so substantially, as has been inferred by other Members. Some people say Independent Members were bought. I certainly was not bought.

          <p eId="para_119">Everyone in the House is thoroughly enjoying the good weather and why would we not? It is a unique Mediterranean-type weather experience here. Like everything else it presents its own problems. There are real issues in the agricultural sector. There was a very good piece on the RTÉ news last night about the difficulties grain farmers along the south have. In the area where I live, there is a real issue with water shortages for farmers in Cavan and Monaghan. There have been challenges in a number of incidences. There is a challenge with the growth of a new cut of silage and in some instances, there are challenges with crop growth. There will be a challenge with getting alternative feed for cattle and drawing water in some instances. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to the House as a matter of urgency to discuss a raft of very specific strategies to be looked at to deal with shortages and the problems confronting agriculture. We need to know that Teagasc is on board and that the Department is completely on board. We do not want to anticipate such things, but it may be necessary, unfortunately, in the end to give a form of fodder relief to farmers and that cannot be shirked from if it has to happen. Will the Leader considering this as a real priority issue? There are people suffering the downside of what is a wonderful weather spell. Neighbours of mine throughout Cavan and Monaghan are having bad experiences.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">I feel somewhat locked out of the conversation about nominating presidential candidates, considering the Irish people's disappointing decision to keep it to those who have reached the age of 35 years. Senator Ruane would make a wonderful president.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> I have been meaning to raise the issue of street art for some time. It adds to the vibrancy of our cities and towns. My sense is the public art created for the ESB boxes around the city has been popular.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I only wish that the artists themselves were rewarded and paid properly for that work. Recently an order was given by Dublin City Council that a number of very high profile murals be taken down or greyed out, in spite of consent being given by the owners of the property for the artist to paint the gable end. Places such as Waterford have festivals that champion, encourage and elevate street art and facilitates the work of artists. This work does not appear out of thin air. It is the result of many artists toiling together behind the scenes. </p>
          <p eId="para_123"> I welcome the formation of a new collective of street artists called Subset, who are asking for more clear rules and regulations in Dublin City Council. Subset referred to a lack of infrastructure and designated areas for street art, which make the endeavour essentially next to impossible. I think it is time that we have ministerial guidelines for local authorities regarding street art, murals and busking. I accept that perhaps a Commencement matter with the Minister might be more appropriate, but I would appreciate a response from the Leader.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Having listened to people talk about the water crisis, sometimes I think it is like crocodile tears. Climate change is a reality and one must take a holistic approach. Last night the Heritage Bill was voted through the Dáil, which means grubbing and upland burning can take place now. There is no point in saying that it is terrible to have a water crisis unless one actually addresses climate change in a holistic way. Unfortunately not everyone is prepared to go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> On the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, I must say that something stank last night. The Minister who was in the Chamber said he had not read the GRECO report. Then he was able to turn around to Senators and say there will be no earthquake when one reads it. After sustained pressure he said that he would bring the report to the Cabinet. Cabinet papers were circulated several days ago. Is he bringing it as a matter of urgency? He had not obviously planned to bring it to the Cabinet at present because at the very least what would be expected of any Minister from any party is that he or she would have read the papers he or she circulates to Cabinet before they are circulated. </p>
          <p eId="para_126"> GRECO is the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption and has issued a report, but we have not seen it. I believe we were being misled in the Chamber last night. It is a case of getting this through at all costs. My party has always acknowledged that there are some good elements in the proposals and we need to debate and discuss them, but we cannot do that in the dark. At the very least, the full facts should be put in front of us. I will take the Minister at his word, that he will bring this report to Cabinet tomorrow; that he will seek publication and then it will be circulated. There is an onus on the Seanad to say that we will not take Committee and Remaining Stages until we have had an opportunity to consider the report, the Government's viewpoints and to ensure that the amendments to the Bill take account of the GRECO report. I think there is an onus on us to do that. We have a responsibility to do that. The courts are one of the pillars of our democracy. We have seen the Northern Ireland Assembly being taken down as a consequence of "cash for ash". This is more important than cash for ash. This is one of the foundations of this State that has served us so well. We as legislators have a responsibility to ensure any changes in our court services are the best they can be. I will be supporting the amendment to the Order of Business.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">Recently I had cause to drive to the west and to the very south point of the country in the same week. By the time my journey was over, I was really depressed by the decline in the villages and rural areas. I do not have to go to such far flung places as I can see it in my own county where the villages are passed by and closed down. The shop fronts remain but the shops are closed. This has not happened by chance. In the past 20 years several Governments have orchestrated an oppressive national planning framework and spatial strategies and foisted them on people. This was supposed to save rural areas but it is killing rural areas, which have been decimated. In the past ten years some 17% of the houses built in the country have been one-off houses. Large scale development is non-existent.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I call on the Minister to liaise with county managers and ask them to interpret the county development plans to assist and help those applying for permission for a one-off house. Many county managers stand behind their county development plans to deter planning permission. This should not be the case nowadays where people cannot start a home. If one is living in Dublin, Galway or Cork or a metropolitan area one could hope to buy a house but if one is living in Mullingar, Athlone, Ballina or Letterkenny where it is not viable for developers to build a house, houses are not being built. The only tool that people have is when the county manager loosens up the planning regulations to help people and allow one-off planning permission. Local authorities should be trying to assist people who apply for planning permission and give them a chance to move on. This would allow them to start a family and give them hope.</p>

However, it is an elitist area of our democracy and I concur and thank Senator Ó Domhnaill for putting it succinctly this morning. The noise that is being caused about GRECO as an important report does not take away from the fact that the Bill is for the reform of the elitist Judiciary and it will make the courts and the law available to the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soap in this country. That is why I will support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_131">I want to raise the disappointment with HIQA. HIQA has written 15 reports on the different centres for people with disabilities throughout the country. Unfortunately Cherry Orchard in my area of Dublin South-Central in Ballyfermot has been taken off the register of approved centres for people with disabilities. It is two separate houses in the Cherry Orchard campus and it has been taken off the register for major non-compliance with standards. What was very concerning was the procedure in regard to what we term "do not resuscitate", DNR. This was not discussed with the patients or their families and yet DNR was in their notes and a few of the patients were not resuscitated to the surprise of the family because they had not realised that this decision was made. The other issue was in regard to the finances of the patients and whether there was proper oversight and record keeping. They set up a new records system but when HIQA went to look at it, the actual record book was completely blank. The third area was healthcare infection procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The Minister could respond, in particular, to the deregistration of this centre for people with disabilities, which is one of the most vulnerable.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">We are all aware of how closed-circuit television, CCTV, systems can assist to identify criminals and to deter criminals in the first instance from committing assaults and other crimes in towns and villages. Over the past three or four years €3 million has been allocated to the installation of CCTV in our towns and villages, but unfortunately only four applications have been approved to date. The low number is worrying and clearly signifies we have a problem that needs to be looked at. People are sick and tired of assaults and antisocial behaviour, including littering. The benefit of CCTV systems particularly in urban areas is immeasurable. It can assist gardaí, who are short in numbers, in their role. A light should be flashing over the low uptake level. Clearly communities want this but unfortunately the application process is too cumbersome and applicants are walking away from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> There is another issue with GDPR. The County and City Management Association, CCMA, has instructed all councils not to process applications because apparently there is an issue with who holds the data and who the data controller is. For example, if a camera is mounted in a Garda station an issue arises as to who the controller is in that case. There has been an impasse for some time and in the meantime assaults, littering and burglaries are all taking place throughout the country. The Minister needs to get a hold of the issue. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House so that we can discuss the scheme in general. He might be in a position to inform us that he has the GDPR issue resolved to the benefit of everyone.</p>

However, he was able to clearly state that nothing in the report would have any negative impact on the legislation before us. If that is the case, I ask the Leader at this the 11th hour before the legislation comes back before us to contact the Minister's office and suggest to him that it is the opinion of the majority of this House that the Committee Stage of the Bill should not progress until we have clarification on this report. I repeat that there is an international report on the proposals in this legislation in the Department of Justice and Equality.

          <p eId="para_141">I welcome Senator Wilson's clarification of his intention. I hope he remains in this House. To have one Member of the Opposition running against another for the position of President would be unbelievable. The Senator would make a wonderful President. I had the honour of studying with him and I know he is a man of high values and morals. I hope he will one day run for the Áras.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> I thank the 20 Members of the House who contributed on the Order of Business. I am not sure if it is the hot weather or the impending summer recess, certainly the octane level has reached a new high.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I join Senator Ardagh in expressing my disappointment, as I did last week, on the energy price increase. Of course, we have an independent regulator. As the Senator will realise, the Government extended the fuel allowance, which can be paid in two lump sums. It is worth recognising that the price hike is due in part to wholesale energy costs. Car users will have noticed that the cost of petrol and diesel has also increased. People who have a legitimate issue paying for fuel should in the first instance talk to the Department about the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which allows them to avail of money for heating. It is a supplement that can be paid to a person who lives alone. We should make people aware of it because the points Senator Ardagh raised are valid and should not be dismissed. Equally we should ask people to engage with the community welfare service.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The Senator made a point about the transition from State payment to work, on which we have done a lot of work. People with an issue have an avenue available to them. We need to inform and educate people on it. The transition from being out of work to being back at work can be difficult for people and I concur with the Senator on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> Senators Craughwell, Bacik, Norris, Ó Domhnaill, Humphreys, Devine and Wilson made reference to the debate on the judicial appointments Bill. The Government's position has not changed. I have proposed the Order of Business and I do not intend to accept Senator Bacik's amendment. I understand where she is coming from. I know Senator Craughwell has left. The use of language is also important. We are Members of the Upper House and I will not use derogatory words, like Senator Craughwell. We are all here to debate an issue. We can debate its rights and wrongs, its merits and demerits. The Minister for Justice and Equality has brought a Bill to the House. He has made amendments to the Bill and if the Bill needs further amending, I am sure he is open to engaging with Members. Regarding the tenor of what is being said, Senator Ó Domhnaill put it very well. The Bill is about increasing judicial independence through reforming and transforming how judges are appointed. It is about transparency. </p>

          <p eId="para_153">It should not be on the personality issue. The Bill has been amended as it has gone along. If there are other changes to be made, then let us make them but let us not do so in a manner that is about a particular Minister or person. Let us have the debate about the issues relating to and aspects of the Bill. We will have that debate, subject to the result of the vote on the Order of Business.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">That will resolve it. I am not accepting the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> Senator Conway-Walsh raised the issue of the Versatis and Anne-Marie's story, which she told, is disturbing. The Minister for Health and the HSE have been before the Joint Committee on Health. Clarity is needed. It might be best for Senator Conway-Walsh to table a Commencement matter. The issue she raises is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Senators Conway, Lombard, O'Reilly and Humphreys raised the issue of water. I cannot summon Irish Water to the House. Senator Conway made a very good point, however, in that Irish Water did run a clinic in the previous Oireachtas. Perhaps it should consider resuming that clinic because it gave Members an opportunity on behalf of their constituents to raise matters around water supply. As Senator Lombard said, we are having an exceptionally dry spell there are issues regarding water. We receive updates from Irish Water by email. It has a Members' help desk which responds quite quickly to queries. As Senator Reilly said, farmers face challenges in terms of growth and fodder for cattle. I hope that the water pipe repair work happening in Fanore and Ballyvaughan in County Clare will be completed. I agree with Senator Humphreys that we need - collectively and collaboratively - to tackle and face up to climate change. We seeing in our country now four distinct weather periods or seasons that we perhaps did not have before even though we had four seasons. It is not going to go away and we need to address that matter collectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I concur with Senator Swanwick about the thuggery taking place in some parts of the country involving damage to property and equipment of the Civil Defence and lifeguards. These groups make a great contribution to our safety. No words of mine will describe the thugs that treat people so badly. I do not have an update on the Life Saving Equipment Bill 2017. I will not be a barrier to the Senator having it brought back to the House and I hope the Department will engage with him on that. I have worked with him on other Bills and the one that is coming before the House this week. He will not find me wanting in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Unfortunately, I was not able to meet Senator Gavan's delegation yesterday. He is right about the hospitality sector that it is important that people are treated properly in respect of wage and working conditions. I am an advocate of collective negotiation and bargaining. I disagree with them, however, on the 9%. That was a very good decision on the part of the previous Government. Not only does it benefit the hotel industry, it also benefits the service industry. Are we saying to the hairdressers of Ireland that we will put their prices up and force them to question whether they take people on or let them go and increase the prices to customers? It affects more than the hotel industry. I understand the Senator's point but there is a bigger picture and this benefits many different sectors of our economy. The Irish Hotels Federation should and must engage with workers. I have never deviated from that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Senator Mulherin raised the issue of premature scrappage of cars. Her point about the different ways people use cars is important. The Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles govern this area. Senator Mulherin's points on this are very pertinent and valid and I would be happy to invite the Minister to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Senator Norris referred to the Taoiseach's comments on the media. I was not present. The Taoiseach's spokesperson said that his comments were taken out of context and quoted selectively. We do need to have an independent media.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">To be fair, we are well served by the majority of our journalists who are people of integrity and of the highest calibre but they are not immune from being to held to account or criticism themselves. I smiled when I listened to 'Morning Ireland' earlier. I also smiled when I read about the matter on Twitter. However, I was not at the Taoiseach's event. We live in a society where we are all open to being held to account. That is the way it should be and we do need to have an independent strong media that holds us all to account. I am all for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator Byrne referred to Shannon Airport. I commend those in Shannon Airport working with the ESB on the reduction in carbon emissions and reducing electricity usage by one third. I agree with the Senator that we are benefiting from small craft breweries emerging. Deputy Alan Kelly has a Bill before the Dáil which will come into the Seanad before the recess. It is unacceptable that the bigger brewery can have a monopoly. We need to support our small craft beer industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Senator Murnane O'Connor raised the very important issue of the Carillion schools and Sammon. The contract was awarded to the company and it has the obligation and duty to look after the subcontractors but I agree with her that it is unacceptable that many subcontractors, small people employing one or two or even working on their own are being treated the way they have been treated. I fully concur with her on that. I have met several subcontractors who have been engaged in work at the schools to which the Senator referred. One contractor living in Cork has had to let people go. That is a disastrous consequence of a decision which we all thought was a good one and we have seen what happened. The examiner is negotiating or engaging with the creditors. That is of no real benefit or solace to the subcontractor but the Senator is right to raise the point.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> Senators Craughwell, Warfield, Wilson and Senator Norris, who did so half jocosely, half sincerely raised the matter of the Presidency.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">Let us await the decision of An tUachtarán on whether he is going to run again or not. Then we might have a debate on who should run against him or not or who will or who might not run. There are always difficulties in the nomination process, whether internal to a party or an independent grouping. Democracy involves elections, whether for the presidency, the local authority, the European Council, the Dáil or Seanad. I would certainly welcome an election contest for the presidency. We should be afraid of that. Whether it is right or not is a different matter. Some members of the media will say Michael D. Higgins should be let run on his own. Others will say he should be opposed and do we want the cost of an election. I do not think we can put a cost on democracy. A price should not be put on democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> I join Senator Warfield in congratulating those involved in street art, not just in Dublin but also in Cork. The Reimagine Cork group did a wonderful job transforming the streetscape and public realm in Cork. I fully welcome the start collective that has been put in place. It does add vibrancy to the city and I would be happy to work with the Senator to ensure that we recognise the different groups. Sometimes the decisions of local authorities on the erection of hoardings or murals baffles those of us who are not planners or architects or engineers or urban planners.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Sometimes we should just allow people to be creative. In White Street in Cork, we have a series of walls where those who engage in graffiti go in and do their work. It is very creative and artistic. It might not be to everyone's taste but it is a space where young people in particular can go. Reimagine Cork has transformed the streetscape and I congratulate the volunteers.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Turning to Senator Humphreys, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, of the Seanad agreed yesterday to the request from the Dáil regarding a climate change committee. It is important and we will endeavour to take it seriously. Senator Mulherin has been very strong within our party in terms of promoting measures against climate change. She has been a great advocate in that regard. I would love to travel around the country with Senator Davitt. I would love to get into the car with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I am trying to assist. Senator Davitt is right that local authorities and local representatives must work to ensure that we protect our towns and villages because they are the lifeblood of rural Ireland. To be fair to the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Ring, he has a programme of work and he is engaging with it. There needs to be a collaborative approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> On Senator Devine's question, I only heard a snippet regarding the report on Cherry Orchard that is emerging from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA. It is a concern. The report needs to be implemented. I refer also to the issues raised in respect of resuscitation, engagement and communication. It is a source of worry. Senator Devine works in the area and I am involved myself. This is one that we need to get right. It is not just about resources, it is also about a combined effort on resourcing, communications, staffing and engagement. To be fair, we are very lucky that the vast majority of the facilities and homes that people live in are of an impeccable standard. However, the points Senator Devine raised need to be worked on. I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Senator Gallagher comes in with the hard question at the end nearly every day. He raised the issue of CCTV today. The Government committed €1 million last year and this year to the project. There have been four CCTV projects commenced, four are awaiting approval and 14 more are going to be approved. The Senator's point on the issue of data protection is one that is exercising the local authorities because they will be the data controllers. There must also be engagement with the local joint policing committees and the councils. We should not be putting bureaucracy in the way of CCTV equipment being erected. That is the point Senator Gallagher is making and I agree with him.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_337">My amendments in this grouping all relate to a new provision that I am inserting in section 29F. On Committee Stage, Senator Ruane proposed an amendment providing that an applicant could seek a review of a decision of an appeals committee not to hear or determine appeal under section 29. At the time, I advised the Senator that I accepted the intention of her amendment but wished to have the opportunity to draft the new subsection in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. As can be seen by the number of new subsections required to provide for this review, it was important to undertake that drafting work to ensure the new provisions will work effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Amendment No. 1 inserts a new subsection (k) to provide for procedures to set out the manner in which and period during which such a review shall be undertaken. The Bill provides for consultation with the educational partners on new procedures for section 29 appeals, and this amendment will ensure that these procedures and the relevant consultation will also cover the manner in which this review can be undertaken and the timelines for requesting and conducting a new review. Amendment No. 2 is a consequential numbering amendment as a result of the new subsection (k).</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Amendment No. 5 provides for the review itself. It provides that where an applicant receives a copy of a decision from an appeals committee that it is not going to hear or determine an appeal, that applicant can request for the Minister to review that decision. Where the Minister receives a request for a review, he or she shall appoint a member of an appeals panel to review the decision. This person shall not have been a member of the appeals committee that made the decision to refuse to hear or determine the appeal. The person appointed shall review the decision, and following the review shall make a recommendation to the Minister that the decision of the appeals committee is either upheld or set aside. Where the Minister receives a recommendation that the decision should be set aside, the Minister shall direct the appeals committee to proceed to hear or determine the appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I am satisfied that the amendments meet the intention of the Senator in proposing the amendment on Committee Stage. I agree with the Senator that it is important to allow a parent or guardian to seek a review where an appeals committee has decided not to hear or determine an appeal. It is an important new provision within section 29, and I am pleased to have been in a position to facilitate the Senator in bringing it forward. Amendments Nos. 7 to 10, inclusive, are numbering amendments consequential to amendment No. 5.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> The other amendments in this grouping are amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 6. I have considered amendment No. 3 and understand the intention to copper-fasten the action of the school must be taken after internal review where an error or failure on the part of the school has had a material effect on the student's application for admission. Amendment No. 3 will ensure that where a school finds an error or failure in how it applied its admission policy during an internal review by the board and that error or failure had a material effect on a student's application, the school must rectify the matter appropriately. Where the error or failure related to admission, the school must admit the student, and where it related to a student's ranking on a waiting list, the school must adjust the student's ranking. On the previous occasion, the Senator rightly pointed out that there was an ambiguity in the way the original provision was phrased. I am happy to accept her amendment, which will bring greater clarity to the internal review on the admissions conducted by the schools' board of management.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Amendment No. 4 provides that at the request of an applicant, a section 29 appeals committee may facilitate "consultation between the applicant and an appropriate member of staff in a neighbouring or otherwise appropriate school, for the purposes of preparing an appeal under this section". The position with this amendment is somewhat different. I do not consider it appropriate and, therefore, it would not be appropriate to accept it. Section 29D(2) provides that, "oral hearings shall be conducted with the minimum of formality consistent with giving all parties a fair hearing". </p>
          <p eId="para_343">The Bill provides for procedures on section 29 appeals to be developed after consultation with the education partners, including bodies representative of parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> Under the current procedures for hearings and determining section 29 appeals, the parent or guardian can bring up to two additional persons to attend the hearing with him or her. In addition, with the prior approval of the appeals committee, one of these two additional persons can make the appeal at the hearing on behalf of a parent or student. It is my intention that the new procedures for hearing and determining section 29 appeals will also provide for a parent or guardian to bring an additional person of his or her choosing to an appeal hearing if he or she desires.</p>
          <p eId="para_345"> While I appreciate the good intention behind this proposal, the approach set out is not technically feasible. It is based on an appeals committee that can be appointed only after an appeal has been made, facilitating this arrangement in advance of any appeal being made. It also potentially opens up the charge of actual or perceived bias should a committee consider or become involved in the issues under appeal before the appeal is even made. The Bill already provides for Tusla's education and welfare services to appoint an independent person to take an appeal on behalf of the student. It also provides for the education welfare services or the National Council for Special Education to support a parent's appeal by the making of submissions to the appeals committee. I consider this to be the more appropriate approach to providing parents with impartial and independent support in regard to section 29 appeals.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The amendment is asking the appeals committee, which must hear independently the case being put forward, to become involved in facilitating the presentation of an appeal. That would not be regarded as a legally sound way to proceed. By contrast, there is already provision for the expertise of either Tusla or the National Council for Special Education to support a parent, or for the parent to pick his or her own people to attend the hearing and support the presentation of the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> As for amendment No. 6, I am providing an alternative version. While I am not accepting amendment No. 6, I have provided an amendment that meets the intention of Senator Ruane.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I thank the Minister and his officials for giving me time between the last occasion on which we considered this and now to come to some agreements. I welcome the Minister's acceptance of amendment No. 3. It gets rid of the lack of clarity over where a child can be placed on a waiting list. I accept all the related amendments. I am referring to amendments Nos. 1, 2, 5 and the others in the group.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I listened to what the Minister said about amendment No. 4. Although I had support for it, I believe what the Minister said makes sense. My wording is such that I bring in the appeals committee before an actual appeal has been submitted. I am willing to accept the Minister is correct in this regard. I will not push the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> I do not have much to add, other than that the amendments are welcome. I trust that when it comes to the time for me to remove my amendments, the Minister will have alternative wording.</p>

          <p eId="para_360">Amendment No. 11 provides for a review of the new section 37A of the Education Act 1998, which provides the Minister with the power to direct a school to open a special class following a report of the National Council for Special Education. The amendment requires the Minister to commence the review not later than three years after the new section 37A comes into operation, and that the Minister shall make a report of the findings made on the review to each House of the Oireachtas within 12 months of the expiration of that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Amendment No. 13 is a consequential numbering amendment arising from the insertion of the provision in amendment No. 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> I thank Senator Kelleher for proposing an amendment on Committee Stage to provide for a review of the operation of the new section 37A. I was pleased to accept approximately 12 or so of the Senator's amendments on Committee Stage. While I agreed to the Senator's proposal regarding this review, I advised that I wished to have this particular amendment drafted in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> Amendment No. 11, which has now been redrafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in line with the approach set out by Senator Kelleher, inserts a new subsection in section 37A. Section 37A provides the Minister with the power to direct a school to open a special class following a report by the National Council for Special Education. The new amendment I am introducing today provides for a review of the operation of the new section. It requires the Minister to commence that review not later than three years after section 37A comes into operation, as I said. This effectively means the report must be completed within four years of the section coming into operation given the 12-month period. I agree with Senator Kelleher that it will be important to review how this important new section of the Bill will operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has drafted the provision in line with similar review provisions in recent legislation. This includes, for example, the Data Protection Act 2018, the Gender Recognition Act 2015 and the Protected Disclosures Act 2014. Amendment No. 13 is a consequential numbering amendment arising from the insertion of the new subsection by amendment No. 11.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> If this amendment is accepted, we will have a significant new provision such that where the National Council for Special Education identifies a need that is not being met, it can, having reference to a series of procedural requirements, require a school to open a special unit to provide for children with special needs. In the Lower House, there was considerable concern that although the National Council for Special Education has the power to designate a school to take a child, there can be circumstances in which schools may be resistant to opening special units. It was felt the power should be available as a reserved power.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> I pointed out here that, to be fair to schools, the evidence is that there is openness to the creation of these special units. There were 548 in 2011 and there are now 1,304. That is a very substantial expansion. The power in question is an important reserved power that the Minister should have at his or her disposal to ensure no barrier is raised unnecessarily against a child in a way that would prevent him or her from getting the most appropriate education.</p>

          <p eId="para_372">We addressed this issue in my amendments on Committee Stage. The Minister indicated that his aim with the Bill was to make incremental progress in secularising Irish education and removing barriers for access to education. Of course I welcome such efforts and I will be supporting this legislation in the final vote. However, I appeal to the Minister to again consider why we are taking half measures in this regard. Is it even fair to take an approach of secularisation when it comes to national schools with a Catholic ethos, yet not with other faith groups? Do State money and State institutions, be they educational or otherwise, have any role when it comes to promotion of religious faith?</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The Green Party believes that State education should be precisely that: State-funded and run with an exclusive focus on the promotion of education and social development, and not the promotion of religious faith. Such promotion has its place in churches, community and faith groups as well as in homes and within families, but not within State institutions such as schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> We disestablished our church in 1869, yet here we are 150 years later talking about preferential treatment in admissions on the basis of religious faith, a promotion of faith if ever there was one. I am fully in support of the principle of religious freedom, but as important is the right to freedom from religion. That is why I have moved this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Amendment No. 20 relates to arrangements for children not taking part in religious classes. I did not get to speak to this point on Committee Stage. I intend to press this amendment because it is one that I have personal experience of as a mother of children who did not partake in religious instruction in school. They sat down the back of the class and were left out and left aside. It was not a particularly satisfactory arrangement. I imagine teachers themselves are seldom happy with such arrangements. Guidance from the Department in this regard would be useful. The amendment would require the Department to provide guidelines to schools on how they should put in place age-appropriate alternatives for those who do not wish to attend religious instruction during school hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> As I have mentioned previously, I believe freedom from religion is an important part of religious freedom, but the current system is not adequate to ensure that students affected do not feel excluded or that their time is poorly used as they merely wait out the class. The amendment would ensure freedom from discrimination and protection of a child's right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion in school. As the Government acts to remove the baptism barrier in our national schools, it is only logical for the Department to set guidelines to ensure that all students are treated equally across schools when they opt out of religious classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> Earlier this year, the Minister issued a circular to all education and training board schools requiring them to provide alternative subject choices for students who do not wish to partake in religion class in school. However, this measure only applies to education and training board schools, the logic being that they are multi-denominational.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> I anticipate that the Minister will argue that he does not normally issue guidelines to schools on issues such as this, but that is belied by the fact that the Department has done so for education and training board schools. My amendment would thus make it compulsory to issue guidelines to deal with this question in all schools. Apart from giving schools certainty in coping with a shift to a more diverse population and an increasingly non-religious population, it would also ensure the right of students to not partake in these classes. It would ensure the children affected could spend the time productively and have their wishes respected.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_379">I want to express my support on behalf of Sinn Féin for these amendments. As the Minister knows, we welcome the Bill and the level of engagement. However, I believe the Minister is missing an opportunity with regard to these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> It does not make sense for a modern republic to still have the vast majority of schools under a particular faith control. The most logical step is to separate church and State. As republicans, we have consistently called for this. I believe the Minister is missing an opportunity. This is an opportunity to be bold and embrace the republic that we need to build. Notwithstanding the fact that this Bill represents progress, the Minister could have gone further. Perhaps it speaks to the ideological differences between us. As a party of the left, we fully embrace the separation of church and State. As a party of the right, regrettably, Fine Gael, does not at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> I have personal experience currently of the issue amendment No. 20 seeks to address. Effectively, my children are parked at one side for the best part of half a year in holy communion and confirmation classes. That is not good enough in a modern republic. We did not have an opportunity to send our children to a non-Catholic school. We wanted to ensure our children got an education through Irish. We had no choice. The Department can and must do better. Again, I encourage the Minister to address amendment No. 20. I accept that amendment No. 14 is probably politically impossible for him given the conservative nature of his party, but surely he should be able to embrace amendment No. 20.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_382">I thank the Senators for this discussion. Perhaps I come from a different perspective but I certainly favour diversity in education. I believe that, as the Constitution sets out, parents are the primary educators. I believe that the State should try to facilitate parents to the best of its ability. That was the background to the approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> I had a consultation on this matter. Alternative approaches were being canvassed on how this should be dealt with, such as only allowing religion to be used within the catchment. Some parties put forward that idea while other ideas included having nearest-the-school rules and so on. None of these met with consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> I sought to see how we could facilitate parents to the best of our ability. I think it is perfectly acceptable that a parent might want to a child brought up in the faith of the parent. I do not find that to be an objectionable ambition in a republic. We have many high-quality minority religion schools. We have many children and their parents, who have a legitimate and recognised desire that their children should have the chance to be brought up in a school reflecting their ethos. The difficulty is that if we removed religion altogether the concept of a minority religion school would effectively disappear. We could not have a minority religion school if it was obliged to accept all-comers because effectivity minority religion schools represent one out of every 20 schools. They would not be able to maintain the ethos. By contrast, I am not permitting religion to be used in Catholic schools. People in that situation have 18 of every 20 schools to choose from. A parent who wants to have a child brought up in a school with a Catholic ethos can achieve that. Similarly non-denominational schools do not apply religion and I am not in any way interfering with that. As a result, 19 out of every 20 schools will not be using religion as a criterion. The one exception to that will be in the case of minority schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I am providing that we allow those schools which are a valuable part of our tradition to continue. I am surprised the Senator is advocating that we should abandon that part of our tradition, given all our political history.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> Senator Grace O'Sullivan has argued that we should have State education institutions but the truth is we do not. Of our primary schools, 99.5% or more are not State institutions but are private institutions. That is because of all sorts of historical reasons. There are denominational schools and Educate Together is another private institution, along with An Foras Pátrúnachta. The only State schools are the education and training board, ETB, schools, and there is a small number of community national schools. It was 11 at the last count. The philosophy of those schools is that every religion should be invited in and equally celebrated. It is a great model and I would love to see many more State schools. I would like to see the ETB model getting greater traction. I hope we will see transfers of patronage to that model.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> For all sorts of reasons we did not go down that road. We have a different model and we must develop and reform the model as best we can. It is what I am doing here. It is a significant reform and I can see it in my constituency. Senator Ó Ríordáin would have the same experience. Parents feel obliged to have their child baptised simply to get into school or they find they live in an area where a baptised child will get a priority in a local school over their child. That is not acceptable. My role is about satisfying parents to the best of my ability rather than imposing uniformity or one model of school.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Our education system is very much a consensus, with stakeholder engagement and consultation being a very big feature. One may say this slows progress but Senators may have read the book by the late Fr. John O'Holohan - sadly, he was recently buried - that reflected on education in the past 50 years. He made a very persuasive case that stakeholder engagement has been a strength of our system. Although we have much friction and tensions, we have seen much very valuable reform. We must continue and accelerate that reform. I am really keen to see far greater diversity. It is wholly inappropriate that 95% of our schools are denominational when at the last count nationally, slightly more than 50% of parents who get married did so in denominational ceremonies. Ireland is changing very rapidly and we must facilitate that change. I hope we can accelerate such change.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> I did not address the provision in the amendments that Senator Grace O'Sullivan seeks to address. It is the other feature of the equality legislation, which allows protection to review admission where it is essential to maintain ethos. It is not an area where I addressed the change. It has never been used so it has not been an issue that has exercised public concern. It is a very high bar to prove it. I am addressing the real issues of concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> Amendment No. 22 seeks to apply the provision I am making at primary level to post-primary level. When I initiated this consultation it was very clear the problem we were seeking to address was that 95% of schools are denominational and the capacity to use religion as a barrier. In post-primary education there is far greater diversity, with more than half of schools of non-denominational patronage. I did not address this in the consultation and it is not anything like as pressing. In practice, religious denomination is not used to de-bar to any great extent in this sector, or at least there is not the same complexity. There is much more choice. Nonetheless, Senator O'Sullivan's proposal would for the same reasons see many small, minority religion, post-primary schools wiped out. One could not continue to have minority post-primary schools under the Senator's provision, as they provide that children of a minority ethos who want access to those schools get preference. This may be called ideology but it is catering to a diverse Ireland and the plurality we experience in our community. Ideology should not totally trounce valuable institutions we have inherited.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> There is the matter of issuing directions and we have made a significant change in this Bill. Before a child enrols in a school, the school would have to set out the policy it provides with respect to attending religious instruction. This is an area where there has been a good deal of evolution and we must see more. One cannot have a one size fits all approach to this and the precise nature of arrangements must be considered by each school, having regard to the particular circumstances. It would not be appropriate to try to develop a one size fits all approach to this. I have no doubt we are moving to a position where there must be much more catering for the needs. I am making provision in the forthcoming parents and learners charter Bill that there must be consultation with parents in how children who do not share the denomination of the school are catered for. I would prefer to see that develop through a parents and students charter, with a degree of flexibility as to how it would be delivered in the 4,000 schools that we have. That is instead of having some attempt to say the rules will apply in a small Church of Ireland, Methodist, Catholic or Educate Together school and they must be complied with. It does not fit with the way in which our school system has evolved and the diversity that exists. I am not disposed to supporting that.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Amendment No. 23 arose from amendments tabled by Senators. It provides that there will be a review of this section within five years of the section coming into operation. This is an area where custom and practice will evolve and our thinking about such matters will also evolve. I do not in any way pretend that this is the last word to be said on the matter. Amendment No. 24 will fall if my amendment No. 23 is accepted.</p>

Amendment No. 15 proposes to expand subsection 62(7)(e) to provide that, in the case of admission to a post-leaving certificate course or a further education and training course run by a recognised school, the school shall not be prohibited from ascertaining a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude for admission to such a course. Amendment No. 17 amends subsection 62(8) by redrafting the existing provision to allow a student's academic ability, skills or aptitude to be considered in relation to admission to a special school or a special class. Both of these amendments relate to particular circumstances in which educational provision is designed to meet a particular need. It is reasonable to give an educational institution the power to establish whether a student fits into a particular category, and that is what these proofing amendments are designed to permit.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I move amendment No. 16:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_398">In page 24, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</p>

          <p eId="para_400">The idea behind this quite self-explanatory amendment is that the Irish language should be protected, enhanced and supported. In Sinn Féin's view, it makes perfect sense for second-level schools to be able to give priority to pupils who have used Irish as they have come through national school level. The simple reason for this is that if they have to attend an English-medium second-level school, it is quite possible that they will not have the support they need and their Irish-language skills will slip back as a consequence. We all have to be mindful of the need to support the Irish language. To be honest, I do not see why this simple and practical amendment should not enjoy the support of everybody in the Chamber. It does not damage the Bill in any sense. It enhances support for the Irish language. My colleague will speak on amendment No. 18, which is supported by Sinn Féin on the basis that it comes from the same broad support for our national language.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">I have spoken to Conradh na Gaeilge about the amendment I am proposing in this area. Like Senator Gavan, I think children should have continuous progression from the naíonra to the Gaelscoil if their parents wish. I will explain why this is desirable. First, a child who has attended a naíonra could lose the language skills he or she acquired at preschool if he or she progresses to an English-medium primary school. Second, as there are partnerships between naíonraí and Gaelscoileanna in many instances - this is the case in Tramore - we can facilitate simple continuity for children by ensuring they get to stay in secure and familiar surroundings. This is also the easiest and most practical option for parents. The close co-operation and unification that exists between naíonraí and Gaelscoileanna enriches children and ensures there is effective crossover across learning and development and social and linguistic objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> Third, by having continuity between naíonraí and Gaelscoileanna we can help parents who do not have Irish but want to ensure their own children do, while also reducing the stress on those who might be concerned they could have to find another Gaelscoil in the area. It is likely that the local Gaelscoil and the next closest Gaelscoil will be very far apart. Parents from all walks of life should have an opportunity to choose to send their children to naíonraí, especially in the context of the early childhood care and education programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Fourth, it is not only good for the child to progress from the naíonra to the Gaelscoil, but it is good for other children in the Gaelscoil as well because it ensures the standard and quality of immersive Irish in the school increases.</p>

          <p eId="para_404">I fully support the Sinn Féin amendment, mainly because I do not think many students from English-language primary schools make the shift to Irish-language schools at second level. The amendment will provide protection in some regions and some places.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> I do not support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Senator Grace O'Sullivan, which would apply further down the age bracket. I know it involves the same principle, but at a much earlier stage. It is not the case that there is a naíonra attached to every Gaelscoil. If it is decided that a child from outside the community who has access to a naíonra in his or her own community should travel to a Gaelscoil in a different community, that could disadvantage children from the locality who want to go to their local Gaelscoil.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Many schools with prefabs have limited numbers of places in their naíonraí. Therefore, the classes are much smaller than the junior and senior infant classes. My daughter did not get a place in a naíonra. I was lucky enough to be able to put her in a private Irish-speaking crèche. This meant she started speaking Irish from the age of one or two, which gave her an advantage. If this rule had applied, she would not have had priority based on having attended a naíonra. I oppose amendment No. 18, but I support amendment No. 16.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I will begin by responding to Senator Gavan. Under the existing legislation, a second-level school that provides education through the medium of Irish is free to give priority to students who have attended a Gaelscoil. Such a school can have a feeder school policy because it is perfectly provided for. The general provisions of this Bill allow for such policies, which are already in place. There is no need for an amendment of this nature because its provisions are already adequately provided for in the Bill. I am setting out the factors that a school cannot consider. I have not sought to set out the admissions strategies that schools are perfectly entitled to consider. I do not believe this amendment is necessary. It would not fit in with the approach of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> My view on amendment No. 18 is the same as that of Senator Ruane. Throughout this legislative process, we have taken the view that factors like education qualifications, interviews, tests or attendance at preschool should not be acceptable grounds for giving priority or preference when children are seeking access to primary school. There is good reason for this. As preschool in Ireland is not an entirely free provision, a measure of this nature could constitute a financial barrier. In addition, it would make it more difficult for parents who come from outside the area to seek access to a primary school. Those who are newly arrived would be at a disadvantage because they would not have been able to enrol their children in the relevant preschool. We have sought to end waiting lists by banning them and to provide for a much simpler approach. In my view, giving priority to children who have attended a local Irish-speaking preschool would not be consistent with the approach in the Bill. On that basis, I cannot support the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> The last time we considered these matters, Senator Gallagher queried how a child's level of fluency in the Irish language will be defined.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The only situation in which we are allowing a Gaelscoil to give priority to a child is where the child's level of fluency in the Irish language is that expected of a student who uses the Irish language as a normal means of communication in a non-educational environment, taking into account the age and any special educational needs of the student concerned. I assured Senator Gavan on the last occasion that the intention was for it to be a high bar. The intention is that there is age-appropriate fluency associated with using Irish in one's normal life. The Senator expressed concern that attendance at a naíonra would give a child access but that is not the intention. It is a high bar. In light of the concerns the Senator expressed, I will set out procedures for section 29 appeals which are provided for in the Bill. In those procedures, I will take the opportunity to give clarity on how the definition should be interpreted in appeals. It will set out a guideline for schools. The appeal mechanism will set out what it means and what is expected of a child who has reached this level of fluency. The intention is to ensure children who come from homes where Irish is spoken as a normal part of their lives get preferential access to Gaelscoileanna so their level of fluency does not regress. I thought it was a desirable objective which was raised in the Lower House and which I have accommodated here without transgressing on constitutional rights. As we discussed before, if we started to look at the parent and his or her background and whether he or she was speaking Irish to the child, it would be discriminatory. I have chosen a provision that is robust and works. I also wanted to give the Senator some assurance because he raised the issue on Committee Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">I move amendment No. 19:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_463">In page 26, lines 30 to 37, to delete all words from and including "of—" in line 30 down to and including line 37 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_464">"of a sibling of the student concerned attending or having attended the school.".</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> This section of the Bill has been dubbed "the Clongowes section", which is probably accurate. It states: "...a parent or grandparent of the student concerned having previously attended the school, provided the maximum number of places filled pursuant to that criterion does not exceed 25 per cent of the available places as set out in the school’s annual admission notice for the school year concerned." This has no place in this Bill. I have spoken on this several times. The Minister knows my reasoning for this stance. This is an elitist provision, which has no place in this Bill. It has no place in a Bill proposed by anybody who genuinely believes in a republic. There is no reason to give more than 25% of the places in a school to children or grandchildren of past pupils. This would be odious enough if it referred only to children of past pupils, but the provision for grandchildren puts the cherry on the cake.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Only one section of the education system is looking for this. The Minister and I know who they are. The private fee-paying school lobby are the only people who are looking for this. These are the ones who have advocated for this, and I will state the reason. People are afraid to say it because they are so powerful, they have so much influence and so many members of Cabinet are past pupils of theirs, so they have an open door. The reason is that they want to keep the royal bloodline going to their schools - the old ties network. They tend to be old boys. The Minister might as well have inserted "sons and grandsons". It would have exactly the same affect. I refer to the old boys' network, those who hang around, stay in touch with each other as business colleagues and on golf courses or kick around the corridors of power together. This lobby wants to ensure that its schools have this royal line of succession so that the children and grandchildren of past pupils will have a certain section roped off for themselves and will be allowed access to the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> We talk about equality. We have all mentioned equality this afternoon in reference to provision for Irish language speakers, Travellers, etc. How is somebody whose father, mother, grandfather or grandmother did not attend secondary school supposed to have the same access to a school on that basis? Let us consider a Traveller child whose father or mother did not go to second level school. If a child is not from the local area, their father or mother will not have attended the local second level school.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">If a child is not from this country, clearly his or her father or mother did not go to the local second level school. If a child is from an area of acute disadvantage, it is more likely that his or her father or mother did not go to a second level school and it is extremely likely that the child's grandparents did not go to a second level school. Let us be honest. The only reason this provision exists is because of the powerful lobbying of a section of the education sector, which is fee-paying, exclusive and elitist. They want that exclusivity and elitism in legislation and they will get their way. I do not really expect much more from the Fine Gael Party but the Fianna Fáil Party is going to support it anyway. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael together will support this section of the Bill, which gives more rights to children and grandchildren of past pupils. It is odious, elitist and wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> I know the Minister will say that previously there was no cap and he has put one in place. That is not the point. There is much good stuff in this Bill and the Labour Party completely accepts that the Constitution puts constraints on what can be done with the baptism barrier. We are not going to play political football with that at all. We will not support amendments that ask the Minister to do more than he can because of constraints in the Constitution about religious ethos etc. We know the Bill goes further than many people would have imagined it could have gone in that regard. However, there is no need for this provision at all. My colleague, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, believed this should be at a zero level. Senators should not go far as I will be calling a vote on this. The compromise was meant to be 10% but that did not get through the Cabinet in the previous Government. The Bill did not get past Cabinet in the previous Government because of this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> People want this section to go through without any pointing to it or mention that this section of Irish society has so much influence in this Republic that the political system, over and over again, will bend over backwards for them. They want school ties written into legislation, which is disgusting. This elitism has ruined the country and gives every young person who does not come from that background the idea that life just is not fair and those people do not really play by the same rules. We are writing that into legislation as unless a pupil's father or grandfather went to the school, for example, there is not the same right of access.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> I will make a suggestion to the Minister but he will not do it. He should scrap this by agreeing to our amendment and saying it is right. He will not do it. Fianna Fáil is the so-called republican party but if it supports the Government on this, it should not speak about equality in education in this Chamber or the other Chamber ever again. This provision puts Travellers, migrants and poor children at a disadvantage and it is being put in legislation. This is supposed to be a republic. I know what the Minister will say as he has already said it twice. We just have to go with it. Before coming to this House I heard rumours of the influence of elitist groups in Irish society on members of the Cabinet and politicians in this place but I did not really believe it. It is now written in front of me and we will pass it into law. </p>

          <from>Senator Kevin Humphreys<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_472">I second the amendment. Senator Ó Ríordáin covered most of the points. Often people say politicians vote in this House in self-interest. Dublin Bay South probably has the biggest concentration of people who have attended private schools but this provision is wrong. I might be shooting myself in the foot in supporting the amendment but if we believe in equality and want people to be able to break through the glass ceiling, we cannot put this into legislation. It is utterly wrong. We can speak of diversity and equality of opportunity but we are saying to children that they will not have the same equality of rights as others. If a person's grandfather went to the right school, that person can go to that school as well. In some cases a child might live across the road, looking at its gates, but be excluded because somebody else had the right grandfather and has the right amount of money in a bank account. I am totally disgusted by this. It is wrong. As Fianna Fáil calls itself a republican party seeking equality of opportunity in education, it must support this amendment. Otherwise, shame on it. This is not a party political issue. Members should think of what they would say to children currently going through the education system and who cannot attend a school because their grandfather did not go to the right school. If their father or mother did not go to the right school, they cannot go there either. It does not matter how others did in school, they can get in the door with the right connections. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I put on record our party's full support of this amendment because we are a republican party. We spoke about ideology earlier and we have an ideological divide.

          <p eId="para_475">Absolutely. Although I did not mean it in a personal sense, and I hope the Minister knows that, the last day I asked how many members of the Cabinet had private education. As somebody who is still relatively new to here, it strikes me when I meet senior people in the Government or senior civil servants that they did not go to the sort of schools I attended. People who attended fee-paying private schools are predominant in the upper echelons of the Civil Service and the Government. Those are the facts and I speak as a working class boy who never had a prospect of going to private school. I would never dream of sending my kids there anyway on a point of principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The fact that the Government seems so intent on stitching in this provision is disgraceful. We speak of equality and we all say we believe in it but in this Bill, the Minister is going out of his way to keep the elite where they are. I am genuinely disappointed as the Minister has demonstrated some determination to reform in this Bill. I acknowledge that. This provision is therefore very disappointing. It is not needed. What possible reason is there for this being included if not the reasons outlined by colleagues in the Labour Party?</p>

          <p eId="para_478">It is not required and no damage would be done if the provision was removed. It would enhance the Bill in a significant way. This is class politics. It is about those people who have the privilege of going to private schools and ensuring they maintain the privilege and the line of succession. If that is the case - it is - the Government should be honest and say so. It is about class and it is probably the most shameful point in a Bill that otherwise has much to commend. We will support the Bill overall but the Minister has let himself down with this aspect. All of us can and should aspire to doing better, regardless of party.</p>

Where I come from it is the complete opposite, schools are touting for pupils although that may be the wrong expression to use. Come enrolment time there is nothing but billboards on every county road and main road across the State where schools advertise open days and invite students to come. It is important to keep a sense of perspective on the debate. I would welcome clarification from the Minister that this amendment applies to all schools, private and otherwise.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">Senator Gallagher can correct me if I am wrong but when asking whether it applies to all schools that does not undermine the point about the schools this will have an impact on. Even if the Minister says this applies to all schools that is still discriminatory because my parents did not go to second level school. I left school at the age of 15. My grandparents did not go to second level school. Whether this applies across the board or not it means that I am discriminated against by every school that might be oversubscribed and decide to prioritise against me. I have daughters but who is to say that if I was to have another child and had a son I would not want to send him to a private school? As this amendment stands if I wanted to send him to the same school as the Minister went to I would be actively discriminated against.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">We have discussed this on Second Stage and on Committee Stage. Schools as of now are allowed to operate their own admissions policy. They have been allowed up to now to have waiting lists, to allow unrestricted preference for preschools, feeder schools, siblings, past pupils, religion. In all of these cases I am introducing restrictions where I feel they are appropriate. We will continue to allow feeder schools and sibling preference to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> In the case of past pupils, we are introducing for the first time a cap on the extent to which priority can be given to past pupils in gaining access to the school. This will apply to all schools. The history behind this is that the then Minister, Ruairí Quinn, proposed 25% which is in this Bill as being the appropriate restriction. Subsequently, I understand that the then Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, reduced that to 10%. I thought in approaching this to get consensus on it and consensus emerged around the 25%, the original proposal made by Ruairí Quinn.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> The counterargument is that schools are communities and that there is a value in having continuity around the community and building a connection between one generation and the next. That does help schools to be stronger. We have to decide when we believe it is appropriate to intervene and to what extent, and we have decided to intervene to ban in their entirety waiting lists, to ban religion in 95% of schools, to ban in its entirety access through preschools but to allow the continuation of access through feeder schools. We just discussed an amendment on that issue in respect of Gaelscoileanna. This is a question of striking a balance in what should be permitted and what caps we should impose. This measure imposes a cap where none applied. It is appropriate. This is a fair and balanced approach. Having listened to all the arguments, this is introducing a restriction which is appropriate. Therefore I do not support the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">On Committee Stage, the Minister did not accept an amendment I proposed that sought to empower the Minister of the day to make national regulations on suspension and exclusion. His decision was based on the existence of statutory codes under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, section 23 of which requires schools to draw up codes of conduct and procedures they must follow before students can be suspended or excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> My concern is that schools are developing these codes of conduct on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with no oversight by the Minister. They are able to write them in any manner they wish. Amendment No. 21 would empower the Minister to make national guidelines for schools on how best to develop codes of conduct in this area. This would mean that some form of national uniform standard would exist, bring ministerial oversight to this area, provide guidance to schools and give parents and students a national reference for dealing with these issues. My intention is that this amendment would complement the provisions of section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 in ensuring codes of conduct are developed with national guidance in the best interests of schools, parents and pupils. I hope the Minister can accept this amendment, which is meant to be constructive.</p>

        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_181" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Skills">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_553">We have had this debate previously. As Senator Ruane has recognised, section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 requires schools to develop codes of practice in accordance with statutory guidelines prepared by the former National Education Welfare Board, which is now the educational welfare service of Tusla. This body has been given statutory responsibility for overseeing the requirement to have proper codes of practice and has published statutory guidelines for schools on developing codes of behaviour. These guidelines provide guidance to schools on supporting student behaviour and on the procedures to be followed in respect of suspension and expulsion. Statutory guidelines are already in place. Any potential review of those guidelines is a matter for the educational welfare service, Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, to which Tusla now reports. As the arrangements to be followed by schools in respect of expulsion and suspension are already provided for in legislation and in statutory guidelines and are under the remit of a separate Department and Minister, I cannot accept this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> When I took the opportunity to examine the practices that exist in this regard in our schools, I formed the view that they are very strict. A school's code of behaviour must disclose the specific procedures to be followed before a student may be suspended or expelled from the school. The statutory guidelines in respect of suspension advise that a decision to suspend a student requires serious grounds relating to the student's behaviour, etc. Those grounds must be set out. The guidelines require schools to consider various factors such as the context for the behaviour, the impact of the behaviour, the interventions that had been tried, the question of whether suspension is a proportionate response and the possible impact of suspension.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> Fair procedures must be followed when a school is proposing to suspend a student. When a preliminary assessment of the facts confirms that there has been serious behaviour that could warrant suspension, the school should inform the student and his or her parents of the complaint and give the student and his or her parents an opportunity to respond. The board of management must provide an opportunity to appeal. The guidelines outline that expulsion should be a proportionate response to the student's behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> The expulsion of a student is a very serious step that should not be taken by a board of management other than in extreme cases of unacceptable behaviour. The school should take significant steps to address the misbehaviour and to avoid the expulsion of a student, including, as appropriate, meeting parents, making sure the student understands the consequences of expulsion, ensuring all other avenues have been considered and seeking the assistance of support agencies such as the National Educational Psychological Service, the HSE, community services, the National Behaviour Support Service, the child and adolescent mental health service and the National Council for Special Education.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> This is a good code. I have not heard anyone saying otherwise. In cases in which people feel the code has not been followed, appeals can be submitted under section 29. The last time the Senator raised this matter, she asked about the number of expulsions. I can inform her that in the most recent year, there were 195 expulsions at second level and 19 at primary level. This means that expulsion is required in the cases of 0.57% of students, or one in every 1,750 students. The Department received 77 appeals relating to expulsions in the same period, which indicates that approximately one in every three expulsions is appealed. Approximately 31% of appeals are upheld, and the expulsions are found not to have been validly applied, when these hearings take place. This matter falls under the remit of another Department and is the responsibility of a statutory agency. I do not have a reason to believe there is evidence that we should be demanding a review. The current arrangements seem to be reasonably robust from a layman's point of view. Having reviewed the evidence since Committee Stage, as the Senator asked me to do, I am afraid I am not disposed to change the approach that is currently adopted.</p>

          <p eId="para_558">I thank the Minister. I suppose I agree that the arrangements are robust. My problem is with how they are being implemented and followed at local level. I would prefer to be in a situation where there is no need for an appeal. I am willing to accept what the Minister is saying. I might follow up this matter through other avenues, such as Tusla or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. I am concerned that many expulsions could be going undocumented and unnoticed, especially in areas of deprivation where it can look like a child who has been expelled simply left school early. There could be a large cohort of people who are not falling into this bracket. There might be another way for me to go about pursuing such cases. For the time being, I am happy enough to accept what the Minister is saying about this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_561">I welcome the Minister back to the House. We were dealing with amendments Nos. 3 to 5, inclusive, which are related. Senator Norris was in possession. We had substantial debate on the whole area of the Group of States against Corruption, GRECO, report, which is not directly related to the three proposed amendments to section 2. I respectfully suggest that we deal specifically with amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5, in that order, and that we move on from the issue of the GRECO report and its possible implications. That is only my suggestion. Senator Norris was in pole position. I am sure he will adhere to my request.</p>

On Committee Stage we cannot wander onto general discussions on issues such as the GRECO report. I will give the Senator some time to make his point.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">I am on amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 5. The GRECO report has a degree of relevance, particularly with regard to amendment No. 4, which refers to the role of the chairman and to the chairman being a lay person. GRECO has expressed specific views on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> The Government has suggested there was indepth consultation with the Judiciary. The Judiciary has taken the extraordinary step of putting out a statement that this is not true, and that it is incorrect and a mistake.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> With regard to the question of GRECO, the Dáil spent ten hours last Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday debating the Bill and there was not a single reference to the GRECO report. I believe the Seanad is making up for that deficiency. GRECO stated it has significant concerns about the composition of the commission as proposed in the Bill. It would place judges in a clear minority position in favour of strong lay representation, including the chairperson. This is not in line with European standards. GRECO's position, as clearly expressed in the evaluation report, is that the composition of the judicial appointments board, consisting of a majority of judges and chaired by the Chief Justice, was considered suitable for the selection procedure. Here is something from GRECO that is directly applicable to amendment No. 4.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">Senator Boyhan and I have both seen something that purports to be the report. I can at least talk a little about what I believe is in the report because the Minister talked about it when he said there were no earthquakes and that we would not be upset and all this kind of stuff. I am just using what I understand to be the GRECO report. It certainly comes across in the flavour of the language and the seriousness that it is the GRECO report. It very clearly expresses the belief that the chairperson should be the Chief Justice. I have tabled an amendment to that effect. I will leave it at that for the time being.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">This amendment echoes something the Minister said the other day in the course of the discussion we had on the GRECO report. The Minister said that it should be understood that this Bill does not change the fundamental architecture whereby under our Constitution it is the Government and the Government alone that makes its decision on whom to recommend to the President for appointment to the Judiciary. It is very important that remarks attributed to a Minister, whom I shall not name, but whom I incorrectly described yesterday as a plaintiff when in fact he was not a plaintiff to the proceedings to which I referred yesterday - I just want to correct the record-----</p>

          <p eId="para_689">A Minister, whom I shall not name, said that the purpose of this Bill was to take the appointment of judges out of the hands of politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">As I said yesterday, this is strange coming from a person who, when in opposition, proposed that a committee, consisting of Opposition politicians in the main, should decide who should be appointed to the Bench. He proposed an amendment to the Constitution to that end.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> I want to emphasise that the Constitution confers on the Government of the day the duty and the right to recommend and advise the President of persons to be appointed to the Judiciary. In our system, the Government is composed of elected politicians. As has been done in favour of this Bill, to take away from them the function of advising the President as to who should be a judge is a constitutional falsehood. Unless there is a referendum, that function remains vested in the Government. To claim that the Government has somehow ended cronyism and taken the appointment of judges out of the hands of politicians is simply false. Let it be remembered that, no matter what is done in this legislation, this underlying constitutional reality remains unaffected. The Government of the day must take responsibility and must make the ultimate choice as to whom it advises the President should appoint. There is no way around that or no way of avoiding it under our current system. To make a false claim that one is somehow preventing the Government from appointing people who are eligible to be appointed under this or any other legislation is to pull a fast one on the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">Anybody who puts as much effort as some individuals have done in order to get to the Cabinet table and park their feet under it, should not be there if he or she is not willing to accept responsibility and personal accountability for the appointment of judges. In the end, this legislation, in whatever shape or form in which it is passed, cannot transfer responsibility for the choice of judges from the elected Government of the day, or each member of the Government, to any other body. If one cannot stand the heat in the kitchen, one should not be there. If one repudiates the role the Constitution gives one in the context of making decisions as to who should be appointed to the Judiciary, one should not be in government. It is shameful to pretend that one is a member of the Government if one somehow abdicates one's responsibility for carrying out that function.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> This is important. The Minister will doubtless internally agree, even though he will not nod his head. The delay we have encountered for the past year or two in appointing judges on the basis that this legislation has not yet been passed is unconscionable. Very good appointments have been made by the Government in the recent past. There was no reason not to make them. There was no reason either, however, to go on an individual ministerial go-slow or to take a non-co-operation tack in order to prevent the filling of judicial vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> Yesterday morning, I heard a High Court judge complain of the absence of judicial resources. There are vacancies to be filled. There should be more judges appointed, not fewer. If the judicial system is to function, we not merely must have more judges, the Department of Justice and Equality, through the Courts Service, is going to have to face up to this and put its hand in its pocket in order to give judges assistance in the discharge of their functions. No justice Minister, past or present, myself included, and no senior civil servant, including every honourable and decent civil servant I have ever met, would accept the duties that a High Court judge performs with the tiny resources given by way of support. The House should consider what it is like after the end of a three-week case to be told that one must deliver a written judgment, which sometimes may run to 100 pages, analysing the arguments of both sides, ruling for or against the legal arguments on both sides and analysing the evidence and ruling on its credibility. How long would one need to carry out that function without any assistance whatsoever? How would one deal with this while the president of the court says he needs one back the day after tomorrow to do another case because there are inadequate judges and that the whole system will collapse if one does not keep hearing cases while reserving judgments? No Minister could function on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> I have had the honour of being a Minister and of serving as Attorney General. One could not discharge the functions of either office without people drafting and putting forward analysis pieces in private or without having secretarial and research support to assist one in carrying out one’s functions. However, we ask judges of every rank to carry out their functions with the most tiny and exiguous support. They have one junior adviser each, who do not command big salaries, or researchers as they are called. That researcher must frequently act also as the court messenger for the judge. That is the function that used to carried out by judges’ tipstaffs of getting the books while a court is sitting and sending messages to other judges. That is the only support we give to judges of the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court. Will Members consider the pressure that is on any man or woman, over the years, to carry out that function?</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> I strongly believe that our biggest preoccupation, especially now we are the only common law country left in the European Union, must be to ensure that the quality of the administration of justice in Ireland is excellent and speedy by international standards and that the jurisprudence of the Irish courts measures up to the best international standards. These are important issues. Foreign direct investment companies, American in particular, come to Ireland because they can understand our legal system. They can lift a judgment and understand how a case was decided. Much more importantly, they can understand an entirely independent and arbitral Judiciary will listen to both sides in a case and deliver a reasoned judgment at the end. Contrast that with the European Court of Justice, in which a series of judges sit quietly and deliver one judgment. They are precluded from giving any dissenting judgment. If they do not deal with the arguments of one side or another on a particular issue, there is nothing that can be done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">That is the way their system works. At least the European Court of Human Rights allows for dissenting opinions. The European Court of Justice does not. We need really excellent men and women to discharge the function of being judges in Ireland. Merit-based appointment means that a person shows excellence in doing his or her job. It does not mean that he or she deserves it in some kind of old pals act way. It means that he or she is the best person to carry out that judicial function. This particular legislation is missing an opportunity to deal what is weakest in our judicial system and what is most vulnerable about it, which is that it is under-resourced. Instead of identifying that problem, it is erecting the notion that cronyism is somehow a problem with our Judiciary and that cronyism in appointments is, or has been, a problem that has done serious damage to the Irish judicial system in the past. It has not.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> It is important that the next thing I wish to say is said again for the benefit of one particular Minister who is not here. When it comes to appointing a judge to the Supreme Court, whether a man or a woman, the decision as to who should be appointed does not reduce itself to some statutory formula or whatever. When one comes to consider how a vacancy in the Supreme Court should be filled, be it a vacancy for an ordinary judge or the Chief Justice, one has to look at one issue, namely, what kind of court are we creating overall? Is it reformist, conservative or liberal? These are the questions one has to ask oneself when one is in government. Having been Attorney General, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Tánaiste, I know this. One has to make decisions about men and women not only by virtue of how well they know the law but based on the kind of court one wants to create. Does one want to create a court which will be judicially activist or does want to create one which will be reasonably conservative? Does one want to have a court that is likely to clash with the Executive regularly or one which is less likely to do so? Does one want a court which is going to be totally pro-European in its outlook or does one want to create a Supreme Court which will remember the sovereignty of the Irish people as well? Those are the kinds of questions that actually did decide, in the round, who became members of our Supreme Court. </p>
          <p eId="para_705"> It is proper for those decisions to be made only by the Government of the day, not by some self-appointed group of people who think they know better who should be on the court by reference to the candidates' socioeconomic backgrounds or whatever. I am not trying to trespass on the next amendment proposed by Senator Bacik, which is equally important.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_709">It was an excellent intervention, if I may say so. I welcome that remark but the point is that the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is and it ultimately means what the Supreme Court says it means. Therefore everybody on any Supreme Court makes a declaration to uphold the Constitution and the laws. However, in the minds of different people who might or might not be appointed to that court, there could be very different conceptions of what the Constitution actually means with regard to, for example, the balance between freedom of speech on the one hand and the prevention of hate speech on the other. There could be very different views on where that balance lies. It is on that precise point that the Government has to make up its mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> To come back to this commission, there cannot be a competition run by the Public Appointments Service designed to create a body which is to second guess the Government on such issues. It just cannot be done no matter who is put on this commission. If it was all judges, that would be bad. If it was all lay people, that would be bad. If it was all lay people of one kind or all lay people of another kind, it would be equally bad because those people would have no mandate from the people of Ireland to make decisions of the kind I have mentioned - value judgments about the kind of Supreme Court we should have and the direction the Constitution should take. They would have no mandate from the people. No statutory formula could confer on them a mandate which is reserved exclusively to the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> What we want to do with this amendment to section 7 is to state, clearly and unambiguously on order that nobody can be under any illusion as to what this Act is about later, that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the advice the Government may give to the President with respect to the appointment by the President, under Article 35 of the Constitution, of a person to be a judge." I note that similar wording appears in section 40(3) of the Bill as it currently stands, which relates to the functions of the commission. However, because we are proposing that in certain cases a senior appointments committee should be involved, the provisions of section 40(3) are not sufficient because they refer only to the commission carrying out its functions. This particular amendment is intended to apply to the Act in its entirety. That also applies to amendment No. 110. </p>
          <p eId="para_712"> What I am asking this House to do is to echo the sentiments of the Minister and to ensure that this Act does not derogate from the constitutional entitlement and duty of the Government to use its own judgment on these matters. Insofar as the judicial appointments commission and the existing Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, comes up with suggestions or advice, suggestions or advice are all they are. In the end, responsibility lies with each and every Minister, no matter how reluctant he or she may be, to decide who should be appointed as a judge. I ask the House and the Minister to accept this amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_713"> I want to say one thing on that last subject. At this point I have no inkling as to which, if any, of the amendments tabled by myself, Senators Boyhan, Bacik, Norris or anybody else in this House in this debate are likely to receive a favourable view from the Minister. We have had no hint as we have gone through the first five amendments - and thank God we are moving forward-----</p>

          <p eId="para_715">I have no idea whatsoever as to where this journey is likely to end. I accept the Minister is in a theoretical minority in this House but, because of the deal done with Sinn Féin, he is not really in that much of a minority. However, I think we are entitled to be informally told if the Minister does not intend to accept any of our amendments, if he intends to accept some or if he is thinking of putting down his own amendments to mirror our suggestions up to a point or completely. That should not necessarily be done from the floor of the House. I am not suggesting that. We are entitled to some picture of the Government's thinking on this matter. At the moment, in trying to be constructive - and I am trying to be constructive - we are, to some extent, in a submarine without a periscope. I have no idea of what is acceptable and what is not, of what it is intended to vote down or of what might be replicated in a Government amendment on Report Stage. I know the Minister will probably say in reply that he wants to listen to the entire debate. That is true and that is fair enough but it would be helpful, at least to some of us who are taking a constructive role in this debate, to have some vague outline from the Minister, whether informal or formal, as to whether we are barking at the moon or whether anything we say is likely to be heard, received and acted on. I would not mind whether that happened inside this House or outside. Since the Minister has already said that nothing in the Act has the effect dealt with in this amendment, I ask him to indicate that he will accept it as a clear honest statement of the truth of the situation and a negation of the idea that this Bill is going to take the appointment of judges out of the hands of politicians, which is a falsehood and unconstitutional.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">I do not say it is cronyism that a particular Minister, whom I shall not name, is not in the House and does not come from Laois, when editor of the financial section of the <i>Sunday Independent </i>brought his son-in-law and various election workers onto the team, but it certainly looks like cronyism. I cannot imagine the Government not accepting this amendment because it strengthens the hand of Government. Why would the Government not want its hand strengthened or reinforced? As mentioned by Senator McDowell, this wording is in the legislation, virtually word for word. The amendment states: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting the advice the Government may give to the President with respect to the appointment by the President, under Article 35 of the Constitution, of a person to be a judge.". Section 40(3) states: "Nothing in <i>subsection (2)</i> shall be construed as limiting the advice that the Government may give to the President with respect to the appointment by the President, under Article 35 of the Constitution, of a person to be a judge.". Why would the Government reject an amendment that parrots almost identically language in another section of the Bill? I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_717">I agree with the Senators who said there appears to be a lack of openness on the Minister's part to engage on the amendments tabled to this Bill. Senators have put a lot of work into these amendments. Senator Bacik, on behalf of the Labour Party, has put in significant work to our amendments, which have been put forward in a constructive manner. There has been an unwillingness on the part of the Minister and his officials to work with us to have these amendments inserted into the legislation to safeguard the independence of the courts. As mentioned by Senator McDowell, we could make speedier progress if we had an indication as to whether there is a willingness on the Minister's part to engage on the remaining amendments or if we are simply barking at the moon. We are wasting time discussing each amendment because the controlling bloc of Sinn Féin and Fine Gael in this House will reject every amendment. The Minister said that he will listen to all Senators and make up his own mind but I am not sure that he is open to suggestions. There is a controlling hand outside of this House in respect of the Bill and a Sinn Féin and Fine Gael Party bloc here that will vote down every amendment. I do not believe that is good for democracy. During the break later, it would be helpful if the Minister could clarify if we are wasting our time debating each amendment and if a Sinn Féin and Fine Gael Senator could indicate if they propose to vote down each amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_729">Based on the voting pattern on the amendments we have put this afternoon, it is valid to ask the Minister if he is open to accepting any amendments. Amendment No. 5 in my name, which we debated last night, was a constructive technical amendment seeking to clarify a definition. I had not anticipated there would have been any difficulty with other parties supporting it. I was somewhat surprised to note Sinn Féin voted with the Government to block the amendment. I wonder if there is any purpose to our debate if that bloc - the strange alliance between Sinn Féin and Fine Gael - is to continue.</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_730">I would never suggest to Senators that they are wasting their time. We were here for five hours last night. We dealt with five amendments, on two of which there was no debate because they were ruled out of order, which speaks for itself in terms of time wasting. I am here to listen to Senators and to be constructive. I am more than happy to reflect on amendments that I believe to be constructive and it may be the case that later amendments will be accepted during the debate but I am bound by the rules of this House to deal now with amendments Nos. 6 and 110. On the commencement of the debate, the Leas-Chathaoirleach indicated that to ensure an orderly debate we were to deal with the issues to hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> I refer Senator McDowell to Article 15.4.1 of the Constitution which makes clear that there are no circumstances in which the Oireachtas shall enact any law which in any respect might be repugnant to the Constitution or any provision thereof and Article 15.4.2 any such repugnant legislation enacted shall be invalid to the extent of that repugnancy. Therefore, this Bill when enacted could under no circumstances lawfully change the constitutional prerogative of the Government. There is nothing in this Bill that asserts to in any way change that.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Amendment No. 6 proposes to insert a new section 7 into the Bill, with a general rider that the Act overall cannot limit the advice that the Government may give to the President as regards persons to be appointed. Relevant rider provisions have been inserted into the appropriate places of the Act. Senators Norris and McDowell have rightly adverted to section 40(3) and section 41(4), the wording of which is almost identical to the wording proposed in the amendment by Senator McDowell. The oblique reference that Senator McDowell makes to further amendments probably centres on amendment No. 90. I am happy to reflect on that amendment when we come to it. If it were to be voted upon favourably by this House, there would be validity in amendment No. 6. I will reflect on amendment No. 6 in the context of further amendments and Report Stage. I want to make it clear that the matter intended to be covered by Senator McDowell's amendment is well catered for in so far as the commission is concerned. Were this House to be disposed to the establishment of a senior officials group there would be validity in this amendment and we would have to revert to it. </p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Senator McDowell has taken the opportunity to deal with matters more specific to the Judiciary, not in the context of this amendment but in the context of the Bill. I would not be surprised if, when Senator McDowell is next in the High Court, an opportunity is taken by a judge or judges to make representations on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I would expect nothing different. In fact, I would be very surprised if any member of the Judiciary, or indeed any lawyer, would say to Senator McDowell, "Everything is fine, thank you very much, you are doing a great job". As the Senator well knows, things do not work like that, nor should they. Rather than have individual members of the Judiciary making representations in the ear of Senator McDowell when he is in the courts, I want to point to the Association of Judges of Ireland, a body of some importance, which I have met on a number of occasions and which I intend to engage with on a regular basis covering many of the issues raised by Senator McDowell and more. It is entirely legitimate that a relationship would exist between the Minister of the day and a specifically arranged group or committee, in this case entitled the Association of Judges of Ireland. I am happy to engage. I am also happy to record in the budget for this year increased capital expenditure for the courts and their buildings. Senators may have had the opportunity to visit some of the new courthouses which have opened in recent times. I have had the very pleasant opportunity of seeing the opening of four or five state-of-the-art courthouses across the State by the Chief Justice, and not solely in the capital. That is indicative of a commitment on the part of this Government to ensure that the courts and the Judiciary have available to them sufficient surrounds in which to work, and also that they have the assistance which a modern Judiciary should have in regard to the engagement between the courts and our people. I look forward to continuing that unprecedented level of investment this year in the context of the October budget. Capital expenditure on courts has been in excess of €120 million over the past six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> Senator McDowell is right that there needs to be much more than just bricks and mortar in terms of court infrastructure. He makes a valid point about ensuring there are appropriate and necessary levels of support. We will come to that more particularly in the Judicial Council Bill, which is before the Seanad and which will deal with the issue of judges and supports, the ongoing need for continuous professional development and the ongoing need to ensure modern technology is available right across our courts, for judges, court-users, victims of crime and everybody who experiences our Courts Service. Yes, I will continue to do that, and I would prefer to do so through channels I would regard as being accepted channels, and perhaps even formal channels, rather than an opportunity for a tap on the shoulder or a word in the ear, should Senators McDowell or Bacik, or anybody in this House, engage in professional activities in the Four Courts or outside of this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">Senator Humphreys reads it in the newspaper.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> We are just about half way through the year, and we have had the nomination by the Government, and the approval and appointment by the President, of 16 judges. That is not indicative to me of any blockage, stop or halt. It is my intention between now and the end of this term to seek a Government approval for the nomination by the President of further judges, particularly having regard to the word in Senator McDowell's ear in recent times. I intend to do that between now and the end of term in the next couple of weeks. I reject any allegation on the part of anybody that there has been a form of old-boys network or cronyism in the appointment of judges. Our people and our courts have been very well served over the decades in the independence of the Judiciary and the appointments to our courts. That record speaks for itself and does not need to be proved by citing any instances or otherwise. We have been very well served. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary, and I reject any suggestions that might be made in that regard. I say this without reference to any individual Member of this House. I acknowledge the points that have been raised by Senator McDowell. It is my intention to engage with the Judiciary in a way that is transparent and that ensures that Government is very much aware of the concerns which arise from time to time. These concerns, however, are couched in the constitutional regard for the separation of powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> I will keep amendment No. 6 grouped with amendment No. 110. We will have a look at how we are going in the context of other amendments, in particular amendment No. 90. If the Seanad is so disposed to adopt some of the later amendments, then that will be an amendment to which we will need to return on Report Stage. I would ask Senator McDowell to consider not pressing the amendments now with the reservation of the right to come back on Report Stage having regard to the later ones.</p>

          <p eId="para_743">I truly welcome the remarks made by the Minister. I will do what he asks, and not press the amendment now. As I explained, it is there to enable amendment No. 90 to have effect, and not to leave it high and dry if it was made by itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> I also welcome very strongly what the Minister has said about his relationship with the Association of Judges of Ireland, and his anticipated relationship with the Judiciary through the judicial council and other organs which will be made. I appreciate that. I hope I did not give the impression that I was sent as a messenger here. I was not. The remarks that I echoed here were actually made to a jury panel which was sent away yesterday because there were no judges to hear the case. They had been summoned and had come from their work to the Four Courts to uphold their duty as citizens to function as judges of fact in certain kinds of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> Again, I do not want to be controversial or to waste the House's time any further but I will make this point. We are not eejits in this House. We have seen the foot-stamping going on. We have seen the press briefings stating there will not be further appointments unless there is progress with this Bill. We have read it. The Minister is aware that the Taoiseach got into a slight bit of trouble in New York for being ambiguous about the creation of news by the media. Newspapers have reported a certain Minister's determination not to allow further appointments to be made, and the bad grace around certain appointments which the Minister of Justice and Equality has correctly made. I do not believe those were invented reports. I do believe they represent the actual thought processes of someone who does not understand his function as a Minister. I am not talking about the Minister who is present, needless to say. I am talking about somebody else. All of those press briefings indicated that one Minister was at least posing in public in a way that is utterly wrong and in breach of the duty of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> I remember the late Jim Kemmy saying when he was a Deputy that another Minister was "Mighty Mouse in the constituency and then just a church mouse in the Dáil". It may be that a certain Minister is Mighty Mouse in the media and a church mouse in Cabinet. The impression has been given to the public that there was a go-slow or a policy of non-appointment of vacancies conditioned on the progressing of this legislation. I am very glad that this attitude has been seen off thus far, and I am very glad to hear that the Minister proposes to see it off further. This commission will take a long time to actually get going and there is absolutely no reason for the Judiciary not to be up to full strength with every vacancy appointed punctually in the meantime. It would be very wrong if an individual Minister was able to pose in public, whatever the private reality at Cabinet table, as the person who is preventing or delaying appointments in order to secure the passage of this legislation, or its operation whenever the commission gets around to being established. </p>
          <p eId="para_747"> The last point I will make is this will be a highly expensive system compared to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, system, which I concede had its limitations. However, between €500,000 and €1 million, by my estimate, will be spent every year on the operation of this new institution. We should remember that we are allocating those resources to this particular body in circumstances where the remarks I was making earlier about the under-resourcing of the judicial function need to be addressed as well. There has to be give and take in all of these things. </p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Finally, I welcome the Minister indicating at least an openness to considering the acceptability of amendment No. 90, which would insert a new section 44 in the Bill. Although he is not committing himself to the text or ideas I have proposed, it is welcome to hear that he is at least prepared to listen to this House in its entirety. It is welcome that he is open to the process of being persuaded that a senior judicial appointments committee is better for senior judicial appointments than requiring serving judges to be interviewed in hotels by laypeople as a precondition to them being promoted, say, from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court, which frankly is a ridiculous idea. </p>

          <p eId="para_749">While we have had a prolonged discussion, we have still gone a relatively short way into this legislation and the amendments. That is why, given what has been said already by a number of speakers, I want to nail this as best I can. It is not really a great secret that Sinn Féin supports the core premise of this Bill. We supported it in advance of its entry into these Houses, we have supported it in the other House and we will be supporting the core premise as it progresses through this House. In the primary instance that is the issue of a lay majority and a lay chair. That should not really come as a shock to anyone. Sinn Féin will not be opposing every amendment, and the Government is well aware of this. I do not know of any other situation where we ask to be told what the Government is opposing and what it is not so that we can make a decision on whether we will go ahead with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> A huge amount of play-acting has been going on over the last day and a half, and no doubt there will be more in the time ahead of us. There has been a fair bit of show-boating and acrobatics. The Minister who shall remain nameless may actually be proud of some of the attempts at begging media attention to focus on this issue. It has been alleged we are legislating in the dark but this is not the case. The legislation is here in front of us, and every Member has an opportunity to amend it and engage with it politically on its own merit. I will resist the temptation of the low-hanging fruit in the form of the Labour Party accusations of strange alliances and blocs with Fine Gael. There are only four of them in here because of their strange alliances in the past. No deal has been cut in this regard. A deal being cut implies that both parties have had to concede something. Sinn Féin has actually come in here and used its political craft, based on the fact that we do support this Bill. That is called political leverage or political craft, something that perhaps others could have learned from in the past. </p>

I also wish to clarify that at no stage did I mean to say the Minister had any part in blocking the appointment of judges. The appointment of judges is to his credit and I want to say that on the record of the House. If we are to believe the reports from Cabinet, he had to fight for those appointments. We need the Courts Service to work well and efficiently and we need those appointments to go ahead. That is to the Minister's credit, so let us move on with the business. It would be helpful if the Minister could indicate at an early stage which amendments he is prepared to look at and concerning which amendments he is prepared to take our views on board on Report Stage. I think that would be helpful.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce this amendment. It is an important amendment that sets out a core principle for all of us who are interested in the reform of the judicial appointments process and upholding the core democratic principle of judicial independence. I hope the Minister will at least consider accepting it and that other colleagues will consider supporting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> This amendment would insert into the Bill a new section 7, entitled, "Obligation to uphold judicial independence". It sets out various points that the Public Appointments Service, the commission and members shall uphold. It starts by stating the Public Appointments Service, commission and members shall, "in performing their functions under and in connection with this Act, uphold judicial independence". I will not go through the amendment word for word but Members will see it proceeds to set out how the principle of judicial independence shall be upheld. It states, in particular, that a person shall not apply for appointment as a lay member of the commission with a view to influencing the interpretation of the law or the Constitution by the courts. It also provides that people who apply for appointment as lay member shall not provide information relating to political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs. The same principle applies to a person who applies for appointment to judicial office. It sets out the means by which we believe the core principle of judicial independence should be upheld. We do not see that anyone could object to this; we see it as an important part of a package of reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> In my Second Stage contribution, I referred ongoing litigation in the High Court. Ms Justice Aileen Donnelly has sent a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice concerning an extradition to Poland, of which the Minister for Justice and Equality will be well aware. The Advocate General's recently published opinion, citing existing EU case law, held that maintaining independence of national courts and tribunals is an essential guarantee of independence and that it is inherent in the task of adjudication. I am grateful to Senator McDowell for providing to us some of the text of that important opinion. The Advocate General went on to say: "It cannot, to my mind, be ruled out that lack of independence of the courts of the issuing Member State may, <i>in principle</i>, constitute a flagrant denial of justice." That is precisely the issue at stake in the Polish extradition case. I refer in particular to the issues associated with the changes - I will not call them reforms - to the judicial system in Poland that have caused such concern among so many people and institutions across the European Union. We are seeking to have this amendment accepted in that vein.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> We discussed at length last night what is in the GRECO report. I read to the Minister relevant excerpts from what I have, which purports to be an excerpt of the up-to-date GRECO report. I refer in particular to paragraphs 35 and 36. It is worth repeating, because it is directly relevant to the text of the amendment, that in the as-yet-unpublished report, which we do not yet know for sure has been read by the Minister, GRECO states it has significant concerns about the composition of an appointments commission as proposed in the Bill, as amended on 31 May 2018, which "would place judges in a clear minority position in favour of a strong lay representation (including the chairperson) accountable to parliament." It states this is not in line with European standards, which in situations where final judicial appointments are taken by the Executive calls for an independent authority drawn in substantial part from the Judiciary to be authorised to make recommendations or opinions prior to such appointments. Paragraph 36 states GRECO urges the authorities to reconsider this matter to limit potential risks of improper influence from the executive of political power over the appointment process to the Judiciary or any perception thereof, and to do so in close co-operation with the judicial authorities. This is all prefaced by the statement by GRECO that it takes the view that the Bill, as far as the composition of the appointments commission is concerned, needs to reflect European standards, aiming at securing judicial independence through more substantial judicial representation in respect of the overall composition of the proposed commission. GRECO is framing its comments on reform in terms of the need to uphold judicial independence. We believe, therefore, that one of the best ways to ensure judicial independence guaranteed is to state that overtly and specifically, as we do in the amendment, which seeks to create a new section 7 setting out specifically an obligation to uphold judicial independence. We do not see how there could be any objection to this. We believe it would be important in any process of reform to state this clearly. It would go some way towards dealing with the concerns that GRECO expressed in the aforementioned paragraphs of the as-yet-unpublished report, which I hope we will all see.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> It would have speeded the debate up considerably if we had sight of that report in advance of drafting our amendments, or at least in advance of this resumed Committee Stage. That is why my Labour Party colleagues and I, along with Senator David Norris, tabled an amendment to the House on the Order of Business this morning. I am sorry it was not supported. I hope we will see the GRECO report without delay. The Minister said he would bring it before the Cabinet tomorrow, which will be at the earliest opportunity. He might say whether we will have sight of it later tomorrow or before the weekend to facilitate us in our further deliberations on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> This is a constructive amendment. It seeks to strengthen the declared principles lying behind this Bill. I hope the Minister sees fit to accept it. I hope others, including members of Sinn Féin, who have so far consistently voted in a bloc with Fine Gael on this, will see fit to support it today.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> If, with the best will in the world, the Minister is expressing willingness to engage with us and consider amendments we have tabled, as he has just done with Senator Michael McDowell on amendments Nos. 6 and 110, the problem is that, given the tight timeframe we have been told we are working towards, it is difficult to see how any real engagement can take place on any amendments between now and Report Stage. We are told we will sit late tonight and probably late tomorrow night, and we will probably sit all day on Monday. We will probably sit late next Tuesday and Wednesday nights to have Report Stage rammed through the Seanad so the Bill can go back to the Dáil before its final sitting day, which is tomorrow week. That does not give us great comfort, nor does it reassure us that there will be any real engagement on any of the amendments we put forward and which we have tried to craft carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Some of the amendments I have redrafted in conjunction with Labour Party colleagues were not tabled in the Dáil and it is important that they be given due consideration in the Seanad. We are willing to do that but we are concerned about the tight deadline we are working towards, to which many of my colleagues and I have objected, particularly given that we do not have sight of the full information we should have in having this debate. I am trying to be constructive and I will not go on any further. I hope colleagues will see fit to support this important amendment we are putting forward in the spirit of constructive reform of the judicial appointments process.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">Subsection (1) of the proposed new section looks satisfactory but I have a worry. I do not know whether what is stipulated in subsection (2) is normal practice. Maybe I can be corrected. The amendment makes it almost illegal to answer questions. Reference is made to not providing in an application "any information relating to the person's political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs". It is stated the person "shall not be asked, and if asked shall not answer". It sounds extreme to make it illegal to answer a question. I am querying the wording and the implications of putting such wording in legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_789">Maybe it should state, "should not be obliged to answer". It is important in respect of independence.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> In speaking in favour of the amendment, it is helpful that the Minister read the report yesterday evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">He indicated in the Dáil this morning that he had done so. He can see how this amendment is helpful, taking into consideration the GRECO report and how it can balance matters out. We have been fortunate enough to see excerpts of the report. However, not every Member has those excerpts. That is why we have argued strongly that we need to see the full report.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> We believe this amendment strengthens the Bill and the independence of the Judiciary. Will the Minister indicate if he will consider taking it on board on Report Stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_796"> I have not had the opportunity to read the GRECO report. I only heard what Senator Bacik said about it last night. I could not take it all in. I will have to look back at the blacks of the debate to understand what was and was not said last evening. While I am not whingeing, I consider myself to be at a disadvantage because I have not seen the report but am trying to play a constructive role in this debate. The sooner the GRECO report is shown to the public, including myself, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> The principle involved is of significant importance. This characterises what the judicial appointments commission will and will not be. I hope Senator Ruane will not take offence because none is intended. Elements of what she spoke about yesterday in terms of diversity and some of the reasons she advanced for it take one view, not only of the Judiciary but also of the judicial appointments commission. I made the point that I can see a case for having a diverse commission and that it should not be all the same point of view. By the same token, however, the commission, regardless of whether it has a lay majority, should not be a mini-version of the Citizens’ Assembly that met at Malahide Castle.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">I stand corrected. It held its meetings at the Grand Hotel in Malahide.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> It is not intended that the commission should mould the Judiciary in one way or the other as to outcomes in individual cases or outcomes of philosophy or whatever. This goes back to the point I made earlier, namely, that a person's political opinions can be hugely important when the Cabinet has to decide as to whether to choose me or Senator Norris to be a member of the Supreme Court. It is important that the Cabinet is entitled to make a judgment on those issues. It is equally important that these cannot be delegated to some people outside the Cabinet and they cannot be encouraged to second-guess what the Government should or should not do under its constitutional obligation.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Who do we really envisage will want to be appointed, through the Public Appointments Commission, to the judicial appointments commission? What kind of person do we think will do this? We do not know how much they will be paid. We do not know whether they will be remunerated at all, except for expenses <i>per diem</i> for attending meetings of the commission, committee meetings, interviews and the like. What kind of persons are actually going to put in applications to the Public Appointments Commission for appointment to the commission? Will they be frustrated non-lawyers? Are they going be social radicals or conservative activists? Will they be people who will conceal their fundamental outlooks with a view to hoping to influence who will or will not be appointed to the Judiciary?</p>

          <p eId="para_803">Imagine that I was not a lawyer. What would induce me to put my name forward to be one of the lay members - perhaps chairman, perhaps not - of the commission? What would be my motive for so doing? Are there people who just want, out of the goodness of their hearts and patriotism, to assist in a process of this kind without remuneration? Will they be properly remunerated for doing the part-time job of carrying out the functions of this commission?</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> I urge the Minister to accept the principle behind Senator Bacik's amendment. It would make it clear to each person on the commission, whether it is the practising barrister, the practising solicitor, the judges, the Attorney General, the six laypersons or the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission representative, that it is not their function to vet the ideas and the ideology of the people coming before it seeking appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> When the Irish Human Rights Commission was originally established, there was a group of people who were keen that what they referred to as the Paris Principles should determine who was appointed to it and who was not. On foot of this, the then Attorney General, David Byrne, put in place a process to interview people with a view to their appointments to the Irish Human Rights Commission. Several people put their names forward. I do not want to invade their privacy. However, one of them was a former Minister who is from a minority religion and who had taken a great interest in law reform and human rights. Senator Humphreys will feel that he was a colleague of his at one stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">It was crazy. He was no longer a politician and no longer a danger to anybody politically. He was rejected, however. People who, in my judgment, were far less in a position to give a rounded opinion as members of the commission were selected instead. I do not wish to embarrass another person but it involved somebody who has become since a senior member of the Judiciary and who is a noted constitutional expert. That person too was rejected in favour of so-called human rights activists of whom nobody had ever heard before.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">That experience makes me wonder who wants to be appointed to these positions, and what would motivate them. The huge advantage of Senator Bacik's amendment is that it warns them not to come onto this commission, or waste time applying to the Public Appointments Service, PAS, thinking that they will be the ones who give us a liberal or conservative Supreme Court over the next five, ten or 15 years. That is not their function. It is not their function to make judgments on those things or to ask Michael McDowell, if he comes before them as an aspiring appointee to the commission, what his view is on this or that, how he would decide this or that case or, even generally speaking, where he would stand on socioeconomic rights and whether he would be up for expanding them or not. That is not the function of this commission. The great advantage of Senator Bacik's amendment is that it makes it very clear that it is not a ginger group to shift Ireland this way or that way. It is not a body intended to shape Ireland through the opinions, ideologies and outlooks of the individual members of the judicial appointments commission. If this amendment is accepted, it will absolutely copperfasten it and make it crystal clear that if one puts one's name in to PAS, that will not be one's motive, one will not be allowed to achieve that and insofar as that is one's private, secret aim, one will be frustrated in any intended implementation of a private agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> The question Senator Ruane asked, that a person shall not be asked about certain subjects and, if asked, shall not answer, is hugely important when one looks at the subjects. If people are asked if they are practising Catholics, members of the masons or members of this, that or the other, or what their sexual orientation is, or how they view or do not view gay rights, and if this is the direct purpose of the interviews, that is a direct trespass on the Government's prerogative in these matters. It effectively creates a mini-Cabinet subcommittee to vet people by reference to their outlooks and ideologies, and that would be entirely wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> Even in America, where they have an appallingly politicised approach to supreme court and federal court appointments, in a manner which even the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, would be a bit off-put by, one can never be asked at a meeting of the judicial committee of the US Senate about how one would decide particular cases or lines of cases. That is prohibited in America. It is hugely important to lay down here very clearly to any person who wants to be on the judicial appointments commission that he or she may not ask those questions, and anybody to whom those questions are addressed is not obliged at the very least to answer the question. It would be remarkable if it became known that the lay majority on judicial appointments advisory committee were generally disposed to people of a particular political or philosophical outlook, and that we were generally down on people of a different outlook. It would be deeply damaging to the whole process if people in those circumstances felt they were wasting their time putting forward their application to be considered on merit because the commission would ask questions which go to their religious opinions, philosophical beliefs or whatever. </p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Another point that this amendment would, if accepted, make very clear is that the interview process itself would not venture into that territory at all, and that candidates would know they were under no obligation at all to participate in discussions of this kind with the appointments commission, and that the members of the commission were not entitled to tempt them out onto that ledge of indicating their philosophical views. There is a narrow line of distinction in that a person's temperament is a perfectly reasonable thing to take into account in making appointments. If somebody going forward for appointment is a black-and-white person who does not listen to the other side, that can be found out in an interview process. Temperament is one thing and someone's reputation as regards his or her temperament can be hugely important. If this new commission asks for references, it should probably ask if the person is temperamentally suited to be a judge. There are many brilliant lawyers who are temperamentally unsuited to being a judge. They could be the best solicitors or barristers in their field. They could be top notch, yet they could be repugnant as judges because temperamentally they are not given to listening to both sides of an argument and have huge belief in their own judgment and pre-judgments of most issues. It seems that it would be utterly wrong if the appointments commission were to grill would-be appointees by setting them constitutional law exams, or by having interviews where it was elicited from them whether they were liberal or conservative, and whether it made up its mind based on propositions of that kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The last bit which is important is section 7(2)(c). It says to people who apply for judicial office not to start advertising themselves by reference to their religion, their political opinions or their philosophical beliefs, not to signal that if a liberal is wanted, they are the man or woman and not to say that their general attitude would be to support the State on immigration law matters or to say we have gone far too far in allowing asylum seekers and immigrants to use the court system. If somebody was in a position to say that and signal that to the commission or the Government, it would be reprehensible because he or she would be advertising himself or herself to the Government as saying, "I am your man and I will uphold what you want to do." A particularly conservative Minister for Justice and Equality, much more conservative than the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, or me, I might say-----</p>

          <p eId="para_817">I have always been liberal. The idea that people would put themselves forward as the kind of guy who would be on the Government's side when the court cases come to be decided would be very wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> I am jealous of Senator Bacik for her industry and prescience in coming forward with this provision. It defines the scope of the judicial appointments commission. It warns off the activists from saying that the role of Government will be usurped and the Judiciary will be shaped philosophically or ideologically in the future. It tells them to do what it says on the can, which is to assess people on their merit for appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Merit does not mean how the commission will decide cases in the future on the basis of a particular set of beliefs. I strongly support Senator Bacik's proposal, which would add hugely to this Bill. From what I hear, it would chime completely with what GRECO is saying about this legislation in its current form. The principles in this amendment should be accepted and put into law in order to ensure that those who apply to be members of the judicial appointments commission, and those who apply to it for recommendation, understand that it is not the function of the commission to usurp the function of Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">I agree totally with the sentiments expressed in this amendment but I have some questions about it. For example, it is proposed in subsection (1)(a) that members "shall, in performing their functions under and in connection with this Act, uphold judicial independence," but that is taken for granted and it is the way in which things should operate. How does one assess that? How does one find out whether people have acted in this way?</p>

          <p eId="para_823">This situation is mercifully different from that in America where the retirement of Justice Kennedy has created a problem. There is no question but that Trump will stick in somebody with a very conservative background. We should be glad that this situation does not appear here.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The amendment, in subsection (1)(c), proposes that members "shall not perform any of those functions with a view to influencing the interpretation of the law or the Constitution by the courts." Senator McDowell asked what kind of people would put themselves forward. On the lay panel, they will be exactly the kind of people who want to influence the interpretation of law and the Constitution. These are exactly the kind of people we are going to get. I remember a judge stating quite clearly in open court that he was implementing the law of God, which was above the law of the State. I could provide the House with the name of the gentleman concerned but I will not do so, even though he is now securely in the embrace of Abraham's bosom.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> If the amendment is accepted, section 7(2)(b) would read:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_826">a person who applies for appointment as a lay member of the Commission—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_827">(i) shall not provide in connection with that application any information relating to the person’s political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs,</p>
          <p eId="para_828">That is fair enough. The next part reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_829">(i) shall not be asked, and if asked shall not answer, any question relating to—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_830">(I) the person’s political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_831">(II) the merits of any change in the interpretation of the law or the Constitution by the courts,</p>
          <p eId="para_832">What I said about the earlier section applies here as well. The people who are intent on corrupting the system will not announce the fact. The background of judges up for appointment as Chief Justice, superior judges or just judges will be known. People will have a very good idea of whether they are right-wing, left-wing or centrist and what their religious beliefs are because some judges are not in the slightest bit backward about announcing these things in court. We may not know what position lay members of the Public Appointment Service take but we will know it for judges and we will know what their views are in matters relating to legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Putting a lay majority on this seems utterly daft. If such people are to have had no connection with the law for the past 15 years, are we to assume they are completely ignorant of the law? They will do their damnedest to influence the interpretation of the law and that is one very good reason there should not be a lay majority on this body.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">Nobody is suggesting a team of eight lay members from the radical left. It will attract people with a genuine interest in contributing to a commission and to the Judiciary of the country. This is about creating diversity and I do not understand why people are afraid of diversity. People are only afraid of things when they feel threatened so I wonder what it is about lay people that threatens the Senators so much. People from all different fields will go for this. Senator McDowell said that a judge got in to allow a human rights activist in but that is extremely unfair. Human rights activists are changing the shape of our environment and they did not get in on the back of the judge who was allowed in. Maybe it was because of the amount of work they actually do and the knowledge they possess.</p>

          <p eId="para_843">There is much that is useful in amendment No. 7 and it offers some constructive proposals to ensure that there is clarity regarding the independence of the process. However, I do not think it is worded as well as it might be. I have concerns about the phrase "and if asked shall not answer", which is quite different from not being obliged to answer. I do not want people to be penalised for answering a question in good faith. The phrase "shall not provide in connection with that application any information relating to the person’s political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs" is reasonable but it is important to think it through and assess the effect it might have. We would need to ensure that people are not prevented from including things on their CVs, for example. If a layperson is appointed from Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, will that be construed in a certain way? There is a need for nuancing in this amendment to ensure that it does not gut the CVs of those who may have worked for trade unions or other such organisations. A little bit of thought needs to go into how the amendment may be interpreted.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> I accept it in principle. It is constructive, and we need to make sure that an applicant is not obliged to answer rather than "shall not answer". I share some of the concerns my colleague has expressed around stigmatising framing in some of the language that is being used around persons in this process. </p>
          <p eId="para_845"> On Report Stage we may table a further complementary amendment. The key point is how the commission operates once it is in place. In that regard, as Senator Norris stated, many judges are not at all backwards in coming forward about their political or other views. The commission will have representatives of the solicitors' body and representatives of the barristers, and it may be useful if we have a complementary amendment to make it clear that everybody who is on the commission will operate in a clear way that is not in any way related to a political or other agenda. It is important for all members of the commission to be clear in that regard. I recognise that many of the positions will not be applied for, but they exist by virtue of the role people are in. In terms of the general operation, it is something we could usefully address. </p>
          <p eId="para_846"> The PAS has clear guidelines. Many of these issues would be dealt with, and could complementarily be dealt with during the PAS processes. In any case, under data protection laws it would be inappropriate to deal with a person's political, religious or indeed trade union affiliation. They are special categories of personal data, and there are strict European rules around the circumstances under which they could be used. That is not to say I am not happy to support this amendment, but it intersects with two existing laws, namely the general data protection regulation, GDPR, and the PAS legislation. </p>

          <p eId="para_847">Last night, Senator Dolan made an exceptionally valid point about the issue of lay people selecting judges and having the competency to be advised in that regard. He compared it eloquently with juries. Ordinary citizens are summoned to serve on a jury. They benefit from the legal argument and the case that is put forward by both a defendant and a plaintiff. Colleagues might not agree but there is a lot of merit in what Senator Ruane said. There is no point demonising lay people. Instead, we should put the resources behind them and give them the necessary expertise and advice to do the job, just as we do with juries, as Senator Dolan correctly pointed out last night.</p>

          <p eId="para_848">Nobody is demonising lay people. I am a champion of jury trial. I have always thought that judge-only trial in criminal matters would end up being unfair and unjust, because judges become case-hardened and they tend to believe the people in uniform. We need a system whereby people are brought together to act as jurors, and I agree with what Senator Dolan said in respect of that. I have no objection to the permanent status, which is a constitutional status, of lay people at the centre of important decisions as to whether people are guilty or not guilty of serious offences. That is absolutely crystal clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> We do not allow in this country what goes on in America, where two or three weeks before a jury trial takes place, potential jurors are all interrogated on where they stand on everything from civil and political liberty to the colour of their skin, their attitudes to people and everything else. This is what is wrong with the American jury system. They have developed it to an art form. There are specialist lawyers who come in to try to influence the composition of the jury, and to take the notion of averageness or laity away and try to stack it in their favour one way or the other. Nobody needs to tell me about the merits of jury trial and lay involvement. I have no problem with it whatsoever.</p>

I thought there was a considerable degree of force. As to whether it should be a minority or a majority, that is a different matter. By the way, if it is genuinely a random group of lay people who end up on this, the lawyers will probably be quite influential in shaping their views. However, they will not have the right to impose their views on them. I see that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_853">I will make another point. There is nothing wrong with me asking this, and the Minister should answer now. Will these people be remunerated, and how? Will this be something they do out of the goodness of their hearts? As I read this commission's institutions, a significant commitment will be required. When we select a jury to determine whether Michael McDowell is guilty of murder, we do not put up an advertisement calling for anybody interested in dealing with this case to turn up tomorrow in the Criminal Courts of Justice. We do it in exactly the opposite way. On a random basis, we bring in people who have no interest and never knew what they were about to do to address the particular factual issues that they have to decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> This is the point that I want to have teased out. What kind of commitment will people have to make to this institution? If I am one of the five, seven, or whatever number of lay people we arrive at in the end, will I be there once a week, or sometimes for three days in a row? Will I have to set aside a week, or three weeks if I am on an interview committee, to listen to 60 or 80 people going through an interview process? This is something that nobody has bothered to tell us. Because I am close to somebody who is in academia, I know that the commitment involved in promotion boards in academia is significant. One cannot just turn up and spend a half an hour on it. One has to go through the entire process, ask the same questions and be fair to everybody. Who will put their hand up to do this, and who will have the time to do this? Will they be paid for it? If they are not paid for it, we are effectively saying that people whose time is valuable will have to make a significant sacrifice to be there. Will their employers let them off to do this? Will self-employed people get anything for spending a week doing interviews? When I say "self-employed", I am not thinking of barristers. Let us go down the track of looking at other people who are self-employed, people who own garages and so on. Will they be remunerated for what they do in this role? One aspect I find unclear about the package we are being sold is the terms of engagement these people will be asked to sign up to.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">Will they have to put aside a month a year to carry out these functions? </p>
          <p eId="para_856"> When I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a huge number of people sought appointment to the District Court. When a District Court vacancy came up sometimes there were 120 applications from people who had the requisite qualifications. A problem we face is the legislation seems to propose that we could bring in outside contractors and consultants to do a winnowing-out process, which is very dubious. It is the subject of later amendments. Will we say that some agency will look at the 120 applicants and short-list it down to 19? Who will they be? I do not get a clear picture of how it is all intended to operate. In fairness to the Minister, in this context there must be something rather than nothing. It is the political commitment made by the Government in its programme for Government. I accept that is the commitment but I want to see a picture of how it will work. Who will the lay people be? How will they be remunerated? What is the time commitment expected of each of them? Who does the Minister expect will apply to the Public Appointments Service to get these positions? What would motivate them to do it? </p>
          <p eId="para_857"> I fully accept what Senator Ruane has said. It is wrong to demonise every lay person as a potential subversive or crank or sleeper for Opus Dei or whatever it is. It is wrong to be suspicious of all lay involvement. That point is very true but I am not trying to convey such a suggestion. I am asking how the machine will work. With regard to the appointment of a District Court judge, for example, involving the interviewing of 30 candidates, who will do it? Will it be five, three or two of them? Will they spend weeks doing it? Will they break into parallel structures and do it? When there is a vacancy in the High Court and 60 solicitors and barristers apply for it, who will interview them all? Will the contractor or consultant cut them down to a shortlist of ten and tell us not to worry about the others, that they did not meet some criterion a third outside agency set for deciding who would be reasonably good people to appoint? Will something like seniority be relevant? Could they winnow out people who just qualify for appointment with 11 years' practice because there are people with 20 years' practice? Could they wipe out the junior people on the list? I want to know how it is proposed the system will work. </p>
          <p eId="para_858"> Having served on the JAAB and as Minister, I am aware of its shortcomings. It was not perfect by any means. It never had interviews and just worked on a round-the-table examination of applications. That is the way it worked. It certainly would never have contemplated having interviews or the Public Appointments Service appointment criteria. It took a run of the JAAB and said, for example, that 12 or 15 people were suitable for appointment as a District Court judge and it recommended them. That is the kind of thing it did. If we are to do something very different and grade people, for example if Senator Conway, Senator Noone and I are the three people applying and they put Senator Noone first, Senator Conway second and me third, it has to be done by reference to criteria. There cannot be three sub-committees and different people interviewing making those kinds of decisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_859"> I am not trying to be obstructive when I say it really mystifies me as to how the commission is supposed to operate. It mystifies me as to what commitment will be involved. If we cannot say in advance what the commitment is likely to be, we cannot make a fair judgment about what kind of remuneration will have to be offered to the people who participate in the process. We have had silence on that topic thus far. I have not even seen a sketch of these matters laid out in public. We are entitled to hear the Minister's thought process on how he sees it developing so we can decide what the process is likely to be. The commission is supposed to set up its own procedures committee. It can set up sub-committees. It can do all sorts of things but we have no real picture of how this new body is supposed to operate. We know that in all the relevant sub-committees, laypersons will be in a majority according to the legislation. That may be a good thing or a bad thing; that is for another amendment. The point I am making is I would love to know what is expected of these people if they turn up. </p>
          <p eId="para_860"> Let us remember the situation concerning jurors. A self-employed person cannot afford to be a juror. Jurors get nothing for their efforts. The first thing they do is go up to the judge and ask to be excused because, for example, they run a garage and have one employee. If such a person is put on a jury for three weeks the business will close down so he or she is let off. That is the way the system works. The jury system is biased towards employees whose employers will let them off and towards people who have time on their hands and can say, for example, they will deal with the David Drumm trial even though the judge has warned the trial could go on for 60 to 80 days. A lot of people cannot do that. For an awful lot of people, it would mean financial ruin. A retired person can do it. An unemployed person who is interested and patriotic enough to serve-----</p>

          <p eId="para_862">A Trinity lecturer perhaps could have done it but I do not know. I am making the point that if there is going to be an 80-day trial - it is a point for another day's debate on another Bill - and if we are going to have balanced juries, will we end up paying or compensating jurors for loss incurred in carrying out their function? At the moment we have a cheap way out where people who would be badly economically affected can effectively excuse themselves from jury service because the judges are reasonable and do not want to ruin anybody financially.</p>

          <p eId="para_864"> The last point I want to make is in response to Senator Higgins's point. Whatever criteria apply to behaviour and impartiality must apply equally to judge members, lawyer members, Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission members and laypersons. It must be the same standard. We cannot say to a Bar Council or Law Society nominee that he or she could be pursuing a Bar Council or Law Society agenda on the commission with regard to a particular matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Senator Bacik's amendment concerns the independence from bodies such as the Bar Council and the Law Society. In addition, if Ibec, for example, had a nominee, it should not be allowed to influence the outcome of the proceedings. They are hugely important points. Senator Bacik's amendment is hugely important. At some stage before we create an institution we are entitled to ask ourselves roughly how it will work and roughly what it will require of the people who get involved in it in terms of their time, commitment and remuneration. Then we must ask ourselves what kinds of people are likely to put their hands up and say they want the job. </p>

          <p eId="para_870">Perhaps the word "lay" has a negative connotation, but I am absolutely fine with non-legal people being members of the commission. It makes total sense to me. Potentially, I may be a double pariah because the legislation will mean that, in the future, I, as a solicitor and a former politician, will not have the integrity or objectivity to chair the committee. It is not necessarily that I want to chair any commission, but the intention behind the Bill leaves me a little unstuck. If the Bill did a huge service to the Judiciary, the State and the people, I am objective enough to be able to appreciate that potential benefit. Essentially, however, it states that people like Senators Burke, Mullen, Clifford-Lee and McDowell, who has been Attorney General and Minister with responsibility for justice, or the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, would not have the necessary objectivity or integrity or whatever it is that is implied here. Whatever about us saying the chair could be chosen by the commission, or that the chair could be either a non-legal or legal person, I have a difficulty with actively excluding legal people from being chair.</p>

I am still a practising solicitor and I find the Bill to be an insult to the legal profession. There is a lot of good in it but not in many respects, particularly when it comes to the idea that it must be a non-legal chair. If it could be either that would be fine. There may well be a person who does not have legal qualifications who would be an excellent chair of any such commission but why should an individual who has a legal qualification and legal experience be excluded from chairing any such commission? That is something with which I struggle. I do not know who will come up with an answer on this one. It does not make any sense to me. We have all this talk of lay people and, unfortunately, "lay" is the word used in the legislation. Perhaps some people have chosen for it to be somehow negatively perceived. It is non-legal people. I have absolutely no difficulty with it. I am very disappointed about this aspect of the Bill. I would wish it could be addressed. I do not really have much that is positive to say, so sorry about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_878">I feel very aggrieved. Senator Noone is a practising solicitor, and the Bill means she would have to go through a 15-year decontamination period before she could get involved again. That is entirely wrong. The amendment tabled by the Labour Party Senators is immensely practical. It could do with a little polishing, but it would be a constructive element if the Minister was prepared to accept it and move to Report Stage. It would fill the gap that has been pointed out with regard to the GRECO report and it would give a lot of support and security to the Bill. Anyone applying to go on the commission could clearly see what the role would be. By no means is it perfect, but no legislation has ever been perfect. Whether someone is a judge, a lawyer or an undefined lay person, at least if the amendment is included, it would be very clear what role an individual would be playing because it would be outlined in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_882"> Senator McDowell put a direct question to the Minister and I would like to hear a response to it. I have served on State boards. There was remuneration for members in some instances but not in others. We had people on those boards who, as part of their daily work and remuneration, were members of the sector involved. The person who is not involved is at a direct and real disadvantage. There is a real opportunity cost that goes against the ordinary man or woman with the oil under his or her nails who is doing another job. Senator McDowell has raised a really interesting question about jurors. It is not a matter for today, but it is something that needs serious consideration in our modern State where people now measure time by minutes and not by days. A generation or two ago, there was nothing in a day here or there but that is not the case any more. People's lives are down to hours and quarters of hours, unless they are happily retired or have a lot of free time.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> I listened to Senator McDowell speak earlier. I totally agree with his point on somebody who is brilliant lawyer in whatever field.

          <p eId="para_887">I refer to members of the Judiciary in juxtaposition with the lay people on the board. I just see it as two sides of a coin that should ordinarily and easily complement each other. In a sense, a judge's role, not on this commission but in day-to-day work, has some of the elements of being a chairperson and making sure that there is even-handedness, that the rules are obeyed and that everybody gets his position. A judge will also rule on what is admissible and on other matters but there is a certain part of the role that is similar to that of someone who is a chairman. I do not accept that, because somebody is a barrister or solicitor, he therefore makes a good chairperson.</p>

          <p eId="para_916">I welcome the Minister of State. It is unfortunate, given the way in which this Bill has been debated, that the Minister was not in a position to respond personally to the debate. I asked the Minister when we would see the GRECO report. We debated at length last night the context to this Bill and the issues it purports to address. I read into the record of the House certain paragraphs of what I believe to be the GRECO report, which is as yet unpublished and dated 31 May 2018 or a date subsequent thereto. I will not repeat the paragraphs I read; suffice it to say they express significant concerns about the current composition of the appointments commission as proposed in the Bill and state the move is not in line with European standards. The document urges the authorities to reconsider this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> It is in light of the critique by GRECO, which we have not yet seen, that I tabled amendment No. 7. The amendment is very much in keeping with the principles behind this Bill and the stated intention of the proposers of the Bill, namely to ensure positive reform of the judicial appointments process. I speak as somebody who has always advocated for positive reform of the judicial appointments process, particularly regarding the need to ensure that we enshrine in law the obligation to uphold judicial independence. That is precisely what this amendment seeks to do. It was in the context of our discussion of this amendment that I asked the Minister earlier when we would have sight of the GRECO report so we could know, when debating the amendments, the response of the Government to that report and precisely what the GRECO criticisms are. All I have are excerpts that I believe are from the GRECO report, but we are all at a severe disadvantage drafting and debating amendments at this late stage, halfway through Committee Stage, without any knowledge of whether the Minister has seen the report and what his response to it will be.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> When will the GRECO report will be available to us as legislators in the Seanad? We have been told the debate will continue tomorrow until late. It will obviously go late tonight, and it will probably continue into Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of next week with a view to ramming it into the Dáil by Thursday of next week. I asked the Minister whether he could really commit to reviewing amendments we have tabled and coming back to us on Report Stage given the very tight timeframe, which is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> I listened very carefully to the contributions of colleagues during the debate. The Minister said there had been no go-slow on judicial appointments and that judicial appointments were being made even though the Bill was in the offing. In that context, I question again the urgent desire to get the Bill back to the Dáil by Thursday of next week given that the Minister said there are no judicial appointments to be made that are awaiting the passage of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">I have been a Member of this House long enough to know that justice Bills are always rushed through in the last few weeks prior to the summer recess. It is unfortunate in the context of new politics and the new procedures we have in place that this approach is still being taken such that we have late night sittings and so on. This is an important but contentious Bill. We are all well aware of the particular Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport who is driving it through both Houses, which seems to put him at odds with his colleagues in the Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_921"> I listened carefully to Senator Noone's astute critique of the Bill and I note her comment that she will be voting for it with a heavy heart because she is whipped to do so and also that this Bill is an insult to the legal profession. I am interested in hearing the response of the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, to all of the points made. I am particularly interested in knowing if the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is in a position to indicate whether the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, will be able to review the amendment and to tweak it if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> As mentioned by Senator Humphreys, we are happy to see it amended but we believe it is important the Bill includes a specific and overt reference to an obligation to uphold judicial independence and that the work of the Public Appointments Service, the commission and its members should be conducted in the context and the framework of a commitment to the principle of judicial independence. I do not think anyone could have any objection to that, although a few people have raised issues around obligations to answer or not. It is important to provide that if a person is asked a question, he or she is not obliged to answer such that those who are seeking appointment to judicial office or those seeking appointment as lay members of the commission should not be obliged to answer any question relating to personal political opinions or religious or philosophical beliefs. This is an important protective measure, which is in keeping with GRECO's view that there is no perception of improper influence on the appointment process to the Judiciary. This is an important part of the amendment but we are happy to see the wording tweaked if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> I would like answers to the specific questions I have raised and, in particular, on whether the amendment will be considered by the Minister in the brief time available to him between now and Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_924">On the issue of lay members and what constitutes a lay person, I listened with great interest, as I always do, to the contribution of my esteemed colleague, Senator Norris, in which he said that for him what constitutes a lay person is black and white. He put great emphasis on the issue of experience. There is a point up to which I do not disagree with him. I would not dare to call into question the bona fides of the current Judiciary and those who have gone before. However, I have with me a report from June 2017 in which a European anti-corruption body - GRECO - found Ireland to be "globally unsatisfactory, particularly in the areas of judicial appointments and independence". I would contest that in terms of what has gone before, all of those with the greatest experience in the world have not come up to the standard expected by GRECO.</p>

          <p eId="para_926">We put huge import on the views of GRECO. In its report of June 2017 it found Ireland to be "globally unsatisfactory, particularly in the areas of judicial appointments and independence", even though all past members of the Judiciary had the illustrious experience that Senator Norris so craves. Perhaps it is worth considering that the commission comprise a lay majority, which might strengthen our Judiciary such that GRECO will no longer find it to be globally unsatisfactory. A change is as good as a rest.</p>

          <p eId="para_935">I would be the first to say that we need reform. I have always stood for reform. I did a report some years ago seeking reform of the judicial appointments process, at which time I did a good deal of research on the need for change to the process to ensure, in particular, a better gender balance on the Judiciary. I have no difficulty with reform and will be pressing for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> The excerpts that purport to be from the May 2018 GRECO report state that GRECO recommends that the current system for selection, recruitment, promotion and transfer of judges be reviewed with a view to targeting appointments at the most qualified and suitable candidates in a transparent manner without improper influence from the Executive or political powers. We all know that GRECO sought reform. The point is that GRECO is critical of this reform. Many of us sought reform but many of us are critical of this reform. It is not a contradiction to say that reform is necessary but we do not agree with all of the provisions of this particular reform and nor do we agree with the process by which this reform is being made.

          <p eId="para_961">The particular skills and experience required of the lay members are set out in section 12 of the Bill, a section to which many amendments will be discussed during Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> On amendment No. 7, this is a substantive amendment and we thank the Senators for it. Subsection (1) of the amendment seeks to insert a new section 7 in Part 2. The thrust of the amendment is to make provision for obligations on the part of the Public Appointments Service and the commission to uphold judicial independence. Subsection (2) provides for restrictions on the motivations of persons seeking to be appointed as lay members of the commission and on information that may be provided or asked of a person applying for judicial office.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> The primary concern behind the decision of the Minister in 2013 to engage in public consultations was with a mind to ensuring that the independence of the Judiciary was preserved and strengthened. Ireland's Judiciary is rightly lauded and rates most highly internationally on criteria relating to judicial independence. This is on record, as we know. We are fortunate in having a uniquely independent Judiciary. Other factors were in view regarding the public consultations, including matters related to diversity, eligibility and the adequacy of existing structures in place in respect of judicial appointments. This is carried over into the Bill. In the critically important areas of the Bill dealing with the development of procedures and requirements around judicial appointments, it is recognised explicitly in Part 8 that, in the preparation of statements, the procedures committee shall have regard to the independence required of holders of judicial office as respects the exercise by them of their functions as holders of such office.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> Members will be aware that in my view and that of the Minister, the Public Appointments Service is the most appropriate body to carry out the function of selection by lay members of the commission and, indeed, of the lay chair. It is the centralised provider of recruitment, assessment and selection services for the Civil Service and provides analogous services in the wider public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> The Senator seeks to apply new obligations to the Public Appointments Service itself and the Minister thinks this is excessive and unnecessary. We are fully aware of the excellent standards of service delivered by the PAS to the State. It operates to the highest standards and delivers a most professional service. It is independent in the manner in which it operates and its byword is that all appointments are made on merit. The Minister is completely satisfied that merit will be the only criterion, with reference to the specific qualities indicated in section 12, that will be benchmarked in the selection of lay members. He sees no basis for adding any conditionality to that role, nor would he have any authority to do so, and he believes that it is an unnecessary step.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> The canvassing restrictions in section 62 of the Bill provide that any applicant for judicial office who canvasses any person involved in the process for support for an application shall be guilty of an offence. This would apply to any untoward influencing of a decision to be made by the PAS or the commission. The Minister is satisfied that the functions given to the PAS and the commission, the provisions related to the composition of the commission and the relevant provisions of the Bill concerning judicial independence, and the restriction on canvassing and matters relating to confidentiality, fully protect the integrity of the roles assigned and address any concerns that lie behind this amendment.</p>

When will we have sight of the GRECO report? Is the Minister willing to consider accepting the amendment or some version of it? We would be happy if it was in some way adjusted but it is important to have an explicit reference to the obligation to uphold judicial independence. I understood from the Minister of State's careful response that the Government is willing to make it implicit but not explicit. This is such an important consideration in any reform of judicial appointments that we believe it should be explicit. It is entirely in keeping with the expressed views of GRECO, both in this and previous reports, that judicial independence should be a cornerstone of a judicial appointments process.</p>

          <p eId="para_976">It is important that we recognise diversity. This is not a lawyer-only zone, nor should it be. The courts and the Judiciary serve the citizens and all our people so it is essential we embark on a process of modernisation in the area of judicial appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_977"> To answer Senator Bacik, I intend to bring a memorandum to Cabinet tomorrow on the matter of the GRECO report and, should I receive the assent of the Government, I intend to ensure the availability of the document, some of which is already available. It is not my document - it is GRECO's document - so I presume I will publish it with the consent of the authors. There is no secrecy or an attempt to short-change Senators in any way. I have read the report in full and prepared a memorandum for Cabinet. By the time this debate is resumed tomorrow, subject to the business committee of the Seanad, I would hope the report will be available to everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_978"> It will be no surprise to Members who have been involved in this debate, and were involved in the consultation process over a period, that the former Minister for justice, Alan Shatter, initiated the first round of public consultation in 2013. He asked for submissions from a wide range of stakeholders to assist in the preparation of the reforming legislation. I trust that the appropriate Seanad committee or party caucuses acknowledge the importance of that consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> Nobody was in any doubt that the judicial appointments system, which Senator McDowell knows so well, served its purpose for a decade but was in need of reform. The first line of the 2014 submission from the Judiciary, about which there has been much talk, and for which there has been much support in this House, stated that the present system of judicial appointments was unsatisfactory.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> We then moved on to the consultation process and there was engagement in this House on it. In 2016, the programme for Government committed to a new commission with an independent chair and a non-legal majority, and the scheme of a Bill was published at the end of December 2016. There was prelegislative scrutiny in January 2017 and I dare say some Members of this House were involved in that, though I was not. The scheme was modified and the Bill was published on 30 May 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">It was passed by the Dáil and is now here. There was engagement with GRECO. I noticed an element of surprise on the part of Senators last night that we had been in touch with GRECO, as though this was some sort of sharp practice or unacceptable aspect to the proceedings.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">They were critical of the Bill, both in their view that there had not been adequate consultation and, of course, their consistent opposition to the composition of the new commission. Why not? I accept that the judges may have wanted to continue with the JAAB process and not favour the type of reform in which we have a duty and obligation to engage. I very much welcome that the judges made their views known. Shortly after my appointment, I made it my business to meet a number of judges, including all the presidents, to discuss aspects of the Bill. We did not find agreement. I did not expect to find agreement with lawyers and judges having regard to the separation of powers, and their interests and priorities being in some way different from mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> I welcome that the judges engaged with GRECO. GRECO itself welcomed the interaction with the Judiciary. In the draft compliance report, the body expressed significant concerns over the proposed composition of the new commission, in particular that a minority of judges and a strong lay representation is not in line with European standards. I am not sure there is any big surprise there. European standards are not something we have been prioritising in our courts, the administration of justice and the scheme of arrangement for precisely the reasons Senator McDowell outlined earlier. It is because of our common law jurisdiction, because we are different and because we diverge in the manner in which we administer justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> However, since then I was pleased to propose and get the approval of the Dáil for a number of judges to serve on the commission. It is important that the Chief Justice, the president of the High Court and the president of the Court of Appeal have a role. It is important that we do not leave out the president of the Circuit Court and the president of the District Court in which 95% of court business in the State is transacted on a daily basis. In the Bill, as drafted, it was not considered desirable to have sufficient places for all the court presidents; I believe it is. I ask for the continued support of the Seanad in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> It was made clear to GRECO that Ireland respectfully disagrees with the suggestion in the report that Ireland is doing something that is less than desirable. GRECO has made a number of recommendations over the years. As I said last night, the appointment of judges under our law is based on the constitutional mandate and we will not change that to be in line with any other European state, particularly having regard to a point Senator Bacik raised earlier about one and perhaps other European states and the manner in which they operate by means of their judiciary. I make no apologies for ensuring that we maintain our constitutional mandate. It was never suggested in the context of this Bill that we would go as far as changing that by way of constitutional referendum. Senator McDowell is correct in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> I refer to some of the other points raised regarding, in particular the composition of the commission and what the non-legal people will be doing - what the garage men will be doing, as mentioned by Senator McDowell.</p>

          <p eId="para_991">To compare the work, powers, authority and <i>modus operandi</i> of the non-legal members of the commission to those of juries is probably a misapplication or a misunderstanding. It will not be like that at all. It will be more akin to membership of a State board. I am sure there are plenty of Senators who could draw much experience from interaction with State boards. I will come back to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> Amendment No. 7 seeks to insert the new section 7 as outlined by Senators Humphreys and Bacik, making provision for obligations on the part of the PAS and the commission to uphold judicial independence, in essence providing for restrictions on the motivations of persons seeking to be appointed as lay members and on information that may be provided or asked of a person applying for office. I do not disagree with the principle underpinning the amendment. It is important for us, as legislators, to acknowledge - particularly in the context of change we are now experiencing - that the Irish Judiciary is highly rated. Ireland is regarded highly on the international stage in the matter of our judicial independence and GRECO acknowledges that, as do other international fora dealing with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> We are fortunate in having an independent Judiciary. When we consider many other states, we could go as far as to say that our Judiciary is perhaps uniquely independent in the performance of its work. That will not change under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> I wish to make a point to Senator Bacik and if the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has made it already, I will be brief. The Bill contains reference to the PAS which has the function of selecting the lay members and, in particular, the lay chair. I am not sure what we can do by way of amendment. This is where the Senator's amendment could impinge on the independence of the PAS, which would be problematic. The PAS is independent in the performance of its duty. The body is only a few years in operation. I acknowledge that it continues to deliver a high standard of service to the State. It operates to the highest standards and is independent in how it operates.</p>
          <p eId="para_995">I am not sure of the extent to which it would be desirable for us to introduce amendments to this Bill that would have an impact on the independence of the PAS. The fact of the matter - we need to get back to this time and again in the context of what we are saying here - is that all appointments are based on merit. The specific qualities indicated in section 12 will be the only criteria benchmarked in the selection of lay members. I am not sure about the basis for adding any further conditionality to that role. I can tell Senators Humphreys and Bacik that I am not sure I would have the authority to do so, having regard to the independence of the PAS. I reiterate that I do not have an issue with the principle underpinning the amendment. That is why I welcome the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> I apologise to Senators for leaving the Chamber for ten minutes, but I had a duty to go to the Dáil to deal with a matter pertaining to the Garda Commissioner-designate. I am sorry for discommoding Senators in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> The canvassing restrictions set out in section 62 clearly provide that any applicant for judicial office who canvasses any person involved in the process for support shall be guilty of an offence. This measure covers any untoward influencing of a decision to be made by the PAS, or by the commission. On balance, I am satisfied that the functions given to the PAS and the commission, when taken with the provisions relating to the composition of the commission and the relevant provisions of the Bill concerning judicial independence, restrictions on canvassing and matters relating to confidentiality, comprise a robust protection of the integrity of the roles assigned. I acknowledge that Senator McDowell has tabled an amendment on the matter of confidentiality, which we will deal with later. I am also satisfied that, on balance, we are addressing the important issues which gave rise to the concern expressed by Senator Bacik and which lie behind this amendment. If I can reflect further on the matter between now and Report Stage in a manner that allays ongoing concerns, I will be happy to do so. I caution against any perceived or actual interference with the independence of the PAS that this Bill might have.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> I want to respond briefly to what Senator McDowell said about part-time and full-time positions. I remind him that section 11 provides that each member of the commission shall "act on a part-time basis subject to .... terms and conditions". I expect that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will give consent or approval for a stipend or expenses, just as it does in respect of any service on a State board. I do not expect that these positions will be full-time or anything like it. I am reluctant to name names, but it is right to acknowledge the experience and expertise of Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in this regard. During the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil, the Deputy's strong view was that there would not be sufficient work or engagement to make this an attractive position. Senator McDowell, who has a lifelong body of experience and expertise in this area, takes the opposite view. He believes the volume of work will deter people from making applications in the first instance. Deputy O'Callaghan argued that because there are approximately 50 appointments a year, the commission will not have sufficient engagement to make it a worthwhile proposition.</p>

          <p eId="para_1000">I think we have something of a balance here. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has standard guidelines on allowable levels of remuneration and expenses that will apply here as they do to boards. I anticipate that the level will probably be along the same lines as membership of a State board. I do not accept the comparison between non-legal members of this commission and jurors. I remind the House that we are in the early stages of preparing a new juries (amendment) Bill, which will be based on the recommendations in a Law Reform Commission report that was published a number of years ago. I will be happy to debate that at an appropriate time. I do not expect that these positions will be full time. I expect that serious consideration will be given to the job at hand. I believe diversity is important, as we heard in the contributions made by Senator Dolan and others last night. We should not continue to have a lawyerarchy dealing with these issues. We should invite interested non-legal people with expertise to participate in this process. These people will not be randomers who are picked from the side of the street. I ask Senators to desist from simplistic and unfair comparisons when they are talking about who these people might be. Serious people will be involved in a serious task.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> We are not doing something that has not been done in other jurisdictions. I have adverted to the position in our nearest jurisdiction. As part of the modernisation of the appointments process in the UK, non-lawyers and non-legal people have been introduced to that process. As we do the same here, we should not proceed with the type of fear that was evident in Senator Norris's contribution. It is not as if the sky is going to fall in if an expert non-legal person is involved in this process. In light of the many comments uttered by the Senator over the years about the need to improve the administration of justice in the courts system, I am surprised that on the first occasion he is backing the lawyers and looking to keep the closed shop.</p>

The non-legal or lay people will working well with the judges. That is why I ask Senators to acknowledge the important amendment we made in the Dáil to provide specifically for the presidents of all the courts to be members of the commission. That is where the lay people will have an opportunity for expert and experienced guidance before decisions are made by a commission with a non-legal majority and a non-legal chair. The non-legal chair will not be some randomer off the street. The non-legal chair will be someone who has gone through a pretty rigorous and robust process. I have confidence in the PAS because it engages in such a process when it makes all its appointments. I urge Senators to have confidence in the PAS because it serves us well in terms of the manner in which it makes appointments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">In the spirit of being constructive, I am happy to withdraw the amendment and resubmit it on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> I do not accept the terms of the amendment would tie the hands of the Public Appointments Service. I know in the other House my Labour Party colleagues, particularly Deputy Howlin, expressed some concern about the notion that the Public Appointments Service would be sufficiently well equipped to select from among members of the public the members of the commission that should select judges. We must be careful about the assumption that there is some objective notion of merit in this or in any other appointment. There is established literature about merit and what we describe as merit but my idea of merit might be very different from that of another person. We all bring with us invisible bias or what is often called in recruitment literature "affinity bias", where we are inclined to appoint people in our own shadow. That is why I disagreed with members of the Judiciary in the 2014 report described by the Minister, as they sought less political and more judicial input. We must be careful about achieving a balance so it is not just about members of the Judiciary simply appointing more of their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> I am concerned about assuming that everyone has the same understanding of merit. It has been pretty well established that merit can mean very different things to different people. That is why an amendment like this is important, as it sets out the criteria guiding the Public Appointments Service in appointing both lay members of the commission and persons who apply for appointment to judicial office. It would make certain stipulations and provide certain safeguards to people, which is why we put it forward. It states explicitly what the Minister has already indicated is implicit in his proposals. It seeks to guard against any assumption about an objective measure of merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> I am thoroughly in favour of section 62 and I very much welcome it, as I mentioned on Second Stage. This is the prohibition on canvassing. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties sought this years ago and it is a really important reform. It is one of the very positive aspects of this Bill referred to by the Minister in his response to amendment No. 7. In the spirit of being constructive, I will not call a vote on amendment No. 7 at this point but it is too important a principle not to come back on Report Stage. If the Minister does not return with an amendment in similar terms on Report Stage, I will press the amendment again at that point.</p>

If there are to be 50 appointments made per year and there are to be interviews for those 50 appointments per year, it is not anything like the commitment that would be required of a board member of a semi-State company, who would have monthly meetings. It is something very different. If one District Court appointment is advertised, I can guarantee that unless something has changed in the Irish legal world, there will be 100 applicants for that job. Funnily enough, the higher one goes in the hierarchy, the fewer the number of applicants. That was my experience on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB. If there are 100 or 120 applicants for a District Court judge position, we can think of what is the commitment involved in sorting out who should get the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> A member of a semi-State board gets board papers and goes to a meeting. The executive suggests X, Y and Z and the annual report must be done, etc. Sometimes there are very important decisions of strategy for the semi-State body. On the other hand, this position will involve constant activity because of a constant drum beat of appointments. Retirements of District Court judges will keep coming up and it will be the same in all the other courts. People will drop dead and there will be new vacancies because of the expansion of this or that court. With the greatest respect to Deputy O'Callaghan, this is not something that could be done in 12 meetings per year or something like that. If one is to participate seriously in the interview process, which is what is involved here, there will be something every week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> I mentioned earlier that I have an insight into recruitment processes from academia and someone close to me. One cannot just give this a half hour. There must be an hour and a half given for each person and the people must be asked the same questions. The process must be quite formal. An interview board is a really serious obligation. I really do not believe we can hand out €12,000, €15,000 or €20,000 and say to anybody worthwhile that they should deliver that amount of time. It will have to be done on a <i>per diem </i>basis. Decent people will not spend four days in a row listening to would-be District Court judges making an application for the kind of nominal remuneration paid to people honoured to be on semi-State bodies. I am not denigrating them at all and I fully admire people who take semi-State appointments. I hate the accusations of cronyism in respect of them too.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> The Minister must formulate a clearer picture of the engagement. As I read about the procedures committee, the interviews procedure and all the rest of it, I see a really taxing and difficult job being laid down for the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_1023">I hear among the commentariat and Members of this House that this is a vanity project for which there is no need; there is a need for it. Senator McDowell is quite right when he makes the point there is a need for it. I do not foresee that there will be immediate gridlock in the commission when it deals with the appointment of in or about 50 judges per year. Senator McDowell said people will drop dead, and they may well do so, but they will not do so with any greater frequency under the new commission than under the appointments board procedure. We must be realistic.</p>

          <p eId="para_1025">There will be an allowance paid for the expertise of people. The procedures committee may, for example, allocate a sub-committee to deal with interviews for the District Court judges. I cannot say for certain, no more than Senator McDowell can, how many people would be interested in those positions. Of any 100 applicants, for example, 20% would be ineligible for a number of reasons and there would be requirements to produce certain certificates and clearance forms that might not be readily available. The interview process will not be such as to result in an impossible level of bureaucratic gridlock that would frustrate the entire appointments system. I do not envisage that at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_1030">I welcome the Minister to the House. It is an apt time to take this Bill. I am delighted to open the Second Stage debate. This Bill is about being transparent in healthcare, being protected by law and not being protected by the idea of doing something voluntarily, which is unenforceable. We know that to be the case now. More than that, this Bill is about delivering for the men, women, and children who have suffered as the result of medical mistakes which occurred completely unintentionally, but nevertheless happened and caused much harm and heartbreak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> We should keep those people in mind as we debate this Bill. We should think, especially, of those who died as a result of medical mistakes. I am sure we can all remember some of them. The recent reports into the baby deaths at the Midland Regional Hospital Portlaoise and Portiuncula Hospital are to the forefront of my mind this evening. The practice of keeping quiet when something goes wrong is prevalent in our medical culture and only a statutory duty of candour will address this. That is why we are bringing forward this legislation. The decision by the Government last year, supported by a Fianna Fáil abstention, to make open disclosures voluntary was a grave mistake. They now know how much of a grave mistake that was.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> Sinn Féin has always opposed making open disclosure a voluntary concept. Along with independent Members and others in the Lower House, we voted to make it mandatory on 8 November 2017 on Report Stage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2017. We were defeated that day, but this Bill seeks to right that wrong. Most recently, the fallout from the CervicalCheck scandal has shown the limitations of a process of voluntary open disclosure. I welcome that the need for mandatory open disclosure with legislative underpinning is now accepted and the passing last month of a Sinn Féin Private Members’ motion in the Dáil calling for mandatory open disclosure. I hope this House will go one better and begin the legislative process to make this a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> For open disclosure to work, it must be mandatory and legally binding. As an example, when we passed the Children First Act 2015, we made it mandatory to report child neglect and abuse. That only came into being on 11 December 2017. We know what is needed. We know to protect our children but now we have to protect our health, and the health of all the people on this island, when mistakes are made. Mandatory disclosure is the only show in town. This Bill addresses the problems surrounding the current system and amends the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 to provide for a mandatory system of open disclosure in our health system. It provides for mandatory open disclosure of a patient safety incident, the introduction of a mandatory requirement that the patient be provided with any and all additional information which later becomes available and, for that purpose, to amend the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> Recent scandals have given the impression that there is endless protection for those at the top while no such protection exists for those at the coalface. The actions or omissions of those at a high level in the Health Service Executive, HSE, or the Department of Health can affect more patients than the actions or omissions of those on the front line. We have open disclosure for those on the ward and in the surgery. Surely, there also needs to be accountability and disclosure among individual executives, hospital CEOs, and members of the HSE and the Department of Health. It is a healthy proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> I reiterate what I say so often in this House and it comes from my experience. Public participation at all levels of healthcare is vital. If we have more public participation in the top tiers and at the top tables of the HSE, strategy and steering groups, accountability will follow. I ask the Minister to consider this seriously as we deal with the fallout from yet another scandal. The Government is resistant to this Bill. There is a suite of excuses for not supporting it. The Minister might attempt to argue that the current legislation does not allow for voluntary disclosure and that the best practice of mandatory disclosure is being followed, but we have evidence from recent scandals that this is far from the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> The Minister may reference the recommendations regarding mandatory reporting arising from the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance or the Madden report. This is good policy, but it does not go far enough because when we talk to the HSE at the various Oireachtas committees, everything has changed. If the Government is wary of voluntary decisions around disclosure, and it is something it denies is happening, then there is no harm in strengthening the legislation to take away the risk. This is about the culture of the HSE, and legislation such as this is the strongest way to change that and provide protection and honesty. The Minister may also reference the recent approval of legislative provisions to provide for mandatory open disclosure through the development of the general scheme of a patient safety Bill. That is with a view to having it brought to the Government for consideration in early July 2018. The Minister stated that it is hoped that it will be possible to commence drafting shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">However, that is too late. It is early July now and we do not have any time to waste. The Minister cannot tell Vicky Phelan to wait and he cannot tell Emma Mhic Mhathúna to wait. They and many others have lost so much.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> The Minister should allow this Bill to proceed to Committee Stage today in order that we can make the changes necessary as soon as possible. It is the right thing to do and I know the Minister knows that too. We cannot suffer in the meantime but many will suffer if the Minister and his Government do not take this opportunity now. I will quote from what the Minister said on this issue in the Dáil last month: “I want to be clear that the Government is committed to progressing, as a matter of urgency, legislation to provide for mandatory open disclosure for patients and mandatory reporting of serious incidents to the relevant regulator”. This has not happened but this Bill will make it happen. It will be a continuation of our journey to honesty and openness. I therefore look forward to this Bill proceeding to Committee Stage with support from all sides of the House.</p>

        <speech by="#RoseConwayWalsh" eId="spk_425">
          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1039">The Civil Liability (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill is necessary legislation. People who have been deeply impacted by the recent scandals, such as with CervicalCheck, are asking for it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> Up to the time that Vicky Phelan and Emma Mhic Mhathúna spoke out to tell their tragic stories, very many people were under the impression that they would be told if something went wrong or mistakes were made in respect of their diagnosis or treatment. The hardworking staff of the HSE also need open disclosure. It is more than unfair that they are held responsible for individual actions and decisions at the coalface, while many of those higher up are protected by a culture of cover-up and defence of the organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> There is protectionism within the system, something I noticed long before I came into politics as it was blatantly obvious that wagons were circled in such circumstances. Whether in the area of physical health or mental health, this culture exists and until we face up to it we will not change it. This legislation is not about seeking to punish workers in the HSE. It is a genuine attempt to change the culture within that organisation. The benefits that come from a culture of open disclosure between health staff and patients are self-evident and have been proven internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> While this Bill seeks to legislate for disclosure at the patient-health worker level, we are clear that this has to extend to the HSE and the Department of Health. If either of these are aware of mistakes, misdiagnoses or any other information that could impact patients, they must make this known. This did not happen in the CervicalCheck scandal. The recent revelation of the deaths of babies at Portiuncula and Portlaoise hospitals and the long, protracted battle by their parents to discover the truth underline the need for this change in culture. Although devastated by the deaths of their children, these parents took on this culture of cover-up because it is vital that bereaved relatives have access to the truth. Anything that we, as legislators, can do to facilitate this should be a no-brainer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> The culture that exists at the moment, where patients effectively have to go to war with the HSE, does nothing to foster a positive relationship between patients and healthcare workers. In the west, we recently learned of up to 50 children who were identified in a HSE review of audiology services as having been misdiagnosed. The families learned of the report's publication through the media and were left waiting until they saw sight of a copy. The children in question were discharged from the HSE audiology service, only later to be diagnosed with severe to profound hearing loss. I know from these parents that there was a complete vacuum in communication where the HSE adopted a "shut down and go away" attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> The valproate scandal, caused by the wrongful prescribing of a drug to pregnant women that has led to over 400 children in this State being born with avoidable disabilities, is another example of why we need mandatory disclosure. The Government’s own legislation introduced voluntary disclosure. The only conclusion that can be reached is that in the months since that legislation was enacted, the voluntary model has not worked. It is not robust enough to force a change in culture that will be to the benefit of workers and users of the HSE. Therefore, the real argument here is not whether patients deserve and require candour. It is whether every patient should have that right enshrined in legislation. I urge all parties and none who agree with this basic right to support our Bill tonight on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> In no way do we claim that this Bill is a panacea for all faults and mistakes within the health system. Unfortunately, these will always occur. However, a health system that strives to recognise mistakes, informs the patient and attempts to mitigate any future repeat needs legislation like the Bill before us. The current system means that one potential mistake can lead to many more occurring with no checks and balances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> The Minister will say that Government legislation is going through and I know that he recognises much of what we have said in our contributions this evening, but we would be failing as an Opposition were we not to table this legislation. We will work with the Minister and, as my colleague, Deputy O'Reilly, has said in the Dáil, we will work with him in whatever way we can. It is not a competition in which one Bill is trying to be better than another. It is about changing the culture in the HSE. It is for this reason we need mandatory reporting. </p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_426">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1047">I welcome a debate on this matter as it is important that there is open disclosure of any adverse events occurring in medical practice, whether in a hospital, in a voluntary hospital or any medical facility. It is important to recognise we have come a long way. The problem is that our judicial system is an adversarial system and that is not helpful or conducive to all information being given at an early date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> We need to change the process for when adverse events occur in the course of medical treatment. We need a totally different system from the adversarial one we have. Last year we paid out over €300 million in claims via the State Claims Agency. If all the claims with that agency were settled in the morning, it would cost the State approximately €2 billion so there must be a better way. As much of the cost of that system is absorbed by solicitors and counsel, we need to look at the system and I welcome the Government's decision to carry out a review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> On open disclosure, not all adverse events have answers which are immediately available when they occur and, while information may be available to medical practitioners, the reasons for how such an event occurred may require further investigation. I am aware of cases where it has been decided to bring in an external person to examine the history of how a patient has been managed but, 18 months later, no agreement has been reached as regards who that person should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">I had one case where the nurses and doctors on the front line wanted someone appointed immediately, and 18 months later the HSE had not taken a decision about who should be appointed. Cases such as this contribute to the worry and concern and, obviously the immediate impression that something is being hidden, but the people who work on the front line are not the people who caused the delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> Where there have been very adverse events where deaths have occurred there have been considerable delays in the holding of inquests. This has also contributed to the concern of the families involved that someone is hiding something. In fact, it is beyond the power of the HSE and beyond the power of the front-line nurses and doctors and support staff to dictate when an inquest should be held. As a result, they are the people who seem to be identified as causing the delay when, in fact, it has to do with the system of holding inquests. For instance, there is no requirement for a coroner to hold an inquest within a particular period of time and this needs to be changed. In cases of infant deaths and maternal deaths I have seen a considerable delay in the holding of inquests. As a result it caused the wrong impression. It is important that the information, as soon as it is known, is made available to the people who suffered as a result of the adverse event. Any delay causes confusion, upset and anxiety, outside of the fact that people are going through a very traumatic period of time anyway. It is important that we make some of the changes in that area. Specific time periods for coroners are not covered by the Bill but it is something that should be looked at. In some areas of the country it is extremely good and efficient and coroners deliver very early, but in other areas it seems to be a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052"> The Minister will outline the Government's position on the Bill. We need to make the change in law. We need to make sure people are satisfied that every relevant piece of information about an adverse outcome is available to them and that nothing is kept from them. This is no criticism of the Minister because it happened before he was in office, but I had one scenario where I spent two and a half years getting an order for discovery against the Department and after getting that discovery I got a letter stating 1,100 hours of staff time had been used in assembling the documents for me to inspect. Of course the next line in that letter from the Department's solicitor was asking whether I would like to settle the case. That was after two and a half years of looking for discovery. It justified my persistence in getting it. I should not have had to do it and no one should have to do it with regard to any adverse event. It was not a medical negligence case but it was a case that involved the Department. We have made a lot of changes in the judicial and legal processes with regard to the disclosure of documents rather than discovery, but we still need to do a lot more with regard to how we can make information available so people do not have to be forced into the court system. It is extremely important that we do this. I welcome the debate and I look forward to listening to the Minister and hearing his response on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">I thank Senator O'Sullivan and the Acting Chairman. I thank the Members of the Seanad for giving me the opportunity to speak this evening. I thank the Sinn Féin Senators for tabling the Bill, which provides me with an opportunity to outline a number of important developments in this area. Let me be very clear at the outset, because I often hear the position of the Government and myself misrepresented in this regard, although not this evening. The Government and I are completely committed to legislating for mandatory open disclosure. We need to legislate for it and I believe there is a consensus in both Houses in this regard. Tomorrow I will go to the Government on this and I will use this opportunity to outline that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> The House is aware that Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which was signed into law by the President last November, provides the legal framework to support voluntary open disclosure. The Act applies to all patient safety incidents, including near misses and no-harm events. It provides the scope to create a safe space for staff to be open and transparent with patients when something has gone wrong, so that they may be given as much information about the incident as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> The Act provides legal protections for the information given following a serious patient safety incident and for any apology. The apology cannot, for example, be interpreted as an admission of liability and neither can it be used against the provider in clinical negligence actions. It is about providing a safe space for someone to say something went wrong, here is what happened and to say he or she is sorry. Neither can the information and apology constitute an admission of liability in fitness to practise proceedings. However, it is important to note that the protections provided in the Act do not provide protection for incompetent, negligent or other unprofessional patient care. This is very important. Patients will, of course, also continue to be able to use their medical records in litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062"> An open and just culture for patient safety balances the need for a mandatory, open and honest reporting environment and quality healthcare with accountability for individuals and organisations. Sinn Féin has brought forward a Private Members' Bill that would amend Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017. The effect, however, of these amending provisions, which aim to introduce mandatory open disclosure, would alter the intent of the Bill and are, in my view, most likely to prove unworkable. In contrast, the forthcoming patient safety Bill, which has been under preparation by my Department for some time, and which I am pleased to inform the Seanad will be considered by the Government tomorrow morning, will deal with these issues in a full and comprehensive manner, including the issue of mandatory open disclosure. I hope that after tomorrow's meeting I will be in a position to send the patient safety Bill, which will legislate for mandatory open disclosure, to the health committee for its immediate consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063"> Notwithstanding my concerns with regard to this particular Private Members' Bill, I recognise the overriding priority of patient safety and quality in the delivery of health services. I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh's bipartisan remarks on the need to work together on this. I have been engaging with Deputy O'Reilly in this regard. I do not think we are divided on the need to legislate for mandatory open disclosure. We might have different views on it but we all share the aim of making sure we get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> The Government always has been and remains fully committed to open disclosure. At a non-political and political level, the Department has a track record in driving openness in order to ensure patient safety. I believe that all staff must be open and honest with patients. There are also the clear current requirements of the medical practitioners' code of conduct, which sets out that all clinicians have a duty to support a culture of candour, and open disclosure is the clear requirement of the HSE open disclosure policy. I do not want to pre-judge the various inquiries going on now or that will go on in the future, but it is interesting to note that although the medical practitioners' code of conduct is already so clear on this we know disclosure did not happen in so many cases. What is written down in black and white for our clinicians to follow clearly was not followed in the overwhelming majority of cases. This should be a cause for concern and shows the need for us to legislate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> Open disclosure should also happen in the right way and in every circumstance in which it applies. Patients simply must be informed. However, this can be a challenge for the medical profession. The Department’s legislative approach in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 is to encourage this cultural change and encourage our clinicians to do the right thing in circumstances where disclosure is required. Through this Act, passed last year, which covers all patient safety incidents including near misses, any fears that doctors may have had with regard to being open and apologising to patients have been taken away. Put very simply, there is no longer room for excuses in this regard. The patient has a right to know and the patient must be told. I am pleased to advise the House that yesterday I signed the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 (Part 4) (Commencement) Order 2018. The Civil Liability (Open Disclosure) (Prescribed statements) Regulations 2018 to accompany the Act have now been finalised. These regulations provide the form of the statement to be given to the patient at the open disclosure meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The regulations set out the information to be included in the statement about the patient safety incident - what happened, how it happened, the consequences for the patient, treatment and clinical care, actions taken by the provider to address knowledge from the incident and any apology made. The role of the statement is to set out the facts of the meeting in writing, to ensure there is clarity on all the information given at the meeting. This is an important point. I met a patient advocate last week, not concerning CervicalCheck but concerning another matter. On paper, they had been openly disclosed to. They certainly did not feel that the process had been in any way adequate, and they certainly felt that the person sitting on the other side of the table did not think so either. Open disclosure, mandatory or otherwise, cannot just be a box-ticking exercise. It is important that it be done in a compassionate, empathetic, truthful, honest and wholesome way. That is the purpose of this statement, as well as what open disclosure is meant to constitute. </p>
          <p eId="para_1067"> In addition, the 2017 Act requires the health service to designate a liaison person. To comply with the Act, the HSE must prepare a statement in writing of the procedure for making an open disclosure of a patient safety incident and the manner in which the restrictions on the use of information provided applies. </p>
          <p eId="para_1068"> The HSE has been asked to build capacity and expertise within the organisation nationally, regionally and locally to be prepared in advance for the requirements of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 and for the forthcoming mandatory open disclosure included within the draft general scheme of the patient safety Bill. I have also committed to an early evaluation of the implementation of these regulations. </p>
          <p eId="para_1069"> During the Dáil and Seanad debates on open disclosure last year I listened to the concerns voiced by many Senators and Deputies around the need for mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents. I committed to examining other legislation to provide for mandatory open disclosure for serious events. Events over the past few months have further reinforced my belief that mandatory open disclosure for certain serious patient safety incidents, including incidents related to screening, is absolutely necessary. At its meeting on 8 May, the Government approved that my Department would undertake the development of a new patient safety Bill. This Bill incorporates the patient safety elements of the health information and patient safety Bill dealing with the external notification of patient safety incidents, clinical audit and extending the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, to the private health service, in addition to making provision for mandatory open disclosure. I will bring the general scheme of this Bill to Cabinet tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070"> Importantly, the patient safety Bill provides for mandatory open disclosure of serious patient safety incidents to the patient concerned, or to their next of kin or guardian where appropriate. The provisions will apply to all health service providers, public and private. That is an important change we are making. The provisions include private healthcare facilities as well as public healthcare facilities. The requirement extends wherever our citizens interact with any element of healthcare. </p>
          <p eId="para_1071"> A patient safety incident is defined as an unintended or unexpected incident of harm that occurred in the provision of a health service. The Bill enables the Minister for Health of the day to prescribe those serious patient safety incidents that are to be subject to mandatory open disclosure. Among others, examples of such incidents include wrong site surgery, patient death or serious disability associated with a medication error, a diagnostic error or a serious error that could emerge in screening programmes. These provisions are in line with the UK duty of candour legislation. I have heard that many people want to know that we have mandatory open disclosure in line with the UK duty of candour legislation, and that will be the case. However, I am pleased that we are not going to stop there. Far be it from me to critique another country's legislation, but from reading quite a bit about this I know that there was a lot of disappointment with that legislation among some patient advocacy groups in the UK. The duty of candour introduced there only applied to organisations and not to individual professionals. I assure Members that after listening carefully to Senators, Deputies and patient advocacy groups, I have taken the decision that not only must the duty of candour provisions apply to the organisation as a corporate entity, they must also apply to the individual person. There has to be collective organisational responsibility, but also individual responsibility and accountability. In the proposed patient safety Bill which I will bring to the Government tomorrow, we will go beyond other jurisdictions like the UK in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_1072"> I would like to acknowledge the work that Sinn Féin Senators have put into the Civil Liability (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2018, which seeks to amend Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 to provide for mandatory open disclosure of a patient safely incident. I have considered these provisions carefully and can appreciate their intentions. I do not believe we differ on the intention. However, in many ways the effect of these amending provisions would be to make the Act unworkable. If applied to every incident regardless of seriousness, even where a near miss or no harm has occurred, this would result in huge operational implications and could serve to suppress the appetite among staff working on the front line for the cultural change that we clearly need to make. </p>
          <p eId="para_1073"> As I outlined earlier, I am convinced that the forthcoming patient safety Bill will deal with these issues fully and comprehensively. I would be delighted to work on this on a cross-party basis in Seanad Éireann and Dail Éireann. I have made that clear in my correspondence with Sinn Féin's health spokesperson in the Dáil. This important new legislation will provide in law for mandatory open disclosure in respect of serious patient safety incidents and will complement the legal protections for clinicians engaging in open disclosure that were introduced through the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017. </p>
          <p eId="para_1074"> The proposed patient safety Bill will empower the Minister of the day to prescribe by regulation those serious patient safety incidents that are to be subject to mandatory open disclosure. The process set out within the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 is relatively onerous, requiring the arranging of meetings between health service staff and patients and the production of written records in the format prescribed by the legislation. This is to be expected when legal protections are being granted around serious patient safety incidents. However, the adoption of such an approach for every error that occurs during the delivery of a health service, as proposed in these amendments, would be entirely unworkable. </p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> I also note the absence of any enforcement provisions in this Bill for cases where there has been a failure to disclose. In contrast, I want to be clear that in the patient safety Bill I will bring to Government we will introduce a strict enforcement mechanism relating to open disclosure. There must be sanction where people refuse to comply with the law of the land where mandatory open disclosure is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> Furthermore the provision in the proposed amendment to include a patient safety incident that has occurred in the previous five years is provided for under section 23(2) of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which states: "Where a patient safety incident occurred, or came to the notice of a health services provider, before the day on which this Part comes into operation, a health services provider may, on or after the coming into operation of this Part, make an open disclosure of that incident in accordance with this Part." I consider the Current Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 to provide adequately for the provision of additional information for the patient or relevant person. </p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> I would also like to underline the wider reform programme being driven by my Department, of which providing for open disclosure is one important element. The National Patient Safety Office, established in my Department in December 2016, is charged with delivering a programme of policy and legislative changes to improve the ability of the health service to anticipate, identify, respond to and manage patient safety issues. Progress to date includes the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which was approved by Government in December 2017 and referred to the Oireachtas. The Joint Committee on Health has now commenced pre-legislative scrutiny of the measure. This is vital legislation that I hope we can work on a cross-party basis to pass. Licensing our healthcare facilities will give the Minister of the day, and, therefore, the State and the citizens, a power that we do not have today. This requirement will also apply to private practice. Where somebody does not comply with the best practice we expect, the Bill also creates the ability to revoke that licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> We have also introduced Part 4 of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which provides the legal framework to support open disclosure: oversight of the publication of monthly patient safety statements by all maternity hospitals and maternity units in the State and hospital patient safety activity reports by public acute hospitals; an annual National Healthcare Quality Reporting System, which published its fourth report today; and progression of the development of a new national patient safety complaints advocacy service, which will commence later this year. This last measure is really important. Senator Devine has mentioned public participation, which is an important point. I am committed to the idea of having advocacy voices and patient voices embedded within our system and I welcome Members' views on that. We will commence that new advocacy service this year. </p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> Further to this, we have seen quality assurance by the national clinical effectiveness committee of 17 clinical guidelines and one audit, including those on sepsis management early warning systems for both adults and children; in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Ireland’s first ever national action plan on antimicrobial resistance, which was approved by Government in July 2017; and the establishment of the annual national patient experience survey that is administered by HIQA on behalf of the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and HIQA. I cannot understand how up until recently we used to survey everybody and hear everybody's views except the patient's. We now publish an annual patient survey, for all to see what the patient experience is in our health service, warts and all. </p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> The establishment of a patient safety surveillance system has also commenced. We have also rolled out a code of conduct for all health service staff, which sets out the principles which all staff are expected to adhere to with regard to patient safety. I also look forward to going to Government shortly, hopefully this month, with the HSE board legislation, which will improve accountability. I can give a commitment that a patient advocate will be on that board to make sure that the patient's voice is embedded from a patient safety perspective. </p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> In addition to this, I want to pick up Senator Burke's point. As a Government, it is important that we look at how to resolve issues regarding clinical medical negligence claims. The current system is far too adversarial. The State Claims Agency, SCA, does its very best to resolve issues in a non-adversarial way, and I welcome that they are attempting to mediate in clinical negligence claims. However, it is important that as a country we examine best practice in other jurisdictions, and consider alternative methods to the courts process for resolving clinical negligence claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082">Last week at Cabinet I received Government approval to establish a new expert group in this regard. This is a joint initiative by the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Minister for Finance and me. The group will be chaired by the eminent High Court judge, Mr. Justice Charles Meenan, who has significant experience in the area of clinical negligence. It will provide an interim report after three months and a final report within six month from its establishment date. </p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> This group will examine how we can deal more sensitively and in a more timely fashion with issues, such as catastrophic birth injuries, certain vaccine damage claims and claims where there is no dispute about liability from the outset, yet the cases seem to trundle on for far too long. The group will also examine whether an alternative dispute resolution mechanism or a no fault system, which we see in other jurisdictions, would be effective. This follows on from a commitment in the programme for Government. </p>
          <p eId="para_1084"> This group will examine tort law as it currently applies to personal injuries arising in the healthcare context and consider options for reform of relevant tort law. It will also examine whether clinical claims management systems are adequate and whether there may be an alternative mechanism by which claims could be managed and determined more efficiently and effectively from the perspective of the person who has made the claim and the culture of patient safety. This is a very important piece of work for patients and the whole health service. It is a really exciting piece of work and if we get this right, we can radically improve the experiences of people who encounter an adversarial system that seems to go on far too long when it comes to the issue of clinical negligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> I appreciate and share the genuine concerns of Seanad colleagues on the lack of provision for mandatory open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017. I believe the approach taken in that Act is correct but I believe there is a need to bring forward further legislation to legislate for mandatory open disclosure in both our public and private health services, to go further than the UK in this regard in terms of ensuring that the individual as well as the organisation is covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> I want to be very clear that any fear that anybody working in our health service may have had with regard to being open and apologising to patients in the past, should be gone now with the passage of the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017. There is no room for any excuses in that regard. We must now build on what we have done. There is clearly a need to do more. I think we all agree on that. The reality is that serious patient safety incidents, including some that we have seen in recent weeks and months, absolutely require mandatory open disclosure. There is the forthcoming patient safety Bill, and I look forward to bringing the general scheme of the patient safety (licensing) Bill to Government in the morning which provides for mandatory open disclosure and importantly the mandatory reporting of these incidents to HIQA or the mental health commission, which ever is appropriate. It is important that the regulator gets automatically notified of these. </p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> I am confident that this patient safety Bill in conjunction with the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is the correct approach. I will be very happy to work on a cross-party basis to seek the speedy passage of the patient safety Bill. I thank the House for the opportunity to outline my position.</p>

          <p eId="para_1092">I will be brief so as to ensure that there is adequate time for Senator Devine to come back in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> I support this Bill. It was unfortunate that when the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 passed through these Houses more recently that the change was made at that time to go from "shall" to "may". I appreciate the Minister's sincerity and I believe he is serious about engaging with and looking at this issue. I also note that a patient safety Bill will come before us. That will be a Government Bill and no doubt it will have the potential to pass out and overtake this Bill. I think we would all be very happy to see that. Having the pressure point of this very useful, practical and reasonable amendment Bill on the books can only add an appropriate impetus to the patient safety Bill to ensure its speedy passage and to ensure it is given the priority that is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> The recent tragic and unacceptable and outrageous situation on cervical cancer, which others have touched on, and screening is just one example of the importance of taking very seriously what we do in terms of ensuring patient safety. There are three strands to the process: the work of prevention; the work of information; and the work of reparation. I appreciate that the civil liability Act was designed to take that work of reparation and place it in a slightly different place to ensure that the important work of information was not compromised in any way. I hope to bring forward legislation later in the year on prevention, looking at the issue of how we issue contracts and the importance of quality in all public procurement contracts on health. </p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> This Bill focuses on that crucial issue of information which states that people "must" be informed of key issues of interest to them. The question of what might be serious or not serious is ambiguous. I think it is appropriate that this Bill is enacted to put pressure on the patient safety Bill. Having worked in a completely separate but parallel area of data protection, namely, data breaches, I was concerned about the large number of exceptions under which Government and public bodies allowed themselves to not have to disclose to people where their personal data had been breached.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> The devil is in the detail in determining what may or may not be considered serious in respect of a data breach and much more vitally in this area in regard to patient health safety. The seriousness cannot be underestimated. The seriousness may not be known because those who are determining whether it is a serious enough breach do not know the circumstances of the individual. They do not know the decisions that a person might be making without information and might make blind decisions in ignorance of an issue that deeply affects him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> This is a very positive Bill. I think we should accept it. I note the concerns raised by Senator Colm Burke that sometimes the process is very long in terms of the full exposure and the full investigation of an issue, but this is provided for by the initial information of the safety concern. There are also proposals that additional information should be given to them, and that may be two or three years later. The fact that all the information is not in place at once does not stop an initial disclosure. That is provided for separately.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> A very constructive use of language is moving from "at any time" - which is quite vague - to "as is reasonably practicable". That recognises that there will be times when one is waiting for information, when reports need to come back when an expert has been brought in, but it still keeps a clock moving to ensure that things are moving towards getting the patient that information and there is a very reasonable test of "as is reasonably practicable" that is running underneath the process. For all of those reasons I strongly support the Bill, which is very constructive. While I welcome everything else the Minister is also doing, we should vote in favour of the Bill today.</p>

          <p eId="para_1100">I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to the House. I am delighted the Minister is going to the Government tomorrow about the Patient Safety (Licensing) Bill which he put on the agenda yesterday. Perhaps the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill 2018 will give an impetus to the patient safety legislation. Before he left, the Minister rounded off a very decent and in-depth proposal for this patient safety legislation by saying, "I am confident that this patient safety Bill in conjunction with the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017 is the correct approach." I agree with him and I think it would be even more correct when this House passes the amendment to it to include mandatory disclosures. We need to be seen to be acting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101"> In fairness the HSE acted quite fast but it took us a long time to get there. We need to be seen to be taking this issue seriously. I commend the Minister on the patient safety legislation, but I believe we now need to insert the word "mandatory" into the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act. We realise that it needs a great deal of work and we are willing to work with both Bills together. </p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> The Minister ended his contribution by saying, "I am confident that this patient safety Bill in conjunction with the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is the correct approach." However, mandatory reporting must be put in the Statute Book tonight.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1168">In page 9, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1169">
            <b>“Recommendations to be based on merit</b>
          </p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1172">“Diversity Principle”—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1173">(a) the objective that membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1174">(b) the objective that the membership of the judiciary should reflect the diversity within the population as a whole.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1175">(3) Recommendations of persons to judicial office shall have regard to the objective that, consistent with the written statement most recently provided under <i>section 53(7) </i>to the Procedures Committee concerning the needs of the users of the courts in that regard, the membership of the judiciary should include persons with a proficiency in the Irish language.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1176">(4) Subject always to the Merit Principle described in <i>subsection (1)</i>, a list of persons recommended for appointment to judicial office under this Act shall include at least one person whose appointment would further the objectives of the Diversity Principle described in <i>subsection (2)</i>.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">The amendment is pretty self-explanatory. It touches on a lot of the issues we have spoken about at great length up until this point on diversity and respect for merit, ability and capability. The amendment strikes a happy balance between both given the concerns expressed previously. It seeks to introduce greater diversity to the Judiciary. It would not only benefit the Judiciary but also the people who find themselves before the Judiciary. On previous Stages in the other House, my colleagues in Fianna Fáil did not oppose this amendment. It goes some way to tidying up the Bill. It is also a good way to build a bridge between the concerns expressed by both views on the issue of merit, experience, diversity and trying to be inclusive. One of the great aspects of the amendment, and something which has not been reflected in the debate up until this point, is the requirement of knowledge of an Gaeilge within the Judiciary. It is constitutionally, politically and societally important that we acknowledge it and include it in the Bill. Sin mo mhéid. </p>

          <p eId="para_1178">My amendments are in this grouping. I support Senator Ó Donnghaile's amendment. I will speak to amendment No. 11 first. I welcome much of section 7, particularly that judicial appointments are to be made based on merit and that gender equality will be a key objective. However, feasibility and practicality should not be a consideration when setting out aims, especially in terms of diversity. That is what the amendment intends to change. The gender equality objective does not have a provision attached to it that it be feasible but the diversity objective does. It is a key strength of the Bill. At this early stage, when the general principles and objectives of the process are being set out, why should such an important aim be given such a huge qualification and watered down so much? As neither the aim that judicial appointments are to be made on merit nor the objective of gender equality is given a massive qualification, why should we attach one for diversity? We recognise that the objectives are possible and we should be striving for them. The Bill should reflect this. The phrasing comes up twice more in the Bill in section 12 in respect of laypersons and section 53 in respect of judicial appointments and in those instances does not have this massive qualification attached which weakens it so much. The purpose of the amendment is to align with its usage elsewhere in the Bill and to be uniform and consistent. I hope the Minister can accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179"> Amendments Nos. 81 and 83, which are also in this grouping, propose to remove character, temperament and health as grounds that have to be satisfied before the commission can recommend a name to the Minister. These grounds are important for new judges but I am concerned by the meaning of their inclusion here and how they will fit into the process. Could a health ground be invoked against a candidate simple because he or she is older or has a visible or invisible disability? Could character or temperament become problematic in the context of someone who has minor mental health issues or any mental health issue? How do we inquire about someone's temperament and character? Earlier in the debate Senator McDowell spoke about asking questions about socioeconomic background or other qualifying factors but how does one assess someone's character and temperament in an interview? Will it be based on previous court hearings or how one is as a solicitor? How exactly is that determined? Apart from temperament and character, I do not understand why health would be included as a ground. It should be taken out as it could be used in a discriminatory manner. I would like these grounds to be removed from the Bill and the Minister to come back on Report Stage with grounds that better reference the sort of attributes we are referring to here and which would be grounded in accountability and verifiable factors rather than broad, vague terms as it is drafted at present. Competences and ability better reflect what we are looking for rather than temperament and health. </p>

          <p eId="para_1180">I will indicate very briefly where I stand on these amendments. On amendment No. 8, I prefer the present wording of section 7 to the proposed wording of the new section. I do not believe that the juxtaposing of the merit principle and the diversity principle will assist at all. It would create confusion. Senator Ó Donnghaile's proposed section 7(1) would seriously dilute the idea of being selected on merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">It would be of sufficient merit to discharge with distinction the responsibilities of the office to which the person is appointed. It does not suggest the best person will get the job. There is a kind of a threshold of merit, after which it becomes a diversity principle, so I am not in favour of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182"> I have decided amendment No. 9, which is related to amendment No. 12, should not be moved. I will adhere to amendment No. 10 to remove the word "based" and put in "solely". I do not agree with amendment No. 11, which is Senator Ruane's amendment. The qualification is necessary in all the circumstances.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">Amendment No. 8, in the name of Senator Ó Donnghaile, proposes to insert a new section in place of the current section 7. The Senator will be aware it is similar to an amendment discussed at some length already at the Dáil committee which was ultimately withdrawn by the Senator's colleague. It was well flagged in the Dáil that the matter would be submitted in an updated form to take account of the newer element in the section relating to proficiency in the Irish language, which was added on Committee Stage. I refer here to the committee amendment that introduced the objective of Irish language proficiency. I am not amenable to accepting this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184"> Subsection (1) of the proposed replacement section 7 states that, "No person shall be recommended, under this Act, for appointment to judicial office unless they are of sufficient merit to discharge with distinction the responsibilities of the office to which they are appointed (the 'Merit Principle')". Subsection (2) of the proposed new section has the effect of benchmarking that merit-based recommendation against the objectives of an equality of men and women in the membership of the Judiciary, and diversity among the membership of the Judiciary. These objectives are denoted by reference to the diversity principle. Subsection (3) stipulates that a list of persons recommended for appointment to office must include at least one person whose appointment would further the objectives of the diversity principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185"> I am a bit concerned the Bill would mandate the hand of the commission to select in such a direct and specific mode. In fact, I am more than concerned. My concern is such that I am against it. Senators will know there are a number of elements to how the Bill addresses the issue of gender equality and the broader issue of population diversity. Under section 7 itself, subject to decisions being based on merit, the concerns around gender balance and diversity in the membership of the Judiciary are very clearly brought to the forefront by way of the requirement that they must be regarded where the function of selecting and recommending persons for appointment to office falls to be performed. The word "must" is important here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186"> Gender equality and diversity feature elsewhere throughout the Bill. Section 12(4), which was also amended on Committee Stage, mirrors the section 7 provision which requires PAS to apply gender equality and population diversity objectives when selecting lay persons, that is, non-legal persons, for appointment to the commission. Section 12(6) provides that one area where knowledge and experience is to be to the fore in the selection of lay members is with respect to human rights, equality or issues concerning diversity among members of society. The Bill signals the critical importance of taking account of that perspective in appointing lay members to the commission. Section 53(5) requires that, in the preparation of the statements of selection procedures, regard will be had for, among other things, the two objectives of gender equality and population diversity. Therefore, there is a direct correlation between the objectives set out in section 7 and the requirement of the commission to cater for this in its published statements. Under the review process provided for under section 56, the procedures committee, which was mentioned earlier, must monitor "the diversity among candidates for judicial appointment", on review of the implementation of the Act. The committee must report its finding to the commission, and any recommendations it may have in this particular area. The commission will in turn report to the Minister in this matter. In the context of the review, it probably will be a role and function for the appropriate parliamentary committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187"> I am satisfied the Bill already addresses what the Senator intends to achieve by his amendment. I am not inclined to support the amendment.</p>

In amendment No. 11, Senator Ruane wishes to remove the term "to the extent feasible and practicable" from section 7(2)(b). We discussed these issues under amendment No. 3 earlier. Section 7, on making the recommendation on merit, states that regard shall be had to the objective that the membership of the Judiciary should, to the extent feasible and practicable, reflect the diversity within the population as a whole. I am not sure the specific term takes away anything from the objective of what the commission must have regard to.

          <p eId="para_1206">Perhaps a little unusually, I am not greatly distressed by the Government's phraseology in this section as it seems to be perfectly reasonable. There are four cardinal points, with the first being that appointments should be made on merit. The next objective would be that there would be an equality of men and women. The third point is that diversity should be reflected and the final very important issue is that some members of the Judiciary should have a competence in the Irish language. I think about the trial that Mr. James Joyce wrote about of Mr. Michael Joyce on the Aran Islands where there was a grotesque miscarriage of justice because the unfortunate islander could not understand English. He was not properly represented and it was an appalling case. I doubt anything like that could occur-----</p>

I was thinking of context and it is the most extreme example I can think of where injustice was created because somebody could not have their case heard in the Irish language. If we want to encourage the Irish language, it is important to pay due respect to it. I am not saying all judges must speak Irish, as that would go a bit far. It is right that members of the Judiciary should include persons with a proficiency in the Irish language. The four grounds are perfectly reasonable and I am satisfied with them. I have not been persuaded by the arguments of my colleagues.</p>

          <p eId="para_1209">I will speak briefly to amendments Nos. 82 and 83. There may be a drafting error in one of the amendments. I do not know if it came from my office or if it happened along the way. My key concern was the issue of health, as it is inappropriate that there be health tests for those being considered for the Judiciary. It is something not done in many other areas and the danger is this could potentially be deeply prejudicial, for example, to those who may have a disability or an ongoing illness. People would not necessarily be coming into a role where physical health will be tested. We certainly do not want a position where the comparative health of candidates would be a key or adjudicating factor in consideration for an appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210"> Amendments Nos. 82 and 83 are complementary and I now see they were separated by the Bills Office. Amendment No. 83 deals with the deletion of the requirement to effectively prove a bill of health. It is not appropriate that candidates for office should, for example, have to produce medical certificates or other information. As we have discussed, this is a special category of information and falls under the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, as such. The information should only be sought in very specific circumstances where there is real public interest and other concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211"> As a potential alternative, in amendment No. 82 we have suggested the addition of the phrase "and capacity". The original intention in the drafting of the Bill was to get at the question of capacity and whether the person would be present for meetings, be in courts and deliver on requirements. Past proven competence is importance but current capacity is also important. I suggest that capacity may be a better way to get at whatever the original intent was with "in respect of the health" of candidates. However, I would also be happy to decide to delete the text and leave it as is in terms of character and temperament. I feel very strongly about amendment No. 83 and it is very important. It is extremely inappropriate for us to set such health criteria. The Minister understands the sensitivity around such information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212"> I know my colleague, Senator Dolan, is not able to be here but he also feels strongly about the health issue and that it should not become a <i>de facto </i>disadvantage if somebody has chronic or ongoing health concerns that are managed. Perhaps they are managed well enough to deliver on their role. Amendment No. 83 is a priority for me and it is very important. Amendment No. 82 is perhaps a suggestion that the Government may choose to accept to get what was hoped for in the original line on health.</p>

My amendment would make that a firm principal subject with respect to merit. It enhances the Bill and strengthens the commitment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1214">I will come back to the term "feasible and practicable". Section 7(2)(a) states, "the objective that the membership of the judiciary should comprise equal numbers of men and women,". When we set out an objective, it is what we aim for. It is a vision or a mission. It is not that it must happen. When it comes to the mix of men and women, there is an indication of an objective but we do not include the term "feasible and practicable". Neither is it done in section 7(2)(c), which states, "the objective that, consistent with the written statement most recently provided under section 53(7) to the Procedures Committee concerning the needs of the users of the courts in that regard, the membership of the judiciary should include persons with a proficiency in the Irish language." It does not have a clause to dilute the meaning. Three of those paragraphs outline objectives and what we would like to aim for. The only paragraph with a diluting clause is the one concerning diversity. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has spoken about increasing diversity with the Bill but this is the only element being watered down. How can it be justified that the others are not diluted but this one is?</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">Why is the language in paragraph (b) different from that in paragraphs (a) and (c)? It does not really make sense.</p>

          <p eId="para_1216">The Bill does not provide that somebody should be disbarred because of health reasons. It merely mentions health as a factor to be taken into account. I remember during the Sallins mail train case, the counsel for the defendants alleged that the judge was asleep but it turned out that he was dead. That was a pretty good example.</p>
          <p eId="para_1217"> I think Senator Ruane has made a very good argument in favour of deleting the word "feasible" from section 7(2)(b). If it is not included in the other paragraphs, why should it be included in this one? I will support her amendment on the basis of her very good argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218"> I am rather sorry that Senator McDowell intends to withdraw amendment No. 12. As I read it, the amendment would completely subvert the lay composition of the commission. The amendment proposes to prohibit lay members of the commission from taking part in any assessment of an applicant’s "knowledge of the law, skills and competence in the interpretation and application of the law, or ability to exercise functions as holders of judicial office". I think it is a great amendment because if it were accepted, there would be nothing left for the lay members to do. I would certainly push it, but of course I am not Senator McDowell and I am not privy to his reasons for withdrawing it. </p>

          <p eId="para_1225">I should mention to Senator Norris, to satisfy his curiosity, that I believe all members of the commission should be equal in the discharge of their functions. On reflection, I do not think it is really a good idea to disable some of them from making particular decisions on the basis of their status as laypersons. During our consideration of these amendments, we have yet to come to the question of whether those laypersons should be in a majority or a minority on the commission. I expressed doubts earlier about the kind of person who would want to be on this commission in general. If the amendment in question were agreed, I think the lay members would be on the commission in a token role. Having reflected on the matter and having spoken to Senator Boyhan about it, I do not think it is a good idea to have a two-tier membership. That is why I intend to withdraw the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1226">Before I speak about amendments Nos. 81 to 83, inclusive, I would like to respond to the point made by Senator Ruane about the inclusion in section 7(2) of this Bill of the words "to the extent feasible and practicable". There is no ulterior motive here. This clause has been inserted in section 7(2) as a safeguard to cover circumstances in which the commission might be prevented from taking a certain course of action by a perception of rigidity in some absolute or absurd obligation to have regard to diversity. I am talking about unusual circumstances, clearly not intended by the Bill, in which a right or entitlement on the part of a disaffected candidate might be created by relying on a diversity ground where there would not be a real claim. The words "feasible and practicable" have not been inserted to provide an out, or to reduce what will be an obligation in the same manner and means as the gender obligation and the other obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227"> I mentioned earlier that 16 judicial appointments have been made so far this year. I should mention in the context of our discussion about gender balance that nine of them were men and seven of them were women. I assure the House that this is a most important consideration in the context of the Government's obligations in respect of appointments. I do not recall circumstances - over recent years or indeed ever - in which this principle has been applied in the manner in which it is being applied now, where we almost have a 50:50 split. I intend to ensure the existing gap is closed and we reach 50:50. It is absolutely essential for the fact that most entrants to both branches of the profession are now women to be reflected in the appointments to the Judiciary and in the membership of the Law Society and the Bar. The appointments we have seen in recent times are very reflective of that. This pattern will continue to ensure we reach equality at a very early stage. I can say to Senator Ruane that the words "feasible and practicable" have been inserted to cover circumstances in which there might be an over-reliance on what could be regarded as rigid wording or a rigid obligation. It is by no means the case that they will restrict or weaken this obligation in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228"> In amendment No. 81, Senator Ruane is seeking to delete section 36(1)(b), which proposes that one of the conditions to be satisfied when a person is being recommended should be that the person in question is "is suitable on grounds of character and temperament". Amendment No. 82 seeks to amend section 36 of the Bill, the overall purpose of which is to set down some matters concerning a candidate to which the commission must have regard before it chooses to recommend that person for appointment to office. These matters relate in general to the characteristics and suitability of the person concerned. One of these matters, as set out in section 36(1)(b), is the stipulation that the person must be "suitable on grounds of character and temperament". Amendment No. 81 would delete section 36(1)(b), whereas amendment No. 82 seeks to replace it with a new subsection, which refers to being "suitable on grounds of character, temperament and capacity". Amendment No. 83 seeks to delete the next suitability ground in section 36(1)(c), which is that the person being recommended must be "suitable on grounds of health".</p>
          <p eId="para_1229"> The reference to suitability on grounds of character and temperament is a time-honoured formula and is not new. It was originally contained in the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, under which the present board of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was established. The purpose of section 36 of the Bill is to ensure the commission has regard to the suitability of a person in terms of his or her general disposition. I do not disagree with what Senator McDowell said when he referred to this earlier. It is a question of assessing whether a candidate for recommendation has a character and temperament, including personal traits and behaviours, that is suitable when considered in the context of what is often required of judges in the pressure-cooker of a court. Judges must handle in appropriate ways the situations in which people find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">Judges must ensure that they have a level of temperament and disposition that allows them to serve the best interests of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231"> The suitability requirement reflects the fact that the administration of justice is not only about the law but about the many different types of people involved. Sometimes, as we all know, these are the most vulnerable people. Again, this is something I am really keen to ensure is encouraged and acknowledged in the administration of justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232"> Earlier I mentioned the courthouse estate plan. It seeks to ensure that the surrounds of the court are particularly appropriate and suitable for vulnerable witnesses, vulnerable complainants and for children. Life-changing decisions are made on a daily basis in our courts. People often only attend court on very few occasions in the course of their lives and often times, that one occasion can be life-changing, in terms of experience. The administration of justice is not about lawyers and judges; it is about the people who are served. I believe there is a common understanding and appreciation of what is meant when we refer to the suitability of a person's character or temperament with regard to a particular role or job. As I see no basis for dropping this long-standing, accepted and, dare I say, minimalist conditionality, I am not agreeing with amendment No. 81. </p>
          <p eId="para_1233"> In addition, to add the notion of capacity into this mix has the potential to confuse matters in an unintended way. The issue of capacity could relate to a person's intellectual capacity or skills capacity in respect of his or her understanding of the law or a capacity to handle the difficult and demanding situations that occur on a daily basis in courts and courtrooms. On the other hand, it could also refer to a mental or decision-making capacity, which is about something completely different. It may be seen as asking the commission to assess whether a person's mental capacity might be in some way impaired. In fact, as Members will know, Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution, which is the article that governs the circumstances under which a judge may be removed from office following resolutions of the Houses, refers to one of the grounds for such removal as "incapacity". The question of the capacity of a judge, in terms of his or her mental or decision-making capacity, is comprehended among other aspects of health but within the concept of his or her suitability on grounds of health, as provided for in section 36(1)(c) of the Bill. I am not inclined to add the concept of capacity, as proposed in amendment No. 82. I think it will be less than certain and if it is less than certain, it will be open to confusion. We do not want confusion, having regard to the original purpose of character and temperament. If we confuse the original purpose by an add-on then I think we would make things really difficult for the new commission. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_1234"> As for the health question posed by Senator Higgins, in 1983 the condition of suitability on grounds of health arose to some degree out of the experience of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board over the years. I draw on Senator McDowell's experience in this regard, which is greater than mine in terms of dealing with the appointments board. It is fair to say that from time to time, the board has made the point that one of the conditions in the area of judicial appointment should be the health of the candidate and the suitability of the person for the job, as it were, having regard to the issue of health. I listened closely to the submission made by Senator Higgins but this provision is certainly not designed with any intention of being exclusive. It is not intended to introduce new obstacles or barriers or, indeed, in any way militate against an otherwise suitable candidate. In that regard it is not an unusual requirement to have regard to, in the context of any interview for any position. I think it is a standard enough guide and I am not minded to support the deletion of this matter from the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1235"> I revert to the original point on diversity. The Minister used the word "obligation". I do not think that objectives are obligations. Objectives set out what we would like to achieve in the best-case scenario of us fully executing and implementing this Bill in the way it is supposed to be, which is to increase diversity. I do not see how the suggestion that the provision would be rigid or would involve an over-reliance can only be in respect of diversity. Let us consider the Irish language. It would be a little easier to increase the diversity of candidates than have an over-reliance on judges or laypersons with the Irish language. The answer the Minister gave me was insufficient. If this was a single objective then I would say, "Yes, fair enough". If the other two objectives also included that clause, then the provision would make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236"> I am dissatisfied with the answer given by the Minister with regard to the health ground. It is completely inappropriate to include health in the provision. The term "health" is an extremely holistic word. The provision does not only require people to be in good health. When people consider a person's health, they assess whether the candidate has a disability. For example, a person may have lost his or her hearing or be partially deaf and need to use sign language or he or she may have issues with his or her sight. Another example is a person who may be in remission from cancer. So many different grounds fall under the banner of health. We have no idea how that ground will be used in terms of a person having to be in good health. How does one determine health? How does one assess a person's health? What deems a person to be in good health? What qualifies a person as being healthy enough to be appointed a judge? </p>
          <p eId="para_1237"> In all the years I have worked in the addiction sector, I have never been asked about my health or been asked to undertake a health assessment or needs assessment. Even if health has always been a ground that does not mean it should remain so. Things evolve because as time passes one can realise that things are inappropriate. Plenty of people have an ailment that the rest of us would deem to be a health issue but that does not mean that the ailment affects his or her capacity or ability to do a job. We cannot have somebody with a physical disability or whatever participating in an interview - and perhaps he or she uses a wheelchair - yet stipulate a ground in legislation that the person will be judged against what the appointing body determines to be an able-bodied and healthy person. Such a provision is inappropriate and, therefore, should be removed. </p>

          <p eId="para_1238">To be clear, it is not only inappropriate, it may be illegal. Whenever the grounds of health may have been used or introduced in the past has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239"> Recently the general data protection regulation came into effect. Under those regulations, the legislation for which we passed in this House, there are much stricter tests that need to be established in any situation in which persons are required to share their information, including health information. There is a test around necessity and proportionality. If that test were to be used, then we would have to be very clear on what was the basis. We would need to establish a legislative basis or another clear basis for asking persons to share their health information.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">That could be done under section 38 of the Data Protection Bill with the Minister putting forward that there is a public interest need to know about the health of candidates - that would be to satisfy both Houses - or under the Data Sharing and Governance Bill going through the Houses now. That Bill, however, explicitly excludes special categories of personal information so data cannot be shared. If the Minister really is keen, and it has been determined that health will be dealt with and will be part of this process, there is much work to be done on how that can be achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241"> We talked about prejudice and unconscious bias was the subject of lengthy discussion yesterday. There is such a thing as unconscious bias and people deciding whether a person is healthy - for example, a person who may be in remission from cancer. Someone on a panel might decide that person should not become a judge on the grounds of health because he or she should focus on his or her recovery. That decision is made for that candidate because there is no guarantee in respect of that person's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242"> The Minister mentioned the potential ambiguity in respect of capacity. All of the possible interpretations of capacity he mentioned, however, seemed useful. Capacity in handling the challenges and requirements of a role in robust environments was mentioned. The Minister also mentioned, however, that there is a clear precedent regarding incapacity in respect of judges. If we have a clear and functioning definition of incapacity regarding judges - that already functions in respect of removing people from the role - it is not such a stretch to introduce an idea of capacity. If the Minister were amenable and if he would prefer it, we could amend the Bill to leave temperament and character on its own, standing with the history ascribed to it as the Minister has set out, and put in something addressing the key issue of incapacity. Incapacity has precedent in other areas of the law, as the Minister described. It is already in case law and there is some precedent in how it is interpreted in respect of judges. We could refer to where there is not an incapacity. If the Minister was more comfortable with that, we should do it. Incapacity is, appropriately, a higher bar for somebody to be potentially excluded from a role, rather than simply the grounds of health with its wide open interpretation. Incapacity has some level of precedent we can look to and it is a more reasonable approach overall. Any concerns that the previous judicial appointments commission may have raised could be addressed by a clause on incapacity. It might also involve health issues but it would meet the test, in respect of GDPR, on necessity and proportionality while the wide open grounds of health does not.</p>

          <p eId="para_1245">It is all rolling into one. It is a very demanding job and if a person's health is not up to it, he or she should not apply for it. If a person applies for it while suffering ill health, the job should not be given to that person, whether it is a man or a woman. That is a sad fact perhaps for Senator Higgins to take on board but it is serious in the great majority of important constitutional positions. It is about making serious decisions about other people's lives, on child custody, imprisonment and the custody of people's homes, etc. These are life changing decisions. It is a very demanding job. If person goes into such a job with a weak heart, such that he or she is unlikely to be able to manage day long sessions and late night sittings on certain occasions, then he or she should really not be appointed, regardless of whether he or she should apply in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246"> The equality principle can be applied all we like but some people are born with weak hearts and they are unlikely to be able to do the work. The simple fact is that making these appointments is a bit like appointing someone to be a local garda sergeant. The person's health has to be sufficient to be able to do the job. There is no point in codding ourselves or saying we are so much in favour of equality in this House that health does not matter. Health does matter. One of the greatest injustices is when litigants come before judges whose health is failing. Can they deliver reserve judgments? Can they sit long enough? Senator Higgins may say that this is a matter of capacity. It is not. Health is the issue. A person has to be reasonably healthy to be able to be a judge. It is a common-sense principle. </p>
          <p eId="para_1247"> What does that mean in practice? When I was the Minister for Justice, there were two appointments. One was of a man with multiple sclerosis, MS. He functioned perfectly well and it was abundantly clear that it would not interfere with his capacity to discharge his functions. Another was an individual who had a congenital mobility problem and is an excellent judge. There were, however, people appointed in failing health and it caused much difficulty. They got the job, the President of the court asked them to sit and they were not able to. They were not able to sustain cases because they fell ill after three or four days and that is a serious issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1249">We can talk all we like about the theory of equality. I am talking about the practice and the consequences of appointing somebody in poor health to a position. Senator Ruane talked about the capacity to operate through sign language. I do not think that a person who had to operate through sign language could function as a judge. It is the same as he or she not being able to function as an airline pilot, in all probability. It is just a fact. Let us not get carried away by extreme ideological views of where equality will bring us in this regard. Senator Dolan made the point - and I agree with him - that health should be interpreted as meaning not that a person is able to run a mile or whatever. Health has to be given a reasonable meaning in this context and therefore the phrase "is suitable on grounds of health" seems reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250"> We also had reference to the GDPR and the sharing of data legislation. I do not for a second believe that prohibits somebody making an appointment from inquiring about whether a candidate to be appointed to the job is suitable on health grounds. There is this kind of new magic aura surrounding GDPR, sensitive data, etc. It is being exaggerated way out of proportion. A person applying for almost any job in the country will be looked at on health grounds to see if they are up to it. That is in the private sector and in the public sector. A person cannot get into the Defence Forces and then suddenly say that he or she is relying on his or her GDPR rights and not doing a fitness test.</p>

          <p eId="para_1252">We are getting carried away with unrealistic things. I believe strongly that it is reasonable to ask a person seeking appointment to a permanent job, lasting for the rest of his or her life, to demonstrate that he or she is suitable on health grounds to be given that job.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">It is not the case that the person must be in the peak of health or enjoy brilliant health or that he or she does not suffer from diminished sight or something like that, but it does mean that some people who are intellectually capable of being a judge are unsuitable on health grounds to be appointed. I make this point precisely to deal with Senator Ruane's point. If one were relying on using sign language only to communicate, and I have full sympathy for people who are in that position, it would be a big mistake to appoint the person a judge. The process of interacting with counsel, lay people and all the rest would be immensely complicated if one were in that category. Let us not be unrealistic about this. Let us not suggest it would be illegal under the general data protection regulation, GDPR, to ask somebody to prove that he or she is suitable on health grounds to be appointed to a job which requires one to be in a reasonably healthy state before one carries it out. Let us not put ourselves in the position. The person with multiple sclerosis, MS, whom I spoke about, is one thing, but if one were suffering from motor neurone disease on the day one applied for the position of judge, surely the commission is entitled to ask the person about that because they know that within a relatively short period, as science stands, that person will be able to occupy the position only for a short period and that his or her capacity to discharge it will deteriorate over time. I ask people to be realistic and I think the present phraseology of the Bill is fine.</p>

          <p eId="para_1254">We heard the word "reasonable" many times. I am not saying that it is automatically illegal. My point is that it has to meet a test of being necessary and proportionate. All of the circumstances which were described as a concern were questions of capacity, but the key question is a person's capacity to do the job. One needs to pass a physical examination if one is to become a garda because one is required to do physical work and one has to demonstrate the capacity to deliver. There is nothing wrong with having people demonstrate their capacity to do the job, but I think Senator McDowell made the case for why we might need to have a clearer bar because he set out what he thought may or may not be a bar to appointment. It is okay if a person has MS, but it is not okay if one has motor neurone disease. It is not okay if one needs to use Irish Sign Language, even though we have passed the Irish Sign Language Act 2017. Sign language is officially recognised as a language that people can use in engaging with the State. I am advocating for a clear test about capacity instead of leaving it wide open and entirely down to the subjective experience. People may know about certain conditions and have baggage around different disabilities. When we speak of Irish Sign Language we are now into the area of disability. We are talking about persons who have a disability and suggesting that perhaps it would not be reasonable to appoint them to a role in the Judiciary. People may have an unconscious bias. The point I am making is that we must ensure that it relates to capacity to do the job and not to a person's feelings on an array of conditions and disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255"> I think that is a reasonable proposal. I recognised there was a concern to be addressed, and that is the reason I put forward capacity. I have indicated that I am happy to look at another substitute which may do the same work. I recognise that an appointment should not be made where there is a concern that somebody may not be able to do late night sittings for whatever reasons or may not be able to manage a busy courtroom, but I think the question is whether he or she can do the job, not who they are.</p>

          <p eId="para_1257">I invited Senator McDowell to make a contribution, having regard to his knowledge and experience. I am pleased I did because I think he has made a reasonable contribution. As far as the health ground is concerned, I would have thought it was not unreasonable in most job applications to have regard to the health of the applicant. For example, if somebody's tasks included the driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle or a heavy goods vehicle for and on behalf of a transit company, I would have thought that these are questions that would be asked in the normal course. I now learn, however, that in circumstances these questions may be out of bounds. I am somewhat surprised at that, especially as a reading of the section leads me to believe that it may well be a straightforward requirement or a simple requirement for a candidate to self-declare that he or she is in good health and note is taken of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258"> If this is an issue that is causing some distress to Senator Higgins, let me point out that in respect of section 53 on the preparation of statements, the statement setting out the requisite skills and attributes could well refer to the health issue at that stage to ensure that it was not going to be an issue that would ultimately result in an unfairness of a type that is giving rise to anxiety for Senator Higgins. I agree with Senator McDowell. I do not see it as an unreasonable requirement that in the circumstances that might be no more than a mere reference to health suitability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259"> We can continue on all night on this issue but I say in response to Senator Ruane's point on the comparison of the three different areas and objectives that while she says there is a different standard in terms of diversity, I would say it is more challenging to reflect the diverse composition of society than to achieve gender balance among the Judiciary. It is not a straightforward requirement and it is one that will give rise to a challenge. That is why I do not think it is unreasonable to qualify it by putting in the words, "feasible" and "practical". I am not sure it dilutes the objective but it does ensure there is not an unfair rigidity that might cause more difficulties than were intended.</p>

          <p eId="para_1278">I move amendment No. 13:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1279">In page 10, lines 20 to 31, to delete all words from and including “(1) The Commission” in line 20 down to and including line 31, and in page 11, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following:</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1292">(2) The Commission shall elect its own chairperson.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">The amendment proposes to simplify the membership of the commission. Currently, section 10 provides for 13 members, but then goes on to list 17 individuals who will comprise the commission. Our proposal is that five members of the Judiciary would be on the commission of 11 members, including the presidents of each court. The lay people will bring a very different perspective to the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294"> The Government proposes a competition run by the PAS, but this will be a complicated process and a much better way to find suitable lay people would be to have them nominated by organisations and entities that are well respected. This amendment proposes that laypersons be nominated by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Free Legal Advice Centres Limited, the Citizens Information Board and an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295"> It also proposes that representatives of both legal professions be included. Many people may make applications that look great on paper. Some will have impressive CVs and will do a great interview, but the commission needs to have the knowledge of the applicants' experience as barristers or solicitors over a period of 15 or 20 years. One will know much more about a person and whether he or she would make a good judge from knowing how he or she has been as a practising solicitor or barrister. The amendment also allows the commission to select its own chairperson.</p>

It is perfectly reasonable that the chairperson be the Chief Justice, the most eminent jurist in the land, somebody with a lot of experience and understanding of the situation. Earlier in the debate reference was made to taxi drivers. I cannot imagine taxi drivers having somebody who was not a taxi driver in charge of their organisation. It simply would not happen.

          <p eId="para_1335">The substantive amendment I have in this grouping is amendment No. 14 which is similar to that of Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee, amendment No. 13, in that it seeks to address the question of the composition of the judicial appointments commission. Our amendment is slightly different from the Senator's. Like hers, it has the advantage of being coherent in terms of numbers, unlike the current provision we are debating, section 10, which has come to us from the Dáil in an incoherent manner, with inconsistency in terms of numbers, which is unfortunate. Many of the amendments in this grouping, or at least some of the Government ones, are seeking to address it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336"> Our amendment is coherent. It provides that the commission would consist of 12 members, being the Chief Justice, who would be the chairperson of the commission, a number of other judges and seven non-judicial members. It sets out who would nominate each of them. It also takes into account the need for a gender balance. According to subsection (2), each body that makes nominations shall nominate both a man and a woman for appointment by the Government. Subsection (3) states, "In appointing members of the Commission, the Government shall have regard to the objective that no fewer than 5 members should be women and no fewer than 5 members should be men". We have tried to put forward a coherent and clear outline of the preferable composition of a judicial appointments commission and also sought in our provision to have regard to the need for a gender balance on the commission. We will certainly be pressing the amendment. I do not expect the Minister to indicate that he will be accepting it. It may well be that the amendment in the name of Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee will be pressed before ours. It is very much in a similar tone. To be fair, our amendment also draws on the provisions put forward in the other House by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan who proposed a similar composition for the commission. We supported it, in principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337"> The other amendments we have in this grouping are amendments Nos. 58, 60, 62 and 64 which are more procedural in nature. Amendment No. 14, however, is very much substantive and goes to the heart of the debate we have been having on the Bill and the issues we have been discussing about how best to ensure positive reform of the judicial appointments system that will result in a system that is effective in delivering a robust and independent Judiciary.</p>

A person from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission was a positive and constructive addition to the mix.

          <p eId="para_1346">I wish, in the first instance, to respond to Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee. I acknowledge that amendments Nos. 15, 21, 25, 27, 28, 53, 57, 59, 61 and 63 are in my name. I will be moving amendment No. 15. Before I do so, I want to make a point on amendment No. 13, as proposed by Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee. It is, of course, entirely consistent with the approach taken by the Senator's colleagues in the Dáil. The amendment provides for a commission of 11 members. This equates to numbers currently on the Judicial Appointments Board. The breakdown in the amendment is five judicial members, including the Chief Justice and the four Presidents, two legal persons, being nominees of the Bar Council of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland, and four laypersons, each nominated by a different named body. The commission would elect its own chairperson. There are good elements to the amendment. Not wishing in any way to surprise the Senator, I remind her that the amendment is completely at odds with the Government's approach which reflects Government policy in the most fundamental respect. The most positive element of the amendment is that it would secure the membership of all court Presidents, including the Chief Justice who is the favoured person of Senator David Norris.</p>

          <p eId="para_1348">Senators will be aware that an amendment of mine on Report Stage in the Dáil achieved that objective. The Bill, as passed in the Dáil, provides for membership of the commission by these five senior judges. That is important. The Bill also includes an Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission nominee. An amendment in that regard was inserted on Committee Stage in the Dáil. There are some similarities with what is already included in the Bill. The differences are those that make it impossible for me to agree with the Senator's amendment. Amendment No. 13 does not provide for a lay majority. In terms of composition, it does not amount to much in terms of reform of the current position. The current Judicial Appointments Board comprises five judicial members, two legal professional nominees, three non-legal persons and the Attorney General. The only change I can see in the amendment that would achieve any real reform, particularly with reference to the question of involvement, is the addition of one non-legal or lay member to replace the Attorney General. Amendments Nos. 15 and 21, in my name, will bring the membership to 17 by adding one further layperson to provide for a non-legal or lay majority. With the Senator's amendment, we are not very far advanced from the position in 1995, over 20 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349"> Apart from what I see as the low representation of non-legal persons, a point rightly referred to by Senator Anthony Lawlor, the main change in amendment No. 13 would have the effect of dropping the Attorney General altogether from the process. It is true that this was the effect of the amendments passed on Committee Stage in the Dáil. On Report Stage, based on my amendment, the Dáil agreed to reinstate the Attorney General on the commission. I do not envisage going back to the last version of the Bill in order to remove the Attorney General. I want one moment to outline why the Government, including me, is convinced that the Attorney General should be a member of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">The programme for Government commitment is to establish a commission with a lay majority and an independent chair. The Bill, as passed by the committee, provides for a lay chair. My intention in the Seanad, with the support of the Members, is to ensure that we have a non-legal or lay majority. With regard to the lay chair, the amendment provides that the commission shall select its own chairperson. In subsection (2) of Senator Clifford-Lee's amendment to section 10 is to operate in the context of not just a judicial and legal-professional member majority, but a simple majority of judicial members over the lay members. The amendment holds out the theoretical possibility that any of the commission members could be voted into the chair. I am concerned that there is no guarantee whatsoever that any lay person would ever chair such a commission. I do not accept that it is reasonable for us, as legislators, to leave these important institutional arrangements to chance or to what might happen on the day. All of us here are experienced politicians going to meetings where committees are elected and officers are elected and often leaving these issues to an "It will be all right on the night" approach is not in the best interests of the committee or, indeed, those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351"> As regards the lay persons and the nominee system, I would say to Senator Clifford-Lee that I know her party has consistently sponsored this throughout the process, but I am concerned that there is no role whatsoever for the Public Appointments Service, PAS. I would not be in a position to accept that. I am still convinced that the Public Appointments Service, operating on a set of competences, based on the provisions of the Bill, is the best method of obtaining the knowledge and experience that I have no doubt will be represented in some of these bodies. This an open, visible, tested and tried process. PAS was directly involved in the recruitment recently of our new Garda Commissioner. Why should the manner of appointment of members or, indeed, the chair of this new commission be any different?</p>
          <p eId="para_1352"> We spoke about the Public Appointments Service earlier and I said it was a body that had reached certain standards of competence and excellence and that since its establishment it has served the Government and administration and people well. I did not hear any dissenting voice in that regard. My conclusion is that the PAS system is the most appropriate one, fulfilling, as it does, this role in respect of other like bodies. I would say to the Senators in passing that the chairperson of the Top Level Appointments Committee that has been referred to is not a senior civil servant, but is independent of the Civil Service. In any event, Senator Clifford-Lee's amendment poses a number of policy issues, which provides me with a difficulty and means that I will not accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353"> I want to mention the Attorney General, for clarity. I have already made reference to the will of the Dáil select committee that the Attorney General be removed from the commission membership provisions. The committee instead voted in favour of the inclusion of the chief commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC. The element of those changes relating to the IHREC member was a positive result of our deliberations at the Dáil select committee. IHREC is the national institution tasked with protecting and promoting human rights and equality in the State. These areas are of fundamental relevance to the portion of matters which the Judiciary determines, whether it is to do with the powers and functions of Government, the values informing the criminal justice process or a range of personal rights relating to family, private property, education, religious freedom and the like.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354"> With regard to the Attorney General, my view and that of the Government in this matter - and ultimately the Dáil accepted this on Report Stage - is that we wish to ensure the continuing involvement in the important process of judicial selection and recommendation of the officeholder on the new commission. When the job was first provided for in the Courts and Court Officers Act in the mid-1990s, it was seen as absolutely essential to have the Attorney General at the core of the body. The Dáil has accepted that now and I see no going back on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355"> For the record, the service in this role of various Attorneys General over the intervening years has been immensely beneficial and has been complementary to the work of the other Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB, members, in ensuring and guaranteeing, in effect, that the very best of candidates for judicial appointment were, as a consequence, recommended for appointment. While there has been criticism of the appointments system, I have heard none here, nor indeed have I heard of any mistakes having been made, or misunderstandings having come through the system. JAAB and the system of appointments has served us well, was fit for purpose, and we are now reforming in order to ensure that we have best practice. The Attorney General had a pivotal role to play in the process from the start and my view is that the role of that office should continue into the future, and on the new commission. The knowledge and attributes of an Attorney General across a range of legal and, dare I say it, judicial matters are indispensable to the formulation of any view about the merits of a person coming forward for judicial appointment. We cannot ignore the fact that the day-to-day interaction with the law and the courts, and at the highest level of legal proceedings before the courts, provides the Office of the Attorney General with a unique perspective on the work of practitioners, as well as the deliberations of the courts themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356"> I see no valid point whatever in the notion that the Attorney General, in discharging his or her role at Government as legal adviser, is in some way as having two bites at the cherry, as was stated by some Deputies. It is because of the separate role he or she has at the commission - a role I firmly believe can only be discharged by the Office of the Attorney General - that to some degree this opposition to the Attorney General is inherent in this amendment. I cannot accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357"> I acknowledge the fact that we are discussing a large group of amendments here and that we are hitting at the heart of the change, the new system and the scheme of arrangement for the commission. However, I have yet to hear a convincing argument for forgoing or, indeed, casting aside the unique input of the Attorney General to the deliberation stage of selection, where very many names may be before the commission, as opposed the very limited number of names which now come to Government. As a result of that, the argument for the inclusion and retention of the Attorney General is even stronger now than it was in 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358"> I will address amendment No. 14, as proposed by Senator Bacik. This amendment addresses the composition of the commission and provides for 12 members, five senior court presidents - including the Chief Justice as chairperson, as supported by Senator Norris - and seven non-judicial members as the Senator terms it, all to be nominated by stipulated bodies, including the Law Society and the Bar Council, so this is lawyer-heavy. I have several issues with this approach, going over much of the same ground in respect of a more significant number of amendments that revolve effectively around the same points here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359"> Senator Bacik's amendment provides for no lay majority. My interpretation as to what is provided for is five lay persons <i>per se</i>, including one to be nominated by IHREC - we already have that in the Bill - and two legal nominees. This is not dissimilar to the other Senator's approach. The fact that there is no non-legal, or non-judicial or lay majority in this amendment, and no lay chair, makes it impossible for me to support it. Additionally, there is no provision for the Attorney General. As I have stated, I see the role of the Attorney General on the commission as being vitally important. I have argued before that when it comes to a system solely where designated nominating bodies have the say in relation to the lay composition, we immediately run into difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">These are fine organisations. There is no argument about that. However, there are multiples of these organisations directly involved in justice matters, legal matters and relevant advocacy matters on the ground, so these could be considered as being as relevant, if not more so, to the task the Senator has in mind for them. I wish again to bolster my point now with my support for the PAS in the selection of the non-legal or lay members. By and large this has been accepted by the Dáil. It is what is in the Bill now. I do not intend to unwind this, not least because I believe, as I have stated on numerous occasions, that PAS simply is the proper process to follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361"> I note that Senator Bacik's subsection (2) addresses the knowledge and experience criteria deemed relevant. Much work has been done on this aspect in the Dáil. I cannot see an improvement to that here, but it is good to see much of what is in the Bill also reflected here. Section 12 also makes provision for gender equality and diversity objectives in the selection of lay members and, therefore, I will not go along with Senator Bacik's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362"> Government amendment No. 15 proposes to delete "13 members" and substitute "17 members", and amendment No. 21 proposes to delete "6 lay persons" and substitute "7 lay persons" under section 12. They form a composite proposal and they are identical to Dáil Report Stage amendments Nos. 8 and 14. I explained in this House two weeks ago on Second Stage that I would table these amendments relating to the commission's numbers and composition and I explained why. The commission's composition in the Bill, as passed by the Dáil, is as follows: the lay chair, the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal, the President of the High Court, the President of the District Court, the President of the Circuit Court, the Attorney General, a nominee of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, a nominee of the Law Society, a nominee of the Bar Council and six non-legal or lay members. That is a total of 16 and there is no lay majority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363"> However, as I explained on Second Stage, due to a procedural difficulty on Report Stage in the Dáil and a ruling from the Ceann Comhairle on the matter, a number of amendments could not be moved to give full effect to the Government's position with respect to the composition of the commission. Specifically, further to a vote on Report Stage, amendment No. 8, having been lost on 22 May, and an additional three members having been added to the commission to bring the membership number to 16, the Ceann Comhairle ruled on the next day, 23 May, that Report Stage amendment No. 14 could not be moved but that the consequent anomaly arising in the text could be addressed in the Seanad. Due to the defeat of my amendment No. 8 on Report Stage, the number of members is referred to in section 10 as 13, so clearly, we have an anomaly here and we need to rectify it. I indicated on Second Stage that I would do so, so amendment No. 15 provides for the number of commission members as stipulated to change from 13 to 17. I am required to change it to 17 to make way for an additional non-legal, non-judicial or lay member, which is the subject of amendment No. 21, which increases the number of lay members from six to seven to ensure a lay majority in accordance with the programme for Government. The effect of these amendments, in summary, therefore, is to set the commission membership at 17 and to ensure, by increasing the number of lay members by one, that we have a lay majority of one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364"> It is critically important to get the balance of the commission members right. The effect of amendments Nos. 15 and 21 together achieve this. I make no apologies for the net effect of these amendments, which secure Government policy in this area. I indicated on Second Stage that we are moving on substantially from the position created back in the mid-1990s, when the JAAB process was first conceived. This was the first time the Government function in the matter was supplemented by an independent element of the process and it was the first opening to any scrutiny of the process. At the time it was a real advance and a real innovation. The modern justice system now operates in a different administrative environment. More transparent, more participative approaches are clear in the matter of public policy decision-making in models not only here, but also on the international stage. This marks out our approach to having a strong, non-legal, non-judicial or lay representation reflecting today's governance and participation models and public policy decision-making. It is important that we endeavour to get the balance right between different contributions and interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365"> On the matter of balance, a significant change in the Bill, as passed by the Dáil, was to provide for the membership of all four court presidents as well as the Chief Justice on the commission. This is by way of my amendment on Report Stage. This approach fully recognises the need to ensure our senior judges - all five presidents - play the strong, critical, expert and experienced role they have on these matters, and the Bill allows for this. We have struck a good balance in this regard. We have judicial involvement, lay involvement, the Attorney General, the Bar Council's representative and the Law Society's input. The inclusion in the membership, following on the Dáil work on the Bill, of a nominee of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is also a positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366"> I said on Second Stage and I repeat here that my position is clear: the Government has set out to ensure that the commission will have a lay chair and a lay majority, but balanced by a substantial judicial presence and by the presence of the Attorney General and a representative of both arms of the legal profession. The individuals and expertise needed to continue to professionalise the selection of excellent judges will be there with its own strong voice at this commission, including the experience, expertise and wisdom of the Chief Justice himself or herself and other senior members of the Judiciary, so I put forward my own amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367"> I will address Senators McDowell, Boyhan and Craughwell briefly on amendment No. 16. The amendment lays clear the thinking of the Senators tabling it as to what their concept of the leadership of the commission would be. It is the practice that the Chief Justice has been the chairperson of the JAAB. I made it clear earlier that we are moving to a more modern approach to these matters. We will have a commission with a significant remit and its own resources. We will have members of the commission who, according to Senator McDowell, will be busy and will have an onerous workload. In this context, and to ensure that lay representation has a real meaning in this environment, similar to steps taken in England, Wales and Scotland, it is time to move to a stronger non-judicial, non-legal model with leadership of a suitably qualified layperson. The Bill stipulates the qualifications, the process and the qualities required for the leadership of this commission by an experienced, expert, non-judicial, non-legal person working closely with the Chief Justice and other members of the Judiciary. The Chief Justice will lead the judicial team on the commission with the strongest possible input of senior judges - all of whom are court presidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368"> These are important amendments. A number of Senators representing different groups and none have tabled their own variations. We have been over this ground a good deal. I am happy to listen to the submissions of Senators but I am reluctant to accept any amendments that deviate from the framework I have put forward in respect of the new commission: 17 members; a balance between legal and judicial and lay experts bringing their own experience to this important commission; and a role for the PAS in selecting the chair, but that chair being a non-legal and non-judicial layperson. I am not minded to deviate from that. However, having regard to what I said about the balance, as this important legislation enters its final Stages in the Houses next week, it is important we have legislation that is constitutionally robust, legally sound and workable in ensuring the commission can carry out the duties that will be assigned to it under the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1369">I want to respond to the point the Minister made about the Attorney General. It is interesting that section 10 provides that the Attorney General will be one of the members of the commission. If amendments Nos. 15 and 21, in the Minister's name, are made, the commission will comprise 17 persons. The reason the Attorney General referred to it as a dog's dinner is clear; the way in which the anomaly in section 10 is proposed to be rectified is rather messy. It is interesting that the Attorney General is still included as a member of the commission, as is the case in section 10, whereas both my amendment No. 14 and amendment No. 13, as proposed by Senator Clifford-Lee, do not include the Attorney General. That is in keeping with the position of the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, ICCL, which sought significant reform in 2014, including the abolition of the JAAB. It advised the Government to remove the Attorney General, as a political appointee, from the appointments process, believing that this would be in keeping with measures taken against the potential for political favouritism. It is interesting that the recommendation is not followed here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370"> Amendment No. 17 is a stand-alone amendment from Sinn Féin which seeks to remove the reference to the Attorney General in section 10. I am interested to hear a little more about why that recommendation from the ICCL was not followed. It had recommended a lay majority on the new body. The latter seems to be out of step with the package of reforms that is otherwise being proposed. It is an amendment I hope to press, although I may reserve the right to press it on Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2018-07-04T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1371">The amendment moved in Dáil Éireann for the inclusion of the Attorney General on this commission was a wise one. I am interested to hear that the ICCL does not approve of the idea, but there are many reasons why it should be done. Bearing in mind the constitutional function of the Government, which is preserved by this Bill in one way or another - its prerogative to appoint people who are eligible and to advise the President accordingly - it seems that it would be strange indeed if the Government had no insight into what the commission was doing. It is an aspect of the Bill I cannot quite follow in its current form. If the commission was consistently turning down a person the Attorney General thought was worthy of consideration, it would be a good idea if the Government knew about that rather than be simply left to wonder if that person ever applied or what happened to him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372"> The Minister will have to consider what the Government is entitled to know about the deliberations of the commission between now and Report Stage. Various people in this House have stood up and, with a flourish, stated that this is going to be transparent. We will come to the question of confidentiality at a later stage of the debate, but I take it that it is not intended that we should read on the front of <i>The Irish Times</i> or elsewhere that three named people were proposed and were ranked in a particular order. I assume it is not intended that this judicial appointments commission will operate in that way. What I have outlined would lead to controversy, disappointment, disillusionment, political argumentation and dissatisfaction with the ultimate choices made by the Government. There has never been clarity in this legislation as to whether we are to know whether what the commission reports is to be made public in any circumstance, and we have tabled amendments to clarify that issue. It would be nothing short of disastrous if the three names recommended by the commission were made public, including the order in which they were recommended, and it was found that the Government had chosen the third named candidate instead of the first and second choice candidates. What is the point of providing a shortlist of three names in those circumstances? Essentially, the commission would be informing the Government that it may defy its opinion providing that the Government publicly acknowledges that it has inverted the order. If that is what is being contemplated, it is wholly unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373"> On my reading of it, the Bill is not clear on this matter. Some speakers have indicated that they want a crystal-clear and transparent process. It is never going to be either. If it were, the outcome for disappointed candidates would be pretty awful. Top-quality people will never apply for a job where there is the possibility that they will read about their rejection in the newspapers. We must be clear in our own minds about this. If one of the consequences of this new system was to be that a person might read on the front page of a newspaper that he or she had been rejected by the Government or that he or she was number three on the list after two others and if a debate about the various merits of candidates is conducted in the newspapers in general, that would be extremely damaging to the entire process and subvert public confidence in it. In that context, the presence of the Attorney General is of some significance, because he or she would be able to tell the Government what is going on with the commission, what kind of people it is going for and who is not being recommended for appointment. When the Government comes to use its own residual prerogative to nominate people for judicial appointment and to advise the President to nominate somebody, it should know whether that person did or did not apply and was or was not successful in an application to the judicial appointments commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374"> The only dependable way that I can see for the Government to become aware of the list of candidates is to have a confidential and secret line of communication between it and the commission in the person of the Attorney General. Having been the Attorney General on the JAAB, it is not the case that he or she would say to the Chief Justice and various other members of that board that Mr. Joe Bloggs is going to be appointed and that there is no need to nominate anyone else. Nothing like that ever happened. I say this in case people think that the presence of the Attorney General is something that would somehow bring the debate to a halt. That simply did not happen. Perhaps I am biased, having held the office of Attorney General. However, the Attorney General in Ireland, unlike in the United Kingdom, sits at Cabinet. When Cabinet comes to make the decision, the Attorney General and the Minister for Justice and Equality are the two people who, as outlined in the Cabinet handbook, must be involved in the process before a person is suggested to the Government as being suitable for recommendation to the President for appointment to the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">When I was Attorney General, my understanding was that the Minister for Justice customarily made the proposal but he or she was obliged to consult the Attorney General of the day, the Taoiseach, and, by custom in a coalition, the leader of the other coalition party before bringing such a resolution before the Cabinet. </p>
          <p eId="para_1376"> The Attorney General is also a constitutional officer and an <i>ex officio </i>member of the Council of State. It is a job with responsibilities, and one that carries with it a residual role to advise the President on matters where the Council of State has a function, though it does not have a function in the appointment of judges by the President. When the Dáil, in the messy process that gave us this section in its present arithmetically challenged form, decided to reinstate the Attorney General on the commission, it made a wise and proper decision and I cannot support any amendment that has the effect of reversing that decision and excluding the Attorney General.</p>

          <p eId="para_1377">It is instructive to have an insight from someone who has served as Attorney General on JAAB. Senator McDowell brings that experience, which none of us has, to bear and it is useful to hear him speak of the presumed rationale behind the reinsertion of the Attorney General onto the new commission. I simply observed that it seemed somewhat anomalous that the Attorney General remains on the newly constituted commission under section 10 whereas the other changes are in keeping with a rather different perspective on reform. It just seemed to be yet another anomaly, alongside the anomaly relating to the numbers on the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378"> I will address another point that I should have made when I first discussed amendment No. 14, which was made by the Minister about the criteria for deciding who to put forward. We have taken some of the Minister's own provisions in section 12(6) regarding the matters that lay persons should have knowledge of, including matters connected with the administration of justice and so on. My list is somewhat more inclusive in that it also includes the needs of consumers of legal services. It is anomalous that that would not be included among the requisite criteria for those to be appointed as lay persons. It is important that knowledge of provision of supports to persons who are victims of crime be included. We have included it and it is also in the Minister's list. Perhaps "for users of services provided by the courts" might be as close as it gets but I am not sure that it is quite the same. </p>
          <p eId="para_1379"> Our amendment refers to the persons who would be the non-judicial members nominated for appointment by the different bodies. The reason those bodies, such as the Citizens' Information Board, Competition Consumer and Protection Commission and so on, are included is that one would expect their nominees to have the experience or knowledge of matters that are specified under section 12. It is a more focused way, perhaps, of ensuring the same expertise or experience among the lay members of the commission. I see the same approach is taken in Senator Clifford-Lee's amendment No. 13. We are seeking to do something similar but in a more focused and directed way.</p>

          <p eId="para_1380">I do not intend to repeat the points I made earlier except that my opposition to the various configurations of amendments before us from the different groups stems from the ultimate flaw, from my perspective and that of the Government, namely, that they do not facilitate the lay majority and the lay chair. I agree with the points made by former Minister, Senator McDowell, about the central role and the constitutional office of the Attorney General. It is why I point to the body of the current section 10.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381"> I did not refer to the other amendments in the group and will do so briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382"> Amendment No. 53 is identical to Dáil Report Stage amendment No. 53 in the series of amendments that the Ceann Comhairle ruled could not be moved. It is a drafting amendment consequential on the inclusion of the President of the District Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the Attorney General as members of the commission. It extends the effect of the section to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission member, and ensures that the provisions of section 16(7) on the payment of allowances will not apply to these members.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383"> Amendment No. 57 comprehends the IHREC nominee relating the resignation from the commission and the filling of a casual vacancy. While it is a technical amendment, it is a necessary addition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384"> Amendment No. 58 is in the name of Senator Bacik and her party colleagues and is read with her earlier amendment No. 14 on the composition of the commission. Section 18 is a standard provision relating to the arrangements necessary where a member of the commission ceases to hold office. I have tabled a technical amendment to this provision to include the IHREC nominee in its scope. However, Senator Bacik's amendment is consequential on the reconfiguration of the legal and lay membership of the commission. Coming from the Senator's perspective, it seeks to replace the reference to the legal members and lay members with reference to the seven non-judicial members which have been proposed. I return to my original opposition and difficulty to the Senator's substantive amendment, and, therefore, I will not support any of the consequential amendments. </p>
          <p eId="para_1385"> My amendments Nos. 59 and 61 correspond with Dáil Report Stage amendments Nos. 60 and 62 and a series of amendments that the Ceann Comhairle ruled could not be taken for procedural reasons only. These amendments are necessary additions to the matters addressed in section 19 dealing with disqualification and ineligibility for membership. They have the effect of including the IHREC nominee. Amendment No. 59 also applies section 19(1) to the IHREC member as well as its existing application to lay members and the legal professional members. Amendment No. 61 makes ineligible for membership of the commission a member of IHREC should specified grounds (a) to (d) under section 19(1) apply to that person. This merely extends what applies to lay members and legal professional members to the IHREC member.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386"> Amendments Nos. 60 and 62 are proposed by Senator Bacik. I am sure the Senator will agree that these must be read with amendment No. 14 on the composition of the commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_1388">Section 19 contains a standard provision on grounds for disqualification of a member of the commission. I have tabled a technical amendment to this provision to include the IHREC nominee. Having regard to the fact that amendment No. 60 is consequential on the reconfiguration of the legal and lay membership of the commission, as with any amendment consequential on amendment No. 14, I will not support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389"> I refer to my own amendment No. 63.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">This is a former Report Stage amendment No. 64 which was not moved for procedural reasons. What I am doing is extending the provisions of section 20 concerning the removal of membetrs to include the IHREC nominee as it already applies to lay members and the legal profession members. As I could not move the amendment in the other House, I hope to move it here. The acceptance of the amendment is critical. All we are doing is providing for the application of the provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1391"> Amendment No. 64 in the name of Senator Bacik is read in conjunction with amendment No. 14 and deal with the composition of the commission. Section 20 is a standard provision. As I do not agree with the substantive amendment, I am not obviously going to agree with any consequential amendments.</p>
