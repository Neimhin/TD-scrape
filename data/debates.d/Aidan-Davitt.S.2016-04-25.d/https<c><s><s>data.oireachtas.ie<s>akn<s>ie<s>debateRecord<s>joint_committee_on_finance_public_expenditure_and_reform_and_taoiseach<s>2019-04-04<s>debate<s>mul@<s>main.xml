        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Peter Boland<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Linda Murray, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform and owner of Huckleberry's den and play centre in Navan, and Mr. Gerry Monks, director of JDM Insurance. Mr. Noel Anderson of the Licensed Vintners Association is in the Gallery.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Since we last presented to the committee in May 2018, the situation for our members had worsened considerably. In particular, small businesses are now closing on a weekly basis and members right across the spectrum are reporting savage increases in liability insurance renewals. My colleagues will give members evidence in this respect. The crisis is spreading to a broader range of SME sectors, as illustrated by our more recent members, including Nursing Homes Ireland, the Irish Travel Agents Association, the Association of Irish Showmen's Guild which represents circuses and fairs around the country, and Retail Excellence. The crisis is existential in many of those sectors. Businesses across the leisure, childcare and hospitality areas are threatened and one could add many community, charity, sporting and arts organisations to the list. There is increasing alarm among members regarding the slow pace of key reforms and it is clear to us that the dead hand of vested interests and a lack of sufficient political will are grinding the response to the crisis to a halt.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> My colleagues will gladly share their specific experiences with members but right now I intend to cut to the chase and focus on analysis and solutions. When we last presented to the committee we submitted ten asks, practical measures that would help reform this dysfunctional area quickly. We further communicated these asks to the cost of insurance working group, CIWG, and to the Ministers involved. While we acknowledge the amendment of section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which now obliges claimants to inform defendants of a potential claim within one month, progress on other key reforms remains frustratingly slow. It is illuminating to note in this regard that when a similar crisis arose in 2002, the major reforms were in place within two and a half years. Following on the publication of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report in April 2002 the two key responses, namely, the establishment of the PIAB and the commencement of the Civil Liability and Courts Act, were implemented by July 2004 and September 2004, respectively. By contrast, the cost of insurance working group report was published in January 2017 but, over two years later, the key reforms remain uncompleted. Indeed, of the 68 recommendations made in this committee's report on the rising cost of motor insurance from November 2016, our analysis suggests that only 17 have been actioned. Of the CIWG recommendations, ongoing delays in the establishment of a long promised Garda insurance fraud unit and the recalibration of the book of quantum are prolonging and amplifying the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> On the CIWG recommendations, I will start with the recommendation to establish a Garda insurance fraud unit. Insurance fraud is a crime with profound consequences up to and including the loss of livelihood and valuable public facilities. Additionally, it criminalises the very process of making a personal injury claim, tarnishing all claimants with the same brush and deterring genuine claimants from seeking redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">An oft-repeated quote from a member of the public at an alliance meeting last year is as follows.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_21">If I had a need for big money and I had a choice between robbing a bank and faking an injury, I'd pick the fake injury every day. More money and no consequences if I'm found out.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">It is absolutely clear from the experience of our members that An Garda Síochána is not currently equipped to deal with this issue. A specialised unit to deal with insurance fraud has been a key element of the cost of insurance working group strategy since the start and a key recommendation of the Personal Injuries Commission. We are bewildered by how long it has taken to establish the same unit, with issues such as political support, a year-long Insurance Ireland cost-benefit analysis and sources of funding wheeled out to justify the delays. It must be established without further delay if the scourge of fraudulent and exaggerated claims is to be meaningfully addressed. Incidentally, on this point, I welcome the statement by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on RTÉ Radio 1 yesterday evening that An Garda Síochána is investigating some medical practitioners and legal firms in this regard. However, these are one-off investigations and do not constitute a full strategic response to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I refer to recalibration of the book of quantum. As documented in the Personal Injuries Commission reports, the general damages awarded for minor injuries in Ireland bear no relation to those made in other countries, which makes Ireland a very attractive place to sustain a minor injury. This applies not just to whiplash injuries, as covered in detail in the Personal Injuries Commission, PIC, reports, but also to all minor, fully recovered soft tissue injuries. Additionally, there is no consistency between awards for identical injuries between the Personal Injuries Assessment Board and the courts, or from judge to judge, which makes it very attractive in personal injury cases to reject a Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, offer and head for the courts, safe in the knowledge that with the right judge, the rewards from the court or by direct settlement with the insurer may be substantially better.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> It is now abundantly clear that the book of quantum and the current process of its drafting are no longer fit for purpose. However, there has been much debate in recent months about the best approach to address this. We are fearful that the net result of all this debate will be no action and no change, a situation forced by vested interests making hundreds of millions in income from the <i>status quo</i>. This will have catastrophic results for our members as they cannot sustain current premium levels, never mind the additional increases in insurance premiums that may arise if quantum for minor injuries is not addressed. What makes the delay in doing so all the more frustrating is that awards are already capped in this country at the top end of the scale by the Court of Appeal in Nolan <i>v</i>. Wirenski, which has also clarified the principle of proportionality in Shannon <i>v</i>. O'Sullivan. The framework and principles for a recalibration are, therefore, already in place. We ask that the book of quantum is calibrated to reflect international norms and norms already established by the Court of Appeal as a matter of urgency. On this point, we welcome the passage of Committee Stage of the Judicial Council Bill in the Seanad on Tuesday night. However, as it has taken more than a year to get to this stage, we fear that without political will, the Bill will die a slow death.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> I refer to a schedule of forecast reductions. If anything, the situation regarding transparency in this systemically important industry has worsened since we last presented to the committee. As well as the blue book, which gave comprehensive data oversight of the insurance industry, we have learned that the Central Bank has abandoned publication of the comprehensive data on policyholder demographics and cost trends provided by the private motor insurance statistics report. For example, analysing trends in insurance costs for young drivers is no longer possible. This approach to the reports, which offered key consumer protection insights, can only be described as data vandalism. Data from the national claims information database for the years 2009 to 2018 are due from the Central Bank in the second half of this year. Initially, it is expected that the data regarding motor insurance will be very limited. However, neither the national claims information database nor the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has any concrete plans to issue any data on liability insurance costs. Reports on possible plans from both are due by the end of 2019. In this data vacuum both Ms Murray and Mr. Monks are willing to share definitive data on their sectors. From a broader perspective, policyholders cannot plan or be protected if there is no data to measure what is happening or what can be expected to happen. We ask, therefore, that the Department of Finance produce a schedule of forecast reductions for reforms using the 2002 Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, schedule as a model, which I have attached in appendix 3 to my written submission. It is abundantly clear to us at this stage that lawyers and insurance companies will do anything to stop real reform, working tirelessly to slow reforms and blaming each other to deflect from their own responsibilities. This is why it is imperative that political will drives this agenda. Otherwise, we will be here again in a year's time providing a similar update.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> This concludes our formal presentation. As an alliance, we are intensely aware of how urgent this issue is for our members and their employees and volunteers. We hope the committee can help us in getting meaningful action quickly and we are happy to take questions.</p>

          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I thank Mr. Boland. May we now have ISME's opening statement, please?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Mr. Neil McDonnell<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I thank the Chairman for his invitation to address the committee. Our cost of insurance continues to rise. ISME's latest cost of insurance survey results for quarter 4 of 2018 are shown in the first appendix to our paper. The results show that 81% of members report increased public liability insurance. Recent statements about moderating insurance costs refer to private motor insurance only. No one has reliable statistics on liability or other commercial insurances as the CSO does not measure them. The continued rise in insurance costs is the outcome of a failure to make meaningful change in three areas: reducing quantum, to which there is no constitutional impediment; reforming our legal system; and reforming the insurance system itself. The issue goes far beyond the simple cost of insurance to SMEs, although this issue is already causing many businesses to fail. The issue of the cost of insurance is now hollowing out Irish society, restricting the conduct of sport, play and charitable activity, attracting criminal activity and encouraging the advancement of manufactured grievances. It is harming the physical and moral health of citizens. We are getting to the point where suing someone for the most minor of inconveniences is now socially acceptable across all educational and class strata.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> While there has been a large amount of activity by the cost of insurance working group, it has not addressed the core issues, which we address in our presentation. The cost of insurance working group has committed the cardinal sin of confusing performance, by which we mean doing lots of things, with effectiveness, which is doing the right things. What we are left with is a veneer of progress and the complete absence of material reform. What we need is quantum to be reduced; the legal profession to engage honestly with a reform process; moral hazard for plaintiffs in our courts; a perjury statute and an amended Defamation Act; a just, answerable Judiciary committed to continuous professional development; meaningful action on the detection and punishment of fraudulent claims; and transparent, granular data on a well-regulated insurance industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> While it would be easy in these circumstances to call for the head of the responsible Minister of State, we believe this would achieve nothing other than political theatre. We need a Cabinet Minister to take over the lead on this issue personally, and the nature of the reforms required suggests that this should be the Minister for Justice and Equality. We appreciate that the committee has pressing issues such as Brexit and housing to attend to but we have suffered a lost decade on this issue. People are losing their jobs and businesses now because of legislative inaction. Members alone are the people who can fix this, and we ask them to do so now.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I am accompanied by our former chair, who will be able to give the committee real-world examples and figures brought to his attention by members.</p>

          <from> Mr. James Coghlan<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">As Mr. McDonnell said, I am a former chair of ISME, a position I held in the period from 2015 until 2017. Knowing what we know, liability insurance began to ramp up from 2014-15, so I had many people approaching me at that time. I will share with the committee a couple of stories to illustrate this. The first story is illustrated on page 10 of our written submission and concerns an ISME member in the south west, a medium-sized manufacturer with a substantial multi-risk policy in six figures. The policy was with what I would call a multinational enterprise, MNE, a broker or an international brokerage firm. The policy was underwritten, so broker A was underwritten by underwriter B, both of which were multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">At recent renewal, the member received off the record advice that underwriter B had paid broker A and a number of other major brokers a substantial commission to direct all their clients to underwriter B. Broker A would shortly advise the ISME member that the only underwriter who would accept his business for 2018 would be underwriter B and a 30% increase would apply. There would then be only one underwriter bidding for the business at a 30% premium. However, if the ISME member approached broker C, he could renew the book with underwriter B for the same price as before. Broker A duly quoted the premium plus 30% a few days later and the ISME member severed his relationship with broker A. The ISME member will not identify himself or the broker underwriter for fear of commercial retribution. I do not need to explain the implications of this to anybody here as they should be clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> The second story is also in the submission. An ISME member in the east has tracked a policy for six years with respect to premiums, claims, losses, etc. The underwriter has made a surplus of €430,000 over these six years before reinsurance costs and overheads. This surplus of €430,000 represents an effective gross profit of 91%. The ISME member has had four claims over this six-year period, with a total value of €45,000. The premium income is €430,000 while the claim total over six years has been €45,000. I would love to see how the risk was priced over the six years as it effectively amounted to price gouging. Again, the ISME member will not identify himself for fear of commercial retribution. When there is only one underwriter bidding for the business, if the bidding party withdraws, the company will be left uninsured.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> All brokers should be obliged to provide a five-year claims history at renewal. The insurance industry would say this adds to cost and it cannot be done but it is done anyway. The information must be produced for an actuary to be able to price the risk. Somebody may say this cannot be produced but it is already produced and there is no cost. At least with this approach, the client would be in a position to make a business decision by seeing the premiums and claims over a five-year period and deciding if it is an acceptable level of risk and price.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> These are just two stories about members of the organisation but there are many others. The common thread seems to be that there is only one underwriter bidding for the business. Is that by accident or design? I do not know. </p>

          <p eId="para_37">I welcome our guests from ISME and the Alliance for Insurance Reform. If I may, I invite Ms Linda Murray to tell her story as the matter of insurance for play centres is centre stage right now and it is representative of issues facing a number of other sectors too. These are areas with a significant public footfall, including pubs, nightclubs and restaurants, as well as other parts of the leisure industry like leisure centres. As a parent of small children, I know well the value of play centres and the important role they play in society. I wish to give Ms Murray the opportunity to tell her story of Huckleberry's Den and the picture she is facing now.</p>

          <from> Ms Linda Murray<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_38">I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for asking me to speak and I am honoured to be here. This is not something I normally do. I run Huckleberry's Den in Navan, County Meath, and I also represent 60 businesses which have all come together to form an organisation called Play Activity and Leisure Ireland, PALI. We had to form that organisation with a common goal to lobby for fair insurance for our members. We are all in the leisure sector and we include play centres, trampoline parks, pet farms, bowling alleys, karting tracks and basically facilities where families can have fun. It is something that Ireland definitely does not want to lose.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> We cannot get fair insurance and in many cases we cannot get any insurance. Our premiums have risen by between 379% and more than 500% in the past five years. My insurance has risen by 1,040% in the past six years. Incredibly, our premiums far outweigh our claims. As an organisation, we have paid €5 million over the past five years in premiums. We have had claims and reserves of just over €1 million. In the past five years, only €200,000 of that €5 million has been paid in claims in our sector. This means €4.8 million is sitting there while I cannot get insurance and our group cannot get fair insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> When I opened my business six years ago, my premium was €2,500. Last year, it was €16,500. I have been told that I cannot get insurance but I have been advised if I were to get it, I should expect to pay €26,000. That is just a "little" increase of 1,040% since I opened six years ago. This is my livelihood.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I have 12 people employed and I have 25 days left to get insurance. Members may ask why I cannot do it. I have had two claims in the past five years. One child banged his head and, as a result, I am being sued because the child now has anxiety and is unable to play with his friends, go to play centres or play in playgrounds. The reserve on this is €23,000, despite the child not suffering any injury. This is the only reason I cannot get insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> I have the only play centre in Navan and the other play centre closed six weeks ago. Navan has a population of 40,000 people and there are many children who need to play, especially on rainy days. Parents need to go somewhere for their kids' parties. I really do not want to close in 25 days. My own case is horrific but it is not unusual. Centres across the length and breadth of the country are being told they are lucky to even get insurance. After being handed a quote, we are told that even though it was €20,000 last year and €45,000 this year, we are lucky to get that. We are genuinely told that.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> All our centres in the past year have seen increases in premiums of between 100% and 300%. This affects even centres that may have had no claims. Deputy McGrath is familiar with one in Cork that paid just under €8,000 for insurance last year, has never had a claim but has been told it is very lucky to get a premium of €18,000 this year. I challenge the Government to save my livelihood and that of all our members. Save the livelihoods of our staff and give our kids somewhere to play. Within the next 12 to 24 months, there may not be any play centres or leisure centres left if insurance is allowed to keep going the way it is. I thank the committee for its time.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I thank Ms Murray. I am aware of another example in Cork where the quote provided for the next 12 months is €32,000. It is a play centre with which the witness is probably familiar. That figure is double last year's premium and more than six times the 2017 premium. That is the level of growth. The excess provision in the policy has gone from €1,000 in 2017 to €7,500 for each claim in the current proposed renewal.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">This is making centres consider going without insurance. Nobody wants that. A centre should have insurance to cover cases where a real injury occurs and the centre has been negligent, for example. That is what insurance is for and we all need it in our lives. Centres are now proposing going without it, however, which is very risky. We do not want to do that and we want to be able to pay our insurance but we just cannot afford it.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">That is it. There are no other play centres in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I prefer to have parties for my children outside the house. I do not really want people in or to be cleaning up after everyone following a long day. People who live in apartments need somewhere to go. On rainy days, children need somewhere to play. We have had people coming in with their children. We have a very comfortable breast-feeding environment where women can come with their babies. We see those women holding fifth or sixth birthday parties for them five or six years later. This will not be possible anymore. There is no trick up my sleeve. I have 25 days left and that will be it. I have tried everything. I have worked on nothing but insurance since the beginning of January, or a few months before that. I cannot get a quote.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> When I outline the figures, such as €5 million in premiums and €1 million in claims, including all the reserves, I wonder why an Irish insurer does not examine this. Why can we not get insurance on this island? Why do we even have to go across the water, where we are told we are lucky to get insurance? Why can we not get it here? That we cannot beggars belief. It is trickling into other industries. When I was bringing my two children to gymnastics a couple of weeks ago, the organiser said to me he will need to get €10 from me for each of them for insurance. I asked whether it was not included in the membership fee and he said this is the first year in which insurance money has to be collected and that his business is down to its last insurer. He said the business now has to charge everyone coming in for insurance. If this is occurring in gymnastics organisations, what about other organisations? Soccer clubs are ringing me asking whether they can join in with me. What kind of society are we showing our children if we cannot even send them out to play a bit of hurling or football or do gymnastics without worrying whether the organisers will go out of business because of insurance costs?</p>

          <p eId="para_53">All this brings home the point that insurance is now centre stage in sporting, business and civic life, and part of our cultural identity as a people. I ask either Mr. Boland or Mr. McDonnell to identify what they regard as the core issues. They outlined them in detail in their submissions. Regarding the issue of awards, the claims environment and trying to stop and deal with the current trend, the roadmap the Government has laid out comprises the Judicial Council Bill and the new guidelines for personal injuries awards. Do the delegates have faith that this is the right direction in which to go? If the Bill becomes law and we get guidelines, will it change the direction in which we are currently going in terms of awards?</p>

          <p eId="para_56">It is a very vulnerable time for those concerned. As I emphasised in the report, there is fear of alienating the only broker or underwriter now available or of bringing additional claims, reflecting poorly on oneself, personally or from a business point of view. I can guarantee members that behind the play centres is a queue of sectors that are very close to being in the same circumstances. I could list festivals, convenience stores, leisure centres, the entire adventure tourism industry, circuses and street artists. Nightlife in Ireland is being severely affected by this issue. Charitable groups are also affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> On the point about the roadmap, it is abundantly clear that there has been enough analysis. There have been two exceptional reports, namely the cost of insurance working group report and the Personal Injuries Commission report. Both were kick-started by the report this committee produced at the end of 2016. That is enough analysis at this stage. We are well aware of what needs to be done. The problem we have concerns the pace of the action and the apparent lack of political reform. When there was a similar crisis in 2002–2003, there seemed to be political will to get work done. The establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board involved incredibly complex work but it was done in less than two years. The Judicial Council Bill was introduced to the Oireachtas in 2017 and it is still slowly working its way through the Seanad, from where it must proceed to the Dáil. That suggests to us that the political will does not exist to resolve this. We find this extraordinary in the sense that this issue is solvable and the pathway exists. The Government and Oireachtas have many issues that are very difficult to resolve, including housing, healthcare, Brexit and all the other issues that are major distractions, but the issue of insurance is solvable. The pathway exists but the bit that is missing comprises the momentum and political will to get it sorted.</p>

We do not have a sufficient legal or insurance background to say for sure but we know that, after all the expert analysis, it is the judicial council that is being tasked with reducing the claims levels. If that is what the expert advice is, we say it is fair enough but we ask that the work be done and that results be achieved quickly. If we are still talking about this in another year, all the small sectors at the periphery of Irish society will have been closed.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">How big a factor is fraud? There are fraudulent claims and some claims may be exaggerated. From talking to nightclub owners, I have learned that fraud is a significant factor. They say that a high percentage of claims are completely bogus or exaggerated. What is Mr. McDonnell's perspective on this issue? What is the perspective of his members? Is the issue being dealt with? We have tried to obtain data on whether prosecutions have been taken and whether there are any convictions but we cannot get any from the Department of Justice and Equality or Courts Service. Nobody seems to have any. I suspect this is because there are none.</p>

          <from> Mr. Neil McDonnell<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_61">There is a data black hole. The Deputy is absolutely right to point that out. We have already seen in the latest update on the report of the cost of insurance working group that there is not going to be a database. We have said that in view of Mr. Nicholas Kearns' final report, it is absolutely clear that there needs to be a claim-by-claim database. We have asked the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Darcy, to reconsider the decision because we believe it is wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> It is a greater cause of anger if one believes that a claim is fraudulent but the final outcome actually does not matter. The only difference is that one is getting sued by someone who knows they do not have an injury but one is still going to pay regardless of whether the claim is legitimate. The reason we have made quantum the number one concern relates to Mr. Kearns' point in his summation. Like Hansel and Gretel, Mr. Kearns did a fantastic job dropping the breadcrumbs for Members of the Oireachtas to follow in terms of required outcomes. He stated that the quantum is unjustifiably and inexplicably large and that it is leading to all sorts of other consequences. It is resulting in higher premiums but it is also attracting criminality. Mr. Kearns is saying that we do not have any mechanism to deal with this. The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is saying that he cannot tell the Garda what to do. We have suggested this is a particular area of white-collar crime in which there is no enforcement whatsoever, and that the courts do not enforce anything against those concerned. To an extent, it does not matter whether an organisation such as a play centre operator is getting sued by a fraudulent claimant or a legitimate claimant; since there is €30,000, €40,000 or €50,000 of quantum, there will be somebody there. We have described it as a honey pot that is attracting all these people in. The level just has to be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> Collectively, Members of the Oireachtas have been informed that there is a problem with capping damages. The very first recommendation Mr. Kearns made in his Personal Injuries Commission report, which went back to the Department, involved capping damages by means of legislation. We have shown, in documentation sourced through freedom of information provisions by Mark Tighe in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, that it was immediately nobbled by the lawyers and taken out. Mr. Kearns very clearly left the same recommendation in. He has just said he believes the judicial council is the way to go or the way to achieve the same thing. There is a possibility that a judicial council could sit down and decide to maintain damages at the same level, or 60% or 70% thereof. That would not be a solution. In our view, this is a public policy matter, not a matter for court procedure or judges. Respectfully, we suggest it is the members' job to cap damages.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">Telling one's story and bringing the humanity of what is involved here to the fore is very important. Looking back at the work done by the committee on the tracker mortgage scandal, the tide turned when those affected by the tracker mortgage issue came before the committee and told their stories. They were totally outside their comfort zone, but they bared their souls and told their stories and that is when the tide turned.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Mr. Boland spoke about the issue of political will. My observation is that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is doing his best, but he is a lone voice within Government. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has delegated to him the whole issue of insurance. The Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, seems to have no interest in the issue. I never hear the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Humphreys, even talking about the issue. When there was a Private Members' motion on the issue in the Dáil some weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was the only Government representative for almost the entire debate. There is only one person in the Government even attempting to do something about this and that is not good enough. There is a lack of political will. All I can say to the representatives is that, for whatever period is left in this Dáil, Fianna Fáil will hold the Government's feet to the fire on this issue. We know what is at stake.</p>

I know that it was difficult for Ms Murray in particular to give her contribution as a person who has invested so much of her life, expertise and resources in a business and is facing that uncertain outcome in 25 days. Many members are familiar with other play centres that, unfortunately, have closed. Some in my constituency are facing the same future and uncertainty as Ms Murray. I ask her to explain to anybody listening why insurance companies will not insure a soft play centre in Ireland. Is it the case that only one insurance company based in Britain was doing so but is now pulling out of the market? I ask her to explain why the situation has come to this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">Historically, I do not know why we cannot source insurance in Ireland. I have been in the leisure sector for 11 years. It has never even been brought up. In the past, one went to one's broker and was told that leisure centres do not get insurance in Ireland, so I have always sourced my insurance across the water. The insurance company in the UK told me that Ireland is seen as a loss-making nation when it comes to insurance and that the cost of claims is far higher than is the case in the UK. It stated that it has no interest in insuring play centres in Ireland, particularly those with a claim or two against them. The premiums of centres without claims against them are increasing by 100% or 200% to cope with any potential claims on the business. I have noticed what seems to be a cycle, with insurance companies from the UK coming in every three or four years and then leaving. We have never had a range of insurance companies from which to choose. The companies see us as loss-making. However, the figures for our group show that we are not loss-making. I have been told that the insurance companies are afraid of what could happen, given the type of awards that are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> When I began looking into this matter a few months ago, I thought the biggest reason for the difficulty sourcing insurance was claims and that our insurance premiums probably matched or came near to the level of claims. When I discovered that there is a significant disparity between the two, I asked why we cannot get insurance if there is so much money to be made on us as an industry. I was told it is because of the fear of what can happen as a result of the type of awards that are made. It is the fear of claims for broken bones, such as a broken arm or finger. It is not catastrophic injuries, it is the fear of claims for broken bones. Most of the injuries suffered on our premises are soft tissue injuries such as bruises or a split lip. Those are the injuries for which €15,000 or €20,000 is being awarded; it is not, in many cases, injuries such as a broken arm. The insurance companies are afraid that eight companies within the group scheme being sued for broken arms could result in €200,000 or €250,000 of payouts. </p>

          <p eId="para_74">It is not our experience that there has been a surge in claims. Half of our centres have no claims. This is what does not make any sense and why I would challenge an Irish underwriter or insurance company to look at us. Obviously, in my case, there are exaggerated and fraudulent claims. One hates to see them coming through the door and there are many sleepless nights over them. However, as a sector, we do not have a huge number of such claims and there does not seem to have been a significant increase in them, yet our premiums are increasing by 300% and some centres cannot get insurance. There is no transparency in how this is calculated. When my insurance premium increased from €8,000 to €16,000, I asked what was the reason for the increase. The broker told me that was just the way it was. I had no claims in that year, but my premium increased from €8,000 to €16,500. When one questions the increase, one is told that there is one underwriter offering insurance and it is the only option. I took out a personal loan to pay that premium because there is no way that one would have that money lying around. One pays it over the year and prays that one will not have a claim during that time. We are all on tenterhooks.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> A significant issue is that many of our businesses such as leisure centres are based in units in industrial parks where one must take out a four year and nine month lease. In God's name, how can one take out a lease for four years and nine months when one does not know what one's insurance premium will be the next year or the year after that? How can one tell a bank that one can take out a five-year loan to pay for a new set of laser tag equipment such as that we received a couple of weeks ago and be able to will repay it over a few years when one does not know where one will be with insurance in one year? One year ago, I did not know I would not get insurance this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">I am not very strong when it comes to the law and I ask that members forgive me if I make my points in basic English. I do not understand why we cannot shop in the European market or get an insurance company in. I also do not understand why an Irish insurer will not give us cover. Three or four big Irish insurers recently posted profits of €200 million. One can see the profit to be made on our business but we cannot get an insurer. We need an insurance company to be able to insure us.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> We need something to be done about fraudulent or exaggerated claims. If I walk into a soft play centre with my child and he or she suffers an injury, I should not immediately think, "What could I get for that?" That is what some people are thinking. They think they might as well claim and see if they can get something because nothing will happen to them afterwards anyway - they will not be prosecuted if it is found that the claim is fraudulent or exaggerated. That mentality must be nipped in the bud. People should know that if it is discovered that the child did not suffer as serious an injury as was claimed for, the parent could face a fine or prosecution. It is very important to start getting that into people's minds. Persons who lodge fraudulent claims in the UK may face time in jail. That happens there but it does not happen here. I do not think anybody has been prosecuted here for anything to do with public liability. I do not know all the facts but, as far as I know, nobody has.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">That needs to change. We need an insurance company to offer cover. We need competitiveness rather than a monopoly in order that companies are not faced with having to go without insurance or to self insure, which is what we are currently considering but should not have to. Self insurance is very risky but, as a group, we are trying to think of ways to stay in business. We love what we do and being in this business. We love to see tourists and families coming into our businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> Where would we be if there were no bowling alleys or similar facilities down the country? Yesterday, one of our members featured on the "Today with Sean O'Rourke" programme on RTÉ radio. The premium for his bowling alley increased from slightly less than €10,000 to €25,000 with no claims in the past year. There is very little that can go wrong in a bowling alley apart from a ball being dropped on a toe. A similar bowling alley in the UK would probably have an insurance premium of £2,000 or £3,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">That is appalling. The Alliance for Insurance Reform is made up of a wide range of groups, including owners of soft play areas. As Ms Murray and Deputy Michael McGrath stated, this issue goes much wider than one sector. The GAA, other sporting organisations and community groups have spoken to us. We have heard of festivals that cannot go ahead because of insurance issues. St. Patrick's Day parades are being put in jeopardy as a result of insurance. There is a real and sharp impact on businesses and jobs and the resulting issue of employees who have lost their jobs being able to keep a roof over their heads. In a situation where that type of monopoly exists or the State does not provide insurance to a certain sector, has the alliance engaged with Insurance Ireland and has Insurance Ireland given a legitimate reason for not addressing the matter? If somebody does not get motor insurance from a company, Insurance Ireland has a scheme whereby somebody who has been refused a quote for motor insurance will be provided with a quote. That does not mean the quote will be reasonable but at least a quote is offered. In this case, businesses operating in this State cannot get insurance from companies and their representatives, which are now very profitable. Has there been any engagement with Insurance Ireland?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">There has been engagement. Our perspective on this is evolving because we did not start as an alliance that could analyse this crisis in detail. We started and remained an alliance that represents members regarding the crisis they are experiencing. We have engaged and developed a much broader perspective in the past while. I go back to one of the Deputy's original comments on this. Historically, we have had very high levels of awards and claims in this country. These are serious issues that have fed into this crisis and need to be addressed. Arising from our engagement with the insurance industry, we have not received any data that would justify the spike in premiums we have seen in recent years. I am conscious that this is the finance committee and that we are representing businesses. While we have data on motor insurance, we do not have any data to explain what is happening. I will ask Mr. Gerry Monks to give an insight from the perspective of family grocery stores. From January 2014 to December 2016, we saw a 70% spike in motor insurance premiums. We did not see a spike in claims or awards that would justify that increase. There is no clarity in this area. As Ms Murray stated, insurers are again recording very healthy profits across the sector. We do not have clarity on this either but our understanding is that management fees transferred back to parent companies remain an issue. As we do not have a blue book, we cannot prove that. The extent to which insurance companies reserve for potential losses has increased dramatically in recent years, prompted by the Central Bank. Again, our understanding is that the companies are over-reserving at this stage, which means these reserves are ploughed back into profitability. We are faced on one side with an interest group, the lawyers, that has historically done very well out of this sector and, on the other side, insurers, which over any ten-year period always make a profit. We are the jam in the middle. We have not got clear answers and we do not have the data to explain the position, which is certainly part of the problem. I will let Mr. Monks introduce himself. He has put together some data on another sector to show that this is not a very specific issue for one sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I am account director with JDM Insurance Services. I have been looking after retailers - typically shops and convenience stores - across the country for more than 20 years in my 43-year career in insurance. These are commercial businesses but they are also families. When I looked at an analysis of the level of increase for the purposes of this exercise, I deliberately wanted to make sure I was not picking out cases with claims so I whittled it down to a certain number. I came up with a figure of 73% over a five-year period for the average increase applied to these businesses. Of the 29 selected cases, 15 were claim-free. I took out extraordinary figures to try to make it read realistically. Insurance in Ireland is broken. The very simple fact is we seem to somehow tolerate levels of payment for minor injuries and all other classes of injury that are multiples of those in other countries such as our nearest neighbour. The UK has a population that is more than ten times the size of our population, yet we pay out approximately four times more than is paid out in the UK. The figures do not add up and the system does not work. We do not have the numbers to justify it. The reserving being placed by insurers has increased in accordance with Central Bank best practice and nobody will argue with that. Claims do not come and go inside a matter of weeks or months. They take years. A claim can be outstanding for four years and in the meantime, the policyholder - the family - will be faced with an increased bill because the outstanding or reserved claim will be treated as a claim paid. Even if the claim is ultimately not paid and the only costs incurred by the insurer are its investigation costs, the premium increase will have taken place. It is history now. The insurers do not have the wherewithal to go back and pay what they owe to Joe Bloggs back from four years ago. They look at the end of every year and balance out what they need to make sure they do not go into the red because if they do, the Central Bank will close them down.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_87">I will ask a number of questions together because I am conscious that many other members wish to contribute. I hear what Mr. Monks is saying and I agree with him on some of the exaggerated awards that are being paid. While that issue needs to be addressed, I do not believe the insurance sector will reduce premiums accordingly. I do not trust the industry in which I believe a cartel is operating. Ms Murray's example of €5 million in premiums and €1 million in reserves shows that price gouging is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> In his opening statement, Mr. Boland spoke about the commitment by insurers to reduce prices in parallel with reforms. FBD told the agricultural sector that prices would fall if it undertook additional safety measures, installed cameras and so forth. Rather than falling, insurance premiums have increased dramatically resulting in the closure of some rural marts, which constitute the fabric of many rural communities. Before any further reforms are undertaken at this level, do we need a commitment from insurers, similar to the one given in 2002, that if businesses take certain steps, insurance premiums will reduce by a certain percentage? This was set out in a table agreed at that point in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> There has been much talk about fraudulent claims. The insurance industry told us these claims result in a €50 increase in all motor insurance premiums. We can imagine that the cost is significant and not just in motor insurance but in other areas of insurance. Many people do not claim from their insurance even when the claim is legitimate. I think the model is broken. If a tree fell on my car - one fell across the road from my house and my car ran into it just a couple of weeks ago - there is no chance that I would claim on my insurance policy because the company would increase my premium by twice the amount that it would cost to fix the car. Many people who have minor accidents simply do not contact their insurance companies. The sector is broken because businesses are penalised for claiming and using the insurance they have.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> We have statistics on fraudulent claims for the first time. Insurance companies now have to report fraudulent claims or suspected fraudulent claims to the Garda. I found it quite surprising that from 1 October to the end of February, which is five full months, there were only 19 cases of fraudulent claims right across the insurance sector. That includes public liability insurance, motor insurance and all the rest. Either the insurance companies are not reporting what they are saying or they are exaggerating the number of fraudulent claims to justify the price gouging that is taking place, or there is something else going on. That does not take away from the point that there needs to be a Garda insurance fraud unit. We are very strongly in favour of that. The committee is united on it. It should happen without delay. Is insurance fraud as considerable as the insurance companies are telling us? If so, why are they reporting only three cases per month across all sectors of insurance? The claims that are reported are suspected fraudulent claims. Some of them may not be.</p>

          <p eId="para_91">I will deal with those questions in order. With regard to commitments to reductions from the insurance companies, I agree absolutely. We have quite a list of reforms that we believe are necessary but we are very conscious of the amount of traffic going through the Oireachtas at the moment. We want to try to stay very focused. It is one of the top three items on our list. There is a considerable amount of work being done on this. An enormous amount of pain is being caused by insurance premiums. If we emerged at the end of this crisis with no reductions in insurance premiums to follow, it would have catastrophic consequences. It is essential at this stage that we obtain clarity from the insurers as to the benefits of all this work. I am conscious there have been developments since 2002 with regard to competition law and so on, so there may be complications. That is why we have asked the Department of Finance to address this issue. We have asked that it do so from a State point of view because the State is inextricably linked to the issue. Very often, we are legally obliged to have insurance, whether it is motor insurance or, in many cases, public liability insurance. As it is the State and organs of the State that are obliging us to have insurance, they cannot give the impression they are a third party on this issue. We are looking for this kind of commitment from the insurers via the State as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> On fraudulent claims, I am aware of the data mentioned by the Deputy. We welcome any clarity or transparency in this whole area. I am not here to speak on behalf of the insurers but my understanding from some insurance companies is that when they make what they call section 19 complaints on suspected insurance fraud, they are not yet being logged on PULSE. I have been told that by somebody anonymously. I cannot verify it one way or the other. I would be surprised by the low levels of fraud, as reported. The experience of our members is that fraud is a good deal more prevalent than the statistics indicate.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">May I clarify that for the benefit of the committee? The information is from the Minister for Justice and Equality. We have got the information from the Garda. The Minister says that in the period between 1 October 2018 and 28 February 2019, there were 19 incidents of insurance companies reporting insurance claim fraud as per the stated guidelines. An Garda Síochána has advised that crime counting rules have not been applied to these data. I refer to recording the data on PULSE. However, while they are not accounted for on PULSE, as should be the case so we can have ease of access, they represent the total number of claims reported by the insurance industry. In my view, that is concerning. Either they are not taking this seriously enough or there is another reason.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">I will deal with that point first. We have covered it on page 7 of our submission. There may be reluctance on the part of defendants, by which I mean policyholders, and insurance companies to invoke the fraudulent claim clause under section 26 of the 2004 Act. There is case law on this. We have quoted it on page 7. Mr. Justin Kevin Cross said that because, in his view, the 2004 Act is so pro-defendant, with which we have an issue in the first case, aggravated or exemplary damages is the only real deterrent to an irresponsible or, indeed, over-enthusiastic invocation of such a plea. In simple English, that means that if a defendant suggests in defending his or her claim that the claimant is making a fraudulent claim and does not succeed with that assertion, not alone will the plaintiff get damages but he or she can also get aggravated or exemplary damages. That is crimping a lot of activity in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> The Deputy implied that if awards came down, premiums might not. I will qualify his perspective very slightly for him. In our view, premiums absolutely will tumble, but in a competitive market only. We have CSO data on that. PIAB was established in 2003. The CSO tells us that, from peak to trough, the cost of motor insurance came down 41% in four years since PIAB's introduction. One should bear in mind that PIAB was not reducing awards in that period. It was paying out what the judges were paying out but doing so on the basis of payments of €45 being made to it. The motor insurance market is a competitive market and one is legally obliged to have insurance. Some of the problems the Deputy has heard about today concern those with a single underwriter. To qualify this, if awards are reduced in a robust, competitive market, premiums will fall, but only where there is more than one underwriter.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I gather that is being addressed by the Department of Justice and Equality. It is important to make this point and the Senator is absolutely right to raise it. What has constantly been the bulk of the issue as we see it is the level of awards made quite regularly over the past while for very minor injuries, or paracetamol injuries as they have been called. Typically, the type of case that goes to the Court of Appeal involves quite substantial injuries. I do not think anyone in this room would question the right of someone who has been seriously injured to get sufficient general damages to cover their pain and suffering. This is not the issue. The issue is at the bottom end of the scale for minor soft tissue injuries. It is important to note it is not just with regard to whiplash but extends throughout the scale. For example, if I bruise my thumb and there is no ligament damage, no breakage, a certain amount of swelling and a full recovery in a short period of time, at present the book of quantum entitles me to up to €21,200 for that injury. This is what is driving this issue from the insurer's point of view.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">It was last renewed in November 2016 and is due for renewal at the end of this year. Slow reform of this area will not work and will not cut it for the likes of Ms Murray and the clients of Mr. Monks. This is why after all of the analysis and reporting that has been done, the solution put forward by the Personal Injuries Commission was a judicial council. We have to accept there is solid advice behind this and so we have chosen to back it. Many of our members would suggest that asking a judicial council to reform quantum is like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop but we are well aware there are many very wise heads in the Judiciary, particularly at Court of Appeal and Supreme Court level. We are relying on them. First of all, we are relying on the Oireachtas to move quickly to pass the Bill.</p>

There are not a lot of figures out there on catastrophic damages but, interestingly, they suggest that Ireland's payouts in terms of those very serious injuries are not out of line internationally and may even be below international comparisons.

Whiplash awards are all below €21,000. The Circuit Court jurisdiction is up to €60,000 and, interestingly enough, we see all of the plaintiffs coming to the Circuit Court looking for €60,000. We have to start understanding what is driving the behaviour. They do not want to risk it in the High Court even though the High Court's jurisdiction is unlimited. We have a Circuit Court with a cap for €60,000, where all the action is happening. Very few people go to the High Court, although there are a few in-----</p>

The difficulty is that not alone are businesses not able to afford to appeal an award of the Circuit Court to the High Court, no insurer will even let them exercise an appeal to the Court of Appeal. It will not happen. Not alone this, and this is where I would like our former chairman to jump in, the issue of costs is being used to blackmail people into early settlement.

          <p eId="para_131">To illustrate the point, Mr. McDonnell did not write this report off the top of his head. He has worked closely with members. A short paragraph on page 7 of ISME's submission states its members advise it that one of the most important considerations before a case is defended in court is the name of the trial judge. It also states that if it is one of a small number of judges with pro-plaintiff renown, businesses will instruct counsel to settle, or counsel will instruct them to settle, irrespective of the merits and strength of the defence. I had an experience as an operator, again going back to the Circuit Court limit of €60,000, whereby, having won decisively a case in the Circuit Court in which the judge was scathing with respect to the plaintiff in summing up the case and awarding us costs and the case effectively, within a matter of days we received a phone call from the solicitor acting for the plaintiff. Committee members know what I am going to say. His words were that he needed to earn his fees out of this so he was going to appeal it to the High Court unless he was paid a certain amount of money. That cost me my excess. Why would I not want to go to the High Court to defend a case that I clearly won hands down? I go back to the paragraph I read from ISME's submission.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">That is a fair question. We do not really pay for people in wheelchairs or with catastrophic injuries and we need interaction with our health system to deal with that. One should not need to win the lottery if one is put in a wheelchair. Payment orders need to take over in such circumstances. In his second and final report, Nicholas Kearns said we were at 4.4 times the nearest jurisdiction, which itself is an international outlier. Without us, the UK is the worst for generosity and even if we were to use the UK as a benchmark, we would have to be at an absolute maximum of 23% of the current level at the lower end.</p>

Accordingly, we whittled it down to the three that are absolutely essential and the book of quantum is top of that list. It drives many other aspects of the issue, most of which have been outlined. It also tends to muddy the water in an area for which very little data are available and it precludes proper analysis.

We have had report after report, including substantial reports on which this committee worked, but it has not improved and we do not have the transparency we need. I was looking at the eighth progress update and it gave the impression that we are making progress. I cannot get my head around the CSO figures for motor claims because they do not relate to my what I know, particularly having spoken to many people about their experience in this regard. Contrary to the research I have done, the figures state that motor insurance has gone down by 23%. Do the witnesses have confidence that the information gathered by the CSO reflects what is actually happening?</p>

          <p eId="para_159">We have looked at this in quite a bit of detail. The CSO contacts insurers, who give quotes related to the type of policies the CSO wants to measure. It is not an ideal approach to putting together data in an area like insurance, which is so fraught with difficulties. The figures are better that they are for liability, where there are no data at all, but in the area of motor insurance the data being generated are for a specific type of premium. People, including those to whom the Senator has spoken, may not be in the category picked by the CSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Our experience is that younger drivers, drivers of older cars, and drivers of commercial vehicles are still getting hammered and are not experiencing reductions. A very specific area, which I suspect is comprised of standard families based somewhere outside Dublin, may find their premiums reducing at the moment but we do not think that is widespread. </p>
          <p eId="para_161"> One must take the good with the bad. Everyone was quite willing to use the 70% increase as a prompt for action in recent years. That was entirely valid at the time. While there is some validity in the figures and in the response to them, we are not at all convinced that the model being used cover all areas. </p>

          <p eId="para_165">Yes. Mr. Boland has spoken about how data are collected and how it appears from a motor perspective, I will refer to liability data that the CSO may or may not collect. I may be one of the random companies chosen so I am asked to fill in this form, the CSO annual services inquiry form, 2808B, annually. I have tried to put this on the agenda before but have failed so far. The form asks for the company's costs. One question is what is the firm's insurance cost as a global number. Say a firm's insurance premium is €10,000, within that there is a premium for motor, for assets, for property, a premium for employer liability, for public liability, consequential loss etc. The CSO should ask for a breakdown of the insurance figure as otherwise, the question is meaningless. Liability is the key number, it is the biggest cost in any premium. In the case of a manufacturing company, employer liability will be the most significant number. In a business where people are on the premises, public liability is the key number. If I was to be asked to give a breakdown of my insurance premium, if it was €10,000, I should be asked for my public liability premium. Then in another part of the form, to get the denominator for measuring the rate for public liability, one divides the premium into the sales figure. That can be compared internationally to see if Ireland is an outlier: we are. In the case of employer liability the actuarial formula is arrived at by dividing the premium into wages, which gives the rate. The CSO is not collecting these data. Either it does not understand the data or they do not want to collect them for whatever reason, maybe it does not think it is important. It is vitally important that we have the data.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The Alliance for Insurance Reform has its asks but ISME's approach is different. It reverts to Senator Kieran O'Donnell's question. There are three key issues of which the first is quantum. My colleague, Mr. McDonnell referred to several issues relating to legal reform, including reform of the courts and procedure. The final area is the need for transparent granular data. There is no one thing that will solve the problem, but those three things combined, if they are tackled simultaneously, will solve the problem. That is the answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">I need to answer the two Senators together because Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a simple question which we did not actually answer, which was whether quantum was the silver bullet. It is about 70% or 80% of the bullet. I will not refer to any individual business but I ask members to bear in mind that we need to reform how liability is assessed. Currently, if something occurs on a premises, there is not even consideration of negligence, the insurer effectively will simply ask the business "Did this happen on your premises, yes or no?" Last week, the papers reported a €30,000 settlement to a child in a city centre crèche where one child went into another with a tricycle. This happened several years ago and €30,000 was awarded where the child is fully recovered and has a 1 mm scar. Whether we think that is a good idea is a subjective assessment, however we might ask if that happened in a person's kitchen, and one child banged into another and gave a scar, should a payment of €30,000 arise? If the answer is no, then neither should it arise in a crèche or a play facility. We must get our heads around the fact that simply because something happens on a premises does not mean the owner of the premises is liable for it. We have a bonkers concept of what constitutes negligence and duty of care. We have spent a long time arguing that. Currently anyone who owns or operates a premises who goes before a court, most especially where children are concerned, loses before going in to the courtroom, irrespective of the merits of their case. That is an area that must be taken on.</p>

Also, where is the Garda insurance fraud unit? Those are the two key questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I am conscious that the committee does not have a direct line to the Law Society so I will concentrate on the insurance industry, into which it does have a direct line. We are well aware of the profits that have been declared in recent weeks. Given that it looks as though they were over-reserved in recent times, and that may have had quite an influence on the losses they declared, we suspect they will go into a period of very substantial profitability, as those reserves are released back into the profit and loss accounts. I would ask them a direct question, namely, what they will do in light of their improving financial situation, to help the policyholders of Ireland?</p>

It returns to Ms Murray's comments and what Ms Dorothea Dowling has been saying about the black hole and the amount of claims versus what is taken in. She had identified something like €2 billion black hole. The industry is running rings around this Government and around citizens and they will continue to do that until we force through the situation. The 25 days mentioned earlier keeps coming to mind. We need emergency legislation. We can pass legislation through on many other things, and we had weeks for Brexit legislation. For me, the job losses and the impact on society and communities and so on, this needs to be treated like emergency legislation.</p>

They do not even allow someone to try to shop around, even though there is not any shopping around to do. One is told they cannot look at one's new insurance premium until four weeks before the due date but I have yet to come across anybody who has been told what their premium will be at least a week before.</p>

If anything, the insurance industry is more systemically important because we cannot function without insurance. We are legally obliged to have a relationship with the insurance industry yet we cannot get the data. That case absolutely falls under that heading.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">Listening to the disaster that has fallen on the witnesses' business, essentially they are saying that insurance is strangling SMEs because it is unpredictable, expensive and who knows what will happen tomorrow in terms of whether it will be available. First, have they compared the North and the Republic in this regard? Are there processes in the North that we might examine in the sense of an all-Ireland approach, which might make it easier?</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Second, as somebody who goes occasionally to play centres with children which, as Ms Murray said, are popular now for children's parties, it could it be made clearer to people using them at the beginning in what effectively would be a disclaimer notice to the effect that they are using the premises at their own risk unless something very serious happens. Leaving aside the question of responsibility, as she and others said, accidents happen. That is the reason we pay insurance. However, could clear information be given on behalf of insurance companies, not the business, on how they approach it and that people are there effectively at their own risk unless something very serious happens?</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> The other aspect, which is often a contributory issue, is a person suffering relatively minor injuries. There is a series of 24-hour accident centres in the Dublin area, where one can get treatment. Would it be possible to develop a system where if somebody gets a bad bang, such as a suspected fracture, that could be addressed quite quickly? That requires disclosure as soon as possible, which is essential, but do the witnesses believe there are ways and means by which we can address that? At a local level,there are local enterprise offices. Could a package of information be put together for SMEs but also for the customer because, as a previous speaker said, many people do not make claims because they feel empathy with the business owner and they do not want to make a claim? However, sometimes, because of a lack of attention at the time, it develops into something bigger and then resentment, expectations and so on set in and it becomes a difficult road.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I thank Ms Murray and Mr. Boland for their contributions and I thank their association for all it is doing. The three big asks I am taking from the discussion is to get the Garda fraud unit set up as quickly as possible. Where are they with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, or the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy? Are they playing pass the parcel with each other? Is one saying it is not a matter for me, it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality and<i> vice versa</i> or is it all a matter for the Garda Commissioner?</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I refer to the book of quantum, which I have discussed previously with Mr. Boland. It is a statistical, historical database of what has happened and the only way it can change over time is by claims changing. Legislation cannot change the book of quantum but it can, as he suggests, cap the injury awards or whatever over time. The book of quantum is historical and statistical and it is compiled from the information available. Unfortunately, the premiums are as high as they are because the payouts from judges and the insurance system generally have been high. We need to focus on how we can reduce those claims. I do not doubt that everybody in their business is doing everything they can to minimise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> In the ten or 12 years of her business's existence, has Ms Murray physically changed the design of her premises, taken out certain climbing frames, slides or whatever? Twenty years ago I was involved with summer camps and people would tell us that we could not have step-ups and so on. We hear about children not being able to play or run in playgrounds and so on. I read about a claim yesterday where a table flipped over in the wind and, unfortunately, a three year old broke a nose. The award was €30,000 even though the nose healed perfectly. I am sure there was some trauma for the child but I am not sure about an award of €30,000 or where that figure come from. Does Ms Murray have comparative figures for insurance premiums for similar play centres in the UK, although it has a different claims environment?</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> Most people have said the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, is doing his bit but he is a lone voice in that regard. I met the Connacht publicans yesterday and I am conscious that the LVA is doing significant work and that the Vintners Federation of Ireland, VFI, is helping out as well. The biggest bone of contention the Connacht publicans had, bar the issue that arose recently in terms of the limits, is the cost of insurance generally, which is destroying their businesses. They are getting one or two customers a night in some venues but they are still paying large insurance premiums for very little return.</p>
          <p eId="para_194"> The FBD representatives are coming in next. Do the witnesses have any questions they would like members to put to them? We get many lawyers blaming the insurance industry and the insurance industry blaming the lawyers. I would like their thoughts on who is more at fault. I am sure all of them are at fault. I am throwing out the questions because we do not have much time for engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> The witnesses final big ask was in terms of their schedule about the reductions in the data availability. Since I joined this committee in 2016, we have been crying out for visibility on claims. They said the CSO and the Central Bank have more or less thrown out the idea of visibility on that. They might give their thoughts on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I will respect the time constraints and keep my contribution as short as possible. I watched Ms Murray's contribution in my office while I was doing other work and it was very sad because she was a person who was full of enthusiasm and had built up a business.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">The emotion struck me. All we can do is tell people to keep going and not to let others put them down. It is important to say that because people become frustrated and opt out of business. It has happened in my own area. </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Mr. Boland spoke about the slow pace of reform. When I first came into the Dáil following my election in 2016 I heard the Chairman making a very strong case for businesses in his own constituency in the context of insurance costs having risen by 100%. Last year RGDATA told us that shop insurance had increased in many cases from €10,000 to €100,000. Restaurant insurance has gone up by almost 50%. The Chairman has heard me talk previously about the case of an hotel in my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway that was facing closure but a very innovative family took it over, maintaining the employment of 25 people. The family looked at the insurance cover which was very low at the time, amounting to €12,500. A review was conducted four years ago and the family was advised that the proper cover would bring their costs up to around €25,000. Today, their insurance costs are almost €50,000 per annum. This really frustrates me because there were only two small claims against the hotel in the period. One was to the value of €2,500 and the other was €1,500. I ask the representatives of the insurance business here today to explain to me how that is possible. In the context of such small claims, there appears to me to be no justification for that level of premium increase. The Government's competitive watchdog, the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, said in 2016 that the biggest issue facing small business was the increase in insurance costs. Three years later and many businesses are barely holding on. These insurance costs will crucify more businesses if we do not make progress quickly. </p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell asked a number of pertinent questions on the book of quantum. When the reform of the book of quantum takes place - and the work of the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy in this regard must be acknowledged - can the insurance industry representatives assure us that insurance costs will fall? I will give the witnesses another example of the problems here. I know of a haulage company that has secured insurance abroad and I wonder if that is totally safe. One haulier had to take out insurance abroad. He has 15 trucks and at one point his insurance was costing €70,000. In one year, it increased to €130,000, even though there were no claims against his business. His insurance increased by almost 100%. In terms of the costs of running a small business usually wages, raw materials and energy costs outstrip other costs but now, in many cases, insurance is outstripping even these costs. That is not sustainable. </p>

          <p eId="para_200">I welcome the delegations. We had lots of different groups in here, including road hauliers, insurance companies and legal professionals when we were preparing our report on insurance costs. Nobody was to blame, according to those with whom we engaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> ISME apportions a lot of blame to the Judiciary. It argues that a substantial minority of our Judiciary is excessively, unfairly and unjustly pro-plaintiff. ISME was not surprised to see the same High Court justice, who ironically oversees the personal injury list in the High Court, mount a stout defence of the current personal injuries system in the press, suggesting that awards for general damages have fallen in real terms since the 1970s. ISME suggests that this committee should understand that while it does not expect the law to be on its side, it does expect it to be blind. ISME members have advised the organisation that one of the most important considerations before they decide to defend a case in court is the name of the trial judge. If it is one of a small number of judges with a pro-plaintiff reputation, they will instruct their counsel to settle, irrespective of the merits or strengths of their defence. ISME argues that this is an appalling indictment of our Judiciary and I agree. The statement from ISME is unbelievable but the representatives here today stand over it. It is a sad state of affairs, in my view.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> We have all come across cases such as those outlined by previous contributors and we understand the issues relating to the book of quantum and so forth. Mr. Boland said that it was clear to his organisation that the dead hand of vested interests and the lack of sufficient political will are grinding the response to the crisis to a halt. In that context, he is blaming the political system, as well as the Judiciary and vested interests. I ask him to outline to us what we, as politicians, can do. We believe there is very little more than we can do. We are already exerting pressure wherever we can. </p>

I used the example of the last time we had a crisis in this area in 2002 and 2003, when all of the legislation and actions to address it were done and dusted within two and a half years. We are nowhere near that timeframe this time around. In very practical terms, what politicians can do to speed things up is get the Judicial Council Bill through the Houses as quickly as possible. They can also exert political pressure to get the Garda insurance fraud unit up and running and this committee can hold the insurers to account in terms of what they are going to do to make sure that premiums go down.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I would respond to Deputy Eugene Murphy's question on the book of quantum by going back to what the Minister and the insurance industry have said constantly, namely, that claims drive costs. That is the insurance industry's analysis of this problem so if the book of quantum can be resolved, that sorts the claims issue. Certainly from our point of view, we would then regard the insurance industry as being under an obligation to respond with reduced insurance costs. The Deputy's story about the hotel is one which is very familiar. What happened there is happening all over the country. In terms of why it happens, we are mystified and it is absolutely a question for the insurers.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> In response to Senator Horkan, as I understand it an announcement on the Garda insurance fraud unit is imminent. We would ask why it has taken so long to get to this point because it is our understanding that An Garda Síochána has been ready internally for this for quite some time. We are awaiting a decision on that but there is an opportunity to apply political pressure. We are told that it is a decision for An Garda Síochána but surely the Government has a role to play in terms of expressing the desire of the State to have a Garda insurance fraud unit in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> As the legislation currently stands, the book of quantum can only be revised through the history of awards over the previous two to three years. However, the Judicial Council Bill will give the power to reduce downwards, regardless of awards history. That is what we are expecting the Judiciary to do; we need judges to step up to the mark on behalf of society. In terms of health and safety, I would suggest that this country is the health and safety nation Our colleagues from Europe and further afield are gobsmacked at the level to which health and safety is acknowledged and enforced in this country. It is time for the insurers to respect that in terms of the premiums being paid. </p>
          <p eId="para_208">The national claims information database is a partial solution to transparency. When the first report is released towards the end of this year, I suspect that it will be very unsatisfactory because it will be a first look, it will refer only to motor insurance, and there are no firm plans to examine liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> To respond to the question on insurers, I reiterate that FBD and the broader insurance industry should be asked what they will do for policyholders in the light of the improvement in their financial position and the forecast additional improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Deputy Burton referred to Northern Ireland. I suspect that the UK, and Northern Ireland in particular, has its own problems in this area. While the UK is by no means the ideal, as Mr. McDonnell noted, it is regarded by the rest of Europe as an insurance outlier. I would not, therefore, necessarily consider Northern Ireland to be a role model in this area, not least because there may be complications arising from Brexit. I would prefer if we got our own house in order at this stage and there is a fairly well-defined roadmap in that regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_211"> On healthcare and early intervention on injuries, much has been done to try to achieve that but the problem is being caused by general damages, which are paid for pain and suffering, rather than special damages, which cover medical care and loss of earnings. The general damage for the pain and suffering of the original incident is the problem, which is why the solutions we have proposed are in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">To respond to some of Deputy Burton's points, all our businesses, with the exception of perhaps one or two, have a disclaimer for people to sign. Unfortunately, however, when an accident happens to a minor, disclaimers are not worth the paper on which they are written. We would welcome a change in the duty of care to the effect that when someone is on the premises of a business whose owner is not negligent, a disclaimer will stand. Nobody is questioning anything about where negligence has occurred. It would be ideal if a disclaimer stood for something but, unfortunately, it does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> On the 24-hour accident care, we would all welcome it but one is afraid of one's life of suggesting paying for that or even giving the child a Smyths voucher if he or she has sustained an injury. Insurance companies will say it amounts to an admission of liability if there is an offer of something. Nevertheless, many businesses will offer something such as vouchers where something has happened that is not the business's fault, although one can still end up being sued even after offering something like that. Being able to pay for medical expenses, as is the case in Scandinavia, would be great.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Senator Horkan spoke about similar premiums in the UK. I am not sure whether he was present earlier when I mentioned that one of our members paid £1,500 in the UK to have his trains insured there. To have them insured in Ireland, however, he had to pay €33,000 through the same company in the UK, which illustrates the difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> On FBD, I challenge it to insure us as a group. I stated we have €5 million in premiums and €1 million in claims and reserves. I would love, therefore, if FBD was asked why it will not insure us.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Finally, I thank Deputy Eugene Murphy for his kind words. I will not give up without a fight.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I will provide some brief, rapid-fire responses. On what the committee should ask the insurers, we would specifically ask whether solvency requirements are driving higher reserves, profits and premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> On Senator Paddy Burke's question, it is not only we who stand over what we stated on page 3 in respect of our legal system. The dogs in the street, the European Commission, the OECD, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission have stated the Legal Service Regulatory Authority is a waste time which has not delivered for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Deputy Burton asked about the notion of having clinics. Not only would that not make a difference but I have received reports from industry to suggest that a number of GPs will, in exchange for €150, produce a report to allow the patient to approach PIAB. Unfortunately, therefore, a number of medical professionals are now part of the problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">Most of the points have been covered, although Senator Horkan asked about health and safety. I turn to appendix 4 on page 15 of the ISME document, in case there is any doubt about the rates of accident per 1,000. In 1997, the rate per 1,000 was 6.63 but that has dropped to 2.58. There is no causality with anything we are doing wrong in health and safety. There has been massive improvement.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I thank all our guests for joining us and giving their view on the market and what needs to be done. In particular, I thank Ms Murray, who put a human face on the issues. The committee cannot be accused of kicking the can down the road. We have prioritised, debated and written a report on the matter. None of the guests addressed the question I asked about what they did about continually lobbying the Minister or the Government. If any change to the situation is to occur, it will be through Government action. We will keep the Government on notice of the action that is required and contained in our report. I will not single out the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, but the Government is the driver in this regard and it is required to implement the 60 or 70 recommendations we put before it. If there was action on those recommendations, the witnesses would not be appearing before the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Hauliers, co-operatives and many other industries in business have appeared before us. I have met all of them, as well as vintners, throughout the country. Every one of them is complaining. I reject some of the commentary that was made on the reduction in motor insurance, for example. I have yet to meet anyone whose premium has been reduced. Given what is happening and how the Government functions, it is important that businesses engage directly and robustly with the Government. Mr. Boland stated politicians are too busy but they are never too busy. They are paid to be busy. Being busy is one matter but making that business work for the people we represent is another. It is not working, however, and we need to cut through the fog and deal directly with the people who obstruct the course of the reform that is needed in the insurance business. That lies at the feet of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Mr. Boland referred to the Judiciary and lawyers. As they have been mentioned, they are quite welcome to attend a future committee meeting in the light of the commentary and make any submission they wish to. They might wish to appear before us to defend their position or comment on what was said. Until now, the description of a cartel in operation has been used. People in the insurance world are hard nosed. The insurance world encompasses the Judiciary, lawyers and much more. They are taking advantage of the utter shambles that this has become. As a result, small businesses throughout the country and individuals such as Ms Murray are being penalised and made to pay more and more, but we do not know for what.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> Deputy Eugene Murphy asked businesses not to give up. I assure all our guests that we will not give up. Our work will be to ensure that can is kicked no further down the road. I thank the witnesses once again for their attendance.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_140">
          <from> Mr. Jackie McMahon<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_229">FBD Insurance is the only indigenous insurer. We are part of and embedded in the community, with 34 branches in cities and towns throughout the country. Insuring farms and small businesses is our business. They are critically important to us and represent 85% of our premium. It is our job to be there when things go wrong. We have a proud and long tradition, spanning more than 50 years, of paying claims and of being there when things go wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> From 2014 to 2016, FBD Insurance was making a loss. It is in our customers' interest that we have stabilised and returned to making profit. In order to stand by our customers and pay our claims, we must be stable and profitable. We stabilised matters by taking a raft of measures, including charging our customers more. The cost of insurance is too high. It is affecting our customers' ability to do business and that affects us. A great deal has happened in the attempt to address the cost of insurance, but not enough has changed. With the permission of the committee, I will share FBD Insurance's insights into why this is the case and what must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> First, I will summarise what is causing the high cost of insurance. In essence, Ireland has too many claims and those claims are costing too much. People are too willing to make a claim and advisers are too willing to encourage them. Compensation payouts are simply too generous and the cost of getting to a payout decision is too high. To address the root cost of the high cost of insurance, all roads lead to our legal system. The legal system dictates the level of award. It sets the market price that determines the level of our awards, both in and out of court, and the system creates a vicious cycle. High payouts with no downside encourage claimants and high legal fees encourage certain solicitors and barristers to take and make the case. The legal system is difficult to reform and resistant to change and practitioners have little to gain and, perhaps, much to lose.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> I would go further. FBD Insurance does not recognise our legal system as the root cause of the problem. We do not have the capability, or at least we have not demonstrated the capability, to fundamentally reform the system. Litigation is always expensive. I will share how costs spiral as a consequence of this system. Take the example of a soft tissue injury from a low impact collision, meaning there was little or no damage to the car. The occupant has a sore neck. Bear in mind that soft tissue injuries comprise approximately 80% of our motor claims. It is the type of injury that some jurisdictions do not recognise or for which they do not pay or pay very little. Normally, it will take three years and up to five years from the date of the accident until the case is heard. The Injuries Board will assess the injury 12 to 18 months after the accident based on a medical report that gives a six month forward prognosis but the majority of claimants will continue to report pain right up their day in court, three to five years after the accident. The judge will make an award for the same injury based on three to five years of reported pain. Court awards, determined later than the Injuries Board, are higher and costs are significantly higher. The key insight is that the level of award is based on the length of time the complainant is complaining of the pain as opposed to the amount of pain the complainant feels. Compensation is more a function of time than of suffering. There is a major incentive, therefore, to bring a claim to litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> FBD Insurance has previously stated what it believes must be prioritised. Our key recommendations remain outstanding or are work in progress. We should lower the level of awards. Why do we pay four to five times more than what the UK is already trying to reduce? We must recalibrate claimants' expectations. The proposed judicial council and its proposed redrafting of the book of quantum can be the vehicle, but awards and soft tissue awards in particular must be significantly and consistently lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> FBD Insurance also believes that we must cap awards, implement what one might call a front stop on the legal system's generosity. We need a standardised objective approach to assessing whiplash, a measure of pain that is not linked to the time it takes to settle the claim. There must be a more efficient process up to and in litigation. The vast majority of soft tissue injuries should be finalised in the Injuries Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> Insurance companies must be more transparent and publish premium levels. They must work harder on fraud. We need help to be allowed to share data. Finally, we must establish a dedicated insurance fraud investigation unit with An Garda Síochána. In a nutshell, we must build momentum and drive home meaningful reform of the legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The chief executive officer of FBD Insurance, Ms Fiona Muldoon, has said that Irish society can have either high injury awards or cheap insurance, but not both. As legislators, the members of the committee have the sole ability to help deliver what is to the greater benefit for most in our society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerryHorkan" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Senator Gerry Horkan<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_237">That was a robust presentation outlining the company's presence in the market. It is welcome that we have at least one indigenous motor insurer. It is, perhaps, a reflection on the Irish insurance market that we only have one surviving indigenous operator and a number of multinationals. There are probably much fewer participants in the market now than was the case previously. Much of that goes back to transparency, and representatives of Insurance Ireland have appeared before the committee, in terms of the databases and the data that exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> From our point of view it is very difficult to see what is happening. We see many claims being settled. Mr. McMahon spoke about fighting fraud. What percentage of claims FBD Insurance receives in all categories, but particularly motor insurance and public liability, are rejected? How many are fought and lost? Obviously, many cases are legitimate. They are what they are and there is fault. I do not know if Mr. McMahon saw the earlier session with members of the Alliance for Insurance Reform and ISME. Various people were here. The Alliance for Insurance Reform represents restaurants, publicans, small businesses and many people. I am sure Mr. McMahon has engaged with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> There was a particular focus this morning on play centres, the play centre industry and the broader play centre activity park and the like. Our guests at the earlier session stated that their industry has paid money to insurers. It was not FBD Insurance because they stated that most of their business has to refer to the UK because nobody here will insure them. They have paid in €5 million. There are reserves of €800,000 against claims and only €200,000 has been paid out in the last five years. By any measure, it appears to be a profitable industry. Why will FBD Insurance not consider that, or will it? There are play centres, activity centres, places for people to go for birthday parties and places for children's activities closing down in many towns. One lady is in Navan and has the only one left, but she will have to close after 12 years in business. She has seen her insurance premiums rocket. Mr. McMahon might have heard a discussion on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" yesterday morning about play centres. Other people said their insurance premiums have gone from very small amounts to multiples of those. In one case it went from €6,000 to over €200,000. Phenomenal increases were mentioned, and I only heard a small part of the interview.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> There is an existential crisis here for many industries. Representatives of marts appeared before the committee, and I am sure Mr. McMahon is very familiar with marts. It appears that this is the most health and safety conscious country in the world and certainly in the EU. If one goes to Brussels, Paris or elsewhere, there are holes in the ground and no fencing around them but if people fall into them it is their own fault. We seem to have put great emphasis on this. I am aware of a school that had no claims but its insurance bill increased from €27,000 to €34,000 on the basis that it was in a scheme and the scheme had ended. It was more or less a case of "You were getting it on the cheap for the last few years and we are going to ramp it up at the end of the term that was agreed".</p>
          <p eId="para_241">We have a problem with insurance. I do not think the industry is doing enough to fight fraud. I am not referring to our guests in particular and I would like to hear any figures they have on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I also have a question about solvency. Is fraud leading to higher reserves? Are higher reserves causing higher premiums, profits and payouts? What would our guests do if they were on in our position? It is all very well to state that we want lower premiums, etc., but what three things would our guests would do if they were legislators and what requests would they make?</p>

          <p eId="para_243">The Senator is touching on many of the fundamental issues. As a company that is insuring businesses in the community, FBD certainly wants to be there for those businesses. They are important to us and to our own business. We want to right that premium. We need to right that business at a profit and we need to be profitable. While there are many different adjuncts to what is quite a complex issue, it all boils down to the fact too many people are making claims. I put claims into two brackets with fraud at one side. There are people who have genuinely suffered loss and that is what we are in the business for, it is why customers pay the premium, we are there for them and that is what our business is about. We have a long tradition of being there for our customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> There is another group of claimants who have suffered very little, if any, loss or injury as a reasonable person would understand those terms. The problem is that group, which is quite significant, can easily make a claim and receive very high compensation payouts at no risk to them while, at the same time, generating significant fees and incomes for the people bringing those claims on their behalf.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">Does Mr. McMahon have a percentage for such claims? He stated that there is a significant number of them, but is it 10% or 45%? There are payouts to people who have suffered losses and legitimately claimed for them. There is a percentage amount for fraud, exaggeration and payouts for people who broke a fingernail or whatever, and then there are real claims. Has Mr. McMahon a breakdown of what he suspects the figures are?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_144">
          <from> Mr. Jackie McMahon<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_246">Within that breakdown, there are also questions about how severe were the injuries and loss and what is an appropriate compensation for a case of that severity. We could argue a subjective point here. Someone could claim they have pain in their neck because they say they have. He or she tells a doctor about the pain and that doctor states that this person has pain in his or her neck. The doctor then provides a medical report which states that the person has pain in his or neck and which is presented during a court case. We value that, in Ireland, starting at approximately €15,000, with an average of €20,000, compared to the UK where the figures are between £300 and £3,000. It is a question of the magnitude and severity of the injury and the rewards that are granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> There are tables of rates for different firms that outline the level of compensation a claimant is likely to get for various types of injuries. Those are well publicised in many different quarters. They are well out of step with our international benchmarking and the Personal Injuries Commission has proven that. We are way out of step with international norms. The problem is that significant costs are generated because awards are higher. For every €10,000 we pay in litigation, we pay another €4,000 in legal expenses. It is higher than what they are getting pre-litigation.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">Does the industry share that information? Does FBD identify people who have made multiple claims, regardless of whether they are awkward and accident prone or otherwise? There must be people in the industry of whom fraud is suspected and with whom all of the companies have experience. Are insurers sharing that information and those names with each other?</p>

          <p eId="para_257">This is one of the difficulties with which we would like some help. The protocols we have established around the sharing of data contain strict criteria regulating when we can share data with other insurers. For example, if a person has previously made a claim and is claiming a similar injury of the same class as the last one they made, for example a sore neck as a result of an accident, we cannot share the previous medical reports with another insurer. We would have to go to court and issue-----</p>

Other Bills have taken much longer in the Seanad but this one was all done in a single session. We extended sitting times on a Tuesday night and there were only two votes on 79 amendments. The legislation passed Committee Stage and only Report and Final Stages remain to be completed. It will then go to the Dáil.

There would not be as many people applying for compensation if whiplash claims were resulting in awards of €1,500 rather than €15,000 or €25,000. The point has been made that if one tries to rob a bank and one is caught, one will possibly go to jail and have a criminal record. What happens to a person who is found to be making a fraudulent claim? What does FBD do with such claims? Does it send all of the details to the Garda fraud squad? Are people who make fraudulent claims essentially told that they have been unlucky and asked to come back again the following week?</p>

          <p eId="para_272">The Senator is probably not far off on that. Some 80% of the count - or the number of claims we get in - are soft tissue injuries.

          <p eId="para_273">That is what insurance is for and no one in this committee is trying to dispute that. If a person is in a car accident more often than not there is more than one side to the accident but usually one side is more at fault than the other. Nobody is disputing proper claims but what if a certain number of people come along and say "My car got a tip and now I have mental trauma, anxiety and my children are not able to sleep"? We have had months of this before the committee previously when Insurance Ireland was here telling us this. What can be done with regard to the motor insurance market? We could blame whiplash but I would prefer if it was to European norms or less. With technology, telemetry and so on one could have black boxes in cars, dash cams, web access and information about speed limits and performance going into the cloud. It is all there. What efforts does the industry make to monitor the premium holder's behaviour in his or her car so if the driver is on the mobile phone or texting he or she will be caught by a camera in the car? Has the industry explored any of those options?</p>

          <p eId="para_274">The Senator has raised a couple of issues. When one considers all our claims and expenses over premium, with our overall combined ratio in insurance we make a margin of approximately 10%. We are a business and we feel this is a modest and fair return for the service we give.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> The Senator mentioned dash cams. The current legislation around GDPR does not allow us to use some of the data that dash cams actually track, unless we have the explicit authorisation from the other person who has been recorded on the dash cam footage. Legislation could help us to improve our ability to get the correct data to allow us to proactively challenge or pay out fairly on claims.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">That goes somewhere to answering the question I asked: if you were us what would you do. Is any technology in place to look at the behaviour of the person who pays the premium to FBD, for example, a camera within the car monitoring the driver's behaviour, seeing if he or she is texting or taking calls, and keeping track of the speed limit?</p>

          <p eId="para_277">I am not saying it is not a good example. In Italy they have moved to a situation where telematics are fitted in all cars and the system there does not allow soft tissue injury claims outside of a certain G force collision of the car. Fundamentally, we in Ireland are just too generous in our court awards. It is a very subjective decision to say what is the real cost of the pain and suffering when a person says they have pain and suffering, especially around soft tissue injuries. I shall colour this with one example from some weeks ago. Two cars had the wing mirrors on both vehicles damaged. The wing mirrors hit as the cars went by each other. The claimant lost no time from work but his overall complaints were alleged anxiety, sleep disturbance and palpitations. Our cardiologist gave him a clean bill of health. We ran the case on the basis of minimal impact, no complaints made at the scene and that he continued to work normally since and did not seek any medical attention until six weeks afterwards. We thought his complaints were unreasonable on the basis on the facts of the accident. The case ran before the courts. A psychiatrist was called by the plaintiff who supported his evidence and he was awarded €22,500.</p>

          <p eId="para_281">I will give two or three more examples around the key point of time. The length of time can determine the costs not the severity of the pain. This is the key insight I can bring. For example, we had a claimant who suffered neck and upper back injuries. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, awarded €14,700 at 12 months after the accident based on a medical examination that the plaintiff would recover within 16 months of the accident. The case went to trial and 4.8 years later - the claimant alleging ongoing complaint - the judge awarded him €33,000, and costs were set at €16,700.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Another case of soft tissue injury to neck and shoulder, for example, was awarded €9,900 by PIAB one year and ten months after the accident. In his report the claimant's own GP expressed the view that she was 100% recovered six months after the accident. The case went to court and the judge awarded €33,700. The claimant was alleging ongoing complaints and stated that she did not agree with her own GP's first report.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> A case that was not a soft tissue injury was a claimant who suffered scarring to the lower leg and post-traumatic stress after being bitten by a dog. PIAB made an award one year and 11 months after the accident for €78,600. The case went to trial in the High Court two years and eight months after the accident and the claimant was awarded €103,000, and legals costs of €41,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> We can talk about a lot of aspects on the margins and on the periphery of insurance costs, but a key point and the fundamental issue is that the legal system is too generous. It is too generous by a factor of five timeS, especially on soft tissue injuries, which is where the real problem is. It is incentivised because a dragged out, long and slow process generates significant legal costs. At the end of the day the claimant wins because he or she gets a higher award and the lawyers win because they get significant fees. Businesses, consumers and those who pay insurance lose. Ultimately society loses. Everything else helps with the margins but that is the significant issue that needs to be addressed. We need to use that to change what is fundamentally a very high claims culture in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">Okay. With many claims that are paid, there is little or no evidence that any injuries were caused or sustained on mart premises but the insurance company has settled. Mart managers are very unhappy about 80% of those settled claims. Why are the claims being settled?</p>

          <p eId="para_316">In the first instance, we put much time and effort into investigating a claim. In that we want to understand whether the customer is on cover and if liability is an issue. In other words, we consider whether we are at fault within the claim. If investigations indicate the customer is on cover and there is liability, we would be in a position of trying to value the scale of the injury. My core point is that those scales are essentially set as a market rate by the courts. What we are trying to do that is absolutely in our customers' interests and favour is to pay the claim without having to pay the significant cost to bring it through the legal system, which has a two-fold impact. The first is that when the length of time the injury is suffered is greatest, the compensation may be significantly higher, and we would also incur costs. It is absolutely in our interests to settle the claim at a fair price. It is also in the claimant's interest to settle that in a speedy manner. If it is in that zone, we will try to settle the matter. If it is not, we will fight it absolutely.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">The witness is right in that sense. If the mart is not negligent and there is no evidence to back up the claim, why are the claims being paid in the name of the marts?

          <p eId="para_318">I have much sympathy for the marts and that perspective on liability. The difficulty is the Senator's or my interpretation of liability, what constitutes an injury and what the courts will ultimately declare as liability and injury could be worlds apart. To balance that, we have seen some horrific accidents within marts. We are working hard with mart owners to address this matter but, fundamentally, as patrons are in gantries with animals, there is much potential for them to be caught in gantries. We have seen many examples where that is the case. I certainly would like to leave the Senator in no doubt that we will pay where we think it is right at what we believe to be market rate, although the market rate is way too high. If we are not happy it is right and we have a strong case, we will absolutely fight that case. I would not like the Senator to have any doubt about that. I speak for FBD and we will fight the cases.</p>

I am absolutely making that clear from the start and it is driving the cost of insurance. We could tell the customer that we are paying €25,000 on the basis of an injury and he or she might say "no way, that is ridiculous". We could then ask them about a hypothetical offer of €25,000 plus 40% of that in costs to run it. Would they accept that?</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Of course not. It would be too much risk, given the cost of the bill and of running the case, the fact that the size of the compensation can increase, and the courts' interpretation of what is "fault" and the severity of injury under the law of the land.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">There is a perception out there that, up to a couple of years ago, insurance companies were going head to head in a competitive market.

          <p eId="para_333"> We have been asked to put a direct question to the insurance companies. They are now beginning to show significant profits, yet their rates are not decreasing in any way. Their reserves and profits are increasing, but their premiums are not decreasing accordingly. We are being told anecdotally that they are provisioning to put a reserve bank in place. The insurance companies blame the legal profession and legal costs. Solicitors and barristers blame the insurance companies. The only person who appears to be getting a raw deal is the consumer. We are here as public representatives. When the legal profession and insurers appear before us, it is a case of <i>déjà vu</i> and we never seem to get to what is really happening.

          <p eId="para_334">I will put the profits in context. Some €50 million, or €43 million after tax, sounds like a great deal of money. Our investors are taking a risk because we target low double-digit returns on equity. The €50 million figure equates to a 15% return. That was a little above what we targeted in 2018. We need our profits for the providers of capital, who demand and are entitled to a return on their capital. They are investors in the company. For the type of risk they are taking, low double-digit returns are not exorbitant. It is what the markets expect and it is what we are expected to deliver on their behalf. It is a highly competitive industry and there is no question of FBD making any kind of supernormal profit. We are making an adequate return, which we need to pay our future claims, remain financially sound and stable, continue investing in the customer, and give stability to our customers through the cycles. From FBD's perspective, the profits are not exorbitant.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">That is what we need to find out. From the committee's discussion this morning, I believe that the minimum payout for whiplash is €21,000. I am going by memory. Maybe the Chairman will correct me, but I believe that was the figure. If it decreases to €10,000 and FBD sees a 50% reduction in payouts under the book of quantum across a range of areas, will I see a 50% reduction in my premium?</p>

          <p eId="para_383">I would like to welcome our guests as well. I will be relatively brief. I refer to the Judiciary's interpretation of the book of quantum. The fundamental point is that it cannot be too loose. If there is still a significant degree of discretion I am not sure we will solve anything. If the judge merely has to have regard to the new guidelines it is a waste of time. The application has to be much tighter than that. We will have to watch that very carefully in the course of the legislation, otherwise we will not make the progress we want.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> On the overall financial performance, I take Mr. McMahon's point that insurance companies have to be profitable. It is a risk-based business. I was looking at the annual figures. Profit before tax of €50 million equates to a 15% return on equities. The gross written premium is €372 million. Profit before tax is therefore about 13% of the premium. Is that typical of what the market would expect FBD Insurance to deliver as a public limited company, PLC? FBD Insurance has investors. I am not sure what the profile of its shareholders is. I assume there are significant institutional shareholders among them. Is that typical of what would be expected? If that figure was 20%, 30% or more would the witnesses accept it was too high? I appreciate that it is not at that level now. </p>
          <p eId="para_385"><b>Mr. Jackie McMahon:</b> That is what the investors expect. That is what we target on their behalf. They invest on that basis. I can certainly understand the concern but I would just like to say that as an insurance company and a PLC our accounts are open. They are published and audited. We are the only insurance company in Ireland whose accounts are available. The rest are folded into their parents in the UK or elsewhere. To give some comfort to members of the committee I note that we are in a very competitive market. People and investors need a return but we also need to grow our business. It is basic economics. If the profits increase excessively, sellers will want to sell more as a result. This drives prices down and profits return to a normal level. Those are the forces of the market within which we operate. Competition is sometimes quite brutal but the free market will ensure that we continue to make a normal profit. </p>

          <p eId="para_391"> I refer to farm accidents and the tragedy of farm fatalities. The number of fatalities was 17 last year, down from 24 in 2017. That is a very large number of people dying on farms, which is an awful tragedy. There are many more accidents that do not involve fatalities but do involve serious injuries. What is the overall picture? What is the trend concerning farm safety and the number of accidents on Irish farms? Is the trend going in the right direction? With all the work that the Health and Safety Authority, insurers like FBD Insurance and farm organisations are doing to raise the profile of farm safety, is progress being made? Those figures are still worrying.</p>

We invest a lot of money in promoting farm safety across all our books of business through our local branch network. We can never do enough, but we will continue to invest in it. We go to marts and onto farms to talk about farm safety. We are hugely supportive of any initiative that will help our customer base and reduce fatalities. For us, one fatality is too many.</p>

I wish to echo the Mr. Cahalan's points about the accidents themselves. Some of the cases that cross my desk are absolutely horrific. So much pain, damage and suffering is inflicted on people. We are working hard with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, and with our people on the ground to give the best advice possible.

          <p eId="para_398">I am not sure if Mr. McMahon heard any of the testimony during the previous session. Linda Murray, who owns a play centre in Navan, spoke passionately about her difficulties. It is 25 days away from potential closure. She cannot get a quote for renewal. It is symptomatic of wider problems, especially in businesses where there is public footfall. Where does Mr. McMahon apportion ultimate responsibility? He says that claims are too high and that judges are too generous. He has been critical of the role of some in the legal profession. Where does responsibility lie? Does all of this come back to claims and rewards, and the lack of follow-through for fraudulent claims? There seem to be no prosecutions or convictions, so there is no deterrent or consequence if a person takes a bogus claim and it does not work out, since he or she can try again with somebody else. Where does responsibility lie with regard to the insurance industry and payouts, as FBD Insurance sees it?</p>

          <p eId="para_399">It is a difficult area and my hopes sit with this committee and the Legislature. I appreciate that the legal system as we currently have it is insulated by layers of legislation. I also appreciate that it is protected to some extent with the separation of powers. This is not new. We have tried to address legal costs outside of insurance and injury. We have a system that has created a culture that is highly litigious and which is very beneficial for claimants and the people who are making those claims. That needs to be addressed. The challenge is how to address it given those layers of legislation and the separation of powers.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">I am grateful to the Chair for the opportunity to contribute. I am not a member of this committee but I have a fierce interest in it. I also have a Bill going through the Seanad that passed Second Stage. There are questions about it but its purpose is to cap awards in the courts. I have done a fair bit of research. I think I might have been speaking with Mr. Cahalan regarding this. The problem is fourfold. We all pay insurance levies and up to 7% of a premium is a levy. That is related to Quinn Insurance and all those insurance companies that failed. Profits are also part of the problem. People have spoken about excessive profits. I am not anti-profit but there is a problem when they are excessive. Fraudulent and over-exaggerated claims are a problem. Insurance companies are not doing enough to go after fraudulent claims. We as legislators have to do something with regard to people who bring fraudulent claims that are thrown out in court. We should pursue them through the courts for making fraudulent claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> The issue that is key for me is the awards. I agree that the rewards are excessive. They are four and a half times more than in the UK and way out of sync with Europe. The awards are high across the board, especially for soft tissue injuries. People have mentioned changing the book of quantum, which has been highlighted here. It is not a matter of changing the book of quantum but changing what the judge's award. I will not go on too much about it but I will ask Mr. McMahon two questions. If his company is defending a claim and judge A or judge B is hearing it, and it knows that judge A will make an excessive award while judge B will give a reasonable award, does it settle before it goes into the courts if it knows that judge A will make an excessive award? If judge B is taking the case, who will make a reasonable award, does the company let it go through the courts? Is that a fair assessment?</p>

          <p eId="para_405">When we have a strong case, we will fight that case regardless of which judge is involved. There is variability between different awards and relating to decisions on liability. Ultimately, it is down to a set of facts on both sides and cases on both sides, and how somebody interprets both cases. There will always be a level of variability.</p>

          <p eId="para_409">I would not say that there is no consistency. An interesting point is that there is significant variability, especially in the Circuit Court, with regard to the level of costs awarded by the court registrars. It is not understood why.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">Irrespective of what we do with the book of quantum, judges do not have to adhere to it. The issue is more about the awards judges are making. Did Mr. McMahon ever feel that we should name the judges who are making excessive awards above the norm for similar injuries? Should they be called out? If judges make excessive awards, it impacts on all of us who pay for insurance premiums.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">It is not for me to comment on but we have more recently had some good judges in the Court of Appeal. That is one way of calling it out but it is a lengthy and expensive process for us to appeal something. We have had some good judgments from the Court of Appeal relating to people taking reasonable care of themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">Most of the claims are at the lower end of the book of quantum. More than 90% of claims going through PIAB are for less than €50,000 and they cause all the problems.</p>

          <from>Senator Aidan Davitt<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_418">I have considerable experience in the insurance industry. It is very easy to kick the industry. Given what has happened with PMPA and Quinn Insurance, Ireland has not had a great track record with Irish-owned insurance companies. We need to be mindful of that. If FBD were not in the insurance market in Ireland, we would be totally at the mercy of the German, British and French insurance companies. People might like to bash them, but FBD is an Irish-owned company listed on the Irish Stock Exchange which provides many jobs here. Many of its competitors are totally Internet based and provide few, if any, jobs in Ireland. It is good to have an Irish-owned company that has a face. FBD has an extensive operation in my town, Mullingar, including an extensive call centre. As members will be aware, many call centres are not based in Ireland, the staff are not Irish and it can be frustrating to try to get one's point across. That has not been overlooked, certainly in the business community.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Is FBD very vulnerable, as the only real Irish entity in the insurance business? These larger European conglomerates can squeeze the markets. There was common abuse with the undercutting of prices to try to squeeze competitors out of the market. Is FBD still vulnerable to that? Is much of FBD's book being underwritten by some of these larger insurers? FBD used to do most of its own underwriting but I do not know if that has changed. Could it be bullied at the will of some of the bigger British, German or French operators? I am sure the company faces financial constraints on how it positions its cashflow, etc. How does it stand in an international market in a free open-trading society like Ireland as part of the EU? How does that affect FBD as an Irish operator?</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I thank the Senator for his remarks. We are very proud of being Irish and we have been in business for 50 years. As we do not have a wealthy parent like our competitors, it is very important for us to get our pricing right. We cannot go to London, Germany or France to ask for a bailout. Unfortunately, over the past ten or 15 years new entrants have come into the insurance market and driven prices down. The Senator knows of the companies whose parent organisations had to put large amounts of money back into their reserves. Most recently, we had the experience of Setanta and Kudos.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> As an Irish indigenous insurer, it is important for us to charge a fair price for our product. We do not have the comfort of a wealthy parent. Are we being bullied? We feel that we are very agile. We need to be more disruptive because we do not have our competitors' budgets. As we are led by a very capable CEO, we feel that we are very much up for the fight. We have a unique distribution model with a branch network that our competitors do not have. We feel our closeness to our customer base gives us a unique advantage which we need to leverage as best we can. As Mr. McMahon mentioned, the sector is highly competitive. Maintaining our pricing discipline is critical because we do not have a wealthy parent to come in and bail us out.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">It is also related to what we can do with the capital we are holding and what kinds of assets we can invest in. Essentially our ability to generate returns from those assets is lower because we must invest in safer assets. It is more driven by the investment climate at the moment, but certainly where insurance companies would have made money from investing-----</p>

          <p eId="para_433">The return to FBD shareholders needs to come through higher premiums and higher profitability in other sectors because it is not getting it from there. The witnesses can disagree with me if they want, but when interest rates were better from an investment point of view or when bonds were paying out more, that effectively subsidised the shareholder return to an extent or subsidised the general insurance business to the extent that companies could afford to make less, lose more or whatever.</p>

          <p eId="para_437">I accept FBD has a remit, a mission statement and a core business and I am not telling the witnesses what to do. However, it seems from the figures we got this morning that €5 million has been collected in premiums in the past five years, about €200,000 had been paid out and about €800,000 has been placed in reserve against potential future claims. I am sure they are reasonably prudent returns. Our earlier witnesses seem to think that €4 million out of the €5 million is leaving the State because no company in the State, including FBD, is willing to take that risk. While I am not telling FBD what to do, I hope that somebody will be able to facilitate these businesses in the provision of family activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I hope that somebody will be able to facilitate these businesses in the provision of family activities. They may be obliged to close their doors because, at present, no one is facilitating them. Mr. McMahon made the point that FBD has 34 offices across the country and is involved with marts, farms and everything else. I am not telling him what to do. That is not the committee's role. However, it is something FBD should consider. I think I am right in saying that there is only one insurer dealing with the public house and restaurant industries at this stage. I am not saying that this is an area in which FBD wants to get involved, but I would prefer Ireland to be making the money.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">I thank the Vice Chairman. Ultimately, there is a great deal that can be done to improve and lower the cost of insurance, which is the overall aim. However, the fundamental and key issue is the high level of payout and the high cost of getting to that payout. The more we divert ourselves on other ancillary areas around that, the more we stay away from the core issue that is affecting us. The committee will appreciate that the challenge is in trying to address that. That is essentially what needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">It is reasonable to state that there are vested interests at play here. If someone is making 40% of payouts, which was €190 million last year including legal costs, it means FBD paid out between €40 million and €60 million in legal costs last year. Is that a fair assessment?</p>

          <p eId="para_452">In its letter of invitation, the committee highlighted a particular interest in two areas, namely, Brexit readiness and the proposed individual accountability framework for the banking sector. I will address both in my opening statement but, first, I will provide a brief overview of some developments in Bank of Ireland since our last meeting in July 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Bank of Ireland is focused on the delivery of the multi-year strategy we announced last year. This strategy sets out the plan we are following from 2018 to 2021. It seeks to transform our culture, our systems and our business model, as well as improve customer service and grow sustainable profitability. In 2018 we delivered new lending of €15.9 billion groupwide, an increase of 13% year on year. Last year was the first year of net new lending growth in ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> A core part of our strategy is to strongly support home building and buying. In 2018 we increased mortgage lending by 17%. We are funding the construction of 5,500 residential units across approximately 140 sites nationwide. We are also the largest provider of new business lending into the economy and support two out of every three foreign direct investment projects coming into Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> In addition to lending, since last June, we have taken several steps to improve the service we deliver to our customers. With more than 250 branches nationwide, we have the largest network of any Irish bank. In the second half of last year, we expanded cash services at more than 100 of our locations, opened two new branches and increased the number of front-line staff serving customers directly by more than 200.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> We are also focused on reducing our non-performing exposures, NPEs. At 6.3%, we have the lowest level of NPEs of any bank in Ireland but we must do more. This is why, last week, we announced a transaction involving a potential securitisation of a portfolio of non-performing buy-to-let mortgage loans. In common with all banks, our regulators have set out the capital requirements we must adhere to in respect of any NPEs that we hold. This includes holding up to ten times more capital against certain impaired mortgages compared with others which are current with their repayments. This represents capital that could otherwise be lent into the economy or invested in improving customer service.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Brexit, is of course, a topic that dominates the landscape in Ireland, the UK and across the EU. It is also top of mind for many of our customers. Bank of Ireland’s economic pulse, our monthly index which tracks consumer and business sentiment, has reported weakening sentiment over the recent 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">In March, this was down by 1.4 points to 89.4, a reduction of 7.7. compared with a year ago, with Brexit being the key factor.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> At Bank of Ireland we look at Brexit in two ways. First, how we can support our customers to navigate Brexit. Second, how we are prepared as a Bank to deal with the outcome whatever that may be. Within our customer base we see resilient businesses that are adapting to changing circumstances. Nonetheless, particular challenges do arise for some customers. These can include managing foreign exchange risk, investing in their working capital or changing their supply chains, operations or logistics. In response, Bank of Ireland has launched a €2 billion Brexit fund to support businesses across the island of Ireland. Notwithstanding present issues, many businesses are also identifying opportunities for investment and growth, domestically and internationally, which we are keen to support. </p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Regarding our own business, Bank of Ireland was subject to two European Banking Authority, EBA, stress tests in 2018 - a baseline test and an adverse scenario assuming a severe economic downturn. We performed considerably better than UK peers. These tests demonstrated our resilience and showed we have enough capital reserves in the event of a severe financial downturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> The committee raised in its letter the individual accountability framework for banking. I mentioned earlier that transforming Bank of Ireland's culture is an important element of our strategy. We believe that the individual accountability framework will act as an enabler of cultural change, not just in Bank of Ireland but across the sector. A good corporate culture makes a tangible and positive difference for our customers, colleagues and sustainable financial performance. Given this significance, we have made the transformation of our culture a core element of our entire transformation programme, and just as important as the transformation of our technology and how we are structured. Bank of Ireland has, therefore, welcomed the proposals to increase accountability in the sector in Ireland. We believe this will help to further drive the ongoing cultural change in banking, and we look forward to engaging proactively with the Central Bank on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Banking touches all parts of society. I look at the work under way on culture and an increasing accountability in our sector as core to Bank of Ireland's task of rebuilding trust with our customers and the wider society that we serve. I thank members for their attention. We are happy to take any questions now. </p>

          <p eId="para_464">I welcome the delegation's appearance before the committee. I ask Ms McDonagh to address non-performing loans, NPLs, first. Bank of Ireland has reduced its non-performing exposures to the lowest of any of the banks. It has been claimed that the bank has done so without selling any family homes. Will she outline where the bank is at now? Ms McDonagh said that the bank is now close to the 5% ECB target but we heard from the ECB this week that there is no such thing as a hard and fast target. What securitisations has the bank entered into over recent years? Were they synthetic securitisations or more like the Project Glenbeigh securitisation where the borrower has a new credit servicer and deals with a new agent in respect of them?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_331">
          <from> Ms Francesca McDonagh<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_465">I will take two questions NPE performance and where we are right now and the question on the topic of securitisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> As the Deputy said, we have made very good progress in reducing our NPEs as a percentage of our total book. We have the lowest NPEs of any bank in Ireland currently of €5 billion, which is 6.3% of our total lending book. That has been going down consistently through working with our customers to find individual solutions. We speak to our customers and find forbearance solutions that work for them. When we speak to a customer who has come to us or we have identified as having financial distress, we find that in nine out of ten of those cases we are able to find a solution and those solutions hold. That has been a positive improvement. </p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Our NPE performance and that reduction is over four times better than the industry average. We have talked about getting close to 5% by the end of 2019. The Deputy is correct that we do not have a 5% target. Some other banks in Europe may have but 5% is a psychological line to cross to get to a more normalised level. The average NPE of European banks is 3% to 4%. We are focusing on getting to 5% and then to continue. To date, we have done that exclusively from working with our customers. We signalled, in the course of 2018, that we are looking at all options on the table and that we are open to all of the resolution strategies that could exist to reduce that further. That is primarily because the definitions of what is impaired, a default and the capital that is allocated to those non-performing exposures is changing. There is more and more financial incentive and reason to reduce NPEs because they are becoming more capital intensive. Capital is finite and comes at an expense. We can allocate that capital to supporting growth in our lending book and supporting Irish consumers and businesses. We can use that capital to invest in our systems, improve customer service, meet regulatory requirements and make returns to our shareholders, which include the taxpayer. We have trade-offs there. We find that the amount of capital that is allocated to, for example, a non-performing buy-to-let mortgage is ten times the capital needed to allocate to a performing principal dwelling home, PDH, type mortgage. That just gives the committee an idea of the quantum. </p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Let me outline one of the options. Last week, we articulated or announced our intention for a securitisation of part of our non-performing buy-to-let mortgage book. This is a transaction that we intend to do for approximately €375 million, which will create a securitisation of the cash flow from those mortgages. There will be no transfer of legal title nor will there be any intention of a transfer of servicing of those mortgages. From a customer perspective, we will continue to engage with the customer and collect the mortgage. Nothing will change from a customer lens. </p>

          <p eId="para_480">We feel this is the best model for this particular group of mortgages. We have spoken about having all options on the table, and the option to sell mortgage books is still possible. We are not saying that this is the only option we would take. Until now we have been totally focused on working with our customers. This is a securitisation, but all other options are on the table. This particular group of mortgages is particularly relevant and attractive from a securitisation perspective because they are generating cashflows. These are re-performing mortgages, but there is cashflow in terms of the repayment of principle and interest every month. The generation of cashflow makes that pool of assets a good candidate from a securitisation perspective.</p>

We have spoken at previous meetings of this committee of our commitment to fixing this problem and treating it as a priority. We are in the final stages of doing that. We had 9,700 tracker cases in total, which included 1,800 employees. The group the Deputy referred to is a smaller group of 200 individuals. I just wanted to put that into context.</p>

We are somewhat restricted in what we can say as the group is subject to ongoing analysis and discussion. We have thoroughly examined the additional cases. I welcomed the opportunity to sit down and discuss the nuances yesterday. They put forward a detailed version of their case and referred to the impact this issue has had on many of those individuals. I have also met many current members of staff to discuss this issue in the course of the past 12 to 18 months. I have not yet seen anything to indicate that there is an ongoing entitlement to a tracker mortgage. These customers were never on a tracker and did not take up the option of a tracker mortgage when the product was available. I do not want to pre-empt the findings of the analysis. I have undertaken to take this piece back and to take the further information we have been provided with under the course of the review through a further re-visitation and to keep the Central Bank informed.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I welcome the fact that Bank of Ireland has met with the representative group of the 200 staff and former staff affected. This issue will not go away. Deputy Michael McGrath and others in this committee have raised this issue and have gone into great detail in terms of the documentation available to us. I refer to verbal commitments, emails received from Bank of Ireland confirming that they would roll on to a tracker mortgage rate of ECB plus 0.75%, and the internal communication, of which we have screenshots, which leaves a very clear impression that there was an entitlement there. I do not want to go into the details because I know that Bank of Ireland has engaged on this issue. I hope that engagement is meaningful and will continue, but I have a series of questions I would like to put to the bank which are quite specific to this issue. I propose to put the questions to the bank through the committee, and perhaps it could respond in detail on each question. I believe that is a helpful approach, rather than going through it now. Some of the questions are quite detailed, and the bank may need to look at documentation in order to answer the questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">The current pricing on our current accounts was brought in three or four years ago. It looked at the cost to the bank for transactions and set an appropriate fee for those transactions. We charge 1 cent for contactless transactions, 10 cent for a Visa debit transaction at point of sale that is not contactless, and 60 cent for a teller transaction in-branch. We believe that the price for the mix of services we provide for those transactions represents very good value. On average a current account customer pays around €60 for a year's worth of banking. On top of that there are various concessions, meaning that around 50% of our personal current account base do not pay those transactional charges at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">It is a hidden charge. If I go upstairs to the canteen and buy a cup of tea it will cost me 60 cent, but if I use my chip and pin it will cost 70 cent because Bank of Ireland is taking 10 cent every time I carry out such a transaction. If I have €3,000 in my account I will not be charged at all. The people who are being charged these transaction fees are those who are less cash-rich and the more vulnerable members of society. They are being gouged every time they buy a newspaper using their debit card.</p>

The Deputy gave an example of a purchase worth 60 cent, but if it was €60, €70 or €80, or even more, the same transaction charge of 10 cent applies. We like to look at the total cost of banking.

          <p eId="para_502">Some of what the Deputy is saying is fair. That package is under review. I cannot give any information on the review because we must make at a full application to the Central Bank for changes to fees and charges. As the Deputy may be aware, we recently we launched a new financial well-being initiative and are seeking to simplify what we do and our fees and charges. I believe the service we brought in a few years ago represents very good value for our customers. We are now standing back and looking at it in the context of what is currently happening and the day-to-day banking needs of our customers. The fees and charges are under review and we will be looking at something later in the year in that context.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">It is definitely good value for Bank of Ireland because it made €431 million on the back of fees and charges last year. That is a huge amount of money. It is not just about the differentiation in regard to charges between those who are wealthy enough to have €3,000 in their account and those who are not. If I open an account in Belfast or London, I will not have to pay such charges. Regardless of my income, lodging and withdrawing cash in branches will be free, as will making debit card payments in pounds, online transactions, phone transactions, in-shop transactions, withdrawing cash in pounds from cash machines or post offices and withdrawing euros from Bank of Ireland cash machines in Ireland. In Ireland, we are charged 25 cent for each of those transactions. A bank that was rescued by the Irish people offers free banking services to people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but if one of its Irish customers buys a Mars bar and uses a PIN, he or she is charged 10 cent. If one withdraws one's cash from a Bank of Ireland ATM one is charged 25 cent. That adds up to a nice profit of €431 million for the bank, predominantly, I would argue, on the back of low-income customers. There is a significant inequality. How can the witnesses stand over the fact that the bank offers these services free of charge to its customers in Manchester and Liverpool, but customers in Dublin or Donegal are being gouged?</p>

          <p eId="para_504">I will address that question more broadly. The Deputy referred to poorer or more vulnerable customers. To be clear, students and older customers are not charged. The charges also reflect the difference in cost between a contactless transaction and a PIN or chip verification. It is not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison to compare fees and charges, whether for a transaction or a mortgage, in the Republic of Ireland with those in our UK business. There are different dynamics, positionings and segments and a quite distinct set of charges and infrastructure associated with payments which mean that it is not a like-for-like comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> We generate business income. The Deputy referred to our business income in 2018. It resulted from a variety of areas, including corporate banking transactions. We are the only bank in Ireland that provides assurance. The sources of the income included our growing insurance business and other aspects of the bank's overall income. The amount referenced by the Deputy does not solely result from fees and charges on accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">The committee will revisit this issue and I hope the delegates will take on board some of the points that have been made as the bank reviews it.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> On standard variable rates, it appears that in almost all circumstances the bank's customers would be better off on a fixed rate than a variable rate. Obviously, the danger is that variable rates could go down, however unlikely that may be. The bank has 47,000 customers on variable interest rates. What is the bank doing to inform those customers of better offers within the bank and, under the new rules in place since 1 January, better offers in other banks? Are the witnesses willing to reconsider the bank's position in regard to having a stubbornly high variable interest rate of 4.5% for loans with a loan-to-value ration of more than 80%? That rate has not changed since 2015. Is it under review?</p>

          <p eId="para_508">We are focused on a fixed-rate mortgage strategy and have been so for many years. Some 90% of our new mortgage business is on fixed-rate loans and we have led the market in that regard. Fixed rate for first-time buyers and movers has grown to nearly two thirds of the market, up from slightly more than half of the market one year ago. That is a market trend indicating customers voting with their feet and having a strong preference for the security and clarity provided by a fixed-rate mortgage such that they know how much will come out of their salary each month to pay their mortgage. We keep our fixed rate under review. We offer a fixed-rate mortgage at 2.9% for one or two year mortgages, which is very competitive. We have reduced our fixed-rate mortgage rate over time. Historically, we have reduced it by one third in the past three years. We offer a competitive proposition. We write to our customers annually, as required. In addition, we have written to our customers on higher variable rates and reminded them of the opportunity to switch to a fixed rate. That is good business because keeping a customer on a variable rate when he or she can get a better deal involves a risk of attrition and losing that relationship or mortgage which, obviously, would be a negative for the bank. Some 8,000 existing customers moved from a variable to a lower fixed rate in 2018, while approximately 7,500 customers did so in 2017. I am keen to continue increasing that number as we engage with our customers to encourage them to avail of what we believe to be our best offer in fixed-rate mortgages. Standard variable rate is not necessarily the area in which we compete; fixed rate has been our strategy for several years.</p>

I will pick up on mortgage pricing where Deputy Doherty left off. He referred to the variable rate of up to 4.5%. The bank indicated in response to a question that 47,387 customer mortgage accounts are on a variable rate. That is 25% of the bank's total mortgage accounts. Of those 47,000 accounts, how many are on 4.5%? I presume some are on 4.2% and others on 3.9%. What is the breakdown in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_512">Notwithstanding everything Ms McDonagh stated regarding variable rates not being the area in which the bank is really competing, a quarter of the bank's total mortgage accounts are on a variable rate, which is high relative to its competitors in the market, although the number is falling. Ms McDonagh provided statistics regarding the number who have moved to a fixed-rate offering. Can the bank do more to accelerate that? It is bordering on criminal for a customer to be paying 4.5% today on their mortgage. It is significantly out of line with the market, given that Bank of Ireland is offering a fixed rate of 2.9%, Ulster Bank offers a rate as low as 2.3% and Finance Ireland, a new non-bank lender, also comes in cheaper than the Bank of Ireland rates. To have a quarter of the bank's mortgage accounts on a variable rate does not present a pretty picture.</p>

          <p eId="para_513">The Deputy made the point about account numbers. Many customers will choose to split their mortgage. They may take out a mortgage that is two thirds fixed, because they want that certainty, and one third variable, because they want the flexibility to make additional payments or they are confident that they can pay it off in a shorter term. That is customer choice. Choice comes out of competition and competitive markets result in different choice and differentiation in terms of products. The 4.5% to which the Deputy refers is only in the 80% to 90% loan to value bracket. Customers below 50% LTV will be on a 3.9% rate. As I said, we write to customers. We go beyond the minimum requirement and go the extra mile to let customers know that they can avail of a very attractive fixed rate. We have marketing campaigns. We recently reset our brand in the market and we have some very active campaigning about our lowest ever rate of 2.9%. With the cash-back, which our customers like, we feel we have been very active, transparent and engaged with our customer base. Someone who walks into any one of our 250 branches will see marketing materials and campaigns. As a significant part of colleague growth, we have created new roles are in the front line. We have put over 200 people in the front line and any of them will be able to talk about our mortgage pricing. We are being proactive, responsive, transparent and competitive in our fixed rate pricing. That is the area in which we compete and we certainly encourage any customer on a variable rate, whether they are with Bank of Ireland or a competitor, to have a conversation with us about what we think is a very compelling product.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">Ms McDonagh says people with a loan to value of less than 60% who are on a variable rate are on 3.9%. That is if they have been proactive and have responded to the bank's letters and sent in an up-to-date valuation. I bet thousands of customers have a low loan to value ration but are still on the interest rate for over 80% LTV. They have never gone about sending in that up-to-date valuation and have never moved down the loan to value band. It would be very interesting to see a breakdown of the 47,000 customers. It would tell us some of the story in that respect. I appreciate that the bank writes to them and sets out what they need to do. If any message comes out of today's meeting, although I am not sure it is one Ms McDonagh will want to hear, it is that those customers should certainly contact Bank of Ireland to see if they can get a better rate. If they want to stay on a variable rate, they can submit an up-to-date valuation and avail of a reduction of up to 6.6%, move to a fixed rate and go on 2.9% or else shop around and switch their mortgage elsewhere to get an ever lower rate. That is what they should be doing. I would be very interested if Ms McDonagh would drill down into that data. There are longstanding Bank of Ireland customers whose mortgages are probably less than 50% of the value of their homes and they are paying 4.5%. It is just crazy.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">The average LTV of our mortgage book is 63% so we would actually see customers who would be at or below that range anyway. What we do is exactly what the Deputy has described in terms of being proactive. We saw 8,000 customers last year and I imagine that trend will only continue. It has been increasing because of our proactive engagement approach, switching from higher variable rates to lower fixed rates, so we continue to have that engagement. I would echo the Deputy's sentiment that they should be contacting us if we have not contacted them already to avail of a better market fixed rate offer.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">The public debate on this issue is helpful. One thing that has surprised me is the number of people who do not know what interest rate they are paying on their mortgage.

          <p eId="para_517">May I have an opportunity to respond? On that point about many Irish consumers not necessarily knowing what interest rate they are on for a mortgage, that would apply to personal lending as well. Mr. Kelly touched on the issue of financial well-being. We have launched a major financial well-being initiative. We have committed €5 million to an investment over multiple years to improve the financial well-being of consumers in Ireland, not just our customers. We launched it because despite the relatively high levels of education and GDP <i>per capita </i>growth that have come through since the crisis, the level of financial literacy in Ireland is very low, with 45% of people feeling confident about their interest rate. Our target is to engage with 200,000 customers or non-customers in Ireland to offer them a financial well-being health check. That will involve questions about meeting their financial commitments each month, so people can see how they rate or rank versus the rest of the population. That should open a conversation about helping with their financial well-being. We have also committed to entering every single primary and secondary school in Ireland as part of our youth financial literacy programme, and we are doing some innovation looking at international best in class practices in our financial well-being lab. It is not just about sending another letter to a customer on SVR about a fixed rate offer; the broader issue is about making people more aware, from their time in education through all stages in their lives. This is not just for people who are financially not well off; it is for all customers to look at how healthy their finances are. We have committed a €5 million investment to that so it is something we take incredibly seriously.</p>

On pricing generally, and I have had this debate with Ms McDonagh before, even Bank of Ireland's fixed rate offer is not risk based. The bank does not do risk based mortgage pricing. We were always told that the price of the mortgage was commensurate with the risk yet Bank of Ireland has gone with a flat 2.9% across the board, no matter if I have only a 30% loan to value or I have one that is 90% or 95%. Why is that? I thought it was a cornerstone of banking that the price of the product was relative to the risk.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">In a competitive market we can have a lot of differentiation but we also want to have simplicity. I agree with the Deputy that a lot of people do not know what their interest rate is. Varying it and having a proliferation of different pricing mechanisms can actually cause complexity, which is not necessarily helpful either. We have gone for more simplicity in our mortgage offering so the 2.9%, which is the lowest rate we offer, is regardless of LTV. What we see, particularly because of the growth in first-time buyers in Ireland and because the demand for first-time buyer property is so high, is that this is actually very attractive because for first-time buyers whose LTV would typically be a bit higher, that is actually a more attractive proposition.</p>

Bank of Ireland is part of this bank culture board which will be reporting in the next ten or 11 days and we will see what it comes up with. Bank of Ireland has contributed and has helped to pay for that initiative. What is Bank of Ireland going to do to put the customer's voice at the centre of its operations?

          <p eId="para_525">Customer focus is one of our four key values. We set our values at the end of 2017 and have gone through a very detailed programme of embedding what those behaviours are and what our culture means. We want to see it as a differentiator for our customers and our employees but also for our shareholders, because a good culture ultimately results in more sustainable results.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">We define customer focus as increasing the volume of the customer's voice and listening more. There are many examples of us having listened and we have put more colleagues back onto the front line to serve customers. We have put cash services back into branches and we have put a welcome adviser in each branch, specifically in response to customer feedback. We also define customer focus as achieving minimum standards and service levels. We have improved our journeys and contact centre service levels and there has been an extensive programme of process improvement. There is more to do but we have raised our minimum standard. Finally, we define customer focus as offering tangibly different customer propositions such as financial well-being, protection and insurance and fixed-rate mortgage offerings. I do not see it as being either customer-focused or shareholder-focused as we see a good, engaged satisfied customer as good for business. Being customer-focused does not mean we will always have the cheapest lending in the market. We look at an overall proposition and its sustainability and we believe we are offering very good value in our mortgages and personal lending offers, as well as in the broader relationship. We have more to do to improve customer satisfaction and focus but we have made tangible improvements in front-line branch and contact centre service levels since the last time I appeared before this committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">The 5% is not a target set by the regulator but is a psychological line to cross to get into a more normalised NPE quantum. It is a number which we want to be close to by the end of 2019 but it does not mean we will stop once it has been achieved. We will continue to try to improve our overall portfolio but it is in order to be capital efficient, rather than just to hit a certain number. A capital density is associated with NPEs and if we have fewer NPEs it will release more capital to lend, to invest, to meet regulatory requirements or to return to the shareholder. Beyond securitisation, we are looking at all options to continue to reduce our NPE.</p>

We know that AIB has lost a CEO and a chief financial officer. What is the labour market like for Bank of Ireland? Is it dealing with similar retention issues? Has the entrance into Ireland in a significant way of Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays Bank, in the context of Brexit, changed the landscape as regards the competition for talent?

          <p eId="para_536">At the moment there are restrictions around variable pay based on performance, which is not allowed at any level. We have over 10,000 employees and there is no opportunity to differentiate financially between a fantastic colleague who goes the extra mile for a customer and a person who does not meet the standard. There are other ways to differentiate and we do that by recognising, promoting and developing staff but there is no way to vary pay under the current restrictions. If there is a variable payment there would be a large tax associated with it. In the Minister's letter there is also a restriction on a total payment of €500,000 for any individual. When I refer to normalisation of pay, I am thinking of being more aligned with other banks in Ireland. At the moment the restrictions only apply to Irish banks, including Bank of Ireland, but other banks and financial services companies, along with all other private industry companies, are not restricted in the same way. We know the historical reasons for this, of which I am mindful, but we are encouraging normalisation at this moment in time. This is not just about a couple of senior people at the top of the organisation - variable pay can help drive accountability and reward the right behaviours and performance that are customer-focused at all levels of the organisation, including those who work in a branch. Second, it is very difficult to compete for highly specialised roles and such people can be offered much larger packages by non-Irish banks in Ireland. We are increasingly competing with "Silicon Docks" for people with very strong IT or transformation skills. Third, it is making Irish banks unable to compete on a level footing with other banks and other sectors in Ireland. This is a political matter and a matter for the Government. We were asked for input into the third-party review and we shared that perspective with it. We also gave detailed information of where we are seeing salaries and variable pay packages being offered which provide benefits that we are simply not able to provide. As a result of Brexit, we are seeing it increase quite significantly and it can represent a risk to Irish banks in their ability to retain and develop our talent.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">There are certain areas in the organisation, whether in finance or risk, where the skill sets are very attractive to other banks in Ireland or other companies here and we have seen increased attrition in more specialist areas. It is taking us longer to recruit and that leaves vacancies open for longer, which can challenge our ability to serve our customers and execute against our strategy. To embed the culture and values we want, I would really like to be able to vary people's pay based on their performance and on how they drive customer outcomes and give value. At the moment we incorporate such things into their appraisal and we give an employee a rating every year to differentiate what they do and how they did it, but we cannot vary their reward to reflect that. As we transform the bank, improve service and embed our culture, normalised pay within European Banking Authority guidelines would enable a better outcome, both for the culture of the bank and for customers. I know that the issue is divisive and I appreciate that there may be a challenge to that position but it is my view on the normalisation of pay in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">This committee has started the scrutiny phase of Deputy Pearse Doherty's Private Members' Bill, the No Consent, No Sale Bill 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">We invited submissions and received them from Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, and others in the industry, as well as from debtor advocacy groups that are in favour of the legislation, which seeks to provide that prior to the sale of a mortgage to a so-called vulture fund or anyone else, the borrower must consent. What is the position of Bank of Ireland on the Bill? The bank has commented on it publicly but I ask Ms McDonagh to share its views with the committee. Has the bank carried out any initial assessment of what the Bill, if enacted in its current form, would mean for the Bank of Ireland and its customers?</p>

          <p eId="para_541">The view of Bank of Ireland is that the No Consent, No Sale Bill ultimately would be bad for the consumer by reducing the availability of capital to support borrowing, not just for mortgages but for Irish SMEs. It would be bad for the Irish sector and the Irish economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">Why? Ms McDonagh has given us a conclusion there but not how it was arrived at and why.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_401">
          <from> Ms Francesca McDonagh<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_543">In the interests of brevity, I wanted to be concise, but I am happy to expand. The Bill conflicts directly with the guidelines the European Central Bank has put in place to encourage banks to reduce their NPEs to get towards European norms. The capital allocated to non-performing exposures is much higher than to performing ones. I said at the beginning that, for example, we require ten times more capital to be associated with a loan in respect of a non-performing buy-to-let mortgage than for a performing private dwelling house, PDH, or owner-occupied mortgage. Having inflated NPEs and fewer options to reduce them would result in trapping capital associated with those NPEs. It is essentially landlocking capital that we need to increase lending into the Irish economy to Irish consumers and businesses, to invest in our systems to improve services, to meet regulatory capital requirements or to provide a return to shareholders, including the Irish taxpayer. That is the only way we can allocate capital. I argue as a banker that competition, while it can represent challenges, is ultimately good for the consumer and the sector, whereas the Bill would disincentivise competition in banking. It would make mortgage lending less attractive and less profitable to new entrants, which would reduce the competition many politicians and stakeholders would like to see within the Irish banking market. If the ultimate objective is to increase consumer protection, the Bill will not achieve it. That is not just my perspective. The committee has heard from the BPFI representing the sector but also from the Central Bank, whose representatives were here. I do not need to quote what they said on the record but the same CPC protections exist independently of who owns the asset. The Bill would increase costs for consumers while affording them no additional protection. In fact, it would reduce the availability of capital in the market. For those reasons, it does not make sense and would be bad for the Irish consumer, the sector and the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">The witnesses are very welcome to the committee. On the desirability of people in Ireland being able to buy homes, in particular younger people on moderate wages, the witnesses are probably aware that the Government has a scheme to give couples with an income of €75,000 or single people with incomes of €50,000 access to State-sponsored funds. One of the conditions of that funding is that the applicants should have gone to a financial provider on a couple of occasions and been refused loans. I acknowledge that the bank cannot be absolutely accurate on the following question, because people explore options, go away and come back over a lengthy period. However, how many people does the Bank of Ireland turn down and can it share with us the reason for doing so? I take on board what Ms McDonagh said about wanting to be able to lend into the housing market. As one of the biggest banks in Ireland, how many people inquire about entering a mortgage and what proportion of applicants are turned down? While in some cases the bank might simply say that a person does not qualify and should come back when he or she has done this, that and the other, can Ms McDonagh share that information with us?</p>

          <p eId="para_545">I will respond briefly and then pass to Mr. O'Beirne to speak in more detail. Part of our strategy is to be the leading supporter of home building and home buying in Ireland. We increased our new mortgage lending during 2018 by 17%, which is €2.3 billion, by engaging constructively with customers to help them get the homes they want. We do not do that if it does not make sense or is not sustainable for them from a personal debt perspective. I will ask Mr. O'Beirne to talk a bit more about the help-to-buy scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">I might break the question into two parts and deal first with how the bank assesses individuals and borrowers as they come in to ensure we can provide a sustainable mortgage. I will then talk about the help-to-buy scheme, to which I think the Deputy is referring. On the affordability side, the key for us, as we have seen over the course of mortgage lending in Ireland, is to ensure we provide an affordable and sustainable mortgage. When people come in, we work through what position they are in. We work through what income they have, what is sustainable, what expenses do they have and what does that lead to in terms of an affordable mortgage. Of those who proceed to a full application, we approve nine out of ten mortgage applicants.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">Once they are in that process. There is an element before that where it is a more discursive engagement with people. Sometimes, we find that people want to buy a home but may not have saved a deposit. They may need to manage either their incomes or outgoings in a slightly different way. We call that a "getting mortgage ready" process. We have other elements outside mortgages to help with that. We have a mortgage saver product so that as people save towards that deposit, we pay a good rate of interest and a bonus to narrow that journey. When I look through all the customer research we have, the two things that come back from all customers consistently are whether they will be able to get a mortgage and whether they will be able to manage those mortgage repayments as they come through.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> The help-to-buy scheme was launched in October 2016 and it has had a very positive impact on the market. When one looks at the mix of housing coming through, the number of first-time buyers as a proportion of the mortgage market is starting to increase dramatically and is now just over 50%. Within that, the proportion of new homes for the help-to-buy scheme, which plays a very viable part, has also started to expand. It is due for completion later this year and Bank of Ireland would certainly welcome any extension of it. It is helpful for borrowers to meet that deposit requirement by way of a tax rebate.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">I ask about a couple of urban myths about the scheme. A lot of people ask me about the scheme and I try to give them some advice. One of the urban myths is that if one takes out a PCP, one can forget about being treated favourably, perhaps by Bank of Ireland but pretty much by any other bank. Someone in their late 20s or their 30s might have a very large car loan or a more modest credit union loan. A significant car loan of €30,000 does not rate that high and if credit union debts go over €5,000 or €6,000-----</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_410">
          <from> Mr. John O'Beirne<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_553">The Deputy has absolutely nailed it with her "urban myths" description. They are good for fiction but in practice, we ask about customers' ability to repay all of their debts, including their mortgages. When we look at things like PCPs, car loans or credit union loans, we look at whether repayments on those debts relative to income are sustainable. We also need to understand why such loans were taken out. Certainly they are a factor in the decision but it is not a binary question of customers having borrowed X amount and therefore not being eligible for a mortgage. We look at these things and try to work with customers, depending on their circumstances. It is an overused phrase, but we look at these things on a case-by-case basis. If a customer has debt elsewhere, that is absolutely fine. People take out loans for many reasons and they use credit unions for many reasons. We also provide personal loans for a variety of issues and we look at loans in terms of what they mean for customers' ability to repay a mortgage. Once we are comfortable in terms of their net disposable income, we will look to the macro-prudential lending rules on the loan-to-income ratio. In principle, there is absolutely no issue with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">Mr. O'Beirne is saying that if someone is preparing a mortgage application, it does not matter what other debts are outstanding. There is a great deal of advertising and competition in the lending market right now. One of the areas of intense competition is in car finance where there may be very attractive options available. However, it would be difficult for a couple on a relatively modest income of €75,000 with a car loan of €20,000 or €30,000 to get a first-time mortgage.</p>

          <from> Mr. John O'Beirne<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_555">It is exactly as the Deputy characterises it. The decision is unique to the specific circumstances. If a couple with that income profile has a substantial personal loan that is taking a large amount of their net disposable income to the extent that we cannot see a sustainable way for them to be able to repay a mortgage, that would be a factor in our decision. It depends on income levels and debt amounts. It is all taken into account but it is critical for us and for the borrower that any new debts being taken on are sustainable in the context of overall financial well-being.</p>

          <p eId="para_556">This is important in the context of the comments that were made earlier about financial education and levels of public financial knowledge. This is an issue that the banks could address collectively. People in their late 20s who cannot currently afford a mortgage may think that it is okay to take out a car loan but in fact the consequences of that may be that their debt level relative to their income is higher than it should be. In terms of financial education, people should perhaps opt for a second-hand car and a smaller loan if they are planning to apply for a mortgage at some point in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I am interested in the refusal rate because my impression is that it is much higher than 10%. I am not talking specifically about the Bank of Ireland but banks in general. Bank of Ireland has been involved in the development of the Irish Banking Culture Board. In terms of people who are interested in getting a loan from Bank of Ireland or from the Rebuilding Ireland loan scheme, much more customer information needs to be provided. People should be given a pathway. The bank may well have data which show that arranging a loan when one is on a fairly tight income takes between a year and 18 months and that people must plan for it, above and beyond getting a deposit together. In terms of consumer education, I do not believe that people understand this clearly. </p>

          <p eId="para_558">I agree that the need for increased financial literacy is very high in Ireland and that is exactly what our financial well-being programme is about. Mr. Kelly will expand a little on addressing those specific issues, some of which are individual. We would encourage customers to join one of our financial well-being clinics or to speak one-to-one with our advisers.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_415">
          <from> Mr. Gavin Kelly<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_559">The Deputy has touched on a number of important issues. We did some research on financial well-being using some international benchmarks. When people undergo a financial health check and look at their financial circumstances, they come out with a score. The score puts them into a category. The categories are struggling, stretched, managing or thriving. Our research shows that about 40% of the population are in the struggling category. These are people who struggle day to day, or from pay cheque to pay cheque, to manage their finances. They do not think about things like savings, the impact of loans on their ability to borrow or planning for the future. When one moves up the categories into stretched, people have a bit more breathing space. They are thinking about saving but crucially, are not doing it. People in the managing category have surplus income on a monthly basis, understand that they need to save, start putting some money away but do not necessarily plan for the future. We know from other research that only 50% of the Irish population has a pension plan, for example. People in the thriving category are planning for their future. They are thinking about their long-term future, rainy day savings and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> What we are trying to do is build awareness. We see this in other aspects of life, where people look at their physical well-being for example. We believe that financial well-being is a crucial part of one's overall well-being. What we are trying to do is build awareness. We launched our health check service and within two weeks, 20,000 people had undergone the check. People can attend one of our seminars or come into the bank for a needs review with an adviser. They do not have to be a customer of Bank of Ireland to do this. They can go online, check it out and get a sense of where they stand. That is what is really important. The points the Deputy made about younger people saving for a mortgage and proving their repayment capacity are crucial. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> Another issue that is very interesting and about which there is a lot of debate is the rental market and the cost of rent versus a mortgage. This raises issues like the amount of disposable income going on rent that could be going into savings. This is about helping customers to plan and save as they go forward. In the past few years I have noticed that our clients and customers have become much more serious and resilient in this regard. They are more aware of the issues and are planning and saving. The days of going off at the weekend and buying a house are long gone. People are now really planning out their future and are being very serious about that planning. There is also an increased awareness among many of our younger customers that it is not a good idea to take on too much debt. They consider the impact of car loans and other debts. It is important for people to look at their finances in the round and to plan ahead, whether those plans involve buying a house, going on a holiday or securing their long-term future. There are tools and services available that can help customers to plan ahead. This is a really important part of what we are trying to do as an organisation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_562">In terms of future trends in the market in Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit, it is obvious that lots of equity funds have already arrived here or are planning to come. Rents are extremely high and these funds are pitching heavily into the buy-to-rent market. Does the bank have any concerns that the entry of these funds into the buy-to-rent market will significantly reduce the supply of properties for purchase by way of a traditional mortgage? People who would traditionally have obtained a mortgage are now being outbid by these funds, some of which have very significant resources. Rent levels, particularly in the greater Dublin area, are very high by international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">What is the bank's take on that from a social as well as an economic perspective?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_417">
          <from> Mr. Gavin Kelly<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_564">I welcome that some of these landlords, which are buying up some of the schemes, are coming into the market. We have funded a fund coming in to build a 300 unit apartment block in Dublin. We must have a thriving, long-term rental sector. Many of these landlords bring that certainty to tenants and bring a particular quality of management to these blocks. For us, overall supply is the key. Supply, and the lack of it, is what is really putting pressure on rent. We need to get more property built, we need it built for renting and for purchase. As a bank, we would like everyone to buy a house with a mortgage because that provides us with an opportunity. However, as we touched on earlier, if someone bought an apartment today in Dublin for €350,000, they could be renting it for over €2,000 monthly. The mortgage on that same apartment would be about €1,100 or €1,200. There are costs which are picked up by the landlord, maintenance, etc., but there is around €800 difference which is €800 that could be used to save for a mortgage from us.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> For us, the mix is what is important. Ms McDonagh touched on it earlier. We are funding the development of 5,500 units during 2018 and that has increased further in the last couple of months. When we were last before the committee that figure was 3,000. We are seeing much more development in building. We need a mix. Some of those developments will be for buy-to-rent in the market where funds are coming in, other developments will be for purchases for mortgage customers and people to buy a house. Ultimately, we need to see rents easing off and coming down so that customers can choose to live rental. We see it in many European cities and we will have to see it coming into Ireland, especially Dublin, with longer-term renters coming in. In order to do that there must be the right quality there from a landlord's perspective. There is room in the market for both of these stakeholders. Ultimately, that must push up those developments and numbers. Last year, 18,000 units were built in Ireland, which is welcome. We reckon that will be 22,000 or 23,000 this year and the number will continue to grow over the next two or three years. We need to see this continue to grow and see those numbers going up because all these pressures are driven by the issue around supply and we must ensure that we manage that in the right way over the next few years.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The macroprudential rule is 3.5 times which sets the mortgage debt for a customer at roughly 30% or 35% of their take home pay. That feels about right to me.

          <p eId="para_571">There would be examples, but the average in Dublin, according to our data is that figure. Obviously, it is lower outside of Dublin. To earn the sort of income where that is one third of take home pay would suggest that is unaffordable for the average teacher, nurse or many young people who have got their first job.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> The Deputy asked whether the larger funds or institutions buying property were pushing out regular individual private home buyers from the market. There were 57,000 homes purchased in 2018. We often refer to the number of new build homes, which was 18,000, but in terms of the homes which were purchased, the secondary market was 57,000. We estimate that around 15% were from the larger big investors to which the Deputy referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> On supply and demand, we are seeing the supply come through, even though it is not keeping up with the demand. The demand for new homes in Ireland is around 35,000 to 40,000 per annum. The supply has increased from 15,000 in 2017, as Mr. Kelly noted, to 18,000 last year and the market consensus is that this year will be about 23,000 and 27,000 in 2020. That increased supply has meant that price increases have reduced or softened slightly. At the beginning of 2018 there was double-digit price increases in the residential property market. That increase is still positive but is beginning to fall as supply comes on stream. The macroprudential rules are also having their intended effect of slowing down demand. The outlook for price this year is an increase of about 4% to 5%. That has been more subdued than it was previously as supply increases.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">The last time the bank was here we had a conversation about staff and remuneration. Several staff in Bank of Ireland, in my own area and nationally, have approached me over an outstanding difficulty they have with the bank on the settlement of mortgage issues and mortgage price issues. These are people who took out two-year fixed-rate products in 2005, 2006 and 2007, just before the crash. I understand that several thousand people are in this category. I understand that 1,800 cases have been sorted but about 200 cases are outstanding. As with many cases which arise from the crash, many of these are very difficult for the individuals and families involved. Does the bank propose to address this? The 200 people who have not received a settlement do not understand why they have been excluded. Does the bank propose to review their cases so that they might avail of settlements similar to those of their colleagues? The delegation spoke of the difficulty of staff retention. I know the Bank of Ireland fairly well and think that many of its staff are excellent. It is a long-running sore point that some staff have been included in the settlement while others were not. What is the explanation?</p>

          <p eId="para_575">We treat staff as we would customers in the context of the tracker examination. We are committed to fixing this issue. As the Deputy noted, of the total number of customers who have been included in redress and compensation, some 1,800 were existing or former employees. There is a group over which there is a difference of opinion and I will ask Mr. O'Beirne to expand on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">As Ms McDonagh said, we have made it a priority to bring the tracker issue to a conclusion under the full extent of the examination framework. I met a set of the representatives of the group to which the Deputy referred earlier this week. I have also met many of the parties individually over the past 12 to 18 months or so. We are restricted in what we can say here because we are still part of an ongoing analysis and discussion. However, I went through in depth with the representatives the reasons there is a difference in inclusion or exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">While we have not seen anything yet that indicates an entitlement to a tracker mortgage, I understand the impact that this has had on people and the way they are framing it right down to the human level in terms of what it means to have seen some colleagues returned to tracker mortgages when they have not been. We sought to be as expansive as possible. It is a group of staff who were never on trackers and did not take up the offer of a tracker when it was given, but I do not want to pre-empt anything. I have given them an undertaking to re-examine the specifics of the issue in light of some of the additional points that they have brought to bear. I have also given an undertaking to discuss the matter with the Central Bank.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">Will the bank revert to us, as it is a significant issue for the people affected? In our earlier discussion on culture, the word "bonus" was not mentioned, but we are aware that a great deal of pressure has been put on the Government to jettison the caps on payments to senior executives. We understand the arguments that our guests have made about the difficulty in recruiting staff. In light of Mr. O'Beirne's comments just now, though, one has to smile at that. The people who are in a middle or lower position in the bank are in a dilemma. They are not receiving €500,000 or €600,000 in annual remuneration and, like many others, are still struggling in the aftermath of the crash.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">No. What I accept is that, when the mortgages were taken out, the way that the mortgage system was put together meant that, when a fixed rate expired, all options available at that time would be given to the customer, be that customer a member of staff or otherwise. Anyone who rolled in that period would have been offered a tracker. After trackers were withdrawn - this is effectively at the centre of the tracker piece - the product was no longer available and there was no contractual element. Typically, customers would have drawn down on a standard variable rate. Since they never had a tracker, it was difficult to return them to it. Having met the group and spoken to people individually, however, I understand their view and expectation that there was no difference for them in terms of what they felt they would be returned to.</p>

The rules set out that one can only borrow up to three and a half times one's income and 80% of the value of a loan, with a slightly higher allowance for first-time buyers because such borrowers tend to be younger and may have more earning potential over the rest of their careers. As we come through this year with no changes to the macroprudential rules, we hope to be in a position to maintain the ability to provide that allowance to individuals, where required, throughout the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">Is it fair to say that the bank is carrying out more stringent testing on new borrowers in respect of their resilience in the event of a downturn? Nobody can predict the future totally. People can lose jobs and companies can go wallop and so on. Is what happened more than ten years ago now much less likely to happen based on what people are allowed to borrow relative to their circumstances?</p>

          <p eId="para_626">There is a wide range of factors involved. With regard to the bank's approach, many lessons were learned from the crash. We have tightened our credit policies. In the Senator's words, we have introduced a lot more stress testing in respect of the durability and sustainability of people's income. We think ahead with regard to where interest rates might go. That is one of the reasons why we have been very forthright about seeking to brink more fixed-rate mortgages into play as they provide a bit more certainty in terms of repayment. At a macro level, Irish banks retain a legacy in terms of the level of capital that must be set aside for mortgage lending. It is much higher in an Irish context than elsewhere. Other factors have also come in, such as the macroprudential lending rules. Over the next ten years, as we get to 2027 or 2028, nearly all of the mortgage lending in the Irish market will be carried out under the macroprudential rules which were introduced a couple of years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">If the Senator will allow me to broaden the perspective with regard to the bank's resilience, the resilience of businesses - whether SMEs, one-employee companies, or large banks - is particularly relevant in times of uncertainty. There has been a lot of uncertainty as a result of the Brexit situation. Our focus in this time has been to be there for our customers when they are uncertain but also to be ready, as an organisation and institution, to be resilient in respect of whatever outcome to Brexit comes to pass. It is not just about macroprudential rules and one specific proof point. More broadly, it should provide reassurance that our capital resilience and liquidity resilience will be regularly stress-tested from a regulatory perspective. The EBA conducted stress tests in 2018. One was a baseline and one was based on the scenario of a very severe macroeconomic situation arising from a severe downturn. In those stress tests, we demonstrated that we had enough capital reserves to deal with a financial shock. We actually fared better than some of our UK peers. That stress-testing has give some reassurance on the broader question of the resilience of Irish banking, whether in respect of lending to mortgage customers or responding to a broader macroeconomic situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">My initial point was about the resilience of the bank's customers, but I take the point that it is important that we have a resilient banking sector. We certainly do not want to see what happened before happen again. In her opening statement Ms McDonagh talked about Brexit. The bank has an economic pulse which comes out every month and has a team of economists within its network looking at Ireland. It has the largest branch network. It is all over the country and picks up signals from every part of Ireland, which is no different from how political parties operate. The bank sees customers. It sees people under pressure in, I presume, the areas about which we all worry in terms of Brexit - agrifood, tourism and so on. What are Ms McDonagh's thoughts on where Brexit is heading? I do not want her to predict what will happen at Westminster, rather I am asking which areas are more vulnerable. We all have our own opinions on that but what is the bank's perspective?</p>

          <from> Ms Francesca McDonagh<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_629">As the Senator suggested, I will leave the politics to the politicians. With regard to our customers, we think about Brexit in two ways. We need to make sure we are resilient and ready as an institution, but the majority of our energy and day-to-day activity relates to supporting our customers. We do a monthly economic pulse. The March results showed that both consumer and business confidence were at a low ebb. Consumer confidence was at the lowest level we have seen since we started measuring it in the pulse four years ago. We have seen some rebound in respect of business confidence, but businesses, particularly SMEs, are very concerned by the uncertainty which Brexit represents. That is manifesting itself in many ways. Many SMEs are not necessarily cancelling, but deferring investment decisions. They are not buying extra capacity for their warehouses, employing more people, or replacing machinery because they want to see what Brexit will mean for them. It depends on the sector and the part of the supply chain in which the business operates. The sectors most exposed to Brexit, which the Senator mentioned, are those that are highly dependent of imports or exports and which are affected by volatility or lower margins. Where they are lower down in the supply chain, their ability to respond to that threat is quite limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">We are speaking to our customers. We held over 250 events across the island of Ireland in 2018. We have a team of sector specialists focused on agrifood, health care, hospitality and those manufacturing firms which may be more exposed because they are located closer to the Border, either in the Republic or in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> We have also launched a €2 billion Brexit fund. This is putting our money where our mouth is in terms of supporting customers at times when developing a contingency plan may require money. This should enable them to take on sustainable borrowing to support them during uncertain times. There will also be opportunities. Brexit may represent opportunities to develop into new and continental markets, moving away from the UK, or in acquiring manufacturing or production capacity in the UK as a hedge.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> We have a €50 million unsecured foreign exchange fund for small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, customers who are exposed to foreign currency exchange to help them reduce that volatility which can eat into their margins. We continue to have point-in-time commentary. The Bank of Ireland website has regular videos and information guides for those exporting and importing about what to do. Being there for our customers, not just in the public sense but for one-to-one conversations, is a priority. We have the leading market share of SMEs and we are the largest lender to corporate Ireland. Having our relationship managers and our people in the front line speaking to customers during this uncertain time is a key priority.</p>

          <p eId="para_633">Ms McDonagh made a point in her opening statement that new lending was up 13% in 2018 on the previous year and it was the first year of net new lending growth which is a positive statement. Brexit changes every hour. As I have been in this committee room since 9.30 a.m., I do not know what has happened today and it could have entirely changed by the time I finally get to see daylight. It is becoming more uncertain by the day, if not the hour. Are the figures for lending in the first quarter in 2019 a little lower or softer than last year?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_478">
          <from> Ms Francesca McDonagh<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_634">Last year, we set a strategy to grow our total lending across all of our businesses by 20% to €90 billion. Last year was the first year we had a net lending book growth which is positive. The total strategy from now until 2021 is that two thirds of that growth will come from our Irish business and a third from our UK and international business. What we are seeing at the moment, however, is more 50-50. Half the growth we are experiencing comes from our UK and international businesses while the other half comes from retail Ireland such as SMEs, mortgages and consumer lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> We believe that when there is more clarity on Brexit, whether it is good or bad, there will be more certainty, particularly for Irish SMEs, to activate deferred business decisions. It does not necessarily impact on mortgage lending. However, it impacts on consumer confidence. The supply and demand dynamics are much more prevalent in Irish mortgage growth. For SMEs, we would see that there is some overhang from the crisis. They are generally cash generative, meaning they can invest some of their cash reserves. There has been a reticence among SMEs to take on new borrowing until they have clarity in respect of Brexit. When clarity, hopefully, does come, that will provide some more direction for SMEs in terms of whether they broaden their manufacturing in Northern Ireland or partner with a supplier in continental Europe. Some of these decisions are waiting due to Brexit uncertainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> We remain committed to our 20% loan book growth strategy. It depends on external factors and it is predicated on some type of deal being done on Brexit with a reasonable transition period.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">The level of NPEs, at 6.3%, is the lowest for any of the Irish banks. Although the Central Bank has not given Bank of Ireland a target, 5% is a level which the organisation would like to reach. Once it achieves that, is it willing to tolerate that level or would it like to reduce it further to, say, 1%? Will it keep disposing of these types of loans or restructuring them? Ms McDonagh has outlined the reasons the bank does not want NPEs. Obviously there is a challenge for those affected by this. Is it her aim to get to 5% or to 1%? The 6.3% NPE level means the bank’s loan book has tied-up capital. Equally, this involves vulnerable customers who went into a loan with the full expectation that the outcomes would be different than how they ended up. What is the game plan for the 6.3% level?</p>

          <p eId="para_638">We have not provided our shareholders and the market with guidance in terms of NPE reduction beyond the end of 2019. We stated that we would seek to get closer to 5% by the end of 2019. We will look to continue reducing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Across Europe, banks on average have a 3% to 3.4 % NPE level. That would be considered normal but it can vary. Regulators obviously would encourage banks to minimise as much as possible their NPEs during a benign period of a credit cycle, meaning that as one goes through a cyclical change, one is starting from a lower base. After reaching 5%, I do not have a hard number that we will pursue. It goes back to optimisation of our capital. We will work with customers. In cases where customers are willing to work with us on a forbearance solution, we will find a solution in nine out of ten cases. In turn, in nine out of ten of those cases, the forbearance solutions will hold. That has always been our preferred option.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> We will certainly explore other ways to be more optimal in terms of how we manage our capital in that this would be capital which we can lend to more of our customers and improve service. There is a clear incentive in terms of the intensity of capital attached to those NPEs increasing. A definition of what is a NPE is also evolving.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">In her opening statement, Ms McDonagh focused on Brexit and culture. We have had several meetings with the Banking and Payments Federation Ireland, the Central Bank and the Irish Banking Culture Board. In my time on this committee, four of the five banks have changed chief executives. The cultures are evolving. Some might say they are doing so slowly, while others would say too quickly. Clearly, there is a journey for all of the banks to make their cultures more customer-focused. Bank of Ireland may have had less of a journey than some of the others. Can Ms McDonagh describe Bank of Ireland’s journey?</p>

          <p eId="para_644">We have made this a key priority. We have three priorities, one of which is transformation. People often think transformation means IT because it does in business generally. It also means culture, however. We are off to an improved start. I know that because we ask our people and look at other outcomes related to culture. We are on the foothills. While journey is a slightly overused term, there is much further to go than we have come so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> We articulated our purpose and our four key values. At the end of 2017, we embarked on significant communications activity to increase awareness and understanding of what those purposes and values are among all of our employees. Over 6,000 colleagues have attended 50 roadshows across the country. These were led by managers and leaders who talked about culture and what it means to be customer-focused or accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> We have made changes in our customer focus perspective in terms of how we resource our front line. We have made improvements in some of our processes, and there is more to do. We are investing in our technology to be more customer focused in that role. We have also increased two-way communication so it is not just top down but bottom up and across, with informal communication through split level meetings, greater use of technology and just general openness. We have improved recognition of our people. When they exhibit the values that we feel proud of as Bank of Ireland and that a customer would be delighted by, we recognise, encourage and celebrate that. We are investing in developing the skills of our people whether they are leaders or people managers. We are embarking on people manager training and investing to help them understand their values and actions. There is a huge amount of activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> I chair a group customer board, on which Mr. Gavin Kelly and Mr. Tony McMahon join me, that looks at specific metrics and how this manifests in how the customer feels. Do they feel that the effort of dealing with Bank of Ireland is improving and would they recommend the brand? There are the net promoter scores and we look at verbatims. I have a live feed of verbatims from customers, good and bad, about how they feel. We are very responsive and take them very seriously. We contact many of those customers. We have a meeting tomorrow and we will call customers who have given us some feedback to understand it better. We spend a great deal of time on the front line. I will spend the majority of next week just with front-line colleagues on our customers and clients.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Is the huge amount of activity working? We survey our people regularly. We have seen a significant improvement in staff engagement and cultural embedding since we started to measure this approximately 18 months ago. It is still not where we want it to be. There are areas of great progress around understanding of purpose, values and belief. The behaviours that are expected of people are well understood. Our colleagues' understanding of their risk responsibilities is very high. There is also recognition that there are opportunities to improve our technology and processes, and we are working on those. However, there has been a tangible improvement in what our people are saying about our culture over the past 18 months. That is great, but I want the customers to feel that through improved customer service. We are seeing that but the challenge for ourselves in our ambition is that there is more to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">The individual accountability framework is for more senior people, but it trickles down to everybody in the organisation. The individuals who are going to be named and held responsible for various parts of the bank will have staff under them who are either doing the right things or the wrong things and being measured for doing the right things, although historically they were measured and rewarded for doing the wrong things in terms of lending money they should not have been lending. That was before Ms McDonagh's time, but every bank was guilty of lending out more than it should to people who should never have been given those loans. How will she implement that or can she describe that process?</p>

          <p eId="para_650">The individual accountability framework was recommended by the Central Bank to the Minister for Finance. We want to engage proactively with our regulator to see how that will be implemented in Ireland. It does not stop us from increasing accountability. Accountability is one our core key values so we are doing things in advance of that framework being established by the regulator. Many of the team have worked or work in the UK, and before I joined Bank of Ireland I was part of the senior manager regime when it was established in 2016 in the UK. What that meant was that senior leaders would have a very clear statement of responsibilities and what they were accountable for. There was no nebulous understanding of who was doing what in a bank. It was very clear that the SMR is where the responsibility would start and finish, and who that responsibility was handed over to was written down.</p>

          <p eId="para_652">Senior manager regime. Over here it is the individual accountability regime, IAR, or senior executive accountability. It is all the same. IAR or SMR relates to the same concept of holding individuals to account in banking. Senior bankers in the UK will have a statement of responsibility. They will formally delegate it to their team. That is a formal process and that delegation has to be accepted. It has to be very considered about people being qualified to accept that delegation. Then there would be an expectation that, as a SMR, one would demonstrate reasonable steps in the execution of one's responsibility. Reasonable steps would be the right reporting and the right governance, but also challenging, approving explicitly or not, demonstrating that one has done the checks, challenged oneself and that one has an assurance that what one is responsible for is happening as it should. That is the regime I operated under before I came to Ireland. It is a regime under which our senior team in the UK will operate. It ultimately increases clarity and the accountability of senior bankers. That is a good thing and absolutely consistent with what we are trying to achieve in our cultural transformation within Bank of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">The questionnaire is very detailed. I have gone through all 39 pages and all the sections in them. Clearly, the upgrading of the branches to have full cash and so forth is a welcome development. I have seen the clusters and community hubs in my area, and the ability of people to come in has been a very positive development. How far has that concept been rolled out? My branch is in Montrose and it is transformed from what it was. Most bank branches are very different from what they were five or ten years ago in terms of the interaction of people and using the facility for all kinds of things that would never have been considered previously. Some people are on a journey with technology but most people are getting there.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> With regard to the branch network, Bank of Ireland is not trying to close branches and, in fact, has opened branches recently. In terms of ATM security, there were nine incidents and at least one involved Bank of Ireland. There are diggers travelling around the Border digging out ATMs. Is there a plan to try to ensure this does not happen too often? These things can happen but I believe there have been nine incidents on either side of the Border in the past year. It is a challenge. I am aware of the future of money. I attended a recent talk in the Central Bank about payments technology. It is 1 cent for contactless and 10 cent for chip and pin. There are issues today that probably none of us appreciated previously. There is the future of the network and the journey we need to bring some people on in terms of technology and being cashless. We are dragging money out of the Central Bank at the end of every month under Army escort to bring it to post offices and to secure it while people have it under the bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> What does Ms McDonagh envisage in the banking sector? Many people have voted with their telephone, online presence and so forth, but some people are very challenged by that and perhaps need some training or help to go on that journey. Some people do not want to go on that journey, which is presumably their own business. Where does Ms McDonagh see banking in five years at customer level?</p>

          <p eId="para_661">The Senator referred to some of the upgrades and investments we have made. We have seen an explosion in online transactions, such as card transactions, Internet transactions and so forth. We are now processing 50 million payments per month through out business, which is a significant increase on a number of years ago. The more online we get, however, the more important we believe the community presence is. We will invest another €11 million in our network this year and in upgrading branches around the country. The workbench facility the Senator mentioned in Montrose gets much use. That has been rolled out to 12 other locations around the country. We recently opened workbenches in Letterkenny, Tralee and The Quay in Waterford. This concept is taking off in communities. Communities love the use of the branch, its layout and so forth. We certainly see a strong future for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> With regard to the ATMs, I will not comment on an ongoing security issue. We had two regrettable incidents in two of our branches in Monaghan and Cavan. At times like this we must stand up and be counted. We are very committed to those communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">In Ballybay, which I visited a couple of months ago, the ATM was put back in within two months and is fully operational again. That incident hit the community in Ballybay hard because it happened two weeks before Christmas. We kept the branch open for nine consecutive days because it was the only branch in the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> We are the only bank branch in 64 communities in Ireland. We take that very seriously. We are very proud of that. We are committed to staying in those communities and providing those ATM services. We work with the relevant authorities, whether it is the Garda Síochána or the PSNI, to assist when it comes to incidents like that one and we continue to adapt our security measures. However, what is most important is our commitment to our staff, the safety of our staff and our communities but also to continue to provide that service. That is very important as we go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> In terms of five years, I wish I had a crystal ball but I still believe that for us to differentiate what we do as a bank in this market, that mix of online and community presence is essential. We will continue to invest in both our online and mobile channels but, equally, in our branch network.</p>

          <p eId="para_671">I want to ask some additional questions if I may. With regard to restructurings or forbearance measures the bank entered into in respect of mortgages, we can see the table for private dwelling houses, PDHs, for example, and the vast majority of them are term extension or arrears capitalisation. Currently, the bank has done 2,916 PDH split mortgages. I ask about the bank's policy down the line when that warehoused debt crystalises. It is a good solution for many people. It buys time. The debt is parked. The Bank of Ireland, as I understand it, continues to charge some interest on the warehoused element of the debt, unlike most other banks. The witnesses might clarify what the rate is on that. What is the bank's policy at the end of the term of the mortgage? If, say, a family had €100,000 parked, the house could be worth €200,000. Let us say they retire from work. They are on fixed incomes or perhaps social welfare pensions and they do not have the €100,000. My question is, what happens then? Do the witnesses have a figure for the amount of mortgage debt that has been warehoused by Bank of Ireland using that solution?</p>

          <p eId="para_675">To clarify, some of those buy-to-let split mortgages are part of the announcement of the securitisation last week in respect of a certain cohort of buy-to-let loans. That is where some of those would feature. However, the principle is the same. For example, in those split mortgages for owner-occupier, on average, about 40% to 50% of the mortgage is on interest only and, on average, about 50% to 60% would be paying down capital and interest. For the remaining duration of the mortgage, therefore, the first part of it will pay down to zero and then there will be a lump sum left at the end of the period. It depends on each individual circumstance but we would be looking towards people who have retired who may have lump sums or pensions. One or other of those dynamics may change over a period of time. It depends on certain circumstances. The children get older, but the sale of the property would be one of the repayments that was envisaged when those were contracted with those customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">The bank would hope, as each of those mortgages is reviewed on a periodic basis, that some of the warehoused element will come into the active mortgage and that they will start making inroads on the capital and interest. However, notwithstanding that, there will still likely be a residual warehoused element when the mortgage term ends and people are legitimately asking what will happen at that point in time.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">Yes, and because of that potential dependency on the sale of the property, that is where the classification comes in. Those mortgages would be classified as non-performing from a European Banking Authority, EBA, and a European Central Bank, ECB, guidelines point of view. Like all of our non-performing mortgage customers, we have more than 200 staff just dealing with mortgage customers in difficulty. We proactively look to engage on an ongoing basis with those customers to make sure we are looking towards solutions that work for the customer also.</p>

We read from time to time that the banks have used up their exceptions under loan to income and so on and that no more mortgages will be approved outside the macro prudential limits for the remainder of the year.

          <p eId="para_689">From our perspective, I think we are supportive of the rules. When they were introduced it was challenging to start to manage that process because for the first time it introduced a checkpoint after a mortgage was approved and before it drew down. However, as time has gone on we would certainly look to see how we can manage that in as clean a way as possible and as we look into this year, our intent is to make sure that we try to keep available exceptions throughout the full course of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">It is measured once per year on the drawdown amount through the course of the calendar year, so it is measured on 31 December. Effectively, the challenge with managing to it is to make sure that if the market and mortgage lending is lower or the amount of drawdowns we would expect is lower than normal, then it is one number divided by the other. However, we look at that and look ahead through the course of the year and try to make sure that we keep a level of availability there.</p>

          <p eId="para_697">No. It tends to be lower than that in the Irish market for a number of reasons. For the industry overall it is around the high 40s and for Bank of Ireland it is in the high 50s. We have tried to work very hard on our process, as Ms McDonagh said earlier, in terms of managing the customer process through and, as I discussed with Deputy Burton earlier, in terms of making sure people are mortgage ready, so we tend to have that higher rate.</p>

I would not assign them an absolute percentage but they would be a major driver. It is also a very important product from a customer perspective because it is what most people spend the majority of their disposable income on.

          <p eId="para_703">It quoted Bank of Ireland at 29% for performing mortgages. Ireland has the fourth highest rate in the eurozone. Sweden has the lowest rate at 4%. In aggregate terms, Ireland was about 38%. Non-bank lenders, such as retail credit firms, are not bound by these risk-weighted asset capital requirements. Are they a major threat to mainstream lenders such as Bank of Ireland? Finance Ireland has now entered the market with residential mortgages. It is not bound by those risk-weighted asset capital requirements. To what extent is that a determinant of mortgage pricing? We had Mario Draghi before the committee some months ago and he described the Irish market as a quasi-monopoly. The Department of Finance, however, still seems to be attributing much of the reason for high Irish rates to the capital requirements.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_533">
          <from> Ms Francesca McDonagh<recordedTime time="2019-04-04T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_704">I also welcome the recent report issued by the Department of Finance on risk-weighted assets in Ireland. The density of risk-weighting in Ireland, particularly on mortgages, is a multiple of the European average. We cover that issue in our annual results. Other research in the market has compared mortgage pricing in Ireland with the European market. It is difficult to make direct comparison because application fees are common in other markets but we do not have them in Ireland. The cash-back aspect is also a differentiator. Mortgage risk-weighted assets in Ireland, which vary from 35% to 40%, are 3.2 times the average in Europe, where it is 11%. That translates into an Irish bank needing to hold €50 in capital against every €1,000 it lends in mortgages. The typical European bank needs just €16.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> That gives an idea of the comparison and that feeds into the conversation on pricing. People state the absolute price of a mortgage in Ireland is higher than in Europe. We would state that is not a fair comparison because of the application fees and cash-back elements and because of the amount of capital banks must hold against risk-weighted assets. That density is much higher and reflects historic losses experienced in the Irish mortgage market during the depth of the crisis. It also reflects the time it takes for the legal process in Ireland to work through cases and some other factors. We welcome the report from the Department of Finance and the comparison is vivid and important. We will speak to our investors frequently about this issue and it is reflected in pricing. It is a key driver of our mortgage pricing. </p>

          <p eId="para_706">I accept that. The extent of the look-back in those risk-weighted assets means there will not be any major change any time soon. New bank entrants would be bound by these rules but my point is that new non-bank entrants, such as retail credit firms, are not bound by these risk-weighted assets requirements. Do they offer the potential to shake up the market and, therefore, represent a real threat to Bank of Ireland and the other mainstream banks? Ms McDonagh and others state the risk-weighted asset requirement is a major factor in mortgage pricing. If that is the case and if the new entrants are not bound in the same way, they can then come into the Irish market and undercut Bank of Ireland.</p>

There is much competition in the market today and new entrants will increase that competition. We feel confident about our ability to compete and to continue to compete in the Irish market. The changes we have made, such as reducing our shorter mortgage pricing and improvements in our services and our processes, are part of our differentiation.

          <p eId="para_716">We do not. Overall, prior to possession, many of our staff are regularly engaging with our mortgage customers. Legal proceedings are always a last resort and we continue to proactively engage right throughout the legal process with our borrowers, and any third parties advising them, to see if we can find alternative arrangements right up until the last moment. We discontinued legal proceedings in 164 cases which were very advanced last year. We continue to push and make every effort we can to avoid repossession.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">There can be significant difficulties for returning immigrants to Ireland in seeking to set up a bank account and access a mortgage. The issues involved include criminal justice legislation aimed at money laundering and the need to have a permanent address in Ireland, as well as other factors. When it comes to underwriting and making a decision about a mortgage application for a returning immigrant, however, how does the bank view that? How does the bank consider an individual's work history in another jurisdiction, for example, and what weight is attached to that? Many of the people returning may not be coming back to secure and permanent employment immediately. Do the witnesses have any observations to share on that issue? It does come up.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">I will pass over to Mr. O'Beirne for a full answer. I will just say that this is an increasingly topical issue. It concerns Irish individuals or families coming home for personal or professional reasons and, increasingly, non-Irish nationals who are also attracted to Ireland. That is particularly the case in a post-Brexit environment with much job creation.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">We have absolutely no issue once people return to Ireland. We lend to many people who have just returned, whether new immigrants to Ireland or Irish people returning home. In recent years 1% to 2% of applications have been from people returning to Ireland or people who may have worked overseas. We work on a case-by-case basis when underwriting those applications and look at each individual involved. The types of questions we ask include are applicants in a type of career or work practice that is suitable to the employment environment in Ireland and what is the common salary payable for a job here compared with overseas. We have paused some of that activity in recent months because we want to make sure we are compliant with all regulations as we look to our obligations in other jurisdictions. While we are very comfortable with all the lending we have done to date, we do need to look at what is ahead and make sure we are up-to-date with people resident in the UK, for instance, or in other markets.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">The Bank of Ireland staff tracker group has been raised a couple of times already and I will not labour the point but I encourage the bank not to take a legalistic approach when examining this issue. I have read the documentation and will submit questions about it which, I imagine, will be the same questions Deputy Pearse Doherty will have. When the bank reads the documentation, if it is genuine in its efforts to make the bank customer focused, it will recognise that those customers, some of whom are staff or retired staff, inarguably had a legitimate expectation that they would have rolled onto a tracker mortgage. The fact that these people were never on a tracker is not directly relevant. There are thousands of customers who have been deemed impacted in the whole tracker examination and were never on a tracker but had a contractual entitlement to one. I know that, in accordance with the letter of the mortgage contract, these customers did not have a legal right and that appears to be the case on my reading of it. It is, however, also undoubtedly the case that there was much communication telling those customers that they would have the option of rolling onto a tracker. It is not relevant that the tracker product was withdrawn.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> We are talking about 200 customers and I really think the smart thing for the bank to do is to come down on the side of those customers. Those people had a legitimate expectation that they would be in a position to benefit from a tracker and I am not aware of any other major outstanding issues from Bank of Ireland's tracker examination. We have outstanding issues with other institutions. I am sure Bank of Ireland has already done this but I suggest it quantifies the extent of this issue and, if it is as insignificant as we think it is, the bank would be better off dealing with it and concluding the matter in that way.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">As I mentioned earlier, we keep up the engagement at all times with borrowers or, particularly at the very latter stages, third-party advisers. It may be a new adviser. Last year, 52 possession orders that had come via the courts were executed. That is a much smaller subset by comparison with 411. It exhibits the timeline between the granting of a possession and its execution. In that period, we continue to engage with the customer to determine whether we can find a solution.</p>

If something occurs bilaterally, such as contact by a customer or an adviser to the customer, and if we have written back to say we would welcome the receipt of a proposal or further engagement, we notify the sheriff at that point that there has been further contact.

          <p eId="para_798">I am not going to give Mr. McMahon a particular case; I just want to explore how far the bank would go in trying to resolve the really difficult cases in which independent advice has been taken. Where the customer wants to turn back from that advice and the courts have ruled, resulting in a possession order, is there room to go back to the bank? Would the bank assist and say it will try to provide a mediator or suggest that a mediator be obtained, after which it will participate?</p>

          <p eId="para_799">We would always want to engage with the customer. Legal action is the absolute last resort. We want to keep people in their homes. We would proceed to legal action where engagement has been refused, where there has been no payment for a number of years or where restructuring solutions have not been implemented for a sustained period. Typically, we do not use mediation in the way it is formally defined, nor do we pay for it. It is not something that is part of the success we have had in reducing NPE down to a quarter of the industry average. We work in many other ways. They have been successful to date.</p>

          <p eId="para_806">I am aware that the bank says it engages right along the line. The court cases I have witnessed, involving the county registrar or other courts, lead me to believe there is little contact being made during the course of those court cases between the bank, or the account manager of the individual concerned, and the firm of solicitors. The solicitors tend to pursue the individual doggedly. It may not be an instruction from the bank. How much engagement is there by the bank with the firm of solicitors employed in each case? Are the firms just let loose on the customers?</p>

          <p eId="para_807">They are not let loose on the customer. The legal process is complex and very elongated. My characterisation of the process from start to end is that the banks endeavour to reach a solution for the customer. A lot of engagement takes place. I cannot recall whether the Chairman was in the room when I mentioned we had 164 cases in court proceedings at advanced stages last year that were discontinued. This is an example of where we reached solutions outside the court process.</p>

          <p eId="para_808">We are down to the really difficult cases now, having dealt with quite a number of others. I have seen the banks become more aggressive. I am not singling out Bank of Ireland but speaking in general. Through the courts, the banks have become more aggressive. It concerns me because of the number of cases still in the courts. I urge Bank of Ireland to get a decent handle on each case, or on the firm representing it in each case, to ensure some form of understanding is applied to what is being done in court, particularly where there is a lay litigant or a family trying to retain its home. It may not always be explained clearly to the firm that the bank is open to discussions or to listening to the customer's case. The opposite happens in the court scene in that the customer is subject to aggression and asked for the keys.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The paperwork is not sound in some of these cases. There is a great deal of angst on the part of customers. One of the ways to address that is to highlight it here and suggest there is a need for some guidance for those legal firms when they deal with those cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> If somebody is invited to consider a case in an independent process, would that normally be carried out in-house?

          <p eId="para_814">My point is that for Mr. McMahon and the bank dealing with these people, it is serious. Their house is on the line and they are offered an independent assessment because there is a dispute, but what they receive is another arm of the bank conducting the independent assessment. That was my experience in one such case. Why does the bank do that? Why not give it to someone truly independent, outside of the bank? There are not many such cases but where they arise, people expect independence.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">Mr. McMahon will expand on the detail but I will comment broadly. We are committed to working with our customers if they are willing to work with us. Our desire is to keep people in their homes. We have a track record that is unrivalled in Ireland in respect of working with our customers to improve their situation. Nine out of the ten times that customers have financial distress in respect of their mortgage, we find a solution that holds. We have a track record of considerable resources and experience associated with this and we consider all avenues to find a sustainable solution for the customer, as demonstrated by our reduction of approximately 80% of NPL exposures from their peak. Without knowing the details of those cases, it is difficult to understand the exact context or situation. We would be happy to examine individual cases.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">I am not asking for an answer on an individual case but rather for a comment on the general approach of the bank to such hard cases. I return to the independence of the process and to seeking examples to determine what is happening and the processes of the bank. In one such case, a person involved in the financial services industry discovered that the file that was being considered by the bank in an independent appeal by Grant Thornton was incomplete. The person had the full file and the pieces that were missing made a difference to the outcome. The person appealed to the bank for an oral hearing and asked to put the case before the bank. The request was constructive and professional but the answer was "No". I acknowledge that is an individual example but it brings us back to the question of how far the bank will go to ensure that any process teases out the issues to the end. In the examples I am providing, the individuals do not seem to have felt that it had been worked out to the nth degree, where both parties were at least convinced by the process.</p>

          <p eId="para_817">In the context of an independent appeals process specifically for tracker mortgages, we set up an independent appeals process in line with the Central Bank requirements. It is an important part of the tracker mortgage examination, where customers have up to 12 months to submit an appeal. Some of our customers have asked for an appeal pack and several have proceeded to lodge appeals, some of which have been upheld. They have typically been upheld because of personal circumstances. Due to the independent nature of the panel, I do not get involved in individual cases but I examine the outcomes such as what numbers of cases were processed and upheld and the themes of why they were upheld. Often, as no two cases are the same, there is some individual information in the case or a personal circumstance that the bank would not have known about. The appeals process is in place for that very reason, that is, to look at the individual circumstances and try to find a solution. The solution may not be to the liking of every customer but it is an appropriate and independently led appeals process facilitated by Grant Thornton and chaired by independent members who examine the cases with great rigour.</p>

          <p eId="para_819">We have re-examined the process in recent months because one of the independent advisers, separate to the bank representing the customer, raised it with us. I fully agree it is important that all the issues raised are dealt with. We have tried to ensure consideration of aspects of the case that did not specifically relate to tracker mortgages but which were a broader part of the customer's experience with the organisation. We have set up a process to twin-track the appeals panel with the broader complaints in order that all the documentation can be provided back to the appeals panel, which can make a broader decision in the round.</p>

          <p eId="para_831">Yes. Regrettably, we identified a number of cases that involved a loss of residential homes. In total, ten accounts, that is, ten properties, identified as being affected by tracker mortgages involved the loss of a residential home. It is obviously a very poor and negative outcome resulting from what happened with tracker mortgages.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">When we appeared before the committee in January 2018, we discussed that in detail and I will cast my mind back there now. Any customer who lost a personal dwelling home received the same level of compensation as the rest, that is, all the interest was refunded and fair value was attached. An additional, flat sum of €50,000 was paid as compensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Any difference between the market value on the date of sale and the current market value, given that we have had a recovery in market prices, was also returned to customers. Depending on whether the customer wanted a new mortgage from us or to purchase a new home, we had to make sure they were provided with a mortgage. Let us say their individual circumstances were such that they could not afford a home in that way, we looked to make an additional sustainability payment based on the difference between the interest that was contracted to have been paid originally. We worked that out.</p>
