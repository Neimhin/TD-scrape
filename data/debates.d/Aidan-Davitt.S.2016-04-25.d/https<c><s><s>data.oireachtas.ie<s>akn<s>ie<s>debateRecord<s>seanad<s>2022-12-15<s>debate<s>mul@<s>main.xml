          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_6">This is the third year in a row in which I am presenting the Bill and I am pleased to do so in Seanad Éireann today. The Bill is a key component of the annual budgetary process that must be concluded by both Houses of the Oireachtas before the end of the year. While it is a technical item of legislation, it is one of fundamental importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> It serves two key purposes. First, it is necessary to provide a lawful basis for the expenditure incurred this year. It is based on the total Estimates voted on by the Dáil. This comprises the sums included in the Revised Estimates for 2022, voted by the Dáil earlier this year, and all Supplementary Estimates voted by the Dáil during 2022. These sums to be appropriated for supply services are set out in section 1 and Schedule 1. For 2022, these Estimates amount in aggregate to almost €75.1 billion, representing a significant investment to support the delivery of essential public services and allowing us to progress longer term priorities and invest in high-quality front-line services for a growing population. Funding allocations in 2022 have provided for record investment under our national development plan, NDP, to deliver infrastructure projects to support economic, social, environmental and cultural development.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> The 2022 Estimates also reflect the significant expenditure to respond to external challenges facing our economy and society. Measures to support households and business with the challenges of rising prices were introduced during the year to reduce the burden, especially for the most vulnerable. Funding has also been provided for accommodation, welfare and education supports for those arriving in Ireland from Ukraine. Our continued responses to the Covid-19 pandemic and Brexit are also reflected in the supply sums in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The second critical purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for public spending to continue into 2023. If the Bill were not enacted before the end of this month, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys from the start of January 2023 until approval of the 2023 Estimates by the Dáil. This authority is contained in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965 and is based on the sums provided for in the Bill. They include continued spending in areas such as social welfare payments from the social protection Vote, Exchequer pay for our key public services and the running costs of our schools and hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> The Bill also provides for the capital carryover from 2022 into 2023. Under the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in budget 2004, Departments may carry over unspent capital funding from the current year to the following year, subject to a maximum of 10% of voted capital expenditure in the current year. This multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects. The carryover facility recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and allows for a portion of unspent moneys that would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned under the annual system of allocating capital to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year. The proposed capital carryover into 2023, set out in section 2, is almost €690 million. This represents 6% of the total Exchequer capital programme of more than €11.5 billion for 2022. The proposed sums to be carried over by Vote are set out in Schedule 2. A table listing the sums to be deferred by subhead for each Vote availing of the capital carryover facility is also included in the 2023 Revised Estimates Volume published this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The Bill includes a provision to advance funds from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General's supply account to facilitate payments due in the initial days of January 2023. This provision will ensure the necessary funds are in place for salary, pension and social welfare payments at the start of 2023. Section 3 will provide for up to €355 million to be advanced for this purpose. The need for this provision arises as certain Exchequer liabilities and social welfare payments are due for payment by electronic funds transfer in the first week of January 2023. With the banking system closed on 2 January, funding will need to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year to meet these liabilities in a timely fashion. In addition, An Post requires prefunding before the end of 2022 to distribute funds to its network of post offices for processing social welfare payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> In light of the urgency and importance of the Bill, an early signature request is sought. The signed Act is required by the Comptroller and Auditor General to enable end-year funding to issue from the Exchequer. Under Article 25.2.1° of the Constitution, the President may not sign a Bill earlier than on the fifth day after it has been presented to him or her. However, there is provision in Article 25.2.2° whereby, at the request of the Government and with the prior concurrence of Seanad Éireann, the President may sign a Bill on an earlier date than the fifth day mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Approval to utilise the provision in Article 25.2.2 is now sought and a motion to this effect has been placed before the Seanad. An early signature motion has also been sought for the Appropriation Bill in previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Appropriation Bill is an essential element of housekeeping that must be undertaken each year. As I outlined, the passing of the Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure undertaken in 2022 based on the Estimates voted on by the Dáil during the year. It is of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services. The passage of the Bill will also ensure payments can continue in 2023 in the period before the Dáil approves the 2023 Estimates. I commend this Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Senator Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">The Minister of State is welcome to the House. This is probably one of the most important yet technical pieces of legislation that is generally rubber-stamped but is hugely important nonetheless. All facets and aspects of the State are covered under the 45 headings or Votes as laid out, ending with one of the newer Departments, namely, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. The Minister, Deputy Harris, is doing a great job in ensuring that Department is delivering for the third level sector. We could go through each and every one of them and talk about the individual Votes. Obviously, I will not do that. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure the State and its agencies are run effectively from 1 January 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I wish to talk about the actual process of drawing down capital expenditure to get approval for projects. I understand the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is carrying out a review of the public spending code as it relates to certain projects. I raised this issue with the Secretary General of the Department of Health at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I understand why the three-stage process, with different gates, was put in place. Obviously, the three-stage process for large projects to get Cabinet approval is necessary in terms of proper scrutiny of expenditure. Nonetheless, it is an onerous process that creates delays on certain projects. We see projects effectively stalled. A major project now takes months from when we decide to proceed with it to the start of its actual delivery. It can take five, seven, eight or ten years to get that project over the line in terms of cutting a ribbon and doing all that. People get cynical about this. They hear about these projects so often but the process is so elongated and delayed. There are probably reasons for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> As well as monitoring public spending and assuring there is efficient use of public funds, I am sure this process is also a mechanism to delay projects to ensure all projects in a Department do not come together. I can understand that too. There is a need to streamline the processes, however. Some projects are absolutely vital, irrespective of the planning. There will be debates in the new year on the streamlining of planning. That can take on a life of its own. The public procurement side of things is hugely onerous. I put this to the Secretary General of the Department of Health at the health committee. If the Government and the Cabinet decide there is a project that is absolutely vital for the functioning of the State, how quickly can it be brought through the public spending code? That is the test. There are projects that need to be fast-tracked. They have been discussed. If they have to go through the different gates and approval stages, the process can be drawn out, possibly for years even before we go through planning, approvals and contracts and all that goes with that. That is all I want to say about capital expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I support the Bill. It is interesting reading for people to go through the expenditure on all the different areas that cover all functions of the State and delivery to the public by the State in terms of services, projects and grants, etc. As I said, it is a very important Bill, albeit a technical one that generally does not get much scrutiny.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">The Minister of State is very welcome. As we know, this Bill needs to be passed every year to allow the Department to spend the allocated moneys. It is a bit of housekeeping that has to be done. Of course, Sinn Féin will support the passing of the Bill. This debate gives me an opportunity to raise some local issues regarding capital spending or more frankly, the lack of capital spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> I will deal briefly with three topics, the first of which is housing. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, said last year that the Government is spending half of what it actually needs to spend on housing. I will localise the issue for the Minister of State. I live in Castleconnell, which is a beautiful village of 2,500 people. Right now, we have 443 families and individuals looking for a house in Castleconnell, and it is planned to build five public houses. The official plan for the village tells us we need 130, which is probably an underestimate. Five houses is the reality. I say this to highlight how badly people on my side of Limerick have been let down in terms of adequate capital spend. It is easy to talk about this in terms of figures but when I talk about housing in Castleconnell, I think about a young mother with two young children aged three and five who is living in a single room in her parents' house. She has absolutely no prospect of getting a house and is in absolute despair. I know of another young mother whose child is ready to go to school in Castleconnell. Her whole family support network is in Castleconnell but she is living on the other side of the city with no prospect of getting a house. There are no plans right now to build the additional houses we need. I want to highlight that. I could have picked any number of examples but this is the one I know best. It highlights very clearly the level of despair, frankly, in terms of the housing emergency we face. I call on the Government, as I have consistently done, to address this issue in a much more fundamental and ambitious way.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The Minister of State will be very familiar with my second issue regarding transport, which I have raised with him previously. The Government effectively cancelled the plans for the northern distributor road in Limerick even though it is essential infrastructure. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has made it absolutely clear that it has been cancelled. It has been dropped from all of the plans. This road network is essential if we are to open up investment on the north side of our city. It is also essential for people travelling across the city, who face traffic chaos and danger around the Mackey roundabout, in particular. This road has been in train for several years and the Government has cancelled it. In fairness, all politicians across all parties locally condemned the move, with the exception of the Green Party, I hasten to add. They condemned the fact that this plan has been dropped. I cannot begin to tell the Minister of State the impact it is having in terms of the huge level of despair.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Effectively, Limerick has been put on hold in terms of transport issues. I see that my colleague, Senator Buttimer, is in the Chamber. We really cannot see where the Cork-Limerick motorway is at this point. We would like to know whether it is going ahead. I am not convinced that it is. The Minister of State might shed some light on what is happening on that particular capital project. Again, it is essential. When I was at university, which was a long time ago now, we spoke about a western corridor linking Cork, Limerick and Galway and discussed having really good motorway and rail networks across those three cities. Thankfully, Galway and Limerick are well connected now but we desperately need a motorway connection between Limerick and Cork. I cannot see where the plans are.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> I call on the Minister of State to talk to his senior Minister and ask him to revisit the northern distributor road, in particular. It is causing fury. Of course, it is particularly impacting some of the most vulnerable working-class communities on the north side of the city. They have been badly let down for generations now. We need to get that northern distributor road built. The whole city needs it so that we can have a much more effective transport network, which would obviously utilise the public transport we all want to see. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, does not seem to recognise that right now, public transport across Limerick is just not adequate. We do not have enough buses. We do not have the rail network developed. Yes, there are plans and there is much talk about it, which we welcome, but we are years away from it actually happening. I want to highlight that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> My third point is on the issue of health. When I met the management of University Hospital Limerick, UHL, earlier this year, in fairness its representatives conceded that the hospital is 200 beds short. This has been an ongoing issue for as long as Fine Gael has been in government, for the seven years Fianna Fáil has been effectively supporting the Government and, indeed, for the two and a half years the Green Party has been in government. Right now, there are plans for 96 bed units, but 48 of those beds will be replacing old beds that are coming out of the system. That will not be ready this winter. It probably will not be ready next winter. When it is completed, we will still be 150 beds short. What does that mean? It means we have 1,500 people on average every month on trolleys in our hospital. The latest HIQA report shows devastating results in terms of the fact that our hospital is not safe for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It is easy to talk about the figures, but we should talk to the families about the despair they experience about having to wait, in some cases, for days on a trolley. Elderly patients in their 70s or 80s are spending days on trolleys as a result of inadequate planned capital expenditure over a long period of time. The impact has been that people across Limerick are frankly afraid to go to their local hospital. The HIQA report, which I think only came out yesterday, is probably the most damning report yet in relation to the ongoing failures of this Government. We need to see much more urgency in capital investments in our hospitals. We need to see a real belief in achieving the goals that were set out in Sláintecare all those years ago. We are still so far away from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Those are the capital issues that I wanted to raise briefly in the time I have. We will of course be supporting this Bill because it is a necessary piece of housekeeping, but I could not let the opportunity pass to highlight the desperate and urgent need for additional investment, at pace, in housing, health and transport across Limerick.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I will pick up on the Senator Gavan made about the M20 motorway. It is important in the overarching transport infrastructure budget to recognise that the second and third cities of our country are not connected by motorway. That makes no sense from an economic and social point of view. Last Sunday, as people returned to Cork from the Munster match in Limerick following a disappointing result, they were frustrated to find that the traffic in Charleville and Buttevant was back to the old days. Those of us who represent Government parties, and especially those of us on the transport committee, have been very vocal in our support of BusConnects and the modal shift from the car to the train or bus. We have supported the initiatives of the Government - particularly the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton - around the light rail plan for Cork and the BusConnects strategy. To be fair, attitudes are changing around the whole issue of public transport because of the initiatives that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has pioneered in government, and that is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I was not going to speak this morning about the proposed motorway between Cork and Limerick, but I will do so now because Senator Gavan is right when he says it is an imperative that it is built. I know that the Minister for Transport has said that there is not a fatwa against the road. It is important that in the capital expenditure programme, we invest and we commit to investing. This is about the connectivity of two cities, about job creation, about people and about freeing up the lives of people in Buttevant, Charleville and other points in between. There was a documentary on RTÉ recently about the towns that have benefited from the Cork-Dublin motorway because traffic is not going through them anymore. It showed how Fermoy has benefited from the bypass. Equally, I hope Macroom will benefit from the bypass there. Even from a road safety perspective, the Cork-Limerick motorway makes sense. There have been multiple tragic accidents along the existing road. I know it is not in his brief, but I ask the Minister of State to ensure the Government commits to the Cork-Limerick motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The other point I want to make relates to the comments that Senator Gavan made about health. We had a debate yesterday on risk equalisation. In the appropriation of money in the health budget, there needs to be a recognition that our population base is growing. In some places, bed capacity is not keeping in tandem with that growth. The shift to primary care and community care has not developed accordingly. When we discussed the Bill yesterday, I made the point that when we speak to GPs, they say there will be a waiting list. As I said yesterday, the lower age group cohort is coming in and the older cohort is coming in, and there seems to be a logjam in the middle. When many people try to ring their GP, they are told that there is a waiting list of four days, three days or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I want to make my next point, which relates to local government, very clear. We spoke here a number of years ago about councillors' pay and conditions. I genuinely believe we need to build on what we did in the Citizens’ Assembly on a directly elected mayor for Dublin by continually augmenting and supporting our local government members. We cannot put in place roadblocks to them doing their work, regardless of whether they are urban or rural councillors. They have a variety of different impediments in their way. The vast majority of them are working part time as councillors and full time in their day jobs. As we all know, the reality in the majority of cases is that they have to work full time as a councillor and the day job nearly suffers.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Ossian Smyth)<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_48">I thank Senator Buttimer for his kind words on my precarious position. I believe what will happen if a new Taoiseach is appointed, and presumably he or she will be, is that I will cease to be a Minister of State at that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I will start by addressing the points made by Senator Kyne. He mentioned the public spending code. There has to be a balance between the number of stages that it takes to get project approval and the amount of time that is required. There are three decision gates. Initially, to carry out a big capital project you need preliminary approval, which is the State saying that, in principle, it would like to do the project. Then you have to design the project and the design has to be signed off on. Eventually, it has to be put out for tender and you do not know how much the project will cost until, quite far down the tracks, the construction company comes back to you and says how much it will build your infrastructure for. At that point, the final amount of money has to be signed off on. Those are the three decision gates. In general, there is a view that although the public spending code was recently reviewed, it needs to be looked at again. </p>
          <p eId="para_50">Time is not free and saying that there is need to go off and do repeated evaluations, has a cost. Sometimes there is a feeling that every time something is evaluated and subjected to more appraisals, the project risk is reduced. In fact, the time is adding up as well and eventually it comes to the point where nothing at all has been delivered. That is the risk of having a public spending code that takes too long, and this is being reviewed. </p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Senator Gavan went into particular detail about the capital programme overall and the need for accelerated investment in housing. He referred to his own area of Castleconnell and the specific examples of people requiring housing. While our population is increasing rapidly, we are building, commencing and completing more houses than ever in the past decade. There is a constant need to do more, accelerate and to spend more and approximately €3.5 billion has been spent by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage this year so far; a multiple of what was spent in the past. </p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The Senator referred to the northern distributor road and his fear that it has been cancelled. I did not know that and honestly, I am not up to speed on roads projects. It is not something I have been focusing on but I am sure the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, or the Minister of State at the Department of Transport with special responsibility for international and road transport and logistics, Deputy Naughton, would be happy to answer questions on specific projects. I get many more representations on roads from Senators and Deputies than on public transport. Our programme for Government commits us to spending €2 on public transport capital investment for every €1 we spend on new roads. We are investing heavily in transport but most of it is going into public transport. According to the capital accounts for the year, €2.547 billion spent on transport projects for this year and there is a carryover of €137 million. Some 95% of the budget was spent but the balance means that most of it is going on public transport rather than on new roads. People benefit from that and they want a regular frequent public transport service to their area. There is heavy investment going into rail both in Limerick and Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Regarding the connections between Limerick and Cork, the road needs to be improved. Safety needs to be improved as well as the speed at which motorists can travel between the two cities. That is absolutely critical. Again, the M20 project is not something I am up to speed on nor would I offer comment on it but I want it to become a safer route to travel, whatever means of transport is used to get between the two cities. The old model was that a motorway was being planned, there were landowners along the way, and people would lobby to have a junction in their area. If people get a junction in their area, the land in the area could become valuable as it could be used for housing and then long-distance commuting communities could be enabled to come in and out of the city. Clearly, that has a very destructive effect on our national planning framework if we are designing our transport strategy to facilitate extended sprawl into areas and creating a situation where people are condemned to long-distance commuting as a way to afford a home. </p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Senator Davitt mentioned the tragic events in Lebanon, which are shocking to everybody and a reminder that so many Irish people have taken part in peacekeeping missions at great risk to themselves. That a convoy of Irish soldiers was being shot at and one of those soldiers tragically died and others were injured and taken to hospital is shocking. Their families must be terrified, just coming up to Christmas, that this happened to them. This happened while they were working for the common good and to keep the peace while putting themselves at risk. Our overseas forces are heroes and we should think of them at this time. </p>
          <p eId="para_55"> Senator Buttimer again mentioned the M20, which as I said, I am not up to speed on but I am sure the Department of Transport will be happy to update him on this. He also mentioned the work of councillors. I was a councillor for six years and it is difficult to balance the requirements of having another job, or another source of income, while at the same time serving the public with no staff whatsoever. It is a difficult and thankless job but one that is well respected by the public. </p>

          <p eId="para_66">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for all the times he has come in since the start of this Seanad. I appreciate his engagement with Members, both in Seanad Éireann and through his work with local authorities.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_67">I am pleased to introduce the Bill to the Seanad. The Bill has completed its passage through the Dáil and I am keen to have it enacted as early as possible. I thank all Deputies in the Lower House who aided the progression of the Bill to this Stage, as well as Senators for their constructive support and input into pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> It is always heartening to work in a collegial way with colleagues of all parties and none to make politics more inclusive. I believe that this Bill, short as it is, signifies a key legislative change that will give elected members of local authorities, not before time, a statutory entitlement to maternity leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I acknowledge the positive co-operation of the Ministers for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, and Social Protection and their officials in progressing the Bill to this Stage. I also acknowledge the vital contribution made by councillors, to whom I listened carefully as I developed this policy and legislative approach. I do not need to remind Senators, many of whom have a background in local government, that Ireland has a low rate of female participation in local government. Most recently, in the 2019 local elections, only 24% of the available council seats were filled by women. While a record 562 women contested the elections, up from 440 in 2014, they only made up 28% of candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> The lack of prescribed maternity leave for elected members has been identified as one of the obstacles to the participation of women in local government. Currently, to avail of a period of absence following the birth of a child, section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001 is used, providing that an elected councillor shall be deemed to have automatically resigned from membership of a local authority if he or she is absent from meetings for a continuous period of six months. Where the absence is due to illness or “in good faith for another reason”, then the period of absence may be extended first to 12 months and then up to 18 months. This process requires a resolution to be passed by the relevant local authority sanctioning the request for an extended absence. This mechanism is not specifically designed for councillors who seek leave to take care of their newborn child, and provisions of this Bill will allow for the separation of maternity leave for councillors from such terms as “illness” or “in good faith for another reason”. The provisions of the Bill will mean female councillors can avail of formal statutory maternity leave without having to be shoehorned into phrases such as “illness” or “in good faith for another reason”.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Similar to Members of the Oireachtas, local authority members are officeholders rather than employees. As such, councillors are not covered by the statutory framework for employees on issues such as maternity leave, sick leave and annual leave. The Maternity Protection Act 1994 is the primary legislation giving effect to statutory maternity leave, such leave being applicable to employees rather than officeholders. This is where the legislative lacuna arises. The Bill gives legislative effect for the first time to an entitlement to maternity leave for local authority elected members equivalent to the entitlement for employees under the Maternity Protection Act 1994. It was raised time and again as part of our engagement with representative groups and stakeholders that the role of elected members is distinctive in that it is difficult to step back from the role for a significant period, including the taking of maternity leave. </p>
          <p eId="para_72"> Councillors should never feel pressured either to remain in the role or to attend periodic council meetings when the priority should be to take care of a newborn baby. To this end, I am inserting a provision in the Bill for the possibility of the appointment by co-option of a person as a temporary substitute for an elected member who avails of maternity leave. To safeguard equality of treatment, Government has agreed to extend this temporary substitute opportunity to all members who are absent due to illness or other good faith reason having regard to section 18 of the Local Government Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> I have included in this draft legislation the innovative provision that a local authority must have regard to the preferred choice of the member causing the absence as to who should be the temporary substitute. This builds upon, strengthens and goes one step further than existing similar provisions in respect of the filling of casual vacancies and I hope and expect that the spirit of this provision will be respected by all local authorities and by those from all parties and none.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> Subsection 16(5) of Schedule 10 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that: “The Minister may issue... directions to local authorities in relation to standing orders and the provisions to be included in them.” While I would not like to make such directions in standing orders, should anecdotal evidence suggest that the preferred choice of an elected member is being overlooked, I will draft directions to remedy the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> Additionally, as part of a broader range of maternity-related supports, an allowance for administrative supports will be available to female elected members to support any period of statutory maternity leave. To this end, my Department is drafting supporting regulations and I am happy to engage with this House on those regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> It is intended that the amount of the administrative support payable to councillors will be linked to the latest salary scale for administrative assistants provided to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I expect that the amount of the allowance payable to an elected member will be up to €235.43 per week, which is one third of the first point of the salary scale for an Oireachtas administrative assistant. This reflects the administrative support role being no more than 13 hours per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">This Bill aims to address the specific obstacle of access to statutory maternity leave and also provide additional supports to elected members in an inclusive manner. In progressing the Bill to this stage, I recognise the extensive consultation that has been undertaken and the invaluable input from all stakeholders. In April 2021, a cross-party working group of women councillors was established and asked specifically to examine maternity-related matters for elected members. The group met a number of times and gave a more rounded understanding of the needs of women councillors in respect of maternity supports. The group reinforced the need for maternity leave and additional supports for councillors but also advised that as much flexibility as possible in availing of these supports was critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> The Department also engaged with councillor representative organisations, with the Association of Irish Local Government in particular submitting detailed policy proposals on the substantive issues in the Bill. The Department has also engaged with women’s groups involved in promoting the participation of women in local government, notably the National Women’s Council of Ireland, Women for Election and See Her Elected. My Department has also engaged on this issue with the Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality considering the recommendations in the report of the Citizens’ Assembly on Gender Equality.</p>

          <from>Senator Aisling Dolan<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_79">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to speak about to us. This is ground-breaking legislation because it is about ensuring we get gender-balanced representation within our local authorities across the country. I know the Minister of State has done a mountain of work on this over the past year or two years. I very much appreciate the fact that there has been a consultation group, namely, the cross-party working group that was set up last year to ensure voices are heard, particularly of women, who are councillors and have faced these challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> As a councillor elected to Galway County Council, I was the first female coming into my Ballinasloe municipal district. That is not to say there are not excellent men - of course there are. There are excellent men in all walks of life. There are also excellent women and, unfortunately, their voices sometimes do not get heard. </p>
          <p eId="para_81"> We are making sure that the barriers are removed to ensure women will want to consider a life of public service. When you think about it, women would be the most natural representatives and a perfect fit for a role in public service when it comes to empathy, compassion, the care roles and the roles most women usually have from the experience of looking after children and their parents. This is across the board. We need to hear that voice. </p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Ireland lags behind in terms of female representation. It has been acknowledged at national and international level. We need to ensure we support women in many different ways. This is one measure the Government is taking now. The Minister of State has taken the reins along with his team and officials and looked at this. Having a co-optee - somebody who can come in on a temporary basis while a woman is out on maternity leave - is a really great way to operate. It is crucial for somebody on sick leave or extended sick leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> There are probably far more ways this Government can support women. I know there are a lot of groups like Women For Election that support women to come forward. How do all public representatives and the Government engage at very young levels? How do we do this in transition year and when young men and women are going to college so that women are seen as natural leaders? We have taken big steps when it comes to boards of companies with the 30% rule. We have all the State boards on which we are seeking to ensure women are represented. These are decision makers and leaders. We need to see that start at a very young age. Our student councils are a great way of doing this. Our student councils are a fantastic way of bringing forward students at a young age to get experience of representing their schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> I highlight the difference between urban and rural. We sometimes have far more female representatives from our city centres. There seems to be far more women who come through the natural process of county councils, bringing representatives for our large city centres. I do not know if that is the case in rural areas. Making that breakthrough is far more challenging in some of our smaller towns and rural constituencies. Speaking as someone from a rural area, I understand that there is a tradition in these areas. Even in my local area, there is a tradition of men taking the lead in our sports clubs. Perhaps people come into politics through a background in sports. They become leaders in that way, become well known and suddenly they are a natural fit for becoming a public representative. We also need to look at how we encourage, balance and support women in all walks of life, show them that more women can be public representatives and that it is a matter of pride and support women when they do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> The challenge we sometimes face, and this is probably not within our remit, is making sure all doors are open when someone does come forward. When it comes to communication and social media, women can sometimes be targeted. Safeguards should be put in place for women in those situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> I would love if we could have a review of this legislation in a year or two years time to see its impact. Are we seeing more women in the next local elections coming through? Will this be a real deal-breaker for some of them? I would also like to hear their feedback. It has been fantastic to see the work done by the Department.</p>

          <from>Senator Sharon Keogan<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_87">I thank the Minister of State for his role in respect of local government over the past two and a half years. He has probably been the most effective Minister for local government and councillors in a very long time, particularly regarding how he has respected the role of local government in our democracy. The pay rise was very much welcomed by councillors around the country along with the supports the Minister of State put in place for them to do their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> This Bill is yet another support mechanism that is particularly geared towards women. There are challenges facing women when it comes to getting into politics but they can be overcome. This legislation deals with the issue of pregnancy but there are many women in business who find that when they do go into local government, getting time off for meetings and trying to fit local government tasks in with running a business are pretty difficult. Let us not make any bones about it. This is a difficult job and it is more difficult for women.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> There are some concerns regarding co-option and the person who may take over the position. Some people say it is eroding the democratic will of the people. I can tell them it is not. I have first-hand experience of co-option. If co-option is put in place for the people who are going to do the work on the ground for the people, they will respect that decision made by the councillor who needs the co-option. I welcome the legislation. It is another Bill that breaks down the barriers for women and I thank the Minister of State for it.</p>

          <from>Senator Rebecca Moynihan<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_90">I have a few questions that have been passed on to me by councillors around the country but I will first make a point about other women who do not get access to maternity leave because I sometimes feel this debate can be very focused on politicians. When I tell people I am going on maternity leave they say that, as a politician, I do not get access to maternity leave and support. The reality is that I will get paid support for 26 weeks and access to my full salary. There are many women in this country who do not have access to their full salary or support if they are not in public sector employment, particularly women who are self-employed. While it is very worthwhile implementing these measures, we must recognise that there are barriers for women in other industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">I would love to see a system put in place whereby women who run their own business or are self-employed get support for going on maternity leave and do not simply get statutory maternity leave. That is an important point to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> We have very far to go in terms of the rights of all women and of not presuming that every woman is a public sector worker who gets her full salary or is employed in one of the bigger industries, is well-paid and gets full salary when she goes on maternity leave. I would like to see supports put in place particularly for women who are in the home, unemployed and looking after children or adults so they also can take their time to look after a newborn baby. I think the same applies. Not all work is paid. That is an important point to make in terms of what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> This is very welcome. On many occasions during my 11 years as a member of a local authority, I have been left holding the baby, so to speak, for colleagues who came in to vote on various matters or who had to attend statutory meetings. Inevitably, it is always colleagues who support them. I have been in situations whereby women with newborn babies who should have been at home felt obliged to be present in the council chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> It was very interesting when Deputy Wynne had to bring her baby into the Dáil one evening to vote. Some people were calling it a mark of progress. I do not think it was a mark of progress because no breastfeeding mother should have to bring her child into one of the Houses after hours. Deputy Wynne should have been facilitated and supported to be at home to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> I want to make another point about some of the facilities that we have available to us in the Oireachtas. We have the Oireachtas crèche. I am luck enough that I will be able to get a place in September. However, some Members have been told that they will not be able to get places. In addition, the place is for five days each week. That is fine for people in Dublin, but this Seanad and the Dáil contain representatives from all over the country who have to come up here for two or three days. They should be facilitated to be able keep their children with them after the period of maternity leave ends and be able to put them in the crèche on a part-time basis. That is a barrier, particularly for Members from rural areas. While we are passing this very good legislation, which is only a start, we have to look at the other structures in the Oireachtas and how we support people coming from all over the country. I would like the Oireachtas crèche to be able to offer part-time childcare over the Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to people coming up from the country in order that they can spend as much time as possible with their children, particularly if they are small babies. It is only 26 weeks that we get.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> Can the Minister of State confirm that if a councillor requests an absence for leave for whatever reason, then on each occasion on which something is voted on by the local authority, there will be no pressure that person to come back in after a month to vote, particularly if it is an important local matter? If that happens, will it mean that the temporary substitute will be deemed to no longer be a substitute? Does it have to pass each local authority meeting at each stage? I just want some clarification on that.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinGarvey" eId="spk_34">
          <from>Senator Róisín Garvey<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_97">I will try to speak to the issue at hand and not to every single issue under the sun relating to women. This will probably be one of the best pieces of legislation ever passed. It will go down in history. I thank the Minister of State on behalf of all women in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> Becoming a councillor is often the first step to getting everywhere else, namely, to the Seanad or the Dáil. This is momentous win for the women of Ireland - and for the men as well - because they have been carrying the can for far too long. We are happy to take on a bit more responsibility if we get the chance. This maternity leave legislation will make a massive difference. As a single parent, I felt I could not take on the role until my child was reared. Doing so just seemed impossible. This is a monumental occasion. Of course, there are many other issues that the Opposition likes to bring up that are not relevant to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> The Minister of State started the process relating to this legislation. In March 2021, he set up an all-female working group to examine the provision of maternity leave for county and city councillors. It is great. In Clare alone, we have three female councillors out of 28. I am not easily intimidated, but I found it very intimidating when I served as a councillor. It was only when I came into the Seanad and saw many women - we have a good representation of females in the Seanad compared with the Dáil or local authorities - that I realised how it makes you feel when you are in a room that is mainly occupied by men. I would not have been aware of that until I experienced being in a political atmosphere with many women alongside me. It affects us, no matter how confident or unintimidated we think we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> This legislation very important. When trying to get people to think about running for local elections - I have been talking to different women - they just could not see how it would be possible in the absence of this legislative change. This maternity leave is huge. More and more women realise that they have to stand up and that their voices need to be heard in every chamber. Without maternity leave, that would not be possible. This is a good day for women and men in Ireland, and a good day for young people to see that we value women as much as men and they will need maternity leave because of all of the things that go with it. We need breastfeeding rooms in every single local authority, not, “Oh we have breastfeeding supports in the toilet or the disabled toilet.” I have often been shown the disabled toilet as the place where I could have breastfed my son. That is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_101"> Women can come back to work if there are supports in the workplace around breastfeeding. They can take the maternity leave, but such supports would also empower them to come back to work. Many friends of mine have to find a toilet to express milk, for instance, in the middle of the working day. They have to sit in a toilet to do that, which is just backward. Breastfeeding is the best thing you can do for your child. We need proper facilities. It is not good enough anymore to expect a woman to hide herself away in order to express milk. Many women find it very depressing to sit and hide away when doing the most natural thing in the world. Supports in this regard will have to follow on from the provision of this maternity leave. That will increase the ability of women to come back to work as well. Women want choices. We do not all need to take maternity leave for the time we can. Some of us need to take it for longer and some of us could come to work sooner if there were better supports in the context of breastfeeding and expressing milk.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> It is a good day and this a good Bill. We are improving matter slowly. It would be great to see more women running in elections for local authorities. We need them. Everybody needs them. It is not just a case of women can do better; we are equal to men. This is a very good day, and I appreciate this Bill. For men, even if they are feminists, it might be hard to understand how important it is. The experience women have when it comes to trying to juggle being a mother and going back to work is phenomenal. It is brain-melting trying to figure out how you are supposed to do it all. Now we can have women who will feel that they will be able to stand for election and be supported in the job of a county councillor, which, up until the advent of this Bill, they have not been. I hope it will encourage many more women to step up and join us in trying to have gender balance at every level of politics in Ireland. It could make a huge difference. Why should you not get maternity leave if you need to be with your child when you also want to be a politician?</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> I thank the Minister of State for this legislation. We have not always agreed on everything, but this is a very important day. He should be proud of himself. I will call the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, a feminist from today on. </p>
          <p eId="para_104"> Ar son mhná na hÉireann, is lá iontach agus stairiúil é seo. Má thugtar an deis seo do mhná, b’fhéidir go n-athróidh sé gach rud. I firmly believe that if we had more women involved in things, we would have fewer wars and less destruction of the planet. Many things would be done better if we had gender balance. It would be better for men and women. The patriarchy has never served men or women well. We have been fitted into stereotypes that do not suit anybody. Many males struggle with the patriarchy as well. This Bill has definitely opened a chink in that old historic armour around the patriarchy. I thank the Minister of State very much for his work on it.</p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_105">I congratulate the Minister of State on the Bill. It is definitely long overdue and it is very welcome. Credit to the Minister of State and his Department for all their work on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> The swiftness of this Bill’s journey through the Oireachtas signifies both the importance of the legislation and the broad support for it that exists in the Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">It is rare for us all to be in agreement but I am glad it is recognised collectively that we need to make structural changes to make space for women to participate equally in public life. </p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I congratulate the many present and future councillors whose lives will be changed by the provision of maternity leave. So many women councillors have been campaigning for this change for many years. Many of them have had to contend with the challenges of being new mothers and have had to resume council duties almost immediately after the birth of their children, which placed a huge strain on them and their families. This pressure is felt most acutely by women councillors who are independent or representing small parties. Sometimes they are the only councillors of their political persuasion represented in a council chamber. If they are absent from the council chamber, their perspective goes entirely unheard. I commend the determination and commitment to public service shown by these councillors, but no one should be expected to make that kind of sacrifice. </p>
          <p eId="para_109"> I hope this legislation will encourage women who have not previously thought about standing for election to consider it ahead of the 2024 local elections. There are women all over this country who have fresh ideas and perspectives that can be brought to bear to improve their areas and serve their communities. If they are tuning in to this debate, I encourage them to get involved. It may seem like a totally impossible idea but everything feels impossible until it is done. Politics needs more reluctant politicians and it needs more women.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> Only 24% of local councillors are women. Entering such an overwhelmingly male environment can be extremely daunting, even when so many of the men make concerted efforts to be welcoming and inclusive. More needs to be done to fully incorporate women into political life. It is important that political parties nominate more women candidates and ensure their female members are protected from discrimination and harassment. The timing of council meetings in the evenings is understandable because most councillors also have other jobs that take up their time during typical office hours. However, evening meetings can impede the participation of women, who are more likely to have caring responsibilities on top of their paid work. I acknowledge it is a complicated area and certainly do not have all the answers, but I believe the possibilities created by the widespread adoption of video-conferencing technology might need to be explored further. Politics works best when it is truly representative, and government at local and national levels should reflect the people it serves. </p>
          <p eId="para_111"> I hope the energy and momentum surrounding the push to provide maternity leave for councillors inspires action to make maternity leave available for Members of the Oireachtas. Women are serving at all levels of our politics and it is important that structural changes be made to enable their full and equal participation. This is a good opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, on the birth of her son. Her taking time off is an incredibly brave and inspiring step towards a more modern and inclusive form of politics; however, she can take leave because she is a member of a major party and a Minister in a Government with a solid parliamentary majority. More needs to be done in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Twenty-three percent of Deputies are women. That is half the rate in Sweden, which has a 46% female Parliament. Sweden has a system of maternity leave for Members of Parliament whereby women can co-opt someone for the duration of their leave. This means constituents are represented, perspectives are expressed and Members of Parliament can take the time to bond with and care for their babies. I would replicate this model in Ireland. It is claimed that there is a constitutional barrier to the provision of maternity leave to Members of the Oireachtas. If that is the case, we are fortunate to have a Constitution that can be amended by the people. The Oireachtas Committee on Gender Equality is already looking into how to amend the Constitution to make it more representative of women’s equal status. The Article 41 reference to women’s position in the home stands out as the most problematic and antiquated feature of the Constitution, and the Government has committed to addressing this. Concurrent referenda on Article 41 and maternity leave for Members of the Oireachtas would comprise an effective and worthwhile programme of constitutional reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> I agree with Senator Moynihan that we have to highlight that there are barriers for women. I totally agree on women working in other industries. We have to be mindful that people in the music industry, for example, do not get maternity leave, which can be very difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> I reiterate my congratulations to the Minister of State and all the councillors who have campaigned for this change. They have made Irish politics a more inclusive and hospitable place for women. This is a major achievement. The Minister of State and his Department should be very proud of what they have achieved today. Ireland has made extraordinary progress in the field of gender equality in recent decades but those achievements should not bring on complacency. Instead, they should inspire us to continue to fight for a truly equal and feminist republic.</p>

          <p eId="para_117"> A Aire Stáit, maith thú. Comhghairdeas. Well done. This is a really good day. Is lá iontach agus stairiúil é. I am a woman like many other women and men who have put themselves forward to represent their communities. Our local government is the cornerstone of our democracy. If we do not have a vibrant, strong, well-functioning local government, our democracy is undermined. We are all willing to do anything we can to support our local elected members and local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> It is a great day that the Government and Oireachtas are ensuring that all local authority members will have access to maternity leave. I acknowledge that and thank the Minister of State for it. When we acknowledge our progress, we must recognise and never forget how long it has taken us to get here. Our local government system dates from 1890. It has been updated over the years. I have had three pregnancies, like many others. Pregnancy and parenthood are uncertain, unknown journeys. None of us knows what we are embarking on when we become parents. It can be incredibly rewarding and challenging, but what is really important is that people are supported in every respect, including to have healthy and happy lives, and feel supported in getting on with the daily challenges. The people who put themselves forward to represent their local communities need to be supported. That is what this legislation will do. In most other occupations, it is a given. There are very few jobs that anybody would apply for that would not come with maternity leave or basic workers’ rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> I commend all the organisations that have worked to get us to this point. I commend the councillors who have served their time and communities. I commend their representative groups: AILG and LAMA. I commend all the non-governmental organisations, such as the National Women’s Council of Ireland and Women for Election, which work quietly daily to promote and champion our democracy and, most important, participation therein. The role of the local authority member is often belittled and ridiculed. It is one we disrespect at our peril because local authority members are the ones closest to our communities and who understand most those communities’ needs, wants and ambitions. They are the ones best served to inform us all. Maith thú, a Aire Stáit, agus comhghairdeas leis an Rialtas. I look forward to this legislation being used by generations of women in the future. As Senator Black said, there will be local elections in 2024. I hope the legislation will encourage more participation in them.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I congratulate the Minister of State. We really appreciate all the work he has put into this. He has made it and the Moorhead report a priority from the moment he took office. In that spirit, I thank the councillor representative groups – AILG and LAMA – and Women for Election, which do an excellent job.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">I see the Minister of State is very much supportive of their work with funding; and the working group of councillors and our own councillor, Lorraine Hall, for all the work that she has done. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy McEntee. I hope we can find a resolution for Ministers, Deputies and Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> What I like about this legislation is that it ensures that councillors are taken in under the Maternity Protection Act, that it is recognised as maternity leave and that the legislation is being amended with all the security of employment, and they are being treated like employees. The Local Government Act has been amended to remove the requirement for them to be subject to section 18(4A) or 18 (4B), so that they do not have to ask permission to go on maternity leave. The temporary absence piece of this has been introduced as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> This legislation makes sure that the individual gets access to maternity leave, but the bigger picture is the impact it is going to have on women in politics, because we have a major issue with getting women onto the ballot paper. They are underrepresented. Our PR system is a competitive one, but it does mean that it is a very hard decision for any parent, especially women, that politics does come first. That is probably the biggest barrier for women going into politics. This legislation helps because it is the entitlement side of things but the Minister of State has also brought in the supports. That is what is making the meaningful difference in terms of the struggle to juggle, with the administrative support and the substitution. I will get on to my questions now, I am sorry.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I note the Cathoirleach's ruling about the two minutes. I will take that time. I cannot thank the Minister of State enough. He has been a real champion of councillors. I do not just say that here today. That is the case on a whole range of fronts. It is important that is acknowledged. He was a councillor himself and therefore he has come up through the system. I genuinely thank him for that. He has worked constructively with members of parties and none across the Houses, but also in local authorities. That is something that has been recognised. I know the Minister of State has had a lot of ongoing work with the AILG and LAMA, and they appreciate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> I thank the civil servants behind the Minister of State. I am familiar with them. They know me and we know each other. We have had a lot of exchanges over many things. I am fully supportive of this initiative. I am fully supportive of bringing more women into politics, but I do not just want them to run for the local council.

          <p eId="para_130">Fine Gael did not elect one woman to the Seanad. That was a disappointment but, how and ever, the Taoiseach nominates 11 and the party nominates ten. I genuinely acknowledge the very substantial contribution by all of the ten women in the Seanad. That is fantastic. I like competition; it is good for politics. Hopefully, we will bring people up through local government and they will then come through, compete in the general election, then in Seanad elections and we will have a big turnover of Senators. Let us see it all the way through, not only half the way and stop. It is a full cycle and I wish it every success.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> I thank the Minister of State for his work. He has done a fantastic job. I hope he will still be in local government after next Saturday because he has done an amazing job. What is more important, he has united people across the spectrum. One takeaway from all of this is that we should be mindful that we must not erode the powers of councillors. We have the Land Development Agency. We have An Bord Pleanála and planning. We have come from communities, community groups and community action groups. I know most Members here have been involved. Let us continue to support them. We will be challenged in the coming weeks. Let us see if people stand up for local councils then.</p>

          <p eId="para_132">I also welcome this piece of legislation. I agree with Senator Boyhan and others that a lot has been achieved in the past two years. Sadly, very little was achieved in previous years so he was starting from a very low base, but this is very welcome, as are the other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> I support Senator Moynihan's view that we need a much broader debate on maternity leave across the public sector, in politics and every other aspect of society. We must do much more to get minority, diverse and disabled voices into local government as well. Unfortunately, there are not nearly enough people with declared disabilities in local government. If people with disabilities get elected to local government there is a better chance they will become Members of the Oireachtas. That is the route I came. I was lucky enough to get elected to local government. I spent eight years there and I made the transition to this House. That would not have happened had I not been a member of Clare County Council. The more we do on the ground to support people from minority backgrounds, Traveller backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds and people with disabilities, to become members of county councils, the better chance we will have of more diverse, equal and representative Seanad and Dáil Chambers.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> The Minister of State must consider a lot of measures. He must consider providing grants for people with disabilities so that they have a level playing pitch and can campaign. There are people who use wheelchairs and other aids to assist them, people who cannot drive and who are automatically at a disadvantage when it comes to campaigning, before they ever get onto a ballot paper and get elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> The Minister of State must seriously consider a diversity quota of 10%. Approximately 10% of the population have a disability. Probably another 5% to 10% come from a minority background. If we even started with a 10% quota and that political parties would have to run 10% of their candidates from a diverse, minority, disability background, it would end up producing a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> This is a very welcome piece of legislation and I commend the Minister of State on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I acknowledge the role of the Minister of State. As has been said time and time again, he has stepped up to the mark. My former PA, Mairéad O'Shea, has been very much involved. The Minister of State met with her. Those people are doing a lot of work to encourage more women into local politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Of course it is long past time that women had the entitlement to maternity leave. I hope this Bill will encourage more people. In my county of Roscommon the rate of female participation is about 22%. I acknowledge the female members: Councillors Orla Leyden, Valerie Byrne, Emer Kelly and Kathleen Shanagher. Senator Dolan referred to the fact that she spent a short time on Galway County Council. She has been replaced by an excellent councillor called Evelyn Parsons, who is doing a great job and continuing the good work there. I acknowledge her as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> I know we are very short on time. We must encourage more women into politics. We must do everything to support that. I send out a call to my own county today to ask more women to come forward for our own party and other parties if they wish, but preferably our own party, to stand for election come the next local elections. That is not too far away. We must all be aware of that as well. This is a very important piece of legislation. I thank the Minister of State very much for all he has done and the way he and his officials have pursued this with so much vigour. It is a major step forward. It is the right way to progress. I say well done all round.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I congratulate the Minister of State. From day one he has done an extraordinary job. I know this has been a personal mission of his to ensure that this provision was included. At one stage I tabled an amendment on the motion on the Moorhead report and the assurances he gave at that point were that we were going to have provisions for maternity leave for councillors. It is very important that we have democracy and inclusion at that local level because our daily quality of life is in the hands of local councils and they do an extraordinary job.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I also pay tribute to the fact that we have the temporary absences also included. While we have been focusing on maternity, that is an important aspect of the issue. Should life circumstances arrive at one's door over the five-year period, there is now an opportunity to put forward a bona fide reason and take time off.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I commend the work of Councillor Lorraine Hall, the AILG, LAMA and Women for Election. I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, who, while not at council level, has modelled how this could be done. I acknowledge the work of Deputy Carroll MacNeill, who set out the possibility that we would have an amendment to the Constitution to facilitate remote voting in the Dáil and the Seanad in order to facilitate Members going on maternity leave and other such instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> An awful lot of work has been done. This is an extraordinary achievement, and it is a great day. I thank the Minister of State for all his hard work.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">The Minister of State is very welcome to discuss this all-important issue. Congratulations to him and his officials on all that was involved in coming to this day, from LAMA to the AILG, to various councillors and various organisations, such as Women for Election and the Fine Gael women's group, which contributed to this. Well done to all who are out there promoting women.</p>
          <p eId="para_145"> I served on my council for 17 years, and during 15 of those years there were no more than three females on the council, and they were all older females or single because young mothers found it so prohibitive in that there was no maternity leave and there were costs associated with the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> Today is therefore a good day for females. This is also about participation and encouraging people to participate. I have worked with many young women and young mothers who ran in the most recent local elections. This is about encouraging more women to run, and I believe that this historic day will give that encouragement and support to females to put their names forward. Females have so much to give once elected. I congratulate the Minister of State and wish him all the best and wish this legislation a speedy passage.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I too warmly welcome this legislation. It is really important that this substitute system be available now to women who have a baby. It is important, however, as others have said, to say that this is only a first step. It is in some ways ironic that we have the publication of the recommendations of the Committee on Gender Equality today. Some of the issues are pay, access, the hours of meetings and technology. As Senator Seery Kearney and I am sure others have mentioned, the inability to vote remotely in these Houses is also an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_148"> However, not every woman will want to take this up. I was fortunate to be elected when I was pregnant with my third baby. I came and felt I had to come to meetings ten days after my baby was born. I know, however, that I would never have been able to do that on the birth of my first baby because I was not seen outside the house for the first seven weeks as I was breastfeeding my baby and was simply not able. Women will make different choices, but it is vital we have a choice as to whether to take that maternity cover. I know that the substitute system is available to councillors. Dublin City Council staff and officials were brilliant to me during that time in my life when I was a councillor and had just had my baby.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> Lastly, some concerns have been articulated about the design of the substitute cover. My colleague, Senator Moynihan, raised those questions this morning. We would like to hear from the Minister of State on that. The message has to go out that this is a really important system, a system that needs to be availed of and a system that cannot be abused, and the design needs to be got right.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">I welcome this very important legislation. This Bill is not only about enhancing the role of local authorities but also empowering their elected representatives to serve and to do their job without fear or worry. The points being made in the debate are well made. The Minister of State should be acknowledged as the person who delivered for councillors in his term, to be fair to him. He delivered on the thorny issues of councillors' pay and conditions and he deserves the support and thanks not just of Members in this House, who advocated on behalf of the councils, but also of the local authority members for his work. We should praise the AILG and LAMA for their representation and advocacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> I have spoken on the Appropriations Bill. We should not put impediments in the way of local authority members in delivering their service and their role to the people they represent. We should support them in every single way.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> I will make this final point, which is worth making. The vast majority of local authority members work in addition to fulfilling their roles as members of local authorities. The majority of their time now is spent doing council work and their role has been enhanced and changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> Today is a good day. I thank the Minister of State for what he has done and wish him well on Saturday.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I thank Members for their very kind wishes, for the work the House has done in assisting me in trying to deliver on some of these key proposals, such as the Moorhead report and, obviously, the Bill before us, and for ensuring the Bill's swift passage through the House. I will refer to a few points that were raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> In response to Senator Dolan, the draft regulations provide for a review mechanism. It is very important we would review the operation of the mechanism and see how it is working. As I said to Senator Moynihan, it is important we have that mechanism through issuing directions if we find that it is not operating in the spirit of the law. It was inserted to ensure that the views of the local authority member going on maternity leave would be taken into consideration in respect of the choice of the temporary substitute. Obviously, the temporary substitute will cease in his or her position when the member comes back from maternity leave. That is what women wanted. When we had all the women councillors convened in that group they said they wanted choice and flexibility. That is why we have given them the option of either a temporary substitute or support to carry out their role.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> We now have remote voting in our local authority meetings whereby local authority members can log in and vote remotely. We brought that in through the county development plan process during the global pandemic. That too is now a key reform mechanism that councillors can use to support them as they go about their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> Senator Buttimer is very much correct about the huge obligations now on the councillor to discharge his or her functions. Many will know from doing the county development plans how difficult it is to try to comply with all the regulations and responsibilities now placed on local authority members.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> In response to Senator Currie, I am absolutely confident about the scope in Article 28 of the Constitution for the role of local government to be maintained. It gives the Government significant legislative scope to try to ensure that it is maintained. As a female councillor goes on maternity leave, the option of having a temporary substitute fill in for her maintains that service to the public and to citizens. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> As for policies, we have a huge journey still to continue in trying to bring in more supports for councillors. Many of the Senators have raised issues specific to ensuring that family-friendly places exist in our local authorities. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I will continue to work with the House in trying to bring about those incremental changes. I appreciate that the pace of change and of the introduction of these supports can be frustrating sometimes, but we will do our very best to get as much as we can done in the time I am honoured to hold the role I hold.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group, I want to extend our sincere condolences and sympathies to the Rooney family on the passing of Private Seán Rooney in Lebanon. It was incredibly sad to wake up to the news today that one of our soldiers lost his life on a peacekeeping mission. It was a life lost in the service of his country and the UN, and a reminder to all of us that all of our soldiers - the men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann - who serve abroad on peacekeeping missions put their lives at risk every day that they serve. I thank Private Rooney for his service and extend our sympathies to the wider defence community, his fellow peacekeeping colleagues and those who were injured in the same attack and are still recovering. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I wish to draw the House's attention to the report of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality that was launched earlier today. Senator Pauline O'Reilly, Doherty and Higgins and myself were all members of the committee. We worked extensively for a number of months in the committee to publish the report. It is fair to say that the response this morning in the AV room was hugely positive. Many of the members of the citizen's assembly, which made 45 recommendations that we then worked on to see how we could implement them as an Oireachtas, were there to join us. The support and the welcome for the report was huge. It was lovely, for us as members, to get that feedback. </p>
          <p eId="para_179"> As Members will be aware, one of the key recommendations is for a constitutional referendum to be held in 2023 on the amendment of Articles 40 and 41. Many Members and citizens will be aware of the conversations around the woman's place in the home, with particular reference to Article 41(2), but there are other key recommendations as well, including a pension system for carers; extended parental leave for the first year of a child's life for both parents; recognition of care responsibilities; and recognition of the cost associated with caring for those more vulnerable in our society. While a lot of the focus will be on the recommendation to hold a constitutional referendum to amend Articles 40 and 41, there are some other crucial and key recommendations in the report. I urge Members, in any spare time they might have, to read the report and the recommendations, in particular. It was a pleasure and a privilege to be part of that work. I look forward to working on a cross-party basis, as we did on the committee, next year to get that referendum up and running and to achieve the result that we, as a committee, have recommended. </p>
          <p eId="para_180">That is all I would like to say on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I want to commend a former colleague in this House, Deputy Bacik, who chaired that committee and who did tremendous work. Her legal expertise was referred to by many members of the committee at the launch this morning. As well as that, her political expertise and experience came through in keeping the group together and making sure we adhered to the tight schedule relating to our work programme. The committee was, of course, time-limited nature. I thank and commend the Deputy on her work.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">On behalf of the Fine Gael group, I join everyone else in offering condolences to the family and loved ones of Private Seán Rooney from Newtowncunningham, County Donegal, whose home unit was the 27th Infantry Battalion in Dundalk, on his tragic passing in Lebanon. To the families of the other injured soldiers, I say that hope they make a speedy recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> As this is the final Order of Business before the break, I want to thank, on behalf of the Fine Gael group, the staff of the Seanad Office. I thank Martin Groves, Bridget and all the team, including Eden and Ilinca, and I thank the Cathaoirleach for all the courtesy shown to Senators over the past year. We have had a good and busy session and I know staff members have been put under pressure at times by the business but we have had a positive year and I look forward to the new term in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> We have had a wonderful and exciting World Cup, and the final between Argentina and France is coming up. I want to raise the case of the Iranian footballer, Amir Reza Nasr Azadani, who has been sentenced to execution for campaigning for women's rights in Iran. He and 11 other people have been sentenced to death as part of the raft of legitimate protests in Iran. I ask the Leader that his case be raised with the Iranian ambassador. We have seen appalling abuses in Iran in recent months due to demands for rights and some of us have met representatives of groups in Iran that are gravely concerned about the tragedies and executions that have taken place over 40 years in Iran. I ask that the case of Amir be raised with the ambassador.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">I thank the Leader for organising a moment of silence for Private Seán Rooney, which is important. I have family in Lebanon and I have been there on many occasions. I value and understand the work that is carried out there, as do many of the people in Lebanon. There are huge Irish connections there because of our relationship with Lebanon's UN peacekeeping force, so this is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_186"> I have great respect for this House and its staff. I particularly want to thank the Clerk of the Seanad. Bridget and their team for their work. I also thank the Leader and Deputy Leader. They are a seamless pair and they have operated with great unity. It is one of the things that is seen in politics. I want to pay tribute to both of them because there was never a difference in how they operated. They transcended all of that. I genuinely mean that. I said it to someone yesterday when I was talking about both of them. The reversal of their roles will be so easy because they have operated in partnership. I pay tribute to them for that. I want to pay a particular tribute to the Leader. She has gone out on a limb occasionally, but she made it and did an excellent job. I hope she will continue to do an excellent job in her new role. I wanted to acknowledge her contribution because it is important to do so. The Leader was prepared to step out of the political zone and was not afraid to challenge the odd thing, person or system. That is to be acknowledged, and great credit is due to her. She made the job her own and she has done it well.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I attended the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, conferences a few weeks ago, along with some colleagues here. The Ukrainian delegation spoke in the Polish Parliament and read a letter from a little boy called Ivan. Ivan said he wrote to St. Nicholas and his mother asked him what he was going to ask for this year. He said that last year he had asked for a tricycle and a toy train and this year he was going to do something different. She told him to ask for the same again this year and that he might get what he asked for, because he did not get what he asked for last year. He said he would not do that and that he has only three asks. He said he wants his father back and that he would also like light and water. With that, the president of the OSCE asked that all the lights in the chamber be extinguished in order that there would be darkness . He asked people to take out their mobile phones and put on their torchlights. That was an important ritual and it reminded us of darkness turning into light. When we talk about peacekeeping and building bridges, it is important that we remember the significance of Christmas. It is a time for family and home, but many will neither have a home to go to or will have no loved ones. They will also have no chance of meeting many of their loves ones because they are gone - they have been extinguished out of this life. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> I commend all of the agencies in Ireland that have opened up their hearts wide and brought in Ukrainian people. May we continue to do that. There is a thing about talking about hospitality one day and not another. We have a large diaspora and we are a country whose inhabitants have fled, for many reasons, all over the world to look for support. Most of us do so but we need to challenge ourselves. We are politicians and political leaders. We belong to all parties and none and we influence decisions. Let us go out renewed with confidence that we will not apologise and that we will make this country home and welcome for people in real need of food, homes and support and who want to rebuild their lives. More importantly, many of them will want and choose to stay in Ireland and that is a wonderful thing. Well done to all the people involved in that work but let us continue to be brave and courageous enough to take on the critics, stand firm in solidarity and make Ireland the place it is and that we want it to be; welcoming, supporting, encouraging and enriching. If we do so, we will see the qualities and benefits of enriching that diversity, which will make our society a better place.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I join those commending the Leader on arranging a most appropriate minute's silence for the late Private Seán Rooney. On behalf of the Green Party, an Comhaontas Glas, I convey our deepest sympathies to the family of Private Rooney, his counterpart from Ireland who was injured and the other soldiers who are not from Ireland and who were also injured in the attack. We have praised the Defence Forces on a number of occasions in this House. We reminded ourselves that they put themselves in harm's way. I recall that on a number of occasions we recognised the invaluable, brave and courageous work of Óglaigh na hÉireann. It is so poignant when we suffer the loss of someone from that wonderful family of Óglaigh na hÉireann and when a member of the Defence Forces who is trying to make this world a better place pays the ultimate price. On behalf of the Green Party, I offer my deepest sympathies to all his family and to the greater Óglaigh na hÉireann family.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> I am acutely aware of the value of Óglaigh na hÉireann, particularly as I come from Kildare. I am sure my party is no different from any other party in Kildare and around Ireland in that we have a number of direct connections with the Army and with retired people who have served a number of tours of duty in Lebanon and other places and who are part of the democratic process and living the next chapter of their lives. I am sure that is replicated throughout Ireland but nowhere more is that so amplified than in Kildare, where there is such a rich tradition in the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> On behalf of my group, I thank the staff, led by Mr. Groves and Bridget, and all concerned for their wonderful and dedicated public service in making this place so efficient. I also thank the Cathaoirleach, the Leader and all those in positions of responsibility. We are all in positions of responsibility. We made the place work so seamlessly for the past 12 months and we got through a great deal of work. I wish everyone the season's greetings.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">Cuirim fáilte roimh mo chomhghleacaithe, Francie agus Mickey, fosta. On behalf of the Sinn Féin group in the Seanad, I want to convey our deepest sympathies to Private Rooney's family. We send our solidarity and support to them and to all the families of the soldiers who were injured alongside him.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">As colleagues have said, we often discuss issues affecting the Defence Forces and we often talk about them at a macropolitical level. This is the most tragic reminder that behind that, there are men and women serving with great distinction in our peacekeeping efforts around the world. They are the priority. I hope the outpouring of sympathy, solidarity and support for the families will give some comfort and solace to Private Seán Rooney's family over what will be, no doubt, a harrowing period for them, his friends and his community.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> I note the launch this morning of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality's report and look forward to reading through it. I also look forward to hopefully getting time to discuss its recommendations in the Seanad come the new year. We need to bring about a number of important, outstanding changes as a society but constitutional amendments are also required.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> This brings me to my last point. I hope we will see, as early as possible in the new year, a referendum Bill on extending the franchise for presidential elections to citizens outside the State. It is a programme for Government commitment. Parties across the board agree on the issue. I believe it would be very positive and hopeful campaign. Anything that enfranchises, enables and emboldens citizenship is to be encouraged and welcomed. Other colleagues have already mentioned Ireland's diaspora and the valuable contribution they bring to our lives here. Very often, we ask them for that contribution. This would be a way to acknowledge their citizenship and their link and value to us. It would also be a very clear expression to citizens in the North that no matter what community they come from, they have a stake in the Presidency and in ensuring we have a President who represents the Irish nation in its broadest and most inclusive sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> I thank Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and the whole team in the Seanad Office, the Leader and Deputy Leader and all those who provide us with the first-class help and support we receive. There are too many to mention but we know who they all are. I believe I can speak for everyone when I say, without wishing to sound clichéd, that we really could not do it without them. I wish everyone a happy Christmas and happy new year. </p>

The soldier who was injured, Private Shane Kearney, is also very much in my thoughts. I hope he makes a full and speedy recovery. It is an horrific and awful tragedy. My thoughts are with all of the soldiers serving in Lebanon and their families who are no doubt worried sick about them. Irish peacekeepers are the pride of our nation. They are ambassadors of our shared commitment to peace, solidarity and human rights. We owe them a great debt.</p>

          <p eId="para_203"> I congratulate Senator Mary Fitzpatrick and the 1916 Relatives Association on their briefing yesterday about the campaign to name the new children's hospital after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. It is a fantastic idea. I want to add my name to the long list of Members who are backing this proposal. Dr. Lynn was not only a leader in the 1916 Rising, she was a medical innovator and a friend to Dublin's poor. She was involved in setting up St. Ultan's Children's Hospital, which is just up the road from where I was born and reared. She was a socialist and feminist. By commemorating her, we would not only be paying tribute to an heroic individual but we would also be remembering more widely the people who worked hard in the Irish revolutionary period, which was sadly quelled in the early years of the Free State. I hope the broad agreement on this issue is translated into a tangible result.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> I wish the Leader and everyone else a very peaceful and happy Christmas. I thank the Leader for all the work she has done and I thank Senators. It truly has been a privilege working with everybody. I love the work here. I love the way the Seanad works. I thank the Cathaoirleach for the phenomenal work he has done in his role. I express huge gratitude to the staff, Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and all of the team. They do not get enough credit. They work extremely hard and keep this place going.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I express my gratitude to the activists, experts and campaigners who have supported me in my role as a parliamentarian and Seanadóir. The people I try to represent here are those work in civil society and for social justice. I hope I can reflect their passion and dedication for creating a more caring and equal society while I am in here.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">I join the Leader and others in expressing condolences to our Army personnel and, in particular, to the family of Private Seán Rooney. It is very sad and even sadder coming up to Christmas. We hope the injured parties make a full recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I want to use my time to pay tribute to the Cathaoirleach and the way he has chaired the Seanad. A lot of fantastic work was done and the Seanad is in a far stronger position than it was. I join in the thanks expressed to Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and the other staff. They are fantastic and I greatly appreciate the way they support and help us, especially when in the Chair.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> The Leader has also been fantastic. I will always remember her role in the case of Robert Pether and his family and the effort she has made to try to get him freed. Unfortunately, Mr. Pether will spend another Christmas locked up in an horrific Iraqi jail. His family, who live in Elphin in County Roscommon, are devastated that, once again, another Christmas has come and their husband and dad is locked up. It is upsetting for Desree and the children.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> Everybody wants Santy to come now. Senator Buttimer has already written to him looking for a new chair and I believe the Cathaoirleach will be looking for a smaller chair this time, which he will probably get. I too have written to Santa and all I want is a ticket to Senator Black's concert in Carrick-on-Shannon with her female friends. I would love that. I do not know what Senator Doherty has written to Santa for. She will still be a very busy lady but I am sure she will have more time for canvassing out in Fingal now.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> I wish everybody a very happy Christmas. This is a fantastic Chamber. I was so devastated when I lost my Dáil seat but the Seanad has been a unique experience. We work well together as a group, which is fantastic. Even though we have political differences at times, we all have one thing in common - a desire to make Ireland a better place for everybody.</p>

          <p eId="para_213"> I also wish to be associated with the remarks in respect of Private Seán Rooney. I pass on my own sympathies not only to his family and friends, but also his colleagues who were present in Lebanon with him. I wish the soldier who was injured a speedy recovery. I hope he will make a full recovery. It must have been very traumatic for all of the soldiers serving on the peacekeeping mission to be attacked last evening. I pass on my sympathies.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> I would be remiss of me not to comment on the report launched by consultants this morning on hospital waiting lists and the failure to meet targets, especially in two hospitals in Limerick and Cork. We will have a new Leader in the new year but I will certainly call for a debate on this matter early in the new year. We are now in a cold snap and many people have been admitted to hospital. Some have had to wait up to 60 hours, which is not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I want to recap the year I have had in here. Some of it has been good and some not so good. One of the best things was the coffee morning we had here on 9 March in solidarity with Ukraine. Some 35 ambassadors came in to show solidarity with the Ukrainian ambassador. We raised over €13,000 for the Red Cross that morning. Then we had the surrogacy committee. Although I might not have got a mention here yesterday, I believe I contributed the alternative voice at that committee. It is important to hear other voices in this Chamber and that it is not just an echo chamber for one voice.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I want to remember the Creeslough community. They face one of the toughest Christmases they will ever face. It is their first Christmas since the tragedy. I am thinking of those families this morning and of my colleague, Senator Buttimer, who will not have his dad this year, Senator Fitzpatrick, who will not have her dad, Dermot, and our colleague, Bridget, in the Seanad office, whose brother, Pat, passed away. Remember all of those who have an empty chair at their table this Christmas. We think of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> I thank Martin, Bridget and all the team in the Seanad Office. They have been spectacular. I thank the ushers, the catering staff and the cleaners. I think I gave Alan Ruane a heart attack when I said in March that we had 35 ambassadors coming. I did not realise there was a massive protocol around that but, thankfully, he obliged. I thank the Library and Research Department for all the briefings they give us. They are fantastic. I thank my staff, Grainne, Mark, Robert and Shauna, the staff in my Duleek office, Caroline and Vani, and my two councillors. They keep the whole show going. It is important we look after our people on the ground. I wish all my colleagues in the Seanad a happy and peaceful Christmas. We look forward to robust and respectful debates, please God, next year.</p>

          <from>Senator Malcolm Byrne<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_219">I echo the expressions of sympathy for the late Private Seán Rooney, his family and the wider Óglaigh na hÉireann community, which is a close-knit community. Private Kearney and the other soldiers who were injured must also be in our thoughts. Ireland has a proud tradition in peacekeeping and is the only county that has taken part in every UN peacekeeping mission. That is something of which we are very proud. When somebody gives his life in this way, it is right the nation should remember him.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Colleagues spoke of what they would like for Christmas. I am delighted that the Order Paper contains a motion on Ireland's membership of the European Council for Nuclear Research, CERN. I do not think there could be a greater Christmas present for Ireland's research community than for us to finally look at joining arguably the world's greatest scientific body. Working with the Leader, I hope we will see this happen in the new year. I am glad that the motion will be carried. I trust the Leader will sent it on to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris. I hope that in his last act before whatever happens on Saturday, the Minister might push the matter a little further.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> I echo the comments in praise of the Leader's work and leadership in this Chamber and of that of the Deputy Leader. They have provided leadership in terms of ensuring that we work collectively and have gone out on a limb at times in order to make sure that our voices are heard. That is appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> The Cathaoirleach has been extraordinarily innovative in what he has done in the past couple of years. I hope the new Cathaoirleach will continue with that spirit of innovation and use this Chamber in an imaginative way, and that we will look at and implement elements of Seanad reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> I thank Martin, Bridget and all of the Seanad staff, the ushers and everyone who works in Leinster House, including those who transcribe what we say. When we read it back, we often appear far more eloquent than perhaps we are on the floor of these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Senator Keogan is right that this will be a difficult Christmas. In many ways, however, it will be the first normal Christmas in three years. There are things we take for granted but we can appreciate them much more this year. I echo the wishes for everybody to have a happy Christmas and a peaceful new year.</p>

          <from>Senator Tim Lombard<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_225">I commend the Cathaoirleach. He has had a competent and capable two and a half years. It has to be acknowledged that the House has worked really well. The Leader and Deputy Leader have managed the show appropriately, and it has been a pleasure to work with them. It has been a good experience. It all comes down to teamwork. The Seanad staff are the most brilliant team one could ever deal with. It is a privilege to deal with them. I acknowledge Martin and the team for all they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> This is a sad morning because of the passing of an Irish soldier abroad in tragic circumstances. Only last week I had the privilege of having the Irish Army in Bandon at a Sean Hayes commemoration. People there spoke of the pride they have in the uniform and in what they do. This will rock them to their foundations. I offer my deepest sympathy to the Army and to the family of the private lost in the past 24 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> The next three or four months, from a business point of view, could be a major issue for us. Businesses in my part of the world are deeply upset and offended regarding a rate increase of 3.5% in Cork county. This increase in the commercial rate, on top of energy prices, labour and everything else going through the roof, will have a huge impact on their survival. It is about cash flow for the next three months. These are mainly pubs and restaurants. They envisage the next three months will be really tight and are looking to the Government to do things like warehouse taxes such as VAT to give them the opportunity to breathe. They will have a good summer, but they need to get there. We need a debate on how to put approaches and infrastructure in place so they can get over spring. That will be a struggle for them. I am not being political but anyone who thought it was a good idea to increase the rate by 3.5% in County Cork was mad. The industries are on their knees and the last thing they need is a rate increase across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> I commend the councillors who voted against it. It was a brave decision to vote against the management but they did it. Logic has to play out. We cannot put more burden on these communities that will be struggling. I fear what will happen in the next three months. We are a tourism operation. The Chair's part of the world and Cork South-West are basically the same in that respect. We will have a quiet spring. An increase in the rate and an inability to warehouse taxes could have a huge impact. If we come back in January, the first debate needed is with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, about the plan in place for the next three months to make sure that these industries survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> I wish everyone a happy Christmas. It is our first proper Christmas in years.. I am looking forward to it. I have six-year-old twins who have not stopped jumping up and down. Santa Claus is coming and it is wonderful. It is great that we are back out there and that life has really kicked off again.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I offer sympathies to the family of Seán Rooney, a young man of 23. The young men and women who have joined the Irish Defence Forces, Óglaigh na hÉireann, have taken on the mantle, responsibility and weight of representing Ireland and wearing the Irish flag abroad, as this young man did. We need to remember it is a sacrifice given on behalf of Ireland. We in the Houses of the Oireachtas should pay tribute to and acknowledge what has been done in our name and Ireland's name.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> I thank the Leader, Senator Doherty, who has managed the role so well for the past number of years. As a brand-new Senator, I have got to see how everything works, from the flow of legislation through to accommodating all Senators and groups, engaging through statements and motions and having the opportunity to speak on the topics of concern to us. I also acknowledge the Deputy Leader, Senator Chambers, and the Cathaoirleach, Senator Mark Daly, who allows us to speak and gives us a little leeway with time here and there, and also the Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Joe O'Reilly, who has done an excellent job.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> This year has flown. I thank all Senators for their support and the staff of the Houses and the staff in my office at home. I wish everyone a happy Christmas. We talk about our Christmas wish list. For me, it is being able to seeing the amount of legislation we are able to enact in law and the ground-breaking changes we are making. Just today, we saw legislation on maternity leave for councillors. I think of the changes we make daily, such as what Senator Seery Kearney has been able to do on surrogacy. As Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the committees, we are part of change and I am really proud to be part of that. </p>

          <p eId="para_233">I will talk about Private Seán Rooney. As can happen in sad situations like this, there has been a slight bit of misinformation in the national media which indicated he was a native of Donegal. Private Rooney was born and bred in Dundalk. He attended the Gaelscoil Muirtheimhne Mór and St. Mary’s College in Dundalk. His mum relocated to Donegal when he was in fifth year and he moved to Donegal for two or three years before coming back to Dundalk to serve in the Defence Forces, in the 27th Battalion. This is a dreadful day for many people in the local community, not only in Dundalk but in the Defence Forces and the wider country. Private Rooney has made the ultimate sacrifice in his service to the nation. He served in the 27th Battalion, which is based in Aiken Barracks in Dundalk. It is the same battalion in which Private Michael McNeela was serving when he died in Lebanon in 1989. I know I can speak on behalf of the House to an extent in saying we send all our thoughts and sympathies to Private Rooney's grandparents, Eugene and Rachel, all of his friends at home in Dundalk and the Defence Forces who are suffering immensely today. Let us get him back safely and take him to his home country and town in order that we can offer our sympathies in person.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">On this sombre day, I also pay tribute to Private Seán Rooney who tragically lost his life as a peacemaker. As Senator Malcolm Byrne said, he was part of our UNIFIL peacekeeping mission. We give thanks for Private Rooney and sympathise with his family. As Senator McGahon rightly and eloquently said, let us bring him home so that we can celebrate his life. We sympathise with his family and think of the injured soldiers who were with him as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> This morning, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, published a report on emergency departments in Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Limerick. It gives none of us any pleasure to ask that the Minister for Health come to the House as a matter of urgency for a debate on emergency department service provision in our acute hospitals. At a time when the health budget is €23 billion and we have increased the number of beds, including acute beds, in our hospitals, we see gridlock. More telling, HIQA is saying patients are not safe from harm. That is not good enough in a modern hospital system in Ireland. I ask that the Minister for Health come to the House in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> On a positive note, I join Members in commending and thanking members of staff across the parliamentary community for their work and assistance to us during the year, especially the ushers, the men and women on sound recording and in the Debates Office who make us sound and look better, and Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and all the team in the Seanad Office. I also thank the Cathaoirleach for the patience and tolerance he has shown us in the Chamber and the very equitable manner in which he has selected Commencement matters.</p>

          <from>Senator Martin Conway<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_237">It is a very sad day, as most speakers have mentioned. Private Seán Rooney has lost his life in the line of duty. We salute what he has achieved and we mourn with his family as a nation. We also wish Private Shane Kearney well on his road to recovery. Please God, his recovery will happen and will be swift.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Like others, I commend the Cathaoirleach. As I have told him privately on a number of occasions, he has been innovative and pushed the boundaries. Seanad 100 could not have been any better. I do not think anything could have been done differently or any better in that regard. One could not but have been proud to be here on Monday, seeing all the former Members and members of the diplomatic corps give dignified recognition to the people who served for the last 100 years in a House that has contributed so much to Irish society and created such equalities in the legislation introduced here over many decades. It was a fitting tribute. Well done to the Cathaoirleach and all involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> I also thank Martin Groves and Bridget Doody for the sterling work they and their team do for us in the Seanad. The members of the parliamentary community across all sections do a wonderful job. They show enormous patience and give us great support and advice. They are, in many ways, a parliamentary family as much as a parliamentary community. With Christmas here, everyone will get a break and we wish them every happiness. For those who lost loved ones over the course of the year, we are thinking of them in their first Christmas without their loved one.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> The Leader has done a fantastic job over the last two and a half years in responding and facilitating Senators and getting Ministers into the House to be held accountable. That is what we can do in this House and the Leader facilitates bringing Ministers in, sometimes at short notice, to address issues of national importance. We have had many of them here over the last couple of years. We have been through a pandemic, a health crisis. We have had Ministers for Health here and other Ministers being held accountable to the Seanad. I hope that will continue and I have no doubt it will under the new Leader and Cathaoirleach.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> I thank colleagues for their friendship and support. I commend them on the great work they do across the House. We are a diverse Chamber of many abilities. All those abilities combined is what makes Seanad Éireann the great, progressive and positive Chamber it is. When everyone has had a break and we are back here in January, I hope we will continue with, develop, improve and enhance the work we do, which will ultimately help the people of Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">I welcome to the Gallery some very special guests. The Kearney family are more than welcome. I thank them for coming. David Seery Kearney has a special interest in the House, as Senator Seery Kearney’s husband. The Senator's daughter-in-law Rosemary Kearney is also here, as are her grandchildren Eoin and Luke. I thank them for coming. We are excited and delighted to have them here. I call Senator Seery Kearney who is doing extraordinary work in Seanad Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">I thank the Cathaoirleach. I welcome everyone. This is an extraordinary moment for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_244"> I begin by expressing my sympathy to Private Seán Rooney’s family and friends and the family of Private Shane Kearney who are no doubt frightened and desperate to see their family member. To all our peacekeepers in Óglaigh na hÉireann, I express my sympathies today. It is a very sombre day for us as a nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> I acknowledge that this is the last Order of Business of the year. I assume I will have an opportunity tomorrow to express my deep appreciation for the Cathaoirleach.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">In case I am not afforded that opportunity, I thank him most sincerely. He has guided the Seanad through Covid, which was quite extraordinary. Many of us were new Senators. I have found him to be incredibly helpful, from the texts I have exchanged with him and the requests I have made of him to the most recent occasion when I relied on his extensive knowledge of the protocols around the Irish Flag. Hopefully, this has been instrumental in bringing about change. I will elaborate on that in the new year. In every way, I have found him to be incredibly inclusive. On a personal note, he has given me very sensitive latitude when I have needed it, for which I am very grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> I thank the Leader. I will say more about her tomorrow as we do a changing of the guard. I express my thanks to everyone who works around the Seanad and makes it happen. If I start listing them, I fear who would be left out. I really appreciate all the incredible hard work that is done around this House. </p>
          <p eId="para_248"> One of the things I learned this year concerns the need to hear all voices, including opposing voices. We quite often cross swords in this Chamber and outside it. It is really important that all voices are heard. In expressing divergent opinions, it is important that we are always respectful and compassionate and have empathy for the journey of the people with whom we may have a difference of opinion. I hope that in the year to come, we will debate the surrogacy legislation in the context of the entirety of the assisted human reproduction Bill. Thankfully, due to the Cabinet decision this week, there will be a section that will include international surrogacy. It is really important in that debate that there is a sensitivity to the fact that when we use crude terminology, we are demonising existing children in this State, their families and their terribly hard journeys. The children who were demonised this year, in the crude language that was sometimes used, included my daughter Scarlett. I will stand up for my right not to acknowledge the participation of an individual who was a party to doing that. I look forward to the debate. I look forward to the diversity. I think it will be a very good experience for us as a House. We must always proceed with great respect for the people whose lives are affected by the fact that we have the privilege of public office to stand up and speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_249">I join in expressing condolences to the young peacekeeper who lost his life and the peacekeeper who was injured in the service of the UN and a more peaceful world. That is a very sad thing. He was undertaking very important work.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> It is wonderful to hear such pride in the Seanad and what it has been historically. This year's Seanad 100 events have given us a chance to look at what it has been, what it is and what it might be, particularly if we move towards Seanad reform and crafting even more possibilities into the future. I commend Seanad 100 and the work that went into it by the Cathaoirleach, the Seanad team, the communications team and everybody across the House. I also thank the staff of the Seanad Office, the ushers, the transcribers and the translators. I join those who have thanked the Cathaoirleach for his really ambitious, committed and dedicated work for the Seanad over the past two and a half years, particularly over the past year. I also thank the Leader, who has worked in a collegiate and constructive manner with us as leaders of other groups throughout this period. We have had a shared goal for the Seanad and its role being recognised, actualised and expressed. I think that has been really important.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> I note the launch of the final report of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which is really exciting. It is not just a report; it is an action plan. It sets out an action plan with real timelines. I feel this is one of the proudest moments I have had in my time in the Seanad because we have something that looks to how our Constitution could reflect all families, recognise care inside and outside the home and, instead of having discriminatory language in it, have equality and non-discrimination at its centre. It is really exciting. The transformative proposals for having the idea of publicly supported and serviced care throughout every part of our State system - from collective bargaining, our political system and our budgeting system through to the shift in the social protection system - are also exciting. I know we will get to debate the report's recommendations properly in the new year. The recommendations would make for a better Ireland that reflects and serves all of its citizens better. I am very proud to be part of that report. I hope we will have the opportunity to debate it thoroughly in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">I echo the comments of my fellow Members and extend my sympathies to the family of the late Private Seán Rooney. I come from a constituency that used to have three barracks in Mullingar, Longford and Athlone, with Custume Barracks in Athlone being the main barracks. There is a very strong military history in the area. A lot of service has been given to the Defence Forces from people in my county. I extend my sympathies to his family, colleagues and those serving overseas, including my cousin who is abroad with the Defence Forces. I wish those who were injured a speedy recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> Last week, the Cathaoirleach concurred with me when I wished Longford Slashers ladies football team well. I want to report that they were very successful on Saturday in Croke Park. The first all-Ireland club GAA title to be won by a County Longford team was brought home last Saturday night to Longford town by the Longford Slashers ladies team. It was a huge occasion both in Croke Park, where I was with my son, and in Longford town that night. We might be a small county but we like to bat above our level regularly. I say "well done" to them - onwards and upwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_254"> When I walk into Leinster House every day, I am extremely proud and honoured to be a Member of the Oireachtas. When I come in the door, I look at the Proclamation on the left hand side. It states that we need to honour "all the children of the nation equally". I have spoken about this previously. To me, a child born to a family through surrogacy is a child of our nation and it is important that we cherish him or her equally. I support the comments of Senator Seery Kearney and once again, congratulate her on the work she has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> I assume we might get an opportunity tomorrow to say more about the Leader and the Cathaoirleach. I thank them for the support they have given to me, particularly in respect of my role in looking to get the Committee on Autism set up. They provided support behind the scenes to make sure that happened. The committee has made a lot of changes already, even without our report being finished next March. It has brought the subject to the national agenda, has stimulated a discussion and more acceptance of young adults or children with autism, and has rocked the system a bit to start making changes at third level, at primary level and through to section 37A, with more to come. I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Leader for their support not just for me but also for children and young adults throughout the country and their families to make sure this happens. I look forward to working with them in the term ahead. I thank Martin, Bridget and all the staff and ushers throughout Leinster House. It is an honour every day I walk in the door to deal with the excellent staff throughout the building, in the canteen and elsewhere. It is a joy to be here, to represent the people of Longford-Westmeath and to work here with good colleagues across all parties.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">Today, I think of the family and friends of Private Seán Rooney from County Donegal, who lost his life in the service of our country overseas. I live in the constituency of Dublin Central. We have McKee Barracks on Blackhorse Avenue, with which the Leader will be familiar. We also have the headquarters of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association on Arbour Hill. These are people who give of their lives selflessly. Obviously, the ultimate sacrifice was made last night. My thoughts and deepest sympathies and condolences go to Private Rooney's family and friends and all who served with him. My thoughts also go to Private Shane Kearney. I hope he makes a speedy recovery. One soldier came from County Donegal and the other is from Killeagh in County Cork; they were from both ends of the country. My grandmother came from Killeagh. I have two young sons. When one sees those photographs, it is really heartbreaking. I thank them for their service and express my deepest sympathies.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> I thank everybody in the Houses, both the Dáil and the Seanad, from all parties and none, who supported and continue to support the campaign that is being led by the 1916 Relatives Association to have the new children's hospital named after Dr. Kathleen Lynn. The campaign, which is supported by the National Women's Council of Ireland, Fórsa, SIPTU and politicians on all sides, is born out of a desire to honour and celebrate a woman who was a revolutionary, patriot, disrupter and belligerent. She was passionate. She saw things that did not exist. She was a qualified medical doctor who believed passionately in social justice. She brought medicine to women and children at a time when that could not even be imagined. She is a woman who transcends time and her legacy is one we can all be proud of and aspire to into the future. I thank everybody who has supported the campaign and who welcomed its representatives to the Oireachtas yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I particularly thank the Leader, the Cathaoirleach, our leader, Senator Chambers, Martin Groves, Bridget Doody and all the staff who give us, myself included, the opportunity to serve here and have the privilege of participating in our democracy at this level. Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir. I wish everyone a merry Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I thank colleagues for all their expressions of sympathy. We join together this morning to remember Private Seán Rooney.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> I acknowledge Senator Fitzpatrick's involvement in the campaign to have our hospital named after Dr. Kathleen Lynn, who certainly was an incredibly impressive person. I thank the Senator for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> To Senator Carrigy I say bualadh bos to Longford Slashers Ladies GFA. I wish them continued success. I have a feeling this is only the start of great things.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> Senators Higgins and Chambers both acknowledged the launch of the Joint Committee on Gender Equality's report entitled Unfinished Democracy: Achieving Gender Equality. The report contains 40-plus recommendations in respect of which we have put timelines in order that we can keep people in check. I really hope we do keep them in check. Commitments have been made not only by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste but also by all the Ministers across the line Departments who need to shake things up to make sure that we see an equal future for our women and girls very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> Senators Buttimer and Maria Byrne both asked for debates on emergency departments, particularly those in Limerick and Cork, and the HIQA report after Christmas. I am sure the new Leader will organise that.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I thank Deputy Malcolm Byrne, who prepared the motion on today's Order Paper seeking for us to join the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN. Not everybody will recognise that although the names on the list are wide and varied, Senator Malcolm Byrne wrote the vast majority of the motion, otherwise it would not have been ready today's Order Paper. I acknowledge his commitment. I will certainly prod the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in the hip to see whether we can get him to spend the very small amount of money needed before Christmas in order that we might bring the matter to fruition.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> Senator Murphy spoke about the continuing saga of the imprisonment of Mr. Robert Pether. Mr. Pether's wife, Desree, contacts me nearly every day, if not every second day. Things at this time of year are always heightened emotionally for us whether it is grief or otherwise. Desree is watching her husband deteriorate in front of her eyes and her two children having to grow up without their father. I am told that we are doing everything we can. Somehow, it just does not feel like we are doing everything we can when we are watching a man wasting away. I want to tell Desree that he is in our thoughts and that we will continue to keep working on her behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> I thank Senator Black for acknowledging the Dr. Kathleen Lynn campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke not only about the Unfinished Democracy: Achieving Gender Equality report and its ambitions but also the need for a referendum on Articles 40 and 41 of the Constitution. It would be a very good time for us to have the referendum around extending the franchise to the presidential elections as we committed to do in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_268"> I acknowledge Senator Boyhan's poignant review of the letter by little Ivan. When he brought it up a couple of weeks ago, it really got us all in the gut that this little boy has the choice of anything in the letter he wrote to Santa, because we all know Santa brings whatever children ask for in their letters in most cases. All Ivan wants is his daddy home and electricity. These are things we take so much for granted that we do not even think about them. There are families in Ireland at the moment who are worried about paying their electricity bills. Most people in this country do not have to worry about not being able to turn on the lights when they get up in the morning or about having frightened children. Sometimes, we need that reality check. Senator Boyhan was very right to commend the agencies and, indeed, all the Irish citizens who extended such an enormous welcome. Particularly in the last number of weeks, all those people who are lucky enough to have holiday homes offered them to some of the thousands of people who are still living in hotels. I want to point out that when Senator Boyhan said some of the 75,000 Ukrainians that are here will want to stay, we would absolutely be damn lucky if they did want to stay. I want to put that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_269"> Senator Kyne asked for me to raise Iran's despicable human rights records with the ambassador, which I will be very happy to do today.</p>
          <p eId="para_270"> Senator Chambers opened proceedings by commending Deputy Bacik, who is a wonderful role model for women, particularly young women who would like to get into politics. She really can show us that it is possible to do it all. I acknowledge her contribution to this House and to the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_271"> I thank the Cathaoirleach for steering us over the past two and a half years. The running of this House is an example of his commitment. The way he changed things and shaped the House around his personality is to be commended. I particularly thank him for the role he played in the Seanad 100 celebrations. It was such a pleasure to work with him to achieve the outcomes so efficiently. We had a number of presentations, particularly on Monday which, unfortunately, I had to watch from my bed because I was smothering. It was a wonderful event to watch, however. I will put on record that while the Taoiseach's and everybody else's contributions were lovely, Dr. John Bowman is a class act. He was absolutely wonderful on Monday. I will write to him on all of our behalf to thank him for the wisdom and wit he added to the occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> A number of years ago, we would have considered that the walls of these Houses were adorned mostly by the portraits of men who made contributions to public life over the past 100 years, and rightly so. I am not trying to brush them out. For a lot of the time, however, the women who played equal roles have been brushed out. There are now 200-plus women on the walls of Leinster House, and that is down to the Cathaoirleach. I thank him, because it means a lot. Sometimes, these things are seen outside as being kind of silly and trivial. Being seen and being present both really mean a lot. I thank the Cathaoirleach for that important contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I thank our Leas-Chathaoirleach, Senator Joe O'Reilly. He is a wonderful personality and really has added to the engagement in the past number of years. I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_275"> Like others, I wish Martin , Bridget, all of the other clerks and all the staff in the Seanad Office. This House is run in a meticulous manner and that is down to the wisdom and commitment of the team. I thank them.</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Likewise, I thank Orla, who works in my office. We call Orla "the Leader's office" because that is what she is. There is nobody else but Orla. Apart from being a thoroughly beautiful human being, she is professional to her fingertips. I do not mean “professional” in the sense of working within the bubble of what one particular Department wants to do. Rather, she is a realist, and her advice and wisdom are so grounding. I thank her for all her work. She is one of the most efficient people I have ever had the privilege of working with.</p>
          <p eId="para_277"> As for the ushers, our cleaning and catering staff, I have been a Member of these Houses, thankfully, for 11 years, and I have always felt as though they must have been handpicked because they are so wonderful, accommodating, kind and bloody damn good at their jobs. I thank them all and wish them well.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> This is the final normal Order of Business during my time as Leader of Seanad Éireann. It is a great privilege to have followed in the footsteps of people such as Maurice Manning, Gemma Hussey and, of course, my good pal, Senator Buttimer. When I was appointed on 27 June 2020, the first sitting was to be held on 29 June at the convention centre. An awful lot of the commentary from colleagues was probably was not complimentary, and rightly so. It concerned the role I had played in the 2013 referendum and, critically, it was probably justified. I very much hope that in the past two and a half years, colleagues from all sides of the House have seen not only the enormous respect I have for the Seanad as an institution and for the value of what it can and does do, but also the respect I have for individual Members and all the parties and groups, including those in opposition. I believe it is a privilege not only to be in public life but to have the opportunity to shape and interrogate legislation and make it better, which is what we are here to do, and that includes our own legislation. I hope Senators have seen that respect through my actions and deeds in recent years because I truly believe the Seanad is a far more thoughtful, and much less partisan and gimmicky, place than the Dáil can be at times, with its name calling and shape throwing. I thank them all for their co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> As an example of that, my attitude to the Air Navigation and Transport Bill 2020 probably raised a few eyebrows, with Senators wondering what the hell I was at, but it took more than 13 months to go through this House. With the co-operation of both Opposition and Government colleagues, we made tremendous changes to it and it was a far better Bill when it left this House than when it had arrived here from the Dáil. That is the power and value of this House. The co-operation and collegiality mean we can work to the same outcome, regardless of our colours or creed, and that is powerful. A significant statement, which speaks for itself, is that when that Bill, which took more than 13 months for us to deliberate on here, left this House it took nine minutes to be passed in Dáil Éireann. That is the difference between Seanad Éireann and Dáil Éireann and that is why the Seanad should never again be challenged but only be improved on.</p>
          <p eId="para_280"> I hope I have been fair and approachable. When I came here, I was probably an argumentative auld bag, but I think that was because that was what I was used to being. I was used to arguing combatively and constantly fighting against the Opposition but there is no need for that most of the time. Ultimately, we all want the same outcome, namely, a better country, a better society and an equal and just society for all our citizens. I hope I played my little part in that regard over recent years and I thank Senators for their friendship and co-operation and for their thanks today. It is nice to be nice. I wish them, their families and all our staff a very happy and peaceful Christmas. By God, this one will definitely be meaningful.</p>

          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T13:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">I thank the Leader for her kind words and especially for her leadership in what have been some of the most challenging times I have seen in my 15 years in this House. We forget about all the rules that had to be changed because of Covid and about the agreement that had to be secured, without ever having a vote by all the Senators, in respect of the dramatic changes to our structures, not only regarding the debates but also the votes themselves, which caused no end of concern. We were concerned at times about where we would be allowed to vote in our own Chamber, and it was only through the work of all the party and group leaders and many long hours of debate that we managed to navigate that without any discordance. Senator Doherty's leadership ensured that all worked and that everybody managed to come to a consensus as to how we could navigate that start, which was fairly traumatic in its own right for what were many new Members and which was not normal, as they have learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Despite endless meetings of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight, which had much debate on a lot of issues, I am delighted to say those issues never went anywhere, which is always a great sign of a committee working together. Without that, little would be done and people would not be able to express their views. That was down to Senator Doherty's leadership in the Seanad over the past two and a half years, and for that, I am grateful to have worked with her along with the Deputy Leader, Senator Chambers. They have been a great team and they have worked well together. Likewise, the leaders of the other parties and groups, Senators Pauline O'Reilly, Ó Donnghaile, Higgins, Boyhan and Moynihan, have worked very well together. What is great is that just two of the parties and groups are led by men and the rest by women. Indeed, all the Senators work together very well and the party Whips have the extraordinarily tough job of keeping the show on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> I thank also Martin, Bridget and all the catering staff, ushers and everybody who works so well here, including the Leader's Orla, who does great work behind the scenes. The Leader's office can be a like an air traffic control tower and, as she said, Orla is the office. Similarly, Grace in my office is my air traffic control, and she managed to squeeze five years' work into the past two and a half years. It has been a privilege to serve with the Leader and all Members of the Seanad. Over the past two and a half years, many people have lost loved ones, so we think of them and, of course, Seán Rooney's family.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. This is a Seanad Bill that has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 138, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", a Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For the Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister of State will deal separately with the subject of each related group of amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> Senators have tabled several amendments that arise from the changes made to the Bill by the Dáil. In view of the number of amendments and to avoid repetition of debate, I propose that amendments made by the Dáil and related amendments tabled by Senators be debated together in related groups. Decisions on the amendments tabled by Senators will be taken when the discussion on all groups of amendments has concluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I have circulated the proposed groupings in the House. A Senator may contribute once on each grouping. I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the subject matter of each grouping of amendments made by the Dáil and the amendments tabled that arise out of the amendments made by the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I call the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke, to speak on the subject matter of amendments in group 1, which pertains to the facilitation of the provision of housing on lands owned by local authorities. It includes amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 and Seanad Report Stage amendments Nos. 3 to 15, inclusive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterBurke" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Housing,_Local_Government_and_Heritage" eId="spk_100">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T13:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_306">The proposed measure to temporarily disapply the Part 8 planning approval process to facilitate the accelerated delivery of housing supply is subject to the satisfaction of several conditions: the land is owned by the local authority or another State body; the land is zoned for residential development; the proposed development does not materially convene the development plan or local area plan for the area; the land is serviced or can be serviced with the necessary supporting infrastructure or facilities within the timeframe of the development; and the proposed development is not required to undergo an environmental impact assessment, EIA, under the EIA directive, or an appropriate assessment, AA, under the habitats directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Amendment No. 3, in the names of Senators Higgins and Black, proposes, in regard to the servicing of infrastructure and facilities for proposed developments coming within the scope of the new measure, wording referring to land that is serviced or can practically be serviced with the necessary supporting infrastructure and facilities. The insertion of the word "practically", as proposed by Senators, is unnecessary and superfluous, and, therefore, we cannot accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Regarding amendment No. 4, the provisions regarding the proposed temporary exemption from the Part 8 approval process apply only to lands zoned for residential use, whether they are owned by the State authority or not, or whether they are on State authority land exclusively zoned as residential or not. Therefore, if land is zoned as residential, it would come under the measure. If not, it would be excluded from the measure. The zoning of the land for residential use under the local development plan is what determines which lands can be used for this measure and where accelerated delivery of social, affordable and cost-rental accommodation can be provided. If the Senators' amendment was accepted, it could exclude significant parcels of vacant and idle land from utilisation for the provision of much-needed social housing. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> On amendments Nos. 5 and 6, as tabled by Senators Black and Higgins, I acknowledge that an EIA under the EIA directive and an AA under the habitats directive are core elements of our development consent process and are processes that must be taken into account as required by the EU directive and national legislation before a decision in respect of development consent is taken. The proposals I have outlined in Government amendment No. 43, as tabled for Dáil Committee Stage yesterday, expressly provide that developments can only be developments that do not require an EIA or AA, or both. They must also be carried out in areas zoned for housing development and, further, cannot be involved in the material contravention of the development plan. In effect, all proposed projects will be subject to preliminary EIA and AA screening by the relevant local authority prior to being published and notified to the public. Where it is determined that an EIA or AA, or both, are required in respect of the proposed development arising from the screening process, the project will not be able to avail of the Part 8 exemption and will, therefore, be required to undergo an EIA and AA, as required, as part of the normal Part 8 planning approval process. The EIA and AA screening of proposed projects will, as a matter of course, take into account all the environmental and nature aspects referred to in the amendments of Senators Higgins and Black, including the possible impacts of the proposed project on the environment generally, water and air quality, protected species and nature protection generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I assure the Senators that full cognisance the EIA and habitats directive requirements will be taken into account by local authorities in their preliminary assessment and screening processes of those projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> The preliminary EIA and AA screening terminations arrived at by local authorities in respect of proposed projects will be required to be published and made available to the public in the interests of full transparency of the process. In effect, local authorities would have to justify why they have screened out the undertaking of a full EIA and AA in their proposed project before they can proceed with and make a determination available to the public. Furthermore, on the EIA and AA aspects, it should be particularly noted that public consultation and participation are not a requirement of the EIA and habitats directive in respect of preliminary EIA and AA screening of proposed developments. </p>
          <p eId="para_312"> With regard to the public participation aspects referred to in the Senators' amendments, the proposed provision made in the Part 8 exemption will only apply to development on land that had been zoned for residential use in the local development plan. In addition to the development plan, the zoning of land would have been subject to SCA and AA screening as well as public consultation participation. On this basis, the public would have been afforded the opportunity to participate in the development plan adoption process, including the proposed residential zonings of land owned by local authorities or State agencies that might be available and used for housing developments under the new temporary Part 8 exemption arrangements. In effect, it will have been known beforehand the specific parcels of land owned by local authorities and State agencies that have been zoned for residential will likely be subject of housing developments arising from development plan adoption process. Furthermore, under the proposed arrangements, selected members representing their constituents and the public will also be informed by the chief executive of the housing departments that this is proposed to avail of the Part 8 exemption. As part of the process, they will also be provided with plans and particulars of the proposed development. In addition, the plans and particulars of the proposed projects will be made publicly available. These public notification arrangements will enable elected members to take account of any views their constituents might have to convey them to the chief executive, thereby providing democratic input regarding housing projects being proposed by the chief executive under this measure. </p>
          <p eId="para_313"> In developing these proposals, we have tried to take into account all the obligations that need to be met under the EU and national legislation. As I have outlined, we are faced with a significant housing supply shortage, particularly in relation to social, affordable and cost rental, and we constantly need to be able to use all possible levers to help address this situation but also in respect of international and EU obligations in this regard. In light of what I have just outlined, I cannot accept these amendments. </p>
          <p eId="para_314"> With regard to amendments Nos. 7, subsection 3 of the new section 179A provides that the Minister may make regulations in relation to the giving of public notice by the local authority in respect of the forward development, the publication by the local authority of a notice in the local newspaper in respect of the proposed development, and the notification of proposed developments to prescribed bodies. The purpose of this exemption from the Part 8 approval process in respect of the relevant developments is to streamline and to accelerate the delivery of much-needed social, affordable and cost-rental housing on already zoned residential land. Elected members representing their constituents and the general public will be notified of the proposed developments by the chief executive and will be able to comment on the proposals. The provision of a five-week notice period, as proposed by Senators Higgins and Black would undermine and run counter to the streamlining objectives of the proposed measure an extend and delay the period of such developments could be progressed and commenced. Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> In amendments Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, Senators Higgins and Black propose that any procedures that the Minister may regulate by regulations shall be consistent with the procedure set out in Parts X and XAB of the Planning and Development Act relating to EIA and AA under the EIA and habitats directive respectively. These provisions apply generally in respect of all forms of development under the planning Act and will also apply in respect of projects coming under the proposed new measure. There is no need to insert references to Parts X and XAB. If that approach were to be adopted, we would have to insert cross references to Parts X and XAB throughout the Planning and Development Act for every reference to environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment. Accordingly, I cannot accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Amendment No. 12 is unnecessary as the proposed Part 8 exemption provisions in respect of social, affordable and cost rental housing cannot come into effect until supplementary regulations providing the detail operation aspects of the new measure are made. These regulations are being advanced by my Department and should be finalised in a matter of weeks. There is no question that supplementary regulations will be made in this connection. Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_317"> With regard to amendment No. 13, the new section 179A(4) proposed by the Government provides that sections 138 to 140, inclusive, of the Local Government Act 2001 shall not apply in respect of development that is intended will be exempt from the Part 8 approval process. In this regard, section 138 requires a chief executive to inform elected members prior to commencing any works of the local authority. Section 139 enables elected members by resolution to instruct the chief executive to not proceed with the works informed under section 138. Section 140 enables the elected members by resolution to instruct the chief executive to undertake any particular act or function it feels is required to undertake the functions of the local authority. These provisions are disapplied in the proposed new section 179A providing for the exemption from the Part 8 planning approval process for qualifying housing developments. If the amendment was accepted, it would completely undermine and negate the new section 179A provisions, such that they would have no effect with the party 8 process effectively remaining in place for the purpose of approving housing developments proposed by the chief executive. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_318"> In amendment No. 14, the definition of "housing development" that applies to development works and supporting infrastructure and facilities that will come within the scope of the scheme and that can be undertaken for the purposes of providing the necessary housing under the scheme is intended to cover development and infrastructure that is necessary and ancillary to houses being constructed under the provision. The establishment of the construction of primary and secondary roads as referred to in the amendment goes beyond the scope of the housing and development that is covered by this measure. The provision of such roads as a subject of separate process involving the local authority, the National Transport Authority and other key stakeholders. Therefore, I cannot accept this amendment. </p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Finally, on amendment No. 15, the provision of appropriate cycling and pedestrian infrastructure are among the key considerations taken into account in development of housing schemes. Pedestrian footpaths are standard in all developments and while appropriate cycling infrastructure, including cycle lanes and stands for bicycles, are increasingly being taken into account by local authorities in the assessment of schemes and the determination of planning applications generally, it may not be possible to provide cycle lanes in all housing schemes due to space restrictions and, accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment. </p>

          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_320">I thank the Minister of State for his response to my amendments. I would have liked more elaboration on the Government’s amendments because the proposals that the Government is putting forward will have significant consequences. While my amendments to the amendments have been addressed, but when the Minister of State has the opportunity to come in again, he might elaborate on what the Government is doing with its different amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> This is coming in the context of the turnaround times. It is regrettable that we are only having a Report Stage debate so I am conscious that I will only get to speak once and we will not get to go back and forth constructively or try to refine these amendments so that we can ensure that this section is doing the best that it can because the way that this whole process has been done has been where these massively significant changes by the Government, including significant changes to Part 8, and significant removals of powers of local authority members have been brought in as an amendment in the Dáil after we already had our Fourth Stage scrutiny in the Seanad. They, therefore, have benefited neither from pre-legislative scrutiny nor from proper scrutiny in this House. That is why we find ourselves with only opportunity to speak to them. I do not believe that is an adequate or acceptable legislative process. </p>
          <p eId="para_322">I do not think it is an acceptable legislative process. I will move to the amendments in the grouping.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> My first amendment in the section is amendment No. 3. There are multiple threes and ones in the list of amendments because there are Government amendments as well as mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> Amendment No. 3 relates to the language in the Bill. It has a very wide frame, whereby it refers to anything that can be done. The Government amendment suggests that the special exempted development status would apply to land owned by local authorities or a State authority zoned for residential use and which has access or can be connected to public infrastructure and facilities, including roads, footpaths, public lighting and so forth. Anything can be connected. We can build a bridge to the UK. We can build a 100-mile pipeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> However, we want to ensure that the kinds of developments that get built are ones that will have proper connections to public infrastructure and facilities, that there will be proper development with proper services and the best choices are made in that regard, because it is also about the proper use of the State's resources. It is reasonable that we do not simply say they can be connected, but rather that they can be practicably connected so that we make better choices around where we locate developments and what we consider to be new housing developments, rather than stating that something can theoretically link to the grid which may take time or prove onerous. We need to ensure it is practicable to do so. That will allow us to make better choices in respect of new developments and ensure they are delivered in a timely and more cost-effective way and are better places for those who live in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> Amendment No. 4 concerns an avoidance of doubt provision. I understand the section refers to land owned by a local or State authority and zoned for residential use. The amendment is framed as an avoidance of doubt. The State authorities included in this list are substantial. There are, for example, a large number of potential areas such as technological universities and educational institutions, as well as many other bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I want to address a scenario where part of a site owned by a State authority is zoned residential, as is the case in certain university lands in Galway where part of the lands are zoned for residential use. It is the same in UCD. Other parts of the land are zoned for other functions. When land is owned by a State authority, part of which is zoned for residential use, that should not be used as a justification for losing the other functions that might be on the land or for the extension of new housing developments on land that is serving other important purposes in the hands of State authorities. I hope that is the correct interpretation of the Government's amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> If it is intended that only land which is zoned for residential use will be affected, I do not see why my amendment would not be entirely acceptable. My amendment simply states that any land, or a portion of land, which is owned by a State authority but is not zoned exclusively for residential use shall not be relevant under this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> A portion of mixed-use zoning which is residential, if my amendment is accepted, would mean that the entire mixed-use lands would not become liable for new developments and lose the other functions. This would be a useful clarification and alleviate concerns from those who rely on State authorities for a variety of amenities and functions. That is something that needs clarification.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Amendment No. 5 proposes to insert a new subsection (1A). This concerns the significant effect on the environment where a determination needs to be made publicly. It is one thing to say that the screening in terms of the EIA is an appropriate assessment. However, there are other requirements. This relates to the Aarhus Convention and the right to environmental information. There is a right to participate in environmental decision-making and to environmental information. This is wider than the screening and assessment process in EIAs and AAs. Simply using the screening for EIAs and AAs as a shorthand to say that we have done screening and, therefore, there is no environmental matter of public consequence is inadequate. </p>
          <p eId="para_331"> This does not relate to every case, but where there is a potential significant impact on the environment, there needs to be a determination that requires that information is publicly available within a 12-week deadline. Impact assessments and AAs are one part of people's right to participate in the environmental decision-making process and the right of the public to access environmental information, but they are not the whole picture. Using those screenings as a shorthand for saying that we do not need to talk to the public about environmental matters is not adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_332"> We do not always need to open things to public consultation or a public information process. However, in any case where there is a potential significant effect on the environment that is a requirement. The 12-week period relates to the fundamental point. We need to bear in mind that the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity was clear. It is worried that we are not applying environmental law properly in Ireland. If we apply it properly and consult people properly at an earlier stage, then we get better decisions. That is what leads to fewer judicial reviews.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> The problems we have had with planning have largely come from the fact that planning was not done properly in the first place and shortcuts were sought. Any time we seek a shortcut, we create further problems and often end up making the process longer. I am concerned that it is seen as so burdensome and something to be avoided that we try to avoid having to talk to the public on environmental matters. We then create decisions that are less good and nuanced than they might be.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Amendment No. 6 proposes to insert a new paragraph into subsection (1). It stipulates that where a development may have a significant effect on the environment and, therefore, public participation is required, there will be the publication of the determination or decision that this may have a significant effect on the environment. It also proposes the publication of the information which has informed the planning process around that and should include issues such as the consideration of the impact on water quality so that the requirement of Article 4 of the directive of the European Parliament and Council is reflected in the decision. It relates to the establishment of a framework for community action in the field of water policy. We know there are huge concerns about water quality issues in Ireland. It should also deal with the impact on air quality and species as related to the habitats directive and flora protection orders. These are tools, rather than obstacles. Let us make sure that we are applying them properly at an earlier stage in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Amendment No. 7 proposes to insert a new subsection into section 179A. This is an important amendment. I will deal with amendment Nos. 7 and 8 simultaneously because they are about the notice period. The new section 179A the Government is introducing allows the Minister to set out procedures regarding lots of things for which there are already procedures in our planning Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Now the Minister is going to set out new procedures relating to them. What I am trying to ensure is that any new procedures that the Minister may set out in these areas will at least meet the basic standards in some of the standard procedures. Frankly, the idea that the public is to have five weeks' notice in which to engage in respect of a development is somehow terribly burdensome and is going to stop anything happening in the State is very worrying. Five weeks is currently prescribed for the public engagement. Let us look to the periods of time developers and proposers have. The idea is that we will have procedures that are less than that. What are we looking at? A week, for the public to see something that is going to be a very significant new development in an area, have notice of it and respond to it. Will it be two weeks or a day? Who knows? I expected the Minister of State to say of course the Minister will fulfil and be consistent with the five weeks, which is the standard practice, but instead we have heard that we might not. It comes to the same thing in regard to the piece on more haste and less speed. There is ambiguity around what new parallel procedures for planning the Minister might put in place. It is not as bad but it reminds me of the other Parts of the Bill where the Minister is going to put in place procedures for the appointment of members to An Bord Pleanála, which also were not figured out in advance of bringing the Bill to the House. We do not even know who is making the appointments or whether there is a committee. There is no specification for how new members of An Bord Pleanála are going to be appointed because the Minister simply says a procedure will be put in place. The Minister of State can understand that there is a lack of public confidence in a Department and Minister stating that they are going to do something later or invent a procedure later and it will have certain adjectives attached, when there is almost no information about what the procedure will be and no guarantees for us, as legislators, who have been asked to give permission and pass that power to the Minister. The procedural section is not as vague as the section in respect of the appointment of members of An Bord Pleanála, but it is right up there. It is also a little bit much for the Government that did not take the time to say what it is going to do or to consult on these particular provisions with the relevant Oireachtas committee or indeed to sit through three Stages of proper debate in the Seanad on the proposals in front of us today, to also say it is in so much in a hurry we do not have time for the public to say anything. That does not instil confidence. If we want to have a functional planning system in which people have confidence, that works and moves forward, it would be better to show that the Minister takes it seriously in terms of scrutiny and that he takes what the public has to bring to the planning process seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_337"> On the issue of there being five weeks for the public to offer their input and observations, it is not as simple as objections and support, as they often make important observations. The public gives information about what a place is like and what matters. Policy in the end is the decisions we make about how we want to live together. One of the most fundamental parts of policy and democracy is that people can have a say in the decisions about how they live together in their own community.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 relate to the five-week notice period. Then there is amendment No. 9. The Minister of State has given an indication in respect of amendment No. 10 and I would like him to clarify that because it would be reassuring to have it on the record. I am concerned because the legislation before us provides for the Minister to put in place procedures on EIAs and AAs under the habitats directive. Given the lack of appetite for engagement in these areas, I have been concerned that potentially under the sections proposed by the Government, the procedures the Minister puts in place could be dilutions of the existing process. I would like to know whether that is a definite commitment, because it would be reassuring for people if any procedures the Minister puts in place in respect of these new exempted developments, would be consistent and in no way a dilution of anything in Parts X or XAB in respect of the environmental impact assessment and the appropriate assessment so that we are not going to see parallel processes for EIA or AA but that Parts X and XAB procedures would be mirrored in any procedures set out by the Minister. I genuinely would be very grateful if that could be confirmed and if the Minister of State could commit to it on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Amendment No. 9 goes a little further. I am trying to ensure that the procedure that might be set out by the Minister would be consistent with the procedures set out in Part X of the Act of 2000, and any further mandatory requirements under Article 4 of the EIA directive. That is because there are some new mandatory requirements under Article 4 of the EIA directive, which have come subsequently to the original transposing of that directive in the Act of 2000. They are law, because they are European law, but we must ensure our procedures reflect the additional and further mandatory requirements under Article 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I apologise as this is a long grouping. I might even request a glass of water. We are about half way.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">No, we are probably slightly more than that. Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert a new subsection after subsection (3). I have mentioned that in regard to Part XAB.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> Amendment No. 12 relates to the "mays" and "shalls" that we often come to in this House, but which can be so significant. There is a reference to the fact that the Minister may make regulations providing for "all of the following matters". We must take a preventative approach, especially when we have not had the opportunity for consultative back-and-forth engagement. I seek assurance. Perhaps the Minister of State will be able to address the issue. Could he assure me that there is no question of regulations being created in respect of these new proposed exempted developments, which do not address some of these issues, so that we do not, for example, end up with regulations that leave out procedures for EIAs or one of the stages around publication? I ask that because it states "may", although I do not believe that is the intent. I want to be clear about that, but we must look to the language before us. All we have is the text, which we only received last night. As an avoidance of doubt, I want to be clear that if the Minister does not make regulations providing for any of the matters listed in Part 14(3)(a) to (h), that the existing standard provisions in the Act in respect of those matters would apply, so that we do not end up with any risk of a lacuna where there is a gap in the regulations, and that wherever there is a gap the standard procedures would apply. For example, if the Minister does not regulate for a new notice period, the standard notice period would be assumed to apply. Perhaps the Minister of State could reassure me that there is no such danger. I hope I am being overcautious in this particular amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> Amendment No. 13 is probably one of the most important amendments. It is one in which other Members have significant interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Sadly, this is part of a pattern we have seen of the constant chipping away at the powers of local authority members. It should be borne in mind that when we do that, we chip away not just at the powers of some councillors but also at the powers of communities and those who elect local councillors. We have seen this again and again in small things, such as when local authority members could not attach conditions when handing over land for cost-rental or give some local information that might have improved or informed that. We saw it in an earlier part of the Act and a small provision that used to be there whereby if something were to contravene the local development plan, there would have to be a slightly higher quorum. All these little things are designed to ensure that our planning system and our local authority system are recognised as key elements of a democratic State and key to the public's confidence that they, as citizens or as people living in an area, have a say in their lives and in the places where they live. I stand over my comments on the changes relating to An Bord Pleanála proposed in the Bill as being a direct power grab. There is also a power grab here in that more power is taken off local authorities and handed over to the chief executive. It should be borne in mind that chief executives are not elected. They do not have a mandate in the same way our local authority members do. The chief executives - and maybe people need to be reminded of this - are there to serve local authorities. The governance, strategic direction and policies of local authorities and the development plans come through the local authority members with input from the public. Simply saying that the councillors could say something to the CEO, who may or may not take it on board, is an alternative to having an actual democratic process. It is outrageous and ridiculous, and we cannot gloss over it. I have huge sympathy for local authority members of all parties, including the Government parties, and for the Senators who did not get to have proper scrutiny of this and who are elected by local authority members. Let us be clear. This Government is so afraid of any input from anybody that, as well as wanting to get rid of the periods during which the public can have an input, and as well as looking to have to do as little as possible on environmental law, it is also removing basic powers from the council.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> I refer to section 138, titled "Prior information to elected council", of the Local Government Act 2001. If the Bill, as drafted, is passed, the chief executive will no longer have to inform council members of a major new development in their area. Many local authority members are hungry for new developments. There is an underestimation in that regard. Most local authority members I know are keen to see new developments happen in their areas. As for the idea that the chief executive would not even have to inform them in advance of a new proposal, what are we so afraid of? They would not have the fundamental opportunity to vote on a resolution in respect of works if the local authority had a fundamental concern about the project, which I do not believe would be brought forward lightly. That is not a vote to say they have to vote in favour of it; it is a vote when they want to express concern about it proceeding. There is a wealth of knowledge and information at local level which comes through the public and local authority members and which does not necessarily always come through CEOs, who are often transferred back and forth across the country as they move their way up the ladder and may or may not have local commitment or knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> Section 140 reminds me of a previous planning Bill. It is almost traditional now that legislation in this area gets rushed through. It might seem like a great idea but it is not and it will damage public confidence further. When a previous Bill was being rushed through last summer we saw the erosion of local authority powers. Here is another example. The proposal on cost-rental was reasonable and stated that when land is being given over and there is a new project and it is said that something will be built, a local authority might have been able to add a condition or even say something like "We have a high level of pet ownership in our area and we would like a park attached to the development" or "We are aware of a particular need in this area in that there are many children, so if you are putting in a new development, can we be assured there will be a large playground?". The local authority may be aware of disability needs in the area and may want that to be reflected. The idea is simply that one would be able to add on good conditions. Section 140 is titled "Requirement that a particular thing be done". It should be borne in mind that under that section there is already a safety net. It is not something a couple of councillors can do. A resolution under section 140 already requires at least a third of the total number to vote in favour of the resolution, but that is undone by the Bill, as drafted. Fundamentally, this relates to three very reasonable powers of local authority members, which can and should be used in co-operation with the laudable goal, which I support very much, that we want to build more local authority housing. However, this whole section relates to local authority own housing development. It is exactly what we have wanted for years, namely public housing. We want public housing built in local areas, but local authorities and their members and representatives are taken out of this section. That just does not make sense to me. It will create deep disappointment and a sense of disempowerment rather than opportunity for constructive engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> I come to the two final amendments to this section. Amendment No. 14 is one of the three preventative amendments. The Minister of State may have addressed this issue, so I might not have to press this amendment. My concern was that one of the aspects of exempted development which had been allowed for was the construction of a new road or the winding or realignment of an existing road to serve houses referred to in paragraph (a). The Minister of State did touch on the following, and maybe he could elaborate when he replies to the debate. I wanted to make sure that there would not be any risk that, for example, because two or three new housing developments are proposed and being created, that then be used to treat a major road as an exempted development. We know that so many roads - I am thinking of Galway and the Western Distributor Road - are based on new developments in an area and built to serve those developments. I just wanted to be assured that there was no danger of major roads, primary roads, motorways or bypasses or anything like that inadvertently coming under the provisions in this section. I understand that the Minister of State has indicated that that is a separate process and that this would simply involve service roads or, as one would expect, roads appropriate to serve a specific development. As I said, I am happy to withdraw the amendment if that is not a danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> I will probably press amendment No. 15, however. We should not be building anything that does not have cycle infrastructure. There is no excuse for that. That cycle infrastructure may be different depending on the circumstances. For a new apartment building it may be as simple as cycle parking. For a new housing estate it may be bike lanes. It may be about ensuring, for example, that where a housing estate meets a main road there are proper supports there to ensure safety. Some of the worst things I have seen are the estates built in the past that were islands. I am thinking of Oranmore and other places where I have seen that. People in those estates can only drive out of them. They cannot walk or cycle safely into a town that might be only 1 km away because there is no infrastructure to connect the estate with local services and communities. I will press amendment No. 15. I am not saying that there should be the same cycling infrastructure in every case, but there is no excuse for any new housing development in this State not having both pedestrian and cycling infrastructure built in, by design, at the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">That concludes my comments on this very large group of amendments. I hope the Minister of State will address some of these concerns and that I do not have to press all of these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> I am deeply disappointed at the way the process has been designed. A lot of concern has been expressed about the new proposals the Government might introduce in the new year and I hope they are nothing like what we have heard about. I do worry about some of the very poor decisions that have been made in this Bill. I have comparatively small concerns about this section but huge concerns about the appointment of An Bord Pleanála. Some ambiguities remain about the foreshore and I am really worried that they are not getting the scrutiny they need. Sadly, this Bill is not going to bring us forward. It was an opportunity to bring us forward but is not now because of the way it has been drafted. Also, due to the signal the Bill sends in respect of An Bord Pleanála I am concerned it will take us further backwards in terms of public confidence and ultimately in the effective delivery of housing we so badly need.</p>

          <from>Senator Fintan Warfield<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_352">I commend my colleague on her marathon speech on a marathon grouping of amendments. We only get one shot at Committee Stage and Senator Higgins took a pretty good shot.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> The last-minute amendments on social and affordable housing propose the suspension of the Part 8 process for up to two years. That option has been presented as a mechanism to speed up the delivery of social and affordable homes. Sinn Féin has always said we will look positively at any measures that accelerate or seek to accelerate the increased delivery of social and affordable homes. We would have chosen other ways of doing so but we do not oppose the amendments. However, the amendments do contain a number of risks the Minister of State should and needs to address. First, it is not clear how much time will be saved by a suspension of the Part 8 process. There is also a risk of creating conflict with council staff, elected members and the public. It is unclear how many, if any, additional social and affordable homes will be delivered by the suspension. Finally, the removal of public participation, as we know, could be also open to litigation which could, therefore, delay projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> Having said all that, we are in a housing emergency. Sinn Féin will not stand in the way of this proposal. However, we would ask, and I know Sinn Féin has asked this in the Dáil, that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage - some of its members are present, including Senators Fitzpatrick, Boyhan and Moynihan - be provided with a quarterly report on the use of the provision to allow the committee to monitor it very closely. Notwithstanding what Senator Higgins has said about engagement with councillors, chief executives need to engage with councillors extremely early in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> In conclusion, given that Sinn Féin is strongly opposed to the An Bord Pleanála section of the Bill but not opposed to the Part 8 suspension section, we will abstain on the legislation itself. </p>

          <p eId="para_356">I welcome the Minister of State and Mr. Terry Sheridan from the Department to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> The amendments are clustered and I shall touch on a number of recurring issues. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Senator Fitzpatrick is another member who is present. We did our very best and worked exceptionally hard on a cross-party basis. I want to acknowledge the work done by the Chair of the committee, Deputy Steven Matthews. We did not delay proceedings and entered into the spirit of engagement. To be fair to the committee, whatever differences we may have we reach a consensus when deciding recommendations and get on with the business. We live with that and advocate for that. I have had to do it on occasion but I do not like coming in here and speaking against any of our recommendations. The committee is an exercise in collaboration and consensus building. We do not always get everything we want but that is the nature of politics and pragmatism is a necessity. </p>
          <p eId="para_358"> I make no apology for being a strong advocate for sitting county councillors. I work exceptionally well with city and county managers or chief executives as they are now called. I am somewhat concerned about the suspension of Part 8 for two years. The Minister of State will be aware of what is meant by a Part 8, and I shall quote some details that I have copied from his Department's website and cross-referenced myself. I shall explain what Part 8 is for the benefit of anyone who does not know and the wider audience outside of this Chamber, particularly the public who are listening to this debate, watching live or watching the video of these debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> A Part 8 allows the application of a planning permission for projects by local authorities and states, "Where a project is being progressed by the local authority, planning permission is applied for under Part 8 of the Planning Development Regulations 2001-2015, and the procedure is set out in Part 11, section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 as amended. This procedure requires that notice of the proposed development be given in an approved newspaper and that a site notice be erected on the land on which the proposed development would be situated. After the expiration of the period during which submissions or observations may be made, a report is presented to the members of the council", which is the elected members. The report contains, among other items, a list of the persons, members of the public or bodies who made submissions, along with a summary of the issues raised by them and the chief executive's response to each and every one of them. The following lines are important, "This report recommends whether or not the proposed development should be proceeded with as proposed, or should not be proceeded with. Following consideration of the Report, the proposed development may be carried out as recommended in the Report, unless the local authority, by resolution, decides to vary or modify the development, otherwise than as recommended in the Report, or decides not to proceed with the development. The timeframe for the Part 8 process is set out below."</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Clearly, 20 weeks is a long time. So one forwards an application and newspaper notice in week one. There is the public display period of not less than four weeks. Next is the submissions period and the provision is, "submissions accepted not less than two weeks after the end of the public display period", so we are up to week 6. Next we are talking about the assessment in the CE's report and the chief executive's report within eight weeks. The chief executives have said this is a tight timeframe already and informed the Department of their view. I have seen correspondence from the County and City Management Association, CCMA, to that effect, which I am happy to share with the Minister of State and Members if necessary. In the end, the council decides within six weeks of the CE's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Clearly, the Part 8 process must be reformed. I have always said that one of the anomalies of the Part 8 process is that it is a never ending process and I do not like anything that is never ending because circumstances change. We have city and county development plans every five years and they might now be pushed out to ten years, which is a crazy recommendation. It would be very tight to have a review within seven years but that is an issue for another day and for another debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> Planning is clearly going to be very much the focus of our debates in these Houses over the next few months as we see so much coming down the track. I have expressed my concerns about the Part 8 process.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> More importantly, I am concerned about the role and function of elected members. This week we have heard so much about the engagement of communities and the environmental pillars in the planning process. The Minister of State and I know, as former county councillors, as does everyone here who has been involved in councils, that many people in public life and politics, be it at a local level, in the Dáil or in this House, live in communities. We also have a background in community activism.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">We have come through Tidy Towns, the GAA, sports, recreation, and from campaigns of all sorts, including for underground electrical cables, for example. In public life many politicians in these Houses have come through that process. They have been politicised through campaigning to make their community a better place through a whole range of issues, some of which are more successful than others. There are many Deputies who make a good job of advocating for their communities in Dáil Éireann and in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> I have a genuine concern, however, and this is not to have a bash at anyone, that we have to put in place a system. I am not too sure if it is going to be a temporary suspension. We are told it is a temporary suspension for two years. That will bring us pretty neatly into our next local elections. I can tell the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, that this is going to politicise communities. I am looking forward to that engagement. I look forward to being active in that engagement. I attended two meetings in south Dublin the other day, and I understand that right across this city and county community groups will mobilise into an umbrella group to campaign. They feel they are under threat in the context of their engagement with planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> The Minister of State may or may not have been at our meeting last week when I said that I had looked at various objections that have been made to An Bord Pleanála. I see that a large number of Deputies, and indeed Deputies who are now Government Ministers, had put in submissions, and rightly so, with concerns about planning in their constituencies. I am not complaining about that as I believe that it is right. We in Ireland pride ourselves on our close connectivity with our electorate and our communities. We all more or less live within our own communities, which is another strong part of the Irish political system. I am concerned that, on the one hand, we are legislating for policies against participation in the process, and yet we are jumping up and down to the independent appeals board with appeals. I hope public representatives continue to advocate strongly, through their planning authorities and through an open and transparent system, and right up into the board. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, may not recall, but Mr. Sheridan will, that we had a very tough campaign in the last Seanad to allow councillors to have a waiver from the €20 fee that had been proposed by the last Fine Gael administration. We fought tough and it was a hard battle. It was touch and go. There was a different dynamic in Seanad Éireann then. There was a confidence and supply agreement and there was a block of Independents here, from the Taoiseach's nominee Independents right across to the Independents who were directly elected by the universities or through the panel system. They formed a very strong, focused and cohesive group. They managed, despite all of the objections, to get to a situation where the councillors would have no fee. I would like to check that there is no proposal to levy local councillors so they would have to pay to engage with the planning authority. It would be outrageous if there was such a proposal. It was a hard battle and I hope we do not go down that road. I hope we do not try to rescind that waiver to councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> I will move on now to the other detail in the Bill starting with section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001. The Minister of State will be familiar with this section of the Act and the power it gives to elected members. Sections 138, 139 and 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 empower local authorities to prevent the manager or the chief executive, or the Executive <i>per se</i>, to carry out various issues. It gives power and control to the elected members. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, got great accolades and support this morning across the Houses for his commitment to local government. Earlier I spoke about maternity leave for councillors, along with the pay for elected members of local authorities. That is not enough. Better reform for councillors and sitting county councillors is important too, but let us remember that we cannot water down the powers for those councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> I will not go into a big history lesson here, but the record of the House will show that I made a strong case for keeping councillors' involvement in decisions relating to the disposal of lands to the Land Development Agency. This was resisted by all three sides of the Government. The vote was taken. Some might say that having a few votes is a waste of time but it sets the record of the House when the arguments are going to be debated outside of the House. The Official Report will show what some of us over on this side of the House tried to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> We had it with the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, and the arrangements around the harbours. A case was made that councillors would be considered. Again, this was resisted. We have it in relation to An Bord Pleanála and the special role the Association of Irish Local Government has with regard to feeding into the nomination for one of the panels. Again, this was resisted.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> This Government and the previous Government have centralised more powers. We hear of all the reforms of local government, but somehow there is a strong resistance to set out a series of measures to relinquish certain powers into local government. At best, it is a local administration and it is not local government. This is a pity. I am aware the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, is committed. He has been two and half years in the job and has a lot more to do. It is important. I am conscious of the large number of councillors the Minister of State has in his Fine Gael party, and in Fianna Fáil. These are big blocks of councillors who are also members of the Minister of State's party. I am aware the Minister of State has them engaged in the processes and feeding in and out of them, but one must start to scratch one's head and ask why is it that every time we make a case for these elected members across the board on the local council, they seem disappointed. I spoke with a colleague of the Minister of State who is a councillor. He told me they are powerless. There is the odd councillors' forum and they talk about issues but they cannot do anything with them. It is all part of the system. I just wanted to share this with the Minister of State, for what it is worth.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> This relates to the part of the Bill that provides that "Sections 138, 139 and 140 of the Local Government Act 2001 shall not apply in respect of development to which this section applies.". This means those sections that allow councillors to receive prior information about a development and so on. They will have the power to make changes under section 140. Section 140 is very important. I am saying to the Minister of State that I want us to work together to empower local authorities. This is not about further additional powers. I am trying to stop this Bill taking powers away from them. The Government is proposing to take powers away from these elected members. These are Fine Gael party members. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, has responsibility for local government, and he is doing a really good job, but why leave this legacy after him? The Minister of State will be very familiar with section 140 of the Local Government Act 2001, which states, "...an elected council or joint body may by resolution require any particular act, matter or thing specifically mentioned in the resolution and which the local authority or the manager concerned can lawfully do or effect, to be done or effected in the performance of the executive functions of the local authority." There are reserve functions of local authorities and there are executive functions of local authorities, as the Minister of State is aware. There is a clear mark between those functions. There is no doubt and no issues about them. Members respect the executive functions of the local government executive but by golly they will defend, and rightly so, the reserve functions that are given in law to elected members.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> I thank Senator Higgins. She has done a very good job with these amendments. I am, however, concerned in relation to environmental impact assessments and environmental impact statements. We must work in a spirit of co-operation with the environmental panels. They are not against us, they are not against the Minister of State and they are not against the Government. The Aarhus Convention was talked about in great detail and I do not propose to read out a summary of what the Aarhus Convention is. It is clear for anyone to see online. It is important because we live in a community but we also live in an environment. It is about proper planning and sustainable development. It is about consultation with all stakeholders. It is not about supporting the might of developers to do what they want to do. They have a role, and I am supportive of private development and supportive of private enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> I know what the Minister of State is dealing with when he spoke about the amendment that was made in the Dáil. Amendment No. 5 relates to local authority own housing development, and I am concerned about the subsection (d) which states, "...that is not subject to a requirement, in accordance with the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, for an assessment with regard to its effects on the environment...". What an extraordinary statement. The Green Party is in Government. Has it agreed to this? I am shocked by it. Subsection (e) states, "...that is not subject to a requirement, in accordance with the Habitats Directive, for an appropriate assessment...". The Minister of State sometimes asks why environmental groups and residents' associations must take judicial reviews. It should not happen. We need a good, strong, robust planning system. We should not put obstacles in front of people. We live in an environment and it is important. Many of the cases of judicial reviews that have been taken to An Bord Pleanála on planning matters have been successful. Indeed, there is one such case down the road from where I live. The residents gathered thousands of euro through coffee mornings, fund raisers, discos you name it. They were very successful. One can read the judgtments on the Courts Service website. It is clear the process is broken and needs to be mended, but I do not believe we should raise higher bars or raise higher walls to stop people. </p>
          <p eId="para_374">I remind the House that we live in communities. We were elected by communities. We are advocates and we should not apologise for being advocates for the environment and a better place to live.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> I think of Ringaskiddy and the incinerator. I had a look today. The names there and how they lent their support to the campaign are very interesting. I think of a case in County Galway which was on my desk again today. It was very interesting to see the number of elected representatives involved in that and I say "right" to them too. </p>
          <p eId="para_376"> They are just some general observations and comments. I want to work with the Minister of State, as does the committee. There is no point in a history lesson about what happened with the pre-legislative scrutiny. Let us not have another setback in our committee because it has been challenging and frustrating.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I understand the need and desire of the Minister of State and the Government to reform An Bord Pleanála. Of course there needs to be reform of An Bord Pleanála but one has to ask why it has taken so long. I shared with the Minister last week in this House the fact that I put a freedom of information request to An Bord Pleanála months ago. I was pleasantly surprised to receive all the documentation within two days. What does that tell you? It possibly tells you two things because this is speculation. One is that the board was delighted to get it into the public arena quickly. It certainly put it in a good light. I saw correspondence from the Department. The log should be up to date for An Bord Pleanála, although I had a letter from it this week telling me it was slightly delayed in uploading its latest freedom of information documents. I know it has had a substantial number of freedom of information requests so it is reasonable that it is not up to speed on its log for the past month. The documentation tells me that the board at the most senior level had been in touch with the Department to request additional supports and sanction for additional staff but that was not forthcoming. Qualifying conditions were set down. For every case you made, you had to get back to the Department. This was centralised control by the Custom House over the independent board. We want an independent board. We want able and capable people in planning. We want proper planning and sustainability from a variety of sectors representing a variety of interests in the board. We want to cut the link between the board and the Department. I am concerned and would like to see it changed in time. I know the Minister of State must push things along but I would like to see a change in time so that there is a full disconnect from Ministers or anybody else in respect of the independence and appointment of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> It is clear from the correspondence I have that the Department was aware of shortcomings in An Bord Pleanála. It has a strong relationship with the board and the planning regulator. Many of the individuals involved worked in the Custom House. They are not strangers to the Minister of State's people. When I think about the planning mess and why we got here, I wonder who were the architects of the strategic housing planning scheme that the Minister of State and his officials are now rightly saying was inappropriate and a disaster. It was a pity it took so long to wind it down because we are still flushing strategic fast-track projects through the system. Does the word "fast track" not say it all? It was on the Minister of State and Government's watch or part of its watch. It was in government. Who were the architects who spoke about rebuilding Ireland and how there would be nobody in a hotel in six months? We were assured of that. I questioned the chairman of the board and everybody else at every committee meeting. When I asked whether it had resources, I was told it had loads of resources, money and office space and did not need anything as it was handy-dandy and it was going to fast-track all this strategic housing. Now we have all woken up to the fact that it was a disaster. Where did the architects of all those policies end up? The Minister of State knows and I know, and we will leave it at that. We must be careful who we promote and prefer. There is an acceptance across the Houses that it was a disastrous policy that did not work. Now we are on to Housing for All. I wish Housing for All well. I wish for housing for everybody. What is important is security of tenure, decent homes and assisting people to live in communities across this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> I know I have meandered but I am passionate about it. I am passionate about the engagement of our citizens. I am particularly grateful to the Irish Environmental Network and the pillars associated with it, including An Taisce and other groups. I am very much associated with them and believe they are doing really good work. I acknowledge that the Government supports An Taisce. It supports the environmental networks. I got a print-out of what funding the Government sanctioned for them so let us not make it appear that it is a case of "them and us". There is very much a crossover between the Department and the funding of activities which are legitimate and admirable and should be encouraged. </p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I thank the Minister of State for his time and for listening. I have been sharing my thoughts. I genuinely wish the reform of An Bord Pleanála well in order that we can get on with housing. I welcome any reform of An Bord Pleanála. I want a faster system. I want a Part 8 system and I want it reformed but I do not want it abolished. I know the Minister of State will not do this but he is only one person in the Government. He and his colleagues must support the city and county councillors to do their job without eroding any of their current powers and functions. I remind the House that the chief executives of local authorities are not bad people. They have a very difficult job to do. Between us all, if we operate in a spirit of co-operation and collaboration, we can make proper planning and sustainable development for our communities and for the environment a top priority and a class act in which everyone will have confidence.</p>

          <from>Senator Rebecca Moynihan<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_381">I wish to speak to the grouping as a whole, and specifically to the so-called social housing amendment that was passed by the Dáil last night. Last week, we were told that this Bill needed to be fast-tracked through because we were in a housing emergency. The reality is that the social housing amendment has not been effectively looked at by the Department. In the briefing we received on Monday morning, I asked the Department whether it had a list of projects where the suspension of Part 8 might apply, or Part 11 as it is now. I asked the Department whether it had any units and what the on-site delivery times involved in that might be. Frankly, the Department did not know. It had done none of the homework on it and had not drafted the regulations to do with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> We have been here before at local authority level, specifically on Dublin City Council for the suspension of Part 8. It is worth bearing in mind that even if you suspend the 20 weeks in Part 8, you are not saving the full 20 weeks because there is an awful lot of the process that must be gone through. You cannot magic up houses out of nowhere, as the Government side often says. So you are not even making the 20-week savings but they do not know where this applies. There were projects that did not have a Part 8 process that went through. I refer to developments like Springvale in Chapelizod, which is two minutes down the road from me, and Bonham Street, which is just off Cork Street, for the provision of modular housing just down the road from where I grew up. None of them will be ready before 2024. We signed off on that in 2018 so I do not see the logic of doing this as part of this Bill except to provide window-dressing for the Bill, which is effectively a ministerial or - as I see it - departmental power grab of An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> There are small changes that could have been made to An Bord Pleanála. Emergency legislation could have been introduced for the appointment of a chairman. There is no reason to do it during the last sitting week before Christmas. We have much fanfare about a Bill that was agreed by the Government but again lacks detail and has yet to be published in advance of January. For the life of me, I cannot see the logic and do not understand why this is being rushed through this House this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The last time we did this in 2016, we did it for the SHD process. Again, we were told this would speed up the delivery of social housing and we were in the middle of a housing crisis. What resulted was a load of housing delivery items getting bogged down in the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> What we have in this country is a permissions system. We do not have a planning system. </p>
          <p eId="para_386">We do not have adequate master planning or pre-planning. We have SDZs, but they do not apply everywhere. There are individual disputes over individual projects and we do not join up our thinking. The blame does not lie with any particular side - Government, Opposition or otherwise - because the organisation has been established for almost 50 years. The evidence shows that we are not meeting our housing, climate and transport targets. We have an opportunity to look at international best practice in planning and to adopt an entirely new system, rather than adopting these last-minute rushed pieces of legislation to change the make-up of a board and do some tinkering around the edges with legislation that has been floated, but has not even been published for us to see the detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> I want to put on the record of the House that no specific homework has been done on the social housing provision. We are told it is specifically for social housing and aims to speed up delivery. I would fully support it if that is what it was going to do. However, that is not the case. We have the evidence in projects that were agreed in 2018, with Part 8 suspension, and now there are people who are not going to be in their homes until 2024. That was the exact reasoning and rationale behind the suspension of Part 8 then. I cannot see how this is any different in any way. It appears to be spin and window-dressing.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">I will speak to the amendments and the Bill generally. As a member of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, it is a real privilege to work with my colleagues from this House and from the Dáil, the Minister of State's Department and all relevant stakeholders. The joint committee completed pre-legislative scrutiny on this important legislation, albeit not with the most recent amendments. My colleagues and I see legislation as being an iterative process. The Planning and Development Act was first introduced in 2000 and the foreshore legislation was introduced in the 1990s. Legislation constantly needs to be updated. It is important that we remember that. We must not see today's debate as being an end point. This legislation seeks to amend existing legislation to enable us to move forward. Everybody accepts and recognises the need for it. I do not believe I have heard anybody object to an initiative to try to improve our planning process and the functions within it. Everybody is hugely disappointed in the deterioration and the disappearance of confidence in An Bord Pleanála. Many of the allegations that have been made were made anecdotally for quite a while. There was anecdotal discontent with the organisations. The allegations that the Minister referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda and SIPO, following consultation with the Attorney General, are very serious. They will have serious consequences and have already had such consequences for our country, society and for development and planning generally. It is imperative that every effort is made and that we all work together to try to re-establish some level of confidence in a professional, objective, transparent planning system.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> The amendments relating to An Bord Pleanála are only short-term measures. The Government has signalled its acknowledgement of that by indicating its intention to bring forward much more substantive planning legislation in the new year. That legislation will follow over a year's work on the part of the Attorney General, working with the Minister, the Department and other stakeholders. I look forward to the publication of the complete legislation and to engaging with all stakeholders in the pre-legislative scrutiny. It is really important that when we undertake to make new laws to create a consolidated, comprehensive and fit-for-purpose planning process, we must look at every element of the planning process, from national planning, regional planning, city planning and county planning, right down to planning at the very local level. Obviously, the national planning framework and the regional, county and city development plans are already in place. I know that in Dublin city and in local authorities all over the country, local authority members, communities, residents, individuals, business owners and all stakeholders, including environmentalists or cultural stakeholders, are involved. In my own community, the stakeholders that engage in those city and county development plans include parents, schools and clubs. They are really important. The public participation in the making of those plans is paramount. The SDZ process and the local area plan process should also be reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I acknowledge the Minister of State and the Government for their recognition of the failure of the SHD process, which led to even greater inertia and delays in the delivery of really important infrastructure, including homes, and resulted in far too many judicial reviews. No homes or vital infrastructure, including schools and transport, environmental and energy infrastructure, will ever be delivered in a courtroom. It was really important that the SHD process was done away with. It should also be acknowledged in this debate that the introduction of the large-scale residential development process is an absolute acknowledgement of the primacy of local knowledge, the understanding of local needs and the local ability to make decisions on what are and are not good planning and development proposals for local communities. The fact that the large-scale residential process has restored decision-making at a local level is welcomed by councillors and local authority members all over the country. I acknowledge the Government's acceptance of the failure of the SHD process and most importantly, the proactive and constructive action of introducing the large-scale residential process, which has restored local decision-making at a local authority level and allows for the participation of communities, residents, local businesses, schools, organisations and environmental groups. Anyone with an interest in specific developments is invited to engage, participate and have their say.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> The local authority members are the bedrock of our democracy. They are the people who champion ambition and opportunities for their local communities. They are best positioned to guide and inform development in their local areas. This Government has enabled and supported those local councillors. For far too long the councillors have been under-resourced and undersupported. I commend the Minister of State and the Government on having acknowledged the really important role that local authority members play, and for having ensured are better resourced. I would not say they are as adequately resourced as they could be, but that is a debate for another day. I acknowledge the Government taking action to ensure they have some modicum of resourcing. </p>
          <p eId="para_392"> It is important when it comes to housing that local authority members have been empowered by the affordable housing legislation. For far too long our local authority members have not been in a position to deliver any form of affordable housing in their local authority areas. In Dublin city and county and many other parts of the country, the affordability of housing is second only to the supply of housing as an issue. This Government and the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, in support of the Government, implemented the Affordable Housing Act 2021. This legislation has, for the first time in over a decade, given local authorities the power to deliver social and affordable housing. As well as that, for the first time in the history of the State, local authorities have the power to deliver affordable cost rental housing. This is an important initiative and I know from speaking to councillors that they value it. They value the fact that, for the first time, they will be able to exercise and influence the delivery of social, affordable and affordable cost rental homes on local authority lands. It is a huge innovation, which is long overdue and desperately needed. Councillors welcome it and are committed to making use of the €20 billion in funding the Government has allocated to ensure a massive increase in the delivery of social and affordable homes, including 90,000 social homes and 60,000 affordable homes. I urge the Minister of State and the Government to continue to support, enable and fund local authorities because they are best positioned to understand their communities' needs and what needs to be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> In Dublin city, where the chief executive exercises the power to deliver social and affordable public homes on public land without a Part 8 process applying, the local authorities will be required to commence construction before 31 December 2024. I look forward to that change. That deadline is welcome and I know from speaking to councillors that they appreciate that some urgency will be brought to bear on the delivery of homes in our city and county because for far too long they have not been in that position. They have been at the coalface of dealing with and responding to their communities and fighting for adequate social and affordable homes for them but until now they have not been in a position to deliver them. It is important that they are being enabled and supported to do this and that the chief executives work with the local authority members, including by making information available to them and taking advantage of the value local authority members can bring to the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> I hope we can move swiftly to the next Stage after we have disposed of these amendments. I look forward to the substantial work ahead in the new year. It has been more than 20 years since the last planning and development legislation was passed. I look forward to engaging across the House and bringing forward proposals and legislation that will be fit for purpose into the future, will take us through the next 20, 30 or 40 years and will enable the delivery of housing and other vital social infrastructure such as energy projects. We are all acutely aware of the energy crisis. As a country, society and economy, we must secure our energy independence. It is taking far too long for us to develop vital energy infrastructure and we must move away from that. We have an enormous opportunity with offshore wind and I am hoping the legislation the Minister will bring forward will enable the delivery of renewables.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> As regards public transport infrastructure and the way we live and move around, we need to ensure we have a planning process that is objective, transparent and fit for purpose. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit and his Department for the work they have done on this. I look forward to working with them on the future legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_396">I thank the Senators for their contributions. On the Government amendments, I note the huge challenge we are facing with homelessness and the Ukrainian citizens here. We must ensure we provide a strong and robust Government response and international protection. These Government amendments seek to temporarily disapply the Part 8 planning approval process for local authority developments, specifically for housing, to try to meet that demand. I understand that 38 different projects and sites have been volunteered by local authorities. Last week, the Cabinet approved €100 million in funding which will give local authorities a chance to reduce their debt level on various sites they own and deliver badly needed public housing for our citizens. This amendment will do a huge amount to resolve the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> To respond to Senator Warfield, there will be a quarterly report by local authorities on the specific sites that were using this mechanism to increase housing supply. We are talking about modern methods of construction and trying to use innovative responses to ensure we strongly increase our housing supply. The environmental impact assessment directive was transposed into our planning code in 2018. We are ensuring that all the projects that go through this process will have been screened out for AA and EIA, which are critical to meeting our very important environmental obligations. I fully appreciate the volume of legislation coming before Senators. I thank the committee for adjudicating on this legislation.

          <p eId="para_400">I cannot accept amendment No. 1 as provision for virtual or blended meetings of the board is an efficiency measure to facilitate the board in processing its caseload. It is consistent with other recent statutory initiatives, such as the holding of annual general meetings virtually, through the Companies Act 2014. It is not intended to create a distinction between an in-person, virtual or blended board meeting by having different meeting arrangements for such meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I will not be accepting amendment No. 2 either as there is no basis for having a different meeting quorum for in-person, virtual or blended board meetings. A board meeting will be a board meeting whether it is held in-person, electronically or by a combination of both, provided the minimum statutory quorum and any other statutory requirements for the meeting are complied with.</p>

          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T14:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_402">Serious concerns about An Bord Pleanála have been flagged for a long time. We have heard a lot about the Government learning from things. I welcome the inclusion of a use it or lose it requirement in the section. We looked for such a requirement when SHDs were going through and we were not given it. We flagged concerns on SHDs back in 2016 and they were not listened to. That is why we should have proper and better Oireachtas engagement. Sometimes Members, even those who are not on the Government benches, make useful points that should be listened to.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Similarly, when it comes to An Bord Pleanála and its decision-making, we had the extraordinary situation just before last summer when we were looking for significant and important decisions, not so much on retention but on brand-new projects on adjoining sites that the Government had successfully fast-tracked to An Bord Pleanála, that there were already serious concerns in the public domain concerning the board and its operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I have listened repeatedly in recent years to Government representatives saying the problem is everyone who takes a case against An Bord Pleanála rather than that the problem is An Bord Pleanála's failure to properly apply decision making and deliver on it. There have been concerns around the process. It shows in the rulings on how the law has been applied and as to whether there has been proper scrutiny. </p>
          <p eId="para_405"> There are other concerns. One thing which arose that is slightly addressed here is how two members of An Bord Pleanála, one of whom is now under investigation, signed off on a pile of things all together. We need to be really careful. There is a concern that within An Bord Pleanála and with certain members there appears to have been a somewhat cavalier culture in respect of the application of the fulfilment of responsibilities and the application of scrutiny. We brought forward amendments to improve confidence. When we last looked at it, I brought forward amendments around declaration of interest and strengthening the declaration of interest requirement but the Government chose not to accept those. We brought forward other forms of requirements and scrutiny. These are things that would have genuinely improved public confidence such as measures to improve the panel system. It was a very good system because it was meant to address the idea that you would draw from different parts of society. The problem with the panel system was that entities that no-longer existed were allowed to nominate people and, indeed, their nominees seeming to be chosen in preference. Two of the Irish Rural Dwellers Association nominees were chosen, for example, even though that entity no longer existed. We put forward genuinely constructive amendments to address the confidence issues but instead we have something the Government told us it was planning anyway and it has nothing to do with restoring confidence which is that it wanted to move towards it being all members who were coming through selected by the Government through an unknown process and procedure that will be invented after the fact. The Bill states that it shall be a procedure that shall be created after the fact with functions that may or may not be performed by a committee. It is not the same as with any other body or Ministry.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> Our planning structures were designed explicitly because of the lessons learned from years and years of difficulties and from the tribunals and scandals of the past, etc. They were explicitly designed to ensure that too much power was not given to a Minister with responsibility for planning and housing who sets the policy and the laws so that they would not have undue influence on the application and adjudication of those policies. That is why there were lots of safeguards such as how only one third of members could be appointed by the Minister. There were safeguards around section 30 and how the Minister could not have undue influence in respect of an individual application. Those safeguards have been eroded now because not only can the Minister appoint all the members of the board, rather than one third, but if they do not like what the board states, the Minister can add other temporary members and shift the numbers as much as they wish. Those members can be in the difficult position where they may be seconded from a Department where they must then go back and continue to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I genuinely believe this Bill will further damage public confidence in An Bord Pleanála and, in that context, we need to ensure at the very minimum that we have safety-net measures. These are two amendments which are very reasonable. There were those who said that I should oppose the remote video or telephone options because of the lack of confidence but I am in favour of remote and hybrid work options and will always support them. What I have proposed are two very simple safety-net clauses that will ensure the new powers in respect of remote meeting are not abused. One is to require that the quorum for a remote meeting shall be five. Given the membership will be at least 14 and could be up into the 20s, as temporary members are appointed, a quorum of five is not unduly onerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> The Bill refers to sections relating to the local authorities. They are required to have at least one third of their members present for making those important decisions. It is reasonable that you would have five members of a aboard of 14, 20 or whatever it might be for a video meeting. Remote telephone or video conferencing makes it more possible for members to be present. </p>
          <p eId="para_409"> We should remember that the Bill no longer sets out the requirement that used to exist that there would be one member of An Bord Pleanála who has expertise in environmental law. That is no longer a requirement under this Bill where it was under the previous legislation. Now there is simply 14 members with a balance of skills across them. If we do not have a quorum of five in relation to some of the crucial decisions, we risk that necessary skills that should be applied in relation to a permission or a decision will not be present because we are relying on a diffusion of skills across the board rather than targeted and specialist skills. A quorum of five means there is more chance we get better decisions and a mix of skills, perspectives and expertise applied to those decisions. </p>
          <p eId="para_410"> It was alarming for the public to hear of two members getting together and making a lot of decisions. We do not want any situation whereby a member or members of the board can say, "Let us meet in half an hour or an hour." It is bad practice that sometimes happens where people might be told of a meeting with an hour's notice or even two minutes after the meeting started. That practice where someone can say they had a meeting and they had sent something around at lunchtime to say they would meet at 3 p.m. is dangerous.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">That is very dangerous and that is the kind of situation that happens when people almost want to take advantage of people's other commitments and the fact they must schedule their time. Again, it leads to bad decisions. I am not looking to remove the provision of remote conferencing but I am saying that if there is a remote meeting, 72 hours' notice should be given. That is very reasonable. There would be an obligation to inform the board members, all 14, that there will be a meeting. Those who can make it can attend but we would not have the situation whereby decisions were made in a rush which are bad and end up being rightly challenged by judicial review because either there was not the right expertise in the room or, in some very unfortunate cases, as we have seen in the past, there was opportunism attached to those decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> These amendments are reasonable. Whatever about the quorum, which I like as an idea, the 72-hours' notice is fairly reasonable. I know we are all in a hurry but if you cannot give three days' notice of an important meeting, that will have serious consequences and that is a problem.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T15:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_414">As a body politic, we need to restore confidence in An Bord Pleanála and the whole planning process. I have a pathological dislike of the whole virtual meeting scenario given that we are now out of Covid. Yesterday, we met members of the Local Authority Members Association, LAMA.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Some council meetings are now held virtually or a blended version is available. Several possible scenarios could present themselves here. If there is a vote, mar shampla, on a proposal and it is my turn to vote, I could pretend that my line had frozen, the screen was not working or I could not hear and I could opt out of making a decision. Another possible scenario is that the recording system may not allow for the recording of the vote of a member online because it could be said that the system did not work or it broke down. Post-Covid, I have a dislike of the use of virtual meetings, especially in the context of the planning process.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Senator Higgins is right about the notification process and the due time. While I agree that 72 hours is reasonable, what happens if there is an emergency? Is there a window of 24 hours in the case of an emergency? All of us agree that there is a need to reform our planning processes. As former members of local authorities, as politicians and as residents, we have all engaged with appeals at An Bord Pleanála and so on. I made the point on the Order of Business yesterday, which is probably the minority view in my own political party, that I would not like to see residents' groups within the catchment area of a planning application being unable to submit an objection to An Bord Pleanála or to apply for a judicial review. I will use the example of the M28, which will be one of the most important roads for Cork city because it will facilitate the movement of the Port of Cork down to Ringaskiddy. Had there been real engagement by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, with the residents and local organisations, there would never have been a judicial review. To be fair to An Bord Pleanála, its old hearing system was very good. It allowed for a real presentation of the issues, a thorough examination of same and the result came back, which was fine. However, the residents took a different view, which is their prerogative. </p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Let us proceed with reform to restore confidence in our planning process. We need a planning process that delivers, most particularly one that delivers houses as a matter of urgency and priority without having to stop at every single check and balance. That said, we do need checks and balances. In response to Senator Higgins again, I am concerned that if we tie the hands of officials with bureaucracy then we will be back to where we are today, where there are roadblocks and no way forward.</p>

          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_418">I echo some of the concerns of the two previous speakers. Do I need a lesson in short notice for meetings, and virtual ones at that? That is a question for another day. I sit on three audit committees, one of which is the Oireachtas audit committee. It deals with audits relating to Oireachtas Members, their pay, security and a whole range of other issues but I am sure Members would be appalled if they thought the audit committee could discuss the Minister of State and his pay, for example, at a virtual meeting. It would not be right or proper. I have resisted virtual meetings in all areas of my life. I do not know how Fine Gael operated during Covid-19 in terms of virtual meetings but I accept that the Covid period was exceptional.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Serious allegations of corruption and collusion have been made against the board of An Bord Pleanála. I am aware of the rumours and the media coverage of the issues and I look forward to the speedy presentation of the report to these Houses for debate. We can talk all we want about cleaning up the board's act but if we do not hang, draw and quarter some of the people involved, we are not going to be effective. That is what the public expects and wants, and it is something I would support. We need to clearly hear what was going on and what happens next. People going off into the sunset, taking pensions, going on holidays, taking sick or extended leave and running from interrogation, examination, transparency and accountability is simply not good enough. That said, there are processes in place which I respect and I am not going to go into any more detail on this now. I assure the House, however, that I will be standing up in this Chamber in a few months asking for the reports to be made public and I will not accept excuses such as that the reports are <i>sub judice </i>or that there are issues around privacy and confidentiality. This is about our public planning system, taxpayers' money, and accountability and transparency in our planning processes. </p>
          <p eId="para_420"> There is a lot of money to be made when one gets a favourable planning decision. If decisions are skewed in one's favour in any walk of life, there is money to be made and that is at the root of some of the problems we have here. Who is to suggest that some prime developer in Dublin does not have access to An Bord Pleanála? Who is to suggest that a new planning authority or body would not facilitate it? Remember, members of An Bord Pleanála came under pressure previously. I am not confident that pressure could not be put on the board by developers or by anybody who wants something that others do not want to give them and that is not good for our planning process. </p>
          <p eId="para_421"> The commissioners or inspectors will be well paid; indeed, they are well paid now. An Bord Pleanála has headquarters on Marlborough Street and it may have other offices around the country. Members can get up, do a day's work and be accountable. They can don their shirts and suits, go to Marlborough Street and do their job. I do not buy the idea that they can open a laptop on their breakfast counter and semi-engage in the planning process. We must be really careful here. I know we are coming out of Covid but we have learned a lot of lessons about virtual meetings and blended working. The issues being considered are hugely sensitive and so open to influence and pressure. </p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I want to be clear that the vast majority of people in An Bord Pleanála do a really good job and I do not want people to think otherwise. I believe the organisation should be retained and reformed. I do not believe we need to be playing around with changing the name and so on. An Bord Pleanála has done well and has delivered some really good results. I have taken some appeals to An Bord Pleanála and have been very pleased with the outcome. I have also taken other appeals and not been pleased with the outcome but I recognised that the board was at a remove from the situation and presented a strong rationale for its decisions. That said, it could improve somewhat in terms of presenting its rationale or providing an explanation for some of its decisions. Part of the problem is the fact that the public does not understand the board's decisions, particularly when the board overrules the recommendations of its own inspectors. </p>
          <p eId="para_423"> To return to the issue of virtual meetings, I am involved in a planning application in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown that has gone on for a number of years. It is a very sizeable and considerable development on a site that is zoned either major town centre or neighbourhood town centre. It has enormous potential. There has been to-ing and fro-ing with An Bord Pleanála. Some months ago there was a limited and virtual oral hearing during which Oireachtas Members, including me, engaged but still there is no decision on what is a very substantial application. One must ask what is going on here. We were told that the hearing would be virtual in order to speed up the whole process. We all went online in the morning and said our piece. The developer came and said his piece, as did the elected members of the council. The planning authority also had some contributions to make and rightly so. The point is that the virtual meeting did not speed anything up. I am very happy to share details of this particular case with anyone who is interested. This is a very significant application but somehow all of the virtual business and the limited, virtual oral hearing came to nothing.</p>

          <from>Senator Paddy Burke<recordedTime time="2022-12-15T15:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_424">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is important legislation to restore confidence in An Bord Pleanála. I remember when Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach, which is quite a few years ago - we have had a number of Taoisigh since then - he brought forward legislation to fast track the planning process for large projects. Since then, the whole system has actually slowed down, in every aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> I have a few points to make in respect of the planning system. I appeal to the Minister of State to notify county managers in regard to how planning staff should operate. Usually, when a planning application goes in and the 60 days are up, the planning officer will send out for further information. That should not be happening in this day and age. People who lodge a planning application should know within a couple of days whether they have made a full application. If further information is required to make the application legitimate, for want of another word, applicants should know that within a few days. It is not acceptable to have applicants waiting two months and then getting a notification that their application is not complete and additional information is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> In larger counties like my own, County Mayo, there is a huge difference between the different municipal districts. The latter should be able to make recommendations when the county development plan is being compiled. When a county council meets, the process is very unwieldy, with a lot of debate and different projects to discuss. In Mayo, there are issues to do with marine areas, inland areas, lakes and so forth. The different municipal districts could add to the development of the county plan in a way that is better for local communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> As Senator Buttimer said, this is all about restoring confidence in An Bord Pleanála. I am opposed to virtual meetings because they may be open to manipulation. Online participants might have people with vested interests sitting beside them.</p>

          <p eId="para_429">It is a weakness in the case for such arrangements. I would be wary that it might put members under stress and lead to corruption or whatever else.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The members of An Bord Pleanála are well paid, as Senator Boyhan said. At every meeting, the question should be asked as to whether members have a vested interest in the cases being dealt with. They should have to sign a declaration before every meeting stating they have no vested interest in the particular files being considered. There is a lot at stake here. People can be vulnerable. As we know, people can be got to in lots of ways. There should be a system in place whereby all boards members, or whoever is dealing with the planning applications, are required, at every meeting, to sign off on their having no vested interest in respect of the files they are considering. If a person does have an interest in a matter or knows somebody involved in it, he or she should leave the meeting, indicating why, and that should be recorded.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I thank the Senators for their contributions. It is important to ensure the public has confidence in the integrity and consistency of An Bord Pleanála. Under this Bill and, in particular, the new planning and development Bill we will bring forward next year, we are implementing significant reform of the board. This is being done in response to the first report of the Office of the Planning Regulator. We await its second report, the recommendations of which we hope to encompass in the new Bill. That legislation will be significant and important in ensuring the board operates correctly. We are all aware of the challenge in terms of the backlog and the need to get housing units built for our citizens. Key to this is ensuring that the board is operating correctly.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> Senators raised a number of points. The meeting quorum of two is being increased to three, which is an important change to ensure good practice.
