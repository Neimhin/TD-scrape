            <p eId="para_19">I thank the Minister for coming to the House. I hope he will provide good news on the upgrade of the N5 between Ballaghaderreen and Scramoge. I wish to emphasise how important the provision of capital funding is for this project, and it is a matter of urgency. I am very concerned about the high volumes of traffic using the road, which is our main route to the west. The section of road in question traverses many towns and villages and I am very concerned about the high volumes of traffic going through Strokestown, Tulsk, Ballinagar and Frenchpark and onto the Ballaghaderreen bypass.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> I am also concerned at the excessive speeds at which people drive on the road. As an important route to the west, it should be much safer. Last week, there was another very serious collision and the road between Tulsk and Ballinagar was closed for several hours. This is not unique and there have been many accidents on this section of the road over the years. Four sites have been identified as accident clusters by Transport Infrastructure Ireland and up to 30 accidents have occurred on a bend in one section of the road just outside Frenchpark. Real action is needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I received an update from Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in February, stating that Roscommon County Council had completed the business case, the environmental impact statement and the compulsory purchase order documentation for the proposed N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge road project. All the documentation has been submitted to Transport Infrastructure Ireland for approval to make an application to An Bord Pleanála. Where is the project at? My understanding is that the business case was submitted to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a response is awaited before its submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It will cost in excess of €100 million but it is badly needed. Initiatives have been launched in the context of the action plan for rural Ireland and the need for more balanced regional development and it is important that areas such as north Roscommon, which have gone through a very difficult time economically, have an adequate road network that allows people to get to their destinations in a timely and safe manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> Can the Minister give an update on his commitment to this project? Can he also say where the project stands, in respect of the business case and the submission to An Bord Pleanála? It is our responsibility to do everything possible to reduce the risks and the number of accidents on this section of road. The part between Strokestown and Ballaghaderreen is a high-risk area and numerous accidents have occurred. We need to take real action and to invest to make the route a safer way to access the west.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport (Deputy Shane Ross)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_23">The most convincing arguments around issues of this nature are the ones that concern safety. Everybody knows that the amount of money available for roads is limited and we cannot just magic up money for every road that needs upgrading. The Senator's argument is compelling. Road safety is important and lives have to be saved so the TII is identifying accident black spots. Following the European court judgment that the TII could not charge VAT, an extra €17 million is now available for these black spots.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, is being encouraged by my Department to use a portion of that money to deal with accident black spots and address death on the roads. The accidents to which the Senator referred on the road in question are a convincing argument why this should be considered by TII in its commitment to tackle black spots because of this rebate both this year and next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for TII under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network. The maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer. Due to the national financial position, there have been large reductions in Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure over the past several years.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects is a matter, in the first instance, for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. The Government’s capital investment plan, Building on Recovery - Infrastructure and Capital Investment, provides the strategic and financial framework for TII’s national roads programme from 2016 to 2022. As Minister, I have to work within the capital budgets included in the plan. In turn, TII has to prioritise works on the basis of the funding available to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_28"> Roscommon County Council is proposing an N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge road improvement scheme which extends from the eastern end of the Ballaghaderreen bypass to Scramoge, a distance of 33 km. Given the limited funding envelope available under the capital investment plan and the primary focus on maintenance and renewal of the network rather than new projects, this scheme is not included as part of the plan. TII has, however, provided an allocation of €700,000 to Roscommon County Council for the scheme this year to enable the planning process to progress. Roscommon County Council has completed the business case for the proposed N5 Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge road project.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> All major capital projects are subject to the project appraisal requirements in the public spending code and my Department's common appraisal framework for transport projects, as well as An Bord Pleanála’s development consent process. In this context, a cost-benefit analysis, CBA, for all schemes costing over €20 million is required as part of the business case for the project. In line with the project appraisal requirements, each CBA needs to be assessed by the economic and financial evaluation unit in my Department and then reviewed by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_30"> The CBA for the Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge scheme has been submitted to my Department for evaluation. If the CBA were to be found compliant with project appraisal guidance, a separate decision would be needed on the business case which takes account of the availability of funding for the project. It is not possible at this point to indicate what the outcome of the project assessment process will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> As regards ongoing maintenance on the route, TII allocates funding specifically for safety works based on its analysis of the network. This year, TII has allocated about €17 million for such works. Under its HD15 programme, safety works are based on an analysis of accident density across the network and those sections of the network with considerably higher than average accident densities are selected for analysis. Sections of road which are amenable to engineering solutions are prioritised for treatment. The road in question should be a candidate for this. In addition, TII operates a HD17 programme based on road safety inspection reports. These reports indicate which issues, for example signing, lining or safety barriers, need to be addressed on different sections of road and programmes are drawn up to deal with the priority issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> It should be noted good pavements also contribute to road safety and TII has allocated approximately €50 million for pavements in 2017.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">I thank the Minister for his response. I must emphasise the importance of the progression of this project. He rightly stated we need to focus on projects which deal with improving road safety. The N5 road between Ballaghaderreen to Scramoge is an identified accident black spot and we need to ensure everything is done to ensure that capital funding is made available. I will continue to work with the Minister until we secure the funding because it is critical. Every accident that happens on a route that is not fit for purpose is one too many. We need to minimise the risk.</p>

            <p eId="para_36">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil léi as teacht isteach chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> I want to raise the issue of hospital car parking charges for cancer patients across the hospital network. A cancer diagnosis is a traumatic and life-changing event. Among many things it can incur, it can perhaps mean someone has to give up their work, resulting in a lack of income for the individual and their family. To add to the hurt, they then have to fork out serious prices for hospital parking charges when they are getting treatment for their cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> I acknowledge some hospitals have, off their own bat, allowed free or subsidised parking for some of these patients in question. The Irish Cancer Society, however, has called for the HSE, Health Service Executive, and the Minister to take a lead on this and issue guidelines to all hospitals to ensure clarity on this particular issue across the hospital network. For example, when someone gets their first letter about their cancer treatment, it should identify where the free car parking spots in the hospital are located.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> The Irish Cancer Society has had a campaign on this particular issue for some time, seeking a meeting with the Minister on it. Unfortunately, that meeting has not been forthcoming. Will the Minister of State take this issue on board and give us a commitment that this issue will be examined? As a first step along that road, will she make a commitment this morning to meet with the Irish Cancer Society so that a programme can be put in place to ensure our citizens who are going through the traumatic and life-changing experience of dealing with cancer do not have to worry about car parking charges, which in some cases can go up to €800 a month?</p>

            <p eId="para_40">The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, apologises for his absence. I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_41"> When an individual is given a diagnosis of cancer, they, along with their family, are going through a traumatic experience. It is incumbent on us to make that treatment as easy as possible. As the Senator said, it is important to recognise some hospitals have given a waiver for or put a cap on car parking charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> I thank Senator Gallagher for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the matter. In the past decade, parking charges have been introduced in many of our hospitals. It is important to note that these parking charges form part of a series of measures that ensure that the operational costs of providing parking services do not impact negatively on a hospital's overall budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> As demand for parking services at our hospitals increases, so do the associated costs of providing these services, such as the initial capital cost of purchasing or renting parking areas, the cost of developing extra parking spaces, the need to provide and upgrade security systems in hospital car parks, and staffing and general maintenance of parking services.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> I am advised by the HSE and the Minister that the HSE does not provide guidelines on hospital car parking and that each hospital or hospital group implements its own guidelines. For example and as the Senator is aware, Temple Street Children's University Hospital, the National Maternity Hospital and Mercy University Hospital in Cork do not provide public car parks. Some hospitals, such as St. Luke's in Rathgar, Merlin Park University Hospital in Galway and Mallow General Hospital, do not charge a car parking fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The HSE has advised that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and re-investment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investment in security. The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income being used to contribute to the general hospital budget or to fund research or specific patient facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Hospitals that charge parking fees are cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families, particularly those with long-term illnesses. Consequently, some hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping this expense. Some hospitals provide reduced car parking fees for patients with cancer who are attending for long-term treatment. However, there are many conditions that can require long-term care and it is difficult to prioritise one over another. It is important to consider the clinical circumstances of all patients who require long-term care rather than those with one particular condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> While there is no national HSE policy governing car park charges, the HSE has advised me that it keeps hospital parking charges under review. In terms of the future development of our hospital system, we must take account of public transport services. By supporting the expansion of public transport facilities, we continue to provide more transportation choices to the public when visiting their loved ones in our hospitals. This is one of the key reasons for the choosing of the site of the new children's hospital, in that it has access to various types of public transport and routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> I cannot make a commitment on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris, to meet the organisation, but I can take that request to him and ask him to reply to the organisation directly.</p>

            <p eId="para_50"> Guidance from the HSE is required. With respect, it is not good enough to leave the decision to individual hospitals.

            <p eId="para_55">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Creed, to the House. He will have an opportunity to get water and draw his breath. I thank him for attending personally because this is an important issue. I spent last Saturday in Balmoral, Northern Ireland, at the agricultural show. It was amazing how many farmers from the South were there. One of the major topics of conversation besides Brexit was their GLAS 1 and 2 payments. It was interesting. The <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> had a large stand at the show. Many people, particularly farmers from the Republic, gravitated to this issue. This week, there was a headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> referring to how more than 2,000 farmers had been left in limbo over their GLAS 1 and 2 payments from the Department. This is becoming a bit of a joke.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> On 21 February, I raised the fact that a number of farmers had still not been paid GLAS 1 and 2 payments under the terms and conditions of the 2015-20 farmers' charter of rights. Nearly three months on there has been little progress. More than 2,000 farmers are making a strong case for payments to which they believe they are entitled. As the Minister will be aware, many of them have absorbed the costs involved in joining GLAS 1 and 2. For example, they have paid upfront for GLAS 1 nutrition and management plans, commonage plans and soil sampling plans. Other costs include bird coverage and tree planting. The Minister knows the schemes involved. Farmers are spending on the strength of the grant payments that they are expecting from the Department. They have upheld their side of the conditions applying to the scheme and have incurred significant costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> I took the time yesterday to examine GLAS payments and who co-funds them. They are co-funded by the Exchequer and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, EAFRD. There are obligations in that regard. I also took the time to read the farmers' charter of rights, which the Department and the Minister's predecessors signed up to.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> Farmers want to know when the Minister will be in a position to process all outstanding payments. Will he confirm whether more than 2,000 farmers are still waiting to receive GLAS payments? This matter is critical and there can be no further delays. It needs to be addressed urgently.</p>

            <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Michael Creed)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_59">I thank Senator Boyhan for raising this matter on the Commencement and for giving me an opportunity to outline the up-to-date position regarding the 2016 GLAS payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> This and previous agri-environmental schemes provide support to participants to deliver public goods and environmental benefits that enhance Ireland's agricultural sustainability credentials. The scheme delivers overarching benefits in terms of the rural environment while addressing the mitigation of impacts of climate change, the improvement of water quality and the enhancement of biodiversity. The scheme also allows participants to improve their agricultural productivity and practices in a sustainable manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> GLAS has a maximum annual payment of €5,000 under the general scheme, with provision for a payment of up to €7,000 known as GLAS+, where the farmer is required to give exceptional environmental commitments, in a limited number of cases. Applications under the first two tranches of the GLAS scheme resulted in almost 38,000 farmers being approved into the scheme in its first year of implementation. This represented an unprecedented level of participation in the first year of an agri-environmental scheme in Ireland. Just under 14,000 further participants have been approved under GLAS 3. This brought overall participation levels to in excess of the participation level projected in Ireland's rural development programme of 50,000 farmers.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> The 2016 payments represent the first full year of payment under GLAS. Only participants in GLAS tranches 1 and 2 are eligible for a payment in respect of 2016. At the end of December 2016, there were approximately 37,500 active participants in tranches 1 and 2, of which 27,400, or over 70%, received 85% of their 2016 payments in December. These payments were valued at more than €97 million. Payments can only issue where all required validation checks have been successfully passed. The up-to-date position is that payments have now issued in 93% of cases. These payments bring the total amount paid to more than €121 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_63"> GLAS has a range of more than 30 actions available for selection by applicants. Under EU regulations, compliance with each action must be verified. Therefore, there are validations associated with each of these actions. As a result, there are a number of different reasons for some cases not being finalised. Many of these issues, given their complexity, require review on a case-by-case basis. This work is ongoing in the remaining 2,700 cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">My Department has been in direct contact with participants or their advisers in cases where issues remain to be resolved and is making every effort to resolve outstanding issues on a case-by-case basis. Additional information or outstanding documentation has been requested and is awaited in over 1,000 of these cases. In this regard, I would urge participating farmers to return any outstanding documentation, such as interim commonage management plans and annual low emission slurry spreading declaration forms, and to respond to queries as soon as possible to facilitate payment. In cases where these and other outstanding issues with individual applications are resolved, payments will continue to issue on an ongoing weekly basis, including further payments this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> I am keenly aware of the need to process these cases without delay. I would like to assure the Senator that my Department officials and I are ensuring that the resources required both on the IT and administrative side are directed towards resolving the outstanding queries on these cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I thank the Minister for that comprehensive response. I wish to comment on two things he has said in his response. There are about 1,000 queries on validation and process. That is fair enough. He has to apply the scheme. The Minister has not confirmed this, but according to official figures this week there are more than 2,090 outstanding issues. If 1,000 is subtracted from 2,000 - we will round it off - there are still 1,000 people whom the Minister has not addressed in this response. He says there are 1,000 but we know that research published this week in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i>, which I have shared with the Minister, confirmed that more than 2,000 people have been identified as in need of the money. I am clearly aware of GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 and I did not go into any other GLAS systems. I know exactly where the Minister is coming from and I fully understand the GLAS 1 and GLAS 2 schemes and that they are the only two schemes eligible for payment in respect of 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> I thank the Minister. The important thing is to keep the communication going and perhaps to promote the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine through the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> and other agricultural methods of communication, including the agriculture websites. Clearly there is a lot of misunderstanding and frustration and many people are saying that they will not sign up to another scheme in the future. That is a remarkable pity because this is a really good scheme. I thank the Minister and I would appreciate if he could keep the communication with the farming community in general going, which I know he is committed to doing. There is concern and frustration and people are out of pocket. I thank the Minister for his time.</p>

We have been in contact with all farmers by text message. We have written to 1,270 - I believe that is the figure - on specific issues on which we require documentation. We will be in contact with all of these farmers as quickly as possible to resolve all of the outstanding issues. It is my ambition to finalise these matters as quickly as possible but we need some documentation from this remaining cohort. As I have said, more than 93% has been paid and we intend to make the balancing payment, the 15%, by the end of June. We would like to resolve these outstanding cases as quickly as possible and I assure the Senator that all of the resources that are required of my Department, both from an IT and administrative side, are being applied to that purpose.</p>

            <p eId="para_71">I thank the Minister for coming to the House. I will give him a rough guide to the school and the service it gives to the students, particularly to those in the area of Bagenalstown. The proposed closure of the Muine Bheag vocational school, which was announced in March 2016, was a devastating blow to the community of Bagenalstown. Parents, students and staff alike were shocked by the unexpected announcement from the Carlow-Kilkenny Education and Training Board, ETB. After that, an action group was formed with the aim of overturning this decision. There was a sense of betrayal and loss at the prospect of the closure of the school, which had provided quality education to the people of Bagenalstown and surrounding areas for 54 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> Students of Muine Bheag vocational school enjoy a rich educational environment and access to a broad spectrum of subjects including modern languages, business information, Irish, English and the STEM subjects - science, mathematics and engineering. Students have enjoyed enormous success in a wide variety of extra-curricular areas such as promoting mental health. The school was awarded the amber flag in 2015. The students have mini-enterprises. They provide such a service to the community. The school has a state-of-the-art sports hall which was only opened in 2015. I believe more than €1 million was spent on that building. </p>
            <p eId="para_73"> Muine Bheag vocational school prides itself on extending the educational experience beyond the school walls and into the greater community surrounding Bagenalstown. In keeping with the school's DEIS status, equality of opportunity and access to education are of the highest priority in initiatives such at the "One book, One community" scheme, which promotes literacy in the community but also acts as a catalyst for community involvement. All the primary schools, secondary schools and community groups in the area were given a sense of ownership with this particular project, which was a great success. </p>
            <p eId="para_74"> At the heart of the ethos of Muine Bheag vocational school is the breaking down of barriers to education at all levels. The school has been active in providing numerous literacy programmes for parents, supporting their educational development. This has been crucial for the school itself. The importance of lifelong learning and access to education are at the core of the beliefs of Muine Bheag vocational school. This is also evident in the provision of the adult junior certificate and leaving certificate programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> Muine Bheag vocational school is an integral part of the local community and, as such, it strives to maintain links with businesses in the community. It has a great system wherein students go to businesses and work with them. It is also important to note the school has a great system in respect of apprenticeships. That is crucial going forward. The issue of apprenticeships in every school needs to be addressed. In keeping with its values, the school has also set up an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit in the Carlow-Kilkenny region, which supports students on the autism spectrum with additional educational needs. Continuity of care and predictable routines are essential for students with autism spectrum disorders. The lack of planning for their future care is really irresponsible when dealing with an ASD unit. At the moment, we do not know what is happening. The school also provides the applied leaving certificate. These are all crucial programmes which this school provides. </p>
            <p eId="para_76"> These are the real questions. This all happened on 10 March. The CEO informed the school that there would be no more enrolment for first-year students. This was a shock to the community. On 14 March, there was a meeting with the parents at which the junior and senior cycles were spoken about. There was a big public meeting in the McGrath hall on 29 March and from that a task force was set up. When it had finished its few months and carried out a study, the task force said it would give the school an extra 12 months, which it did. This school currently has 120 students. There are 40 students on post-leaving certificate, PLC, courses. On the leaving certificate applied programme, there are six students in fifth year and six in sixth year. A total of 172 students attend Muine Bheag vocational school. I cannot explain to the Minister the service this school provides and how important it is to the parents and students.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> Does the Minister support the Kilkenny and Carlow ETB? Will he support the retention of this school? Can he clearly set out the roles and responsibility of the CEO of the ETB in respect of communication with parents at a time when the school is at risk of closure? What are the roles and responsibilities of the ETB board of management of Muine Bheag vocational school in identifying that the school has a low intake of first years that is impacting on retaining sufficient staff levels to deliver the full curriculum? What is the criterion for recommending closure? My final question is crucial. What effect will the introduction of the new special education model in March have on the closure of the school, the students and the number of teachers the school would lose based on the new calculations? I thank the Minister for coming to the House.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Richard Bruton)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_78">I thank the Senator for raising the matter of Muine Bheag vocational school. It is important to clarify the position.</p>
            <p eId="para_79"> The Education Act sets out the framework within which any school considering closure has to operate. The Act provides for the right of schools to manage their own affairs in accordance with its provisions and any charters, deeds, articles of management or other such instruments relating to their establishment or operation. That is set out in sections 8 to 11, inclusive, of the Act. That statutory provision allows the Minister to designate a school on request and also provides for a request for a school closure submitted by the patron. The initiative for a closure may come from a variety of sources such as parents, staff, boards of management or patrons. Any proposal to close a school must first involve consultation with the relevant stakeholders. A decision taken at local level follows the consultation process. In that regard, any proposed changes must be well planned and managed in a manner that accommodates the interests of students, parents, teachers, local communities and contributes to an inclusive education system. Where a patron of a school advises the Department that it is no longer in a position to continue to operate a recognised school, the decision to close the school concerned is ultimately a matter for the patron. Any discussion to close a school requires consultation between the various stakeholders, including parents, members of staff and their representative organisations and the board of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> Muine Bheag vocational school is a co-educational DEIS school under the patronage of the Kilkenny and Carlow ETB. There were 119 pupils enrolled as of September 2016. The figure in 2012 was 134. Following meetings on the issues concerning the school, the ETB, the patron of the school, set up a task force to consider options for the future viability of the school in view of declining pupil enrolments. The task force report was adopted by the patron and work is ongoing on the recommendations to increase enrolments at the school. The task force was constituted as a committee of the ETB and comprised ETB nominees, parent nominees, teacher nominees and an independent chairperson. A primary recommendation of the task force is to have a targeted enrolment level of 20 students into first year for the school year 2017 to 2018 and that the school would subsequently establish and grow the targeted intake each year to reach a figure of between 15% and 17% of the transfer population within a three-year period, which has now been extended. Considerable work has been done in the past year to grow the enrolments and all stakeholders are working together to keep the school viable.</p>
            <p eId="para_81"> Details of the roles and functions of ETB boards of management and chief executives are set out in the Education Act 1998 and in the Education and Training Boards Act 2013. The Education Act and the board of management handbook for education and training boards outline that the function of the board of management is to manage the school or college on behalf of and in co-operation with the ETB and for the benefit of the students and their parents and to provide or cause to be provided an appropriate education for each student at the school for which that board has responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> The special needs model is a way of allocating resource teaching having regard to the profile of the school's needs. The profile is based on the number of children in the school who have complex needs or learning difficulties. Under the provision, I have provided an assurance that no school will lose resource teaching in this allocation. The arrangement provides that no school will lose out and, indeed, the allocation will be made to the school in respect of each child and, therefore, no child will lose out under the new model.</p>

            <p eId="para_84">I also thank the Minister for his reply. The situation was handled very badly. Damage was done. If one is a parent and believes that a school could close, one looks at one's options as a mother or father and whether to leave one's child in the school even though it is unclear whether it will be open in five years' time. It is important that the Muine Bheag school is kept open. It is a DEIS school and provides great service to the surrounding areas such Bagenalstown and Carlow. It is crucial because it has an autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, unit and all the services a school needs. It has provided a service to Bagenalstown for the past 54 years. I ask the Minister to keep it open.</p>

            <p eId="para_86">The task force is now in place under the ETB. It will engage with parents, teachers and everyone else. The key to the school's long term success is its capacity to attract students. That is vital. It has set targets in terms of the student numbers it needs to attract. That matter is being vigorously pursued. I am very optimistic because there is a pathway to deal with this and everyone is involved in trying to deliver on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">I wish to raise two issues. The first is the ongoing crippling costs of motor insurance. I commend my Fianna Fáil colleagues in the Dáil who have a motion on this issue on the clár today. The report issued for the first quarter by the Government recently shows that three of the ten recommendations to be completed by the first quarter of 2017 remain to be completed. This is a sad indictment of the Government and its performance on this issue, which has been ongoing for more than three years. As Members will be aware, in 2014, motor insurance increased by 11.5%; in 2015, it rose again by over 30%; and during the 12 months to December 2016, it rose by a further 12.2%. It can be seen clearly how this is crippling our citizens. To give Members a practical example of this, a young gentleman who recently returned from six years in Australia received a quote in excess of €4,000 for his motorcar. This is despite the fact that the same gentleman had more than six years' no-claims bonus before he emigrated. When he contacted his insurance company, it told him it only takes into consideration the most recent two years and he was therefore excluded. What is ironic about this is that he was dealing with the same insurance company. This highlights just one example of how such a simple thing as this is causing serious problems. To add insult to injury, at a time when we are encouraging our young people to come home, they will be burdened with serious motor insurance bills upon their arrival back home, and this is clearly not good enough. I ask the Leader to ask the Government to expedite a resolution of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> I will raise the other issue very briefly. On this, the day the leader of Fine Gael and our Taoiseach is to give notice to our Fine Gael colleagues this afternoon about his departure-----</p>

          <p eId="para_92">-----I wish him well. However, one of the many legacies in respect of which he may look in the rear mirror and feel very disappointed would be health. As I stand here, there are in excess of 666,000 people on hospital waiting lists in our State. This is clearly a sad indictment of the health policy of this Government. When one considers the recent statistics from our census that over the next 30 years it is estimated that the population of those over 65 will double and the population of those over 85 will quadruple, two things are clear. We have a serious problem but, more importantly, our increasing population and the age of our population highlight that it will get worse. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House and advise us of the immediate actions he plans to implement to tackle the current problem and the future plans he has to tackle the issue of our ageing population?</p>

        <speech by="#VictorBoyhan" eId="spk_31">
          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T11:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_93">I wish to raise one simple issue. I refer to the National Rehabilitation Hospital on Rochestown Avenue in Dún Laoghaire. I have continually raised this issue in Seanad Éireann over the past year without success, so today I propose an amendment to the Order of Business. It is the first time I have ever done so but it is now required. I call on the Minister for Health to come to Seanad Éireann today to explain to the Seanad why the National Rehabilitation Hospital has not been provided with the necessary staffing, resources and special supports that are required to enable it to provide a safe and appropriate level of rehabilitation care to patients up to its full bed capacity and to commit immediately to reopening 12 beds that were closed in January 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> I have examined the record of various comments of the Minister and officials. We were told the matter would be looked into, but nothing has happened. I spoke to a National Rehabilitation Hospital official yesterday who confirmed that since January, those 12 beds have been closed and have not been reopened. Yesterday, 209 people were waiting to get access to the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Many of these patients are occupying acute beds in hospitals because they cannot access the rehabilitation services they require. Patients with spinal and brain injuries are in limbo as a result of the Minister's failure to immediately reopen the 12 beds closed in January. The Minister appears to have done nothing about this issue and must, at a minimum, come to the House to explain what he is doing. We hear platitudes and words about health. Do people learn anything from all the scrutiny, publicity, television programmes and documentaries? We have not been able to get the Minister to reopen 12 beds the hospital wants to open.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> A new facility to be built on the site of the National Rehabilitation Hospital has been repeatedly delayed. If 12 beds cannot be opened in the existing facility, I do not know what is being done to build a new hospital on the site. The position is unacceptable. I have taken advice on this issue. There are patients with spinal and brain injuries waiting in acute hospital beds trying unsuccessfully to access the specialist service of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. I am a reasonable person. Will the Leader guarantee that the Minister for Health will appear in the House urgently? Unfortunately, the special committee will discuss Brexit again tomorrow and the Seanad will not meet again until next Tuesday afternoon. This is a serious issue and morale among professional staff in the hospital is low. They do an extraordinary job in extraordinary circumstances and they are committed to doing something about this issue. There are 209 people on the waiting list at the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Will the Minister come to the House to provide an assurance that the 12 beds will immediately reopen?</p>

          <p eId="para_97">I echo Senator Boyhan's concerns and support his call for the Minister for Health to explain to the House his plans regarding the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire. This is a serious issue that affects the entire country. I know people who are waiting to access the centre. The 12 beds to which Senator Boyhan referred must be opened as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> I gave notice yesterday that I would propose an amendment to the Order of Business today. I propose that non-Government motion No. 18 be taken today. The motion can be debated instead of statements on childhood obesity, which are due to be taken between 4.30 p.m. and 6 p.m. Speaking last week on the lack of legislation coming before the House, I stated there was no point in providing time to debate issues on which there is agreement across the House because everyone will say the same things. We need to deal with some serious issues on which cross-party agreement is needed. If agreement is not reached on this, I propose that the motion be taken without debate at the conclusion of the Order of Business. It is the same motion that Sinn Féin proposed to take without debate last Tuesday. The reasons given by Fianna Fáil and other parties for voting against the motion was that the vote clashed with a meeting of the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. For this reason, we ask that the motion be taken today. I gave notice yesterday that we would raise the matter today so nobody can claim not to have been given notice. </p>
          <p eId="para_99"> I also note the Leader stated last week that he would need a briefing from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before he could make a decision on whether to support the motion. I trust a week has been sufficient time for him to receive a briefing. </p>

          <p eId="para_102">As the Leader is aware, this is an important issue in rural Ireland. It must be dealt with as a stand-alone farming issue to address current inequality. I will not allow the waters to be muddied by bringing other farming issues into the mix. During the most recent negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, small farmers in the west were told not to worry about what would happen in Pillar 1 and to allow bigger farms to receive bigger payments because this would be made up in Pillar 2 under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS. It was not made up, however. The same excuse has been given since 2001 and the reference years on the single farm payment. Farmers trying to farm on land in disadvantaged areas and areas of natural constraint need to receive payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> I refer to another farming-related issue, namely, the independent appeals mechanism in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which I may also raise as a Commencement matter. It is taking up to four years to process appeals through the office. This is not right as payments are being held up for up to four years. The reason for the delay is that under legislation, only one director in the appeals office can handle appeals. This must change and I will write to the Minister today seeking a change. I am shocked that only one director can deal with claims that cause farmers' payments to be delayed for years. </p>

          <p eId="para_106">I express sadness on the death of the late journalist, Dara Quigley, who took her life on 12 April, five days after she had been detained by gardaí under the Mental Health Act. We all know that a Garda video of her detention was posted on Facebook shortly before Ms Quigley's death. Her family recently said their distress had been compounded by the publication of her name on many different social media websites. They also criticised the lack of services available for persons with dual diagnosis such as Ms Quigley. In my experience, there are no services for dual diagnoses in Ireland. Working as a therapist in the Rutland Centre, I have no doubt that mental health and addiction are very closely linked. Anybody I have met who has an addiction problem has a mental health problem and the people I have worked with who have a mental health problem often have addiction problems and use substances to numb them. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the House to outline what action is being taken on dual diagnosis. Services are currently separate, which means that someone with an addiction problem who engages with the mental health services will be refused access to the service, while those with a mental health problem who contact an addiction service will be refused access to that service. This is not good enough and the issue needs to be addressed. It is time for change, particularly with regard to addiction and mental health services and dual diagnosis.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I thank the Leader for accepting the Bill proposed by the Labour Party group, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Gender Pay Gap Information) Bill 2017, which we will propose on Second Stage on Wednesday, 24 May in Private Members' time. This is an important Bill to tackle the ongoing issue of a gender pay gap, which remains persistent despite equal pay legislation being in place for more than 30 years. I look forward to securing the support of colleagues for the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on policing, now that the detail, terms of reference and membership of the root and branch review of An Garda Síochána have been announced. I understand that while the review group will report within 16 months, it envisages making a series of rolling recommendations. I ask the Leader to arrange a series of rolling debates as the recommendations emerge from the review. I am pleased with the strong membership of the review group, which includes independent individuals, including academics and practitioners from Ireland and elsewhere, and will be chaired by Ms Kathleen O'Toole. It is vital that we keep the matter under political scrutiny through the Oireachtas, as well as having the review group do its work. Given that the review will make rolling recommendations, we should examine these recommendations as they emerge. </p>
          <p eId="para_109"> The Fianna Fáil Party's position on this matter is untenable. It has indicated it would seek to remove the Garda Commissioner within six months of taking office if it were elected to government. It is bizarre that the party is not willing to move on the Commissioner's position now, having made an announcement that clearly destabilises her. Who knows what will be the Fine Gael Party's position, given the announcement we are expecting from the Taoiseach today?</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I also request a debate on domestic violence and perhaps the Leader will indicate when the Domestic Violence Bill will return to the House. Today's reports in the newspapers show a dramatic increase in calls to the Women's Aid helpline, a 70% increase on last year, and its helpline is now a 24 hour facility. It received 16,000 of these related calls in the past year compared with just over 9,000 the previous year. This is a very disturbing and concerning report, especially given the horrific accounts of deaths in recent weeks in the context of domestic abuse. I note that the Women's Aid report says that 80% of the abused women who contacted it had been abused by current or ex-partners. It is a very real and current issue for many families around Ireland and perhaps the Leader might tell us when we might have the legislation back to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">There is no doubt that the Government is still trying to grapple and deal with the consequences of the Fianna Fáil legacy that was left to this country and its impact on public services. This was outlined by various speakers in the House. There are many problems that remain to be addressed. I will speak on two examples that are of concern to me. There was a recent announcement by the HSE in Waterford of the temporary closure of more than 16 beds in the Sacred Heart unit at Dungarvan Community Hospital. This is a hospital for older people where beds are provided for step-down, respite and rehabilitation, with some long-stay beds. The Leader will agree that this announcement of closures is unacceptable. It puts pressure on our acute services and, in fact, we need more step-down and respite beds. The reason given by the HSE for this temporary closure is nursing staff shortages and the difficulty in recruiting nurses, not only in this sector but right across the health services in the State. Eight nurses are required to reopen the Sacred Heart unit and I know the hospital is actively advertising for them. This will have a knock-on impact on acute services in University Hospital Waterford where step-down beds are no longer available. Patients will then be retained in the hospital and it will add to the waiting lists. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health to the house to outline the HSE's plans to recruit nursing staff urgently to alleviate these pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Recruitment difficulties are not just related to the nursing sector. I note the recent report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills which said that only 2% of current school leavers are entering apprenticeships. When a comparison is drawn with the likes of Germany, where 60% of school leavers enter an apprenticeship programme to look at earn and learn options, it is clear that it should be a concern to us all that there are not enough apprentices to meet the growing needs of our economy. Not all school leavers are academic and this can be seen in the numbers of students dropping out of various third level programmes. The country is experiencing a skills shortage. I acknowledge that the Government has announced a national skills strategy. Will the Leader invite the Minister for Education and Skills to outline his plans and strategy to deal with these skills shortages. Beyond traditional apprenticeships, we need more programmes to encourage apprentices and trainees into sectors such as medical devices and financial services. This debate is urgently required to address these shortages.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">Today is a very special one for Ibrahim Halawa whose trial is pending. I have been in touch with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to find out exactly what the progress is and if it is happening at this point. They are about one hour ahead there. I have been trying to get through to the ambassador in Cairo but have failed to do that. This situation is beyond belief. An Irish citizen has been in prison in Cairo for four years and has not had a proper trial. His trial in court has been delayed 22 times. We all know about the case. Every Member of the Seanad and the Dáil has been supportive of the case for the release of Ibrahim Halawa without delay. This has gone on for far too long. The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, led an all-party delegation to Cairo some months ago to plead Ibrahim's case. The Egyptian President has given a commitment that when the trial is finished, Ibrahim will be released on humanitarian grounds, but there has been no progress in this respect. It is hard to believe that we are allowing one of our own citizens to remain in Egypt, which was such an advanced society in the past with the Pharaohs and its tremendous history, for four years without a proper and immediate trial. Justice delayed is justice denied. I know the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade have been very active and have written letters but maybe the President might intervene at this point. I know the President is above politics but he is a man who may have influence with the President of Egypt. All we can do today is hope that the trial will proceed and that Ibrahim will be acquitted and return to his home as quickly as possible. All we can do today is send best wishes to him and his family and to work with a united approach to bring Ibrahim Halawa home.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">I echo the remarks made by Senator Leyden. There has certainly been broad cross-party support on this issue and for this cause and I am sure and certain that the support will prevail in securing a release.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> Éirím chun cúrsaí Gaeilge ó Thuaidh agus an Lá Dearg atá beartaithe i mBéal Feirste ar an Satharn beag seo a phlé. The Leader is aware, as I have raised the issue before, that the current situation in the North still allows for the retention of one of the Penal Laws, the Languages Act 1737, to prohibit the use of the Irish language in court. There is a concerted, large-scale, broadly representative, cross-community campaign to lobby for legislation to protect the rights of Irish speakers in the North with an Irish language Act. This is an outstanding commitment from the St. Andrews Agreement. Some of the support for that has manifested itself on the floor of this Chamber, including from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, who, on behalf of the Government and along with representatives from all parties and the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, has supported the call for the Irish language Act. The UN and the European Union Council's Committee of Experts have all called for the implementation of that agreed Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> On Saturday, Irish language supporters, speakers, enthusiasts and people who support the progress of rights and equality will descend on Belfast for what is being called An Lá Dearg. They will march from the Cultúrlann on the Falls Road in the heart of the Gaeltacht quarter to Belfast City Hall for a celebration of diversity and the Irish language. I draw Members' attention to this outstanding issue and encourage them to support that call. Conradh na Gaeilge has organised buses from all over the country and Members can consult Twitter or the Conradh na Gaeilge website to see if any buses are going to be close to them. I have not yet seen any from Cork so perhaps the Leader could sort that out. Tá mé ag iarraidh é sin a ardú agus iarraim ar dhaoine ní hamháin a bheith i láthair don mhórshiúl Dé Sathairn ach a bheith linn san fheachtas ar son cearta do Ghaeilgeoirí.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">I wish to ask the House to welcome home the 109th Infantry Battalion from UNIFIL. The troops return home today from Lebanon having served for six months. It was great to see families being reunited in the airport this morning. The State is immensely grateful to the soldiers for the wonderful, invaluable work they do abroad, and for the distinction with which they represent Ireland. We must acknowledge the sacrifices they and their families have given to the State over the past six months. It has not been easy for them. In view of the "Prime Time" programme last night, it is very apt that we will have the Minister in the House next week to discuss the pay and conditions of members of the Defence Forces. We are proud of the Defence Forces and now is the time to address this issue of pay and conditions for the members of the Defence Forces, in particular private soldiers. I acknowledge the homecoming of the 109th Infantry Battalion, as we did last week when we wished the 110th Infantry Battalion well when it was going out. I am grateful to the Leader for inviting the Minister next week to address the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_119"> We have a very serious situation with homelessness in the State. I have raised previously the issue of homelessness in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">One of my colleagues in Galway City Council, Cathal Ó Conchúir, was told that there are 26 people sleeping rough in Galway at the moment and that the supports that were there to help them over the past number of months have been discontinued because of a lack of funding. That is a very serious situation, because there is no housing support available to them. </p>
          <p eId="para_121"> I also want to discuss an issue that I previously raised in the Seanad about the support workers in organisations such as The Simon Community and COPE, who are supported by the IMPACT trade union. They are known as the sleep-over workers, and they support people who are homeless overnight. They are paid a measly €4.50 an hour because of the situation that they are in, and still have not had their pay reimbursed even though they have had a Labour Court ruling in their favour. I do not believe the organisations in question are to blame here - they are happy to pay these moneys - but the HSE is withholding the funding. The Department of Health and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, are responsible. Even though we have many platitudes about the plight of the homeless, it is quite clear that the Government is withholding funding to these organisations in this situation via the HSE so that they can pay those sleep-over workers. I see that strike action is possibly pending from IMPACT on this issue. I call on the Leader to use his offices, and perhaps we could have a debate here once more and discuss the situation. We have had many Government announcements and initiatives, but the particular issue of homelessness needs to be debated again.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> I support the comments by Senator Bacik about the Women's Aid impact report for 2016. The figures are very stark and startling, including 20,769 disclosures of domestic violence against women and children, 3,823 disclosures of child abuse and 16,000 disclosures of domestic violence against women. The organisations that support women in these scenarios are completely underfunded. For example, Domestic Violence Response, DVR, in the Connemara area is certainly struggling to cope with the level of phone calls it receives. A debate on what the Government is doing about the issue of domestic violence would be very welcome as well.</p>

The question everyone was asking was who owns the Book of Kells. Is it the Irish people or Trinity College Dublin? I saw a sign this morning when coming through the Phoenix Park which said "Our shared heritage". The people of Kells and Meath were robbed of their heritage down through the years when it came to the Book of Kells.

If we are serious about the Ancient East tourism trail, the people of Meath and Kells want one of the volumes. Even if it was only on loan for three months of the season, it would be lovely. Tourists could visit the Boyne Valley, Tara, the Cross of Kells, the Book of Kells, Loughcrew and then go to Trim Castle and back to Dublin.</p>

It should have direct election by way of a universal franchise for all citizens on the same day as a Dáil vote, Northern representation, representation from across the diaspora, 50% representation of women and representation of traditionally marginalised groups in Irish society. On 12 successive occasions, reports have been produced proposing reform and yet none of those has been implemented. After speaking with the Leader yesterday, my intention was that I would write to the Department of the Taoiseach calling for urgency in the appointment of a chairperson to the interim implementation body. This House should collectively write to the Department of the Taoiseach to outline our call for urgency in the appointment of that chairperson. I assume, following the Taoiseach's call for nominees, that those have been fulfilled. This House should call collectively, with urgency, for a chairperson for that committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">Over the years we have had many calls from politicians that Ireland should host the Olympics. That is a worthy call and I very much support the Rugby World Cup bid for 2023. This was supported by the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, but also by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and all the countries involved in that. In 2014, the Commonwealth Games were held very successfully in Scotland, and the host event was held in Parkhead, which is the home of Glasgow Celtic. The Commonwealth Games 2018 will be held in the Gold Coast, but Durban, in South Africa, has pulled out of hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games. It is open now for any country to apply to host them. Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham are hoping to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> This is a wonderful opportunity for Northern Ireland to apply to host the Commonwealth Games in 2022. There is a party in Stormont which actually can try to unite the people of Ireland. We could have the Commonwealth Games hosted by Northern Ireland but it could be on the island of Ireland. We have Croke Park, Windsor Park, the Aviva Stadium, the National Sports Campus, and many more. This could be a wonderful opportunity to bring the Commonwealth Games, which involves 71 teams and over 5,000 participants to this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> We have to think differently. People talk about a united Ireland and uniting the people of Ireland. This is a wonderful idea to sell the island of Ireland. Northern Ireland, through the Executive or through the games committee, should now apply with the idea that it could be located on the island of Ireland. The 2021 Youth Games are to be held in Northern Ireland. It is a huge opportunity to have rowing, perhaps in Lough Rynn in Leitrim, to use the National Aquatic Centre and many other facilities in the island of Ireland. Then we can truly unite the people of our country.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I have previously raised the issue of 1916 commemorative medals rightly being presented to members of An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, and the National Ambulance Service. However, fire and rescue personnel, with the exception of County Kilkenny, were not presented with such a medal. They feel that this is indicative of the treatment they receive and the disrespect that exists from the authorities to fire and rescue personnel. A number of questions have been put to various Ministers, including the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Humphreys. It has been said that they are not responsible. Surely a directive or a guidance note was issued to local authorities and somebody somewhere, who was responsible for these commemorations, must have looked at these medals being presented to everybody except fire and rescue personnel across the State. I am asking that even now it be addressed. I do not believe that anybody in these Houses would object to the fire and rescue personnel receiving their 1916 commemorative medals. I ask the Leader to raise this with his relevant colleagues and to please report back to me and other Members of this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> I also want to raise the issue of the gorse fires. I raised the issue this last week. Where is the oversight on this issue?

          <p eId="para_141">For four days, they were pinned down on the hills in Inishowen. Nobody was advising them in terms of helicopters, water, Defence Forces or anything like that. </p>
          <p eId="para_142"> In terms of oversight that leads up to the national emergency co-ordination group, which is led by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, what are the criteria given to local fire services?

          <p eId="para_151">The first is the issue of motor insurance. The cost of motor insurance has continued to increase. Earlier, I heard a colleague looking for a debate. It is urgently needed. There are elderly people for whom the cost of motor insurance is climbing and many people cannot get insurance. I ask that the Minister responsible come before the House immediately to debate it. The question of motor insurance companies operating cartels is being examined but as far as I am concerned they are and we need to take them on at full blast.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The second issue relates to Irish Rail. For a four-week period, between 4 June and 25 June, Irish Rail is effectively closing down Limerick station while new signal boxes are going in. I have two questions. This appears to have come out of the blue. The company is now talking about rescheduling train times and it is more than likely that people will be transported to Limerick Junction. I have put in a call to Mr. Barry Kenny of Irish Rail on the matter and we need clarity on this issue. Although a new facade and a fantastic new promenade have just been put in place at Limerick railway station, it will be out of commission for four weeks. We need answers as to why this has arisen now. What rescheduling is being put in place? Will the buses be disabled-friendly? Why is this work not being done at night when trains are not running? This is something about which I feel very strongly. I will put this to Irish Rail and to the Minister, Deputy Ross, to find out exactly what is going on with Limerick train station.</p>

Ceann de na rudaí nach raibh mórán cainte air, agus nár chualamar ón Rialtas mar gheall air, ná an méid daoine a labhraíonn Gaeilge lasmuigh den chóras oideachais sa Ghaeltacht. Is é an figiúr a fuaireamar ná go bhfuil 20,586 duine a labhraíonn Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht lasmuigh den chóras oideachais. Faraor, laghdú 11% atá ansin ón bhfigiúr a bhí ann in 2011. Ba 23,175 an figiúr ag an am sin. The fall in the daily number of Irish speakers in the Gaeltacht since the last census - over five years, there has been an 11% reduction down to 20,586 people speaking Irish outside the education system - is very troubling. It confirms research findings in 2015 that indicated that on current trends, the language as a community vernacular in the Gaeltacht will not continue beyond 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> For many people in pobal na Gaeilge, the drop in the numbers using Irish frequently in the Gaeltacht demonstrated in the 2016 census was shocking and disappointing. No doubt Senator Ó Clochartaigh, who knows much more than I do about this and who is very directly concerned with these matters, will back me up on what I am saying. One of the specific objectives of the 20-year strategy for the Irish language was to increase the number of people in the Gaeltacht speaking Irish on a daily basis by 25% and to promote language invigoration in these regions. That was said to be critical to the overall strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> I am conscious that I am speaking at a time when it appears that the Taoiseach is about to lay down the burdens of office. We know that he is a very proud Irish speaker and is happy to demonstrate his fluency on State business in Europe. It is not clear that either of the two front-runners to succeed him have a particular commitment to the Irish language although I might be wrong. I am not out to score points, however, but to seek information. It seems to me appropriate that the Taoiseach, even when he leaves that office, should come before this House to give an account of his stewardship in various areas. To look at the areas where there have been successes but also those where there remain challenges. If a man like him who is committed to the Irish language has presided over a situation of manifest decline, where we see the failure of Irish language legislation, the Official Languages Act, where people in various agencies are turning a blind eye to their responsibility to promote the availability of services to Irish speakers, then I worry for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_161"> Once again, I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, to come into the House and allow us to have a real debate on the capital investment review that is ongoing. The consultation has just concluded. In the context of Brexit, it is hugely important for the island of Ireland to take control. Yesterday morning, Senator Craughwell had an important Commencement debate with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, on our transport infrastructure needs. When we look at our port, road and rail networks, they are hugely in need of upgrade in order to deal with the change in how goods and people will enter the country but this is also the case with our educational and civic institutions and many more sectors. It is important that we have a serious debate. Many people will speak of potential boons to the economy in terms of pay or structure but we need to lay down a marker that our infrastructure needs to be brought up to speed in order to deal with the headache that is Brexit. </p>

          <p eId="para_162">Yesterday, I was going to speak on the revaluation of commercial rates that has been happening across the country. This is happening in my home area of Carlow and Kilkenny at the moment. I believe the confusion over the revaluation is the way the system has been set up. It is a new system. It is very confusing when businesses have received their rates. In my area it is multiplied by 0.269. There seems to be a whole different system. I have concerns about it. I will address it to the Minister. I am raising it because I want to compliment Carlow County Council, which is holding a day for businesses there to explain the system next Monday.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Under this new system, there are appeals. Unlike before, commercial rates will be put into categories, which I think is good, but some rates have gone up and others down. It is crucial that the appeals system works with businesses because they are only surviving. I also have concerns about crèches. Crèches and nurseries are now educational. I have represented many crèches where their rates have increased by €1,000 or €1,500 or more. It is an awful amount. I am asking that the Government look at this system and the genuine appeals. These are genuine people who are merely making ends meet. These new criteria should be addressed but the appeals system is crucial. </p>

          <p eId="para_164">I join in the earlier call for a debate on domestic violence in light of the Women's Aid report, which was published today. The statistics are quite shocking and on a personal level, it is terrible to think what some women and children deal with from physical, sexual, emotional and financial abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Of particular concern to me is the fact that the report is critical of the way our courts and judges deal with domestic violence, particularly in the case of access and custody. I am concerned that the impact of domestic violence on children has not properly been taken into account and this dovetails with a debate I heard on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" yesterday on the issues which judges, in good faith, are taking into account but on which they seem to be misguided. There is an issue around training of judges to deal with this issue. Where violence was involved and a barring order given, some judges seem to think that is the end of the matter and do not take into account the manipulation of children. Domestic abuse can be perpetrated by either sex but, for the most part and in 80% of the most extreme cases, it is perpetrated by men. We can put in all the social workers and gardaí we need but if the proper care and protection of children and women is not taken into account by the Judiciary we will end up with the wrong results. Judges are well briefed in the area of law but psychology and the emotional side of things are a different matter and, if we are serious about protecting children, even if they only witness this abuse by their parents, we need experts in court so that judges can make informed decisions where there are concerns that there will be manipulation of children and further abuse, psychological or otherwise. Notwithstanding the removal of a parent from a family setting, this needs to be recognised in judgments.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">Just off the N52 in Rathconnell, a heavily populated area near Mullingar, there have been numerous leaks in the mains water infrastructure on a one-mile stretch of road. There have been seven breaks in the asbestos line in one year and I am working closely on it with Councillor Bill Collentine, who is well equipped in this field.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> I have received calls from several locals asking me a question which I have found hard to answer, so I wanted to ask the Leader. Is there any likelihood they could be poisoned from the asbestos line, which is in very poor condition and is constantly breaking? I am afraid to tell them they will not. A lot of work has been done with the new water authority to get the line upgraded but it is kicking us to touch at present. Can the Leader clarify the matter or invite the Minister to the House to clarify the position? It is only a one-mile stretch of pipe but it is constantly breaking and leaking and it would be great if it could be upgraded.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">In June last year the Committee on the Future of Healthcare was set up. Our colleagues in the other House made sure we were barred from sitting on the committee but I will raise the issue of infrastructural development relating to hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> Every week in this House people talk about the need for infrastructural development for our education system and our roads but we need to talk about it regarding hospitals. We know what is going to happen in Dublin with the new children's hospital and three new maternity hospitals but we have not looked at infrastructural development for hospitals in the rest of the country, where the population is growing in many areas but where no additional facilities have been developed in the past 30 or even 50 years. We need a 20-year plan, not a five-year or ten-year plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue. People will say we cannot deal with it until the future of health care document is produced but we need to do it now and we need to ensure the Department of Health is planning for these things. We should not put it off for another 12 months or two years. We have seen how long it has taken to roll out the children's hospital and we now have a problem with the roll-out of the maternity hospitals. We should include the rest of the country with Dublin in our discussion of these issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">Last week there was an excellent presentation in the AV room by early years educators from Dublin, Cork and the rest of the country. It was well attended and it was disappointing to note that the only party not to send anyone was Fine Gael. Early years educators are in crisis and precarious work dominates, with temporary short-term contracts and rates of pay barely above or at the minimum wage. It is shocking for a country that prides itself on investing in education that our investment in early childhood education is the lowest in Europe and half the level of investment in the UK. One knows one is in trouble when one invests half of what the Tories invest. A very good campaign is being run by SIPTU, my union, for a sectoral employment order to set pay and conditions for the sector, improving both pay and standards. We need to debate that. Everybody in this Chamber should recognise that investment in early years education has not been made and we should make it a priority.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">I wish to highlight a very interesting voluntary project conducted in Kilkenny, where communities are connected with people abroad of Irish descent who are interested in genealogy tourism. Last year, 22 genealogy tourists came to Kilkenny as a direct result of one person in the locality taking a simple and painless saliva test, which in some cases costs as little as €50. In the coming months, the project is expecting five different groups of people to come from Canada and stay in Kilkenny for over a week. I believe there is potential for DNA genealogy to be used on a larger scale as a broader tourism initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> One idea could be to subsidise the refund of a DNA test cost if a visit is made by an individual or group. Alternatively, funding could be provided to offer a free DNA test to a number of suitable people in each village, connecting them via DNA to the wider diaspora globally. We are doing very well in tourism overall but genealogy tourism is an added area we could publicise more heavily and I would like the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to consider incentivising foreign visitors who wish to discover more of their heritage, or companies who wish to avail of such a service.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">I thank the 24 Senators for their contributions on the Order of Business. Senators Gallagher and Kieran O'Donnell raised the important issue of motor insurance and the need to reduce the costs of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Not only has the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, who has responsibility in this regard, set up a commission to examine this matter, to be fair to him, but we have also seen for the first time in five years, according to the CSO figure, a 2.6% reduction in the cost of insurance on this time last year. I share with Senators O'Donnell and Gallagher the desire for more questioning of, and more accountability on the part of, the insurance industry regarding the cost of motor insurance. The Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, is committed to overseeing the implementation of the report and deserves credit and praise for his proactivity regarding the matter of motor insurance. I think we all recognise there is a need now for the motor insurance industry to be transparent and to be held accountable for the quotes it gives and costs it places on people.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> The report of the working group has six main themes. The important themes for me are the protection of the consumer and reducing insurance costs, along with ensuring that insurance fraud is dealt with and the uninsured driver is held to account. The action plan has a timeline for delivery, the implementation of which Government is driving. The Minister of State, who, as I said, is being very proactive, has the report. There are 71 action points, 45 of which are due by the end of this year. I look forward to working with the Minister of State to ensure we commit to the action plan and see, as Senator O'Donnell said, such cartel activity eliminated. It is in the interests of all motorists to have a competitive, cheaper and transparent motor insurance quotation system and that we see more people on the road with insurance and reduce the number of people tempted to break the law by having no insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Senator Gallagher also raised the issue of hospital waiting times, and Senator Coffey in his contribution referred to the issue of respite care. I am loath to begin a political row, but there are legacy issues we must recognise. The health budget is at its highest ever level. The Minister is very much aware of the inordinate and unacceptable waiting times, as all of us are in our own constituency offices from dealing with people - friends, family and members of our communities. However, it is important to note that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, which published figures in this regard just last week, confirmed that over 52% of patients have now been waiting less than six months for either an inpatient or day-case procedure, and 93% have been waiting less than 18 months. However, this is too long for people in huge pain. There is a need to reduce waiting times for those who have been waiting longest, and that is a commitment of Government. It is for this reason the Government, in the most recent budget, allocated €20 million to the NTPF, with a commitment to increase this to €55 million in 2018. The Minister for Health is conscious of the matter and is working to achieve a waiting list initiative that will see more people being treated more quickly. I accept there is more to be done, but the Minister is committed, and the proof of that is in the budget recently announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Senator Boyhan raised the very important matter of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, and I know Senator Hopkins has raised this in the House previously. It is important we join Senator Boyhan in acknowledging that the reduction in the number of beds in this case is unacceptable and that the HSE has delayed too long in recruiting staff and reopening the beds referred to by the Senator. Since the Senator's contribution, the Minister of State with responsibility in this regard, Deputy McGrath, has asked me through my office to tell the Senator that he is happy to speak to him before the end of business today.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> It is important to recognise the huge work being done in the national rehabilitation unit in Dún Laoghaire. The Government has committed to a rehabilitation programme which will see better outcomes for the patients and families who require these services. The HSE service plan for this year has identified a number of key priorities for the hospital, including finalising and progressing the framework of the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy. As a former health committee chair, I, with Senator Colm Burke, have worked very hard to see the strategy brought to fruition and to see investment in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Senator Boyhan is right to highlight the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> Progress has been made on the redevelopment of the campus in Dún Laoghaire. A new 120 bed hospital with integrated therapies and support services will be made available. Planning permission, as the Senator will be aware, has been granted. Like the Senator, I wish this could be done more quickly, but a procurement process has begun, with the appointment of a contractor to be made later this year. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is happy to liaise with the Senator. If he is not happy with that, I would be happy to have the Minister of State come to the House next week to have a debate on the matter. It is a hospital with which we all have a great affinity because many of us have friends and family members who have been in the hospital, and the care, service and attention they have been given are second to none. I think we all would like to see the situation improve and I would be happy to work with the Senator in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> I made an offer to Senator Conway-Walsh last week on the issue of the motion on the Order Paper, but her party pushed the vote, which was its right and prerogative. I again compliment Senator Daly on his approach in this regard. The Minister, Deputy Creed, will come to the House next Wednesday. I am happy to facilitate statements on the matter rather than a motion, and I made this clear yesterday on the Order of Business. I am happy to do so again today, and that is my position.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">Methinks Senator Mac Lochlainn protests too much. The other issue Senator Conway-Walsh raised was the independent appeals office. As she said, perhaps she should raise it as a Commencement matter. I do not have information on the matter to hand so I cannot give her a definitive answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Senator Black referred to the untimely death of the journalist, Dara Quigley, and I join her in offering sympathy to her family. This is mental health awareness month, and I have asked the Minister to come to the House next week or the week after to have a debate on it. The Seanad Public Consultation Committee will be doing a piece of work beginning on mental health, and Government is very proactive on the issue of mental health. I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the matter Senator Black raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Senator Bacik raised the issue of policing, and the Minister yesterday outlined the issue and the appointment of personnel to the independent commission to review policing in Ireland. I would be happy to have a debate on the matter. Both Senators Bacik and Mulherin raised the issue of domestic violence, which is a very serious one. As Senator Mulherin rightly said, it is a compendium of physical, mental, sexual, financial and other violence which we need to address. Legislation in this regard is forthcoming, and I am happy to report back on the status of that legislation at a later date. We need to prioritise this as a Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Senator Coffey raised the issue of respite care, in particular in the Sacred Heart unit in Dungarvan, and the need to prioritise it. This is the fundamental reform of our health system to which Senator Burke referred last week on the Order of Business. We need to have a continuum of care for our citizens. This means we need to plan care and have, as Senator Burke rightly said again today, an investment programme in infrastructure which includes not just primary care, but also respite care, including emergency respite care. We have nearly 2,000 short-stay beds in terms of step-up facilities, intermediary care, rehab and respite care. However, we need to do more, and this is certainly something we need, as a country, to plan for. The HSE needs to be much more proactive on respite care. I do not wish to get into controversy with my next remark, but I think the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA has a role to play in respite care on the road we are travelling because, as a State, we see more people requiring care, including intermediate care, week stays for step-down care and care for those with long-term disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">We need to see an increase in respite provision. We need to ensure, as part of the national carers strategy and the action plan for carers, that this is implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Senator Coffey referenced the national skills strategy. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, have been before the House in that regard. However, the Senator is correct that we need to think outside the box in regard to our skills strategy. More programmes related to different aspects of our workforce are needed. I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House for that debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Senator Leyden raised the issue of Ibrahim Halawa, whose case has been ongoing for far too long. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has raised the matter, as has the Taoiseach. All of us are united in the hope that this case will be resolved for the Halawa family and Ibrahim.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Senator Ó Donnghaile raised the issue of the Act of 1737 and the use of Irish in the courts in the North. I am happy to ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> I join with Senator McFadden in welcoming home the 109th Infantry Battalion and thanking its personnel for their superb work on behalf of all of us. As I said yesterday, the Defence Forces provide a huge service on our behalf around the world. We welcome back those Defence Forces personnel. I am happy to set aside time next week for a debate on the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Senator Ó Clochartaigh spoke about the homeless agencies in Galway. I find it staggering that there has been a withholding of funding for homeless services in Galway at a time when the Minister and the Department are allocating more funding than ever to resolution of the homelessness issue. On the issue of sleep-over workers, which the Senator has raised before, I would be stunned and disappointed if there was a deliberate obfuscation by the Department and the HSE in regard to the matters raised. Senator Ó Clochartaigh also raised the issue of domestic violence and Women's Aid. </p>
          <p eId="para_207"> Senator Butler raised the issue of the Book of Kells. The Senator, in terms of his very passionate remarks and the wonderful picture he painted, has been a strong advocate for the Ireland's Ancient East project. During the campaign for the Seanad elections many of us passed through many of the historic sites he referenced. I would not like to see anything happen to the Book of Kells that would destroy it. It is important not just as a tourist attraction but as an historical artefact.</p>

          <p eId="para_212"> Senator Warfield raised the issue of Seanad reform.

I hope that during the lifetime of this Seanad we will see reform of how the Seanad is elected, which is currently a matter of disagreement among some people.

          <p eId="para_216">Senators Feighan and Richmond raised the issue of an all-island approach to the hosting of the Commonwealth Games, which is an important issue we should consider in terms of the promotion of North-South relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I share Senator Mac Lochlainn's view on the first responder and fire and rescue personnel issue. As the Senator will be aware, I have raised the issue with various Ministers but I have not yet had a conclusive response. I am happy to work with the Senator to see that happen. It would be disappointing to see a differentiation between personnel in respect of the issue raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_218"> Senator Kieran O'Donnell raised the issue of Irish Rail. The Senator was right to raise the matter in the first instance with Mr. Barry Kenny. I hope that Irish Rail will not discommode the people of Limerick. The Senator might consider tabling the issue for discussion as a Commencement matter, which may provide him with a quicker response.</p>
          <p eId="para_219"> I have already responded on Senator Mulherin's passionate contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> Senator Richmond also asked that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, be asked to come to the House to debate the capital investment review. I have put in a request to the Minister's office in that regard and I hope that this debate will take place in the next couple of weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> Senator Murnane O'Connor again raised the issue of revaluation of commercial rates in Carlow. As the Senator is aware, it is an independent process but it is being driven from afar by the Minister, Deputy Coveney. We need to see results in this area. Some of the businesses mentioned by the Senator are commercial entities. Some crèches are community crèches but others are private and operate for profit. As I said, this issue needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> Senator Mullen raised the issue of cúrsaí Gaeilge. Tá brón orm nach bhfuil Gaeilge flúirseach agus líofa agam ach tá suim mhór agam i gcúrsaí Gaeltachta agus cultúir. Tá suim mhór ag an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Kyne, agus ag na hAirí ar labhair an Seanadóir fúthu, an Teachta Varadkar agus an Teachta Coveney. Tá Gaeilge acu. Senator Mullen, unfortunately, brought members of the Government into the issue of the Irish language. The Ministers he referenced, Deputies Coveney and Varadkar, are committed to the Irish language and so it was unfair of him to do that. The Taoiseach has an extraordinary ability to communicate in the Irish language. Irrespective of what he announces today, his support in his role as Taoiseach for and contribution to promoting the Irish language has been second to none, for which he deserves our thanks.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Senator Davitt raised the issue of investment in Irish Water and water infrastructure. The Senator is correct that there is concern regarding water infrastructure in Rathconnell, which is proof of the need for investment, which some colleagues here do not want to see happen, in our infrastructure and Irish Water.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">Senator Colm Burke referred to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare. The Minister could not allow Senators to be members of that committee because of opposition in that regard from the other House, which was disappointing. The committee's report, which we all await with bated breath, will, hopefully, contain key recommendations around the development of infrastructure in our hospitals. In previous remarks Senator Burke spoke about the lack of new hospitals in our country, which is an issue that also needs to be addressed as a matter of priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Senator Gavan raised the issue of early years provision. I was unable to attend the meeting in the AV room last week but I am happy to inform the Senator that I facilitated a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, and early community child care providers in Cork South Central. As a former Chairman of the then Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I am very committed to working with all providers of child care on issues such as investment in early years education. The Minister, Deputy Zappone, who bears responsibility for this area is committed to improving the quality and staffing, including pay and conditions, of early child care services. The Senator's remark was a little unfair when some of us are very committed to this area and have a long history of involvement in it.</p>

It is a good news story for today's Order of Business and I commend Senator Noone on raising it. It is important that genealogy is used as a tool to promote Ireland, in particular in North America and Canada, whose people love to trace their roots across generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">I commend those involved in Kilkenny. I hope that we will not just see the five groups from Canada visiting, but a variety of tourists from North America and elsewhere around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> Senator Paddy Burke asked for the Minister to attend the House. He was right, in that the issue of visitors from the UK post Brexit must be tackled. The tourism sector's link with the UK must continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_304">I am delighted to be in the Seanad to bring forward the Second Stage of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016. Some of my colleagues in this Chamber from former times are particularly aware of the importance of this Bill to the Seanad, especially in light of the work done by Senator Bacik, former Senators Jillian van Turnhout and Averil Power and others in respect of the forerunner to this legislation. It is really important for me, having been a Member of this House, that it begins its journey here. This is the right place to start and I am really hopeful that we can move the Bill through with a great sense of urgency in order to be able to complete its passage in an appropriate timeframe, particularly as so many people have waited so long for it. I acknowledge the presence of the Adoption Rights Alliance and of one of our country's artists, who are strong advocates in respect of this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_305"> The primary purpose of the Bill is to provide an adopted person with a statutory right to apply for his or her birth certificate information and his or her adoption order. Those of us who are not adopted may not completely appreciate the significance of this to people who are trying to find out more about their early lives. I have come to understand over the past 12 months that not having access to a birth certificate causes people great emotional and practical difficulty. In this regard, I believe the emphasis on identity rights is key. As people would be aware, I understand a little bit about the importance of identity rights from other perspectives and backgrounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> The aim behind the Bill is to give adopted persons, birth parents and relatives a statutory right to an information and tracing service. The proposed legislation provides for structured and regulated access to information and tracing services for those affected by adoption. It also provides for access to information for adopted people, birth parents and others, and operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Prior to the foundation of this State, the poor law Acts provided that children who were orphaned or deserted could be cared for in an institution or could be "boarded out" in the locality. This boarding out arrangement was continued in practice by local authorities long after the establishment of the State, along with more informal adoption arrangements and it was not until the 1950s that adoption legislation was enacted in Ireland – much later than many other countries. The Adoption Act 1952 provided important legal safeguards for adopted children and for their adoptive parents. At the time of its enactment there were considerable numbers of children whose care arrangements pre-dated the legislation and who did not come within the remit of the Act. Indeed such informal care arrangements continued to be made for children in the years following the enactment of the 1952 Act. In some of these informal care arrangements, difficulties have subsequently arisen when records have been sought from the authorities. In addition, the State now recognises that there were also children who were incorrectly registered as the children of people other than their birth parents. This could serve to remove any formal record linking a birth parent with his or her birth child. Persons who have discovered that they were incorrectly registered in this way have faced huge and sometimes insurmountable difficulties in obtaining accurate identity information.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> Adoption has existed in varying forms throughout our history and by virtue of various motivations.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">In early society, it was motivated by a desire for continuity of the adopting family and the adopted person was often an adult and most likely male. In modern times, it has been more centred on the creation of a family between adopting parents and an infant or a young child. Currently, the most usual type of adoption in Ireland is an intercountry adoption of a child from overseas under the Hague Convention or the adoption of a child within his or her own family in what may be termed a step-parent adoption. </p>
          <p eId="para_310"> Today, adoption is primarily a child welfare and protection measure aimed at providing a child with a safe and stable family environment in those rare cases where the child’s parents cannot, for whatever reason, fulfil their parental duties and responsibilities. It is a statutory legal mechanism which transfers parental duties and responsibilities from one set of parents to another. Adoption involves providing a child with new legal parents, a new family and a new identity. Adoption has provided many children with secure and stable family units that would otherwise have been denied to them. However, we also now know that the absence of identity information can lead to lifelong difficulties for an adopted person. </p>
          <p eId="para_311"> Many parents whose babies were adopted have subsequently expressed a very understandable desire for information about, and sometimes for contact with, an adopted person who is now an adult. Equally, some parents who may have placed a child for adoption in similar circumstances have expressed no desire for such contact and, indeed, may be apprehensive about the implications of this Bill in the context of their own situation. I will come back to this issue later.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> This Bill will ensure that, where such information is held by the State, individuals who were adopted as Irish children by US couples in the 1940s and in later years will have access to information about their adoption from this country. Many others who were not formally adopted, but in respect of whom the State may hold early life information, will also come within the remit of this Bill and will be entitled to engage with the information and tracing service to be provided by the Child and Family Agency. The Bill also provides that a person whose birth has been incorrectly registered will have an entitlement to avail of information and tracing services under the Bill in the same manner as any other applicant, although I do acknowledge that, in those circumstances, the goal of obtaining accurate and meaningful identifying information may be significantly more difficult to achieve. </p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The Bill recognises the fundamental importance of access to adoption records and information for adopted persons and for their families into the future. In anticipation of the Bill, the State has in recent years acquired a large volume of records from various adoption agencies and institutions, including St. Patrick’s Guild, Bessborough, Sean Ross Abbey and Tuam mother and babies home. These records are currently in the custody of the Child and Family Agency and will be transferred into the charge of the Adoption Authority when the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> In addition, the Bill provides for the Adoption Authority, where the circumstances warrant, to issue a direction under section 8 of the Bill to a person who is in possession of a relevant record, directing that person to transfer the specified record or records to the authority for safeguarding. The Bill provides that the Adoption Authority is to be given responsibility for acquiring adoption records that are still extant, for assessing and restoring those records where necessary and for ensuring their preservation. It is essential the remaining records are appropriately assessed, catalogued and indexed in order to make the right to information meaningful and so that the records are accessible. </p>
          <p eId="para_315"> In a small number of cases, records may date as far back as the 1900s and may be the only available link to an applicant’s original family. Any assessment of these precious records must be carried out in a professional manner. To this end, I will be bringing forward an amendment to this Bill on Committee Stage to bring all adoption records within the remit of the National Archives Act 1986. This will help to ensure that the record-keeping of these documents is in keeping with current professional standards. The National Archives will be consulted and asked to provide assistance to the Adoption Authority in this regard. </p>
          <p eId="para_316"> The Bill also provides that a person seeking information may view his or her original records. Again, this is very important for those who have been trying to find out about their early lives. It is a tangible link with their past. Appropriate arrangements are to be put in place by the authority to provide for this. I want to ensure that the Child and Family Agency can provide a timely service which is respectful to applicants wishing to obtain information. The proper restoration, preservation and indexing of records is essential to achieve this objective. </p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I would like to clarify two issues in particular that have been raised with me regarding the Bill. The first concerns the issue of compelling reasons. This has been highlighted as a matter of concern during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill and representations have been made to me setting out these concerns. As a result of the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, the Bill was amended to provide that the adjudication of compelling reasons rests with the Circuit Court rather than the authority. I wish to clarify that, under this Bill, where a birth parent has registered his or her details on the register of adoption contact inquiries, the Child and Family Agency will notify him or her in writing if an adopted person makes an application for birth certificate information. The birth parent will be advised that the information will be provided to the adopted person unless the Child and Family Agency is notified within 12 weeks by the birth parent that he or she considers that there are compelling reasons not to release this information. Compelling reasons are reasons, that having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to endanger the life of a person. Where the Child and Family Agency, having considered a submission, determines that there are compelling reasons to refuse to provide this information, it will refer the matter to the Circuit Court for determination. It is important to note that the Child and Family Agency will also consider any information otherwise available to it, either regarding the birth parent or the adopted person that may lead it to consider that there are compelling reasons for not disclosing information and, if it so determines, it will refer the matter to the Circuit Court. I look forward to hearing Senators' views on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> Another matter that has been raised with me is the establishment of a new register of adoption contact inquiries. The Bill provides that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, shall establish and maintain this register. The existing national adoption contact preference register operated by the Adoption Authority will be discontinued. However, all information relating to that register will be retained as an adoption record and may be used by Tusla to assist in tracing persons. Before the new register is established, each person who applied and whose details are on the old register will be contacted to advise them of the new register that is being established by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and to invite them to have their information recorded on the new register. If a birth parent has previously entered a preference for "no contact" on the old register, details of this preference will be transferred by the agency to the new register. The existing register is a passive register. Thus, where a person enters his or her details on the register no action is taken unless there is a match, that is, if, for example, an adopted person enters details on the register and these details are matched with those of a birth parent who previously registered.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Many of those who entered details on the register have since received the information sought or have succeeded in making contact and are no longer seeking an information and tracing service. Consideration was given to providing that all the information currently held on the existing old register would simply be transferred onto the new statutory register. It was decided that, as the new register provides for an active tracing service for applicants rather than the more passive matching service provided to date, a better outcome would be achieved by contacting those persons currently on the old register in order to alert them to the new active register and to invite them to provide an update of their current wishes in regard to seeking information together with or as well as contact, and to ascertain whether they wish to have information entered on the new register. A simple transfer of information would not achieve the same outcome and could run the risk of overburdening the information and tracing service from the outset. </p>
          <p eId="para_320"> Following extensive engagement with interest groups and Senators, I have decided to reflect further on some other issues in advance of the Bill progressing to Committee Stage. The question of whether an undertaking is necessary was raised with me by several people. The Bill provides that an undertaking not to contact his or her birth parent is required where a person who has been adopted prior to the commencement of the legislation is seeking his or her birth certificate information. This undertaking is required unless the birth parent or relevant guardian is deceased or have indicated that he or she is seeking to have contact with, or is willing to be contacted by, the adopted person. I am aware of the unease of many in regard to the need to give this undertaking and I would prefer to find an alternative solution which respects the rights of all of those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> I am also aware that in many cases there is no objection on the part of a birth parent to the proposed release of birth certificate information. However, other birth parents who may feel unable to express their views publicly on this matter remain opposed to the release of birth certificate information on the grounds of privacy. It is fair to assume they are anxious that the provision of information will lead them to being identified. A number of social workers from the Child and Family Agency have been in touch with my Department alerting us to significant concerns in this regard. I do not want the Bill to cause further distress to anyone in this position and I have included measures which are intended to minimise such concerns. These include providing that a person who has registered on the register of adoption contact inquiries will be notified in the event that his or her child who was adopted applies for birth certificate information.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> While I am mindful of the need to safeguard privacy rights in this Bill, I am also conscious that such rights must be considered in the context of the importance of identity rights of adopted persons. In particular, I acknowledge that the provision in the Bill obliging an adopted person to provide an undertaking before obtaining his or her birth certificate information has not been welcomed by adopted persons. I appreciate and understand the objections raised. I am taking legal advice and trying to find another mechanism which could help to protect privacy rights for birth parents without necessarily obliging applicants to provide undertakings. Subject to this advice, I hope I will be in a position to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_323"> An awareness campaign will be undertaken during the first six months after the Bill's enactment, which will publicise the provisions it contains. The campaign will alert a birth parent to the steps to be taken to ensure that he or she is notified in the event of his or her child who was adopted applying for birth certificate information. While I am mindful of the need to safeguard privacy rights, I am also conscious that such rights must be considered in the context of the importance of identity rights of adopted persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> I am also considering whether amendments may be needed on Committee Stage in respect of providing for the further adoption of a child.<b>
						</b>The Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is awaiting Report Stage in this House, provides for the adoption of any child, including a child who is currently or previously adopted. This means that, for example, when the Adoption (Amendment) Bill is enacted, an adopted child may be placed for adoption by his or her adoptive parents and a further adoption with new adoptive parents can be effected. In such circumstances, it is possible that an adopted person may seek information about or contact with his or her previous adoptive parents in addition to information about his or her birth parents. It is also the case that previous adoptive parents may seek information about or contact with the person they had previously adopted. I am considering bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage to provide for this. I also signal my intention to bring forward a number of related amendments regarding the provision of the information and tracing service. These amendments arise in the main in Part 4, although there may be a need for some consequential amendments in other sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> The role of accredited bodies will change in the context of the Bill. I am aware of the expertise and professionalism of those agencies that are currently accredited under the Adoption Act 2010 to provide information and tracing services. However, the advice I have received is that the transfer of information to non-statutory agencies may be inappropriate in the context of the provisions of the Bill. For this reason, I intend to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to address this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_326"> It is also my intention to bring forward, later in the year, new policy proposals for information and tracing services with respect to intercountry adoptions. It had been intended to include these provisions in the Bill but, unfortunately, this has not been possible. I have undertaken to bring forward the relevant policy and legislative provisions as a matter of urgency and a proposal to provide for an information and tracing service in respect of intercountry adoptions has been included in the current Government legislative programme. In the interim, the Child and Family Agency will continue with its current information and tracing service for applicants in respect of intercountry adoptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> I am also considering observations on the Bill that I received from the Ombudsman for Children. In this regard, I may bring forward amendments at a later stage to address the issues raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> I will now address the provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title. Section 2 provides for the definition of certain terms. Section 3 provides that the Minister may make regulations for any matter referred to in the Bill, as prescribed or to be prescribed. Section 4 provides that expenses incurred in the administration of the Act are to be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 5 provides that the authority and agency shall allocate moneys each year for costs arising from their respective obligations under the Act. Section 6 provides that a person may authorise another person to act on his or her behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> In Part 2, section 7 provides that the Minister may prescribe a person, who it is reasonably believed has made or has attempted to make arrangements for the adoption of a child, as an information source. Section 8 provides that an information source shall furnish a statement to the authority of the relevant records in its possession. This section also provides that the authority may issue a direction regarding the transfer of the relevant records from the information source to the authority. Section 9 provides that an information source or other person may transfer a relevant record to the authority, notwithstanding that it has not been issued with a direction to do so under section 8. Section 10 provides that the authority shall retain relevant records in respect of each person who is the subject of an adoption order and an information source shall transfer all relevant records to the authority within three months of an adoption order being made. This section also provides that where the agency creates or obtains a relevant record relating to a person who is or was the subject of an incorrect registration or was the subject of an informal care arrangement, it shall transfer the information to the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Section 11 provides that the authority shall ensure that an index and a searchable electronic database of the adoption records is created and maintained. Section 12 provides that the authority shall grant access to the relevant records and to the index and database to persons authorised by the authority or agency. A person who applies for information under Part 5 may also apply to the authority for access to relevant records. Section 13 provides for the search powers to enable the authority to obtain copies of or extracts from relevant records at any place at which the authority believes a relevant record is being kept. This section also provides for the appointment authorised officers and the process for obtaining a warrant to enter any place and to exercise the functions an authorised officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> Part 3 deals with the register of adoption contact inquiries.

This section also provides that where a birth parent has recorded that he or she does not wish to have contact with the adopted person on the national contact preference register, this shall be deemed to be a statement made and recorded on the register. This section also provides that an application for information under Part 5 shall be deemed to be an application to be entered on the register.</p>

Section 16 provides that the agency shall provide a tracing service to locate a person specified in section 14 and to locate a person requested under section 20 to facilitate contact or where the location of the person is required or necessary for the provision of information under Part 5. Section 17 provides that the agency may request a person to provide it with information or access to information that is in the possession of the person, where the agency reasonably requires the information concerned to perform its functions under this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_333"> Section 18 provides that a relevant body may share a relevant record or information with another relevant body if that record or information is required by the other body for the performance of its duties under the Bill. The information shall be shared under a data exchange agreement, agreed to by both bodies, and the record or information shared shall not be disclosed other than in accordance with this Bill. The Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 shall apply to information shared under this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_334"> Section 19 provides that the guidelines may be issued for the purpose of providing practical guidance to the agency in respect of its performance under Part 4 and may include guidelines concerning the procedure to be followed for the purpose of locating a person and the records that are likely to be relevant for that purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_335"> Section 20 provides that a person may request the agency to facilitate contact with a specified person and the agency shall, without undue delay, take all reasonable steps to locate the specified person and ascertain whether the person are willing to have contact with the requestor. Section 21 provides that the agency may authorise an accredited body to perform the functions of the agency under Part 4. As I indicated, this section may be amended on Committee Stage. Section 22 provides for the definition of compelling reasons as being where the provision of information, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to endanger the life of a person.</p>

          <p eId="para_338"> Section 25 provides that where a relevant person applies for birth certificate information or a copy of an adoption order, the agency shall provide the requested information where the birth mother is deceased or where the adoption was effected before the commencement of this section and there is no entry in the register in respect of the birth mother and the applicant has given an undertaking not to contact her.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> Section 26 provides that where an application by a relevant person is for birth certificate information or a copy of an adoption order and there is an entry in respect of the birth mother or the adoption was effected after the commencement of this section, the agency shall notify the birth mother of the making of the application and inform her of her entitlement to provide compelling reasons as to why the information should not be provided. She shall also be informed of the entitlement to support and guidance for both her and the applicant. Where the birth mother provides a statement of compelling reasons, the agency shall determine whether there are compelling reasons, having considered any other information available that is relevant. Where the agency determines that there are compelling reasons, it shall seek the approval from the Circuit Court of its determination. Where the agency determines that there are no compelling reasons, it shall inform the birth mother of its determination and of the right to appeal to the Circuit Court. Where the Circuit Court has made a decision on a matter before it, the birth mother, agency, or applicant may appeal to the High Court on a point of law.

He shall also be informed of the entitlement to support and guidance for both him and the applicant. Where the birth father provides a statement of compelling reasons, the agency shall determine whether there are compelling reasons having considered any other information available. Where the agency determines that there are compelling reasons, it shall seek the approval from the Circuit Court. Where the agency determines that there are no compelling reasons, it shall inform the birth father of its determination and that he may appeal the determination to the Circuit Court.

          <p eId="para_369">I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for a very comprehensive report on this Bill in its current state.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill will give adopted persons, birth parents and relatives a legal right to an information and tracing service. The proposed legislation provides for structured and regulated access to information and tracing services for those affected by adoption. It provides for access to information for adopted people, birth parents and others, and operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible. Fianna Fáil broadly supports this Bill as it makes important progress in recognising the needs and rights of adopted people, and creating a more streamlined and well organised means for birth parents and adopted people to access information and trace their relatives. </p>
          <p eId="para_371"> In transforming the adoption register from a passive to an active one, the Bill will greatly increase the efficiency of the register and will likely increase the number of successful matches and recorded retrievals. In creating a more accessible service, this Bill will expand the range of people to whom adoption and birth information is available, for example, people adopted through illegal or informal adoptions. This Bill, which was promised by both this Government and its predecessor, is a long-overdue recognition of the struggle of adopted persons and their relatives to increase the ease with which important records can be accessed in the legislative process. </p>
          <p eId="para_372"> The Adoption Act 1952 remains the primary legislation on adoption in Ireland, as the first Bill to formalise adoption in Ireland. This Bill provided for an adoption system which preserved the anonymity of birth parents, driven by the social and political context of the time. The Adoption Act 2010 sought to build on this by improving standards in domestic and intercountry adoptions. Under current law, there is no comprehensive statutory right for adopted people to access the records relating to their birth or adoption. It is estimated that around 44,364 adoption orders were made in Ireland between 1953, after the Adoption Act 1952, up to and including 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_373"> The proposed legislation will establish the register of adoption contact inquiries and provides for the safeguarding of all adoption records. This register will be under the remit of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. After the enactment of the legislation, Tusla will undertake a six month long campaign to raise awareness among adoptees and birth mothers. In particular, the campaign will outline that an adopted person aged 18 years and over will be entitled to apply for their birth certificate information and that a birth parent will be given an opportunity to indicate their preference regarding contact on the register of adoption contact inquiries. The existing national adoption contact reference register, NACPR, will be discontinued. However, all information relating to the NACPR will be retained. Before the new register is established, each person whose details are on the NACPR will be contacted advising them of the new register that is being established by Tusla. They will be invited to apply to have their details entered on the new register, which is to be welcomed. However, where birth parents have already indicated a preference for no contact on the NACPR, details of this preference will be transferred to the new register. Where a birth mother is deceased or there is no entry on the register in relation to her, birth certificate information will be provided to an adopted person after he or she has given an undertaking agreeing not to contact or attempt to contact his or her birth parent or not to ask anyone else to make or attempt to make contact on his or her behalf. </p>
          <p eId="para_374"> In cases where there is an entry on the register in respect of the birth mother, the agency will first contact the birth mother, informing her of the request and telling her that unless she provides compelling reason, that is, reasons to suggest that providing the information would endanger a life, the requested birth certificate or adoption order will be provided. While this is an issue of contention with some survivors, it aims to strike a balance between providing information and ensuring that the privacy of birth mothers is respected. Under the Irish Constitution, this is an important balance to be struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> As I said at the outset, while there are certain aspects which may need to be ironed out later in the legislative process, we extend our overall support for the Bill and the principles which underpin it. We will be submitting some amendments, and we look forward to hearing the amendments being proposed by others. </p>
          <p eId="para_376">While this long overdue Bill is to be welcomed, there is a need for tweaking in many areas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#VictorBoyhan" eId="spk_145">
          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_377">I warmly welcome the Minister to the House. I particularly like to see her here and believe she has an amazing record in this whole area. She has been a wonderful advocate for children generally. This Bill will be one of the cornerstones of her policy legacy and I know she is anxious to get it right. In previous debates about the Adoption (Amendment) Bill, she has delivered in separating the two issues which are interlinked in many ways. I thank her for a comprehensive speech in which she outlined she would table further amendments. This shows she is a Minister who is constantly engaging in and thinking about the process to see how it can be tweaked. The more conversations we have with people and the more we hear personal stories and testimonies, the more we change our perspective. That is the nature of this very complex issue in which there is no case that fits all.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> We all agree the most important and right place for children is with their parent or parents, or with their extended family, where they feel secure and safe and, in the word the Minister used, connected. What is paramount in everything to do with children in legislation is what is best for the child. That always has to be to the fore of any legislation dealing with children and their well-being. It is about feeling safe and connected, knowing who one is, where one belongs and the road one has travelled, even though it will have broken sections. This legislation attempts to provide a real structure and legal basis for adopted people who wish to get information and trace from where they have come. The other important line is about balancing the rights of all those involved, which is tricky. I acknowledge the Minister's personal commitment and advocacy in this role. It has been outstanding and is shown with this critical legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> The Oireachtas has a wonderful library and research service team which produced a digest for the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016. I spoke to two Ministers recently who told me they never read a digest about a Bill they had before the House. Is it not extraordinary that they had never taken the time to use this in-house service? Is it not extraordinary that a clever politician, whether in the Dáil or Seanad, would not go into the Library before coming into the Chamber to read the digest for a Bill?</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> From the pre-legislative scrutiny committee hearing, the digest identified 12 key points about this legislation which it flagged with red, amber and green lights. It is interesting there are some red lights which assists us in our work. One point was balancing the rights of identity with the rights of privacy. The digest stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_381">The general scheme of the Bill makes a "presumption in favour of disclosure of adoption information". However, it also makes provision for non-disclosure of adoption information in cases where there are "compelling reasons, such as may endanger the life of a person".</p>
          <p eId="para_382">What is meant by "compelling reasons"? "Compelling" is an open word. Will the Minister share some detail in that? Conversely, the digest stated, "The committee recommended that compelling reasons for disclosing adoption information should equally be considered, including an adoptee’s need for accurate family medical history and genetic information if they seek medical treatment." It is interesting the digest has a red flag on this. The Minister touched on it earlier on and she might give us some feedback on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> I do not know where to start with the role of Tusla. The digest outlined:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_384">The general scheme of the Bill outlines Tusla’s role in providing a centralised, streamlined and standardised adoption information service. However, the committee was also aware of current delays in delivering certain adoption services and is concerned about the possibility of further delays in providing information and tracing services in the future. Service delivery is time sensitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Again, serious concerns were expressed as to whether Tusla has the expertise, sufficient staff and the resources to deal with this. The Minister's response was that the issue of resources would be kept under regular review. That is not sufficient. We need assurances from the Minister in this regard. Will the necessary resources, professional staff and all the people around this sensitive area be in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> The general scheme provided for a 12-month awareness campaign prior to the introduction of the new adoption information register. The committee suggested a shorter, more intense information campaign. While I have no difficulty with a six-month campaign, the Minister would need to redouble the efforts with a more intense education and instruction programme. Again, that was a concern raised by the pre-legislative scrutiny committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> Given the likely increase in demand for counselling services, advice, mediation and support services, the committee raised serious concerns about resources. Again, the response was that the issue of resources would be kept under regular review. If all this legislation does not have the teeth, the power, the money or the resources to see it through, then we are wasting our time. We need reassurances on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> The digest stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_389"> The committee recommended extending the period for appeals from 14 to 28 days [at a minimum]. The committee also recommends allowing appeals to be heard in the Circuit Court rather than the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">That is reasonable and fair. I believe the Minister reflected that in her final draft of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> The independent oversight of the new information tracing system is critically important. This was also emphasised by the pre-legislative scrutiny committee. It was noted in response by the Department but that is not enough. What oversight process is planned for this?</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> There also needs to be a clear definition of "relative". Where does a cousin come into this? The committee expressed some concerns, stating it should be further expanded to include other members of the family.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I support the Bill in principle but I see the potential for several amendments. I already have some half-drafted. I thank the Minister for this Bill and much work has been done on it. The whole issue of competence and resources around Tusla and the other agencies involved will be critical to ensure this Bill is successful.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">I will try and be as brief as possible to accommodate colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I welcome the Minister and her officials to the House. It is clear from her speech that the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 is detailed and complicated. I thank the Minister and her officials for their careful and detailed work on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> The Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016 will give adopted persons, birth parents and relatives a legal right to an information and tracing service which, as other Senators said, is long overdue. This Bill offers access to information for adopted people, birth parents and others, and operates on the basis of a presumption in favour of disclosing information in so far as is legally and constitutionally possible. The proposed legislation will establish the register of adoption contact inquiries and provides for the safeguarding of all adoption records. Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, will undertake an awareness campaign during the first six months after the legislation comes into operation to inform people about the Bill's provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> The campaign will outline that an adopted persons, aged 18 years and over, will be entitled to apply for their birth certificate information and that birth parents will be given an opportunity to indicate their preference regarding contact on the register of adoption contact inquiries. People entering their details on the register can change their contact preference at any time. It is expected the information campaign will encourage adopted people and birth parents to enter their details on the register and to engage with Tusla’s information and tracing service.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">People who were affected by informal adoptions - that is in a long-term care arrangement where no adoption took place or where births have been incorrectly registered - will be entitled to an information and tracing service in the same manner as an adopted person or a birth parent of an adopted person. </p>
          <p eId="para_400"> The proposed legislation also provides that Tusla will offer support and guidance to adopted people, birth parents and relatives at all stages of the information and tracing process. A new register is to be established and operated by Tusla. An adopted person, a birth parent or a relative seeking to share information or wishing to have contact with a person from whom they were separated as a result of an adoption, may apply to have their details entered on the register. People can also enter their details on the register to indicate that they are not willing to be contacted by a specified person.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> I would like to address the subject of adoption records. Adoption records are currently held by the Adoption Authority of Ireland, Tusla and agencies accredited under the Adoption Act 2010. These records are of historical significance and are of great importance for adopted people, birth parents, and relatives. Under the proposed legislation, the authority will have overall responsibility for the safeguarding of all adoption records.</p>
          <p eId="para_402"> I will turn now to the issue of adoptions effected before the proposed legislation comes into operation and to which the Minister has also referred. An adopted person aged 18 years or over who was adopted before the proposed legislation comes into operation, will be provided with his or her birth certificate information, as held on record, following a request to Tusla and subject to certain conditions. Where a birth mother has registered her details on the register, Tusla will notify her, in writing, of the adopted person’s application for his or her birth certificate information. Where a birth father was consulted in relation to an adoption and has not registered his details on the register, and the adopted person has given an undertaking not to contact his or her birth parent, he or she can be provided with details of his or her father’s forename and surname, as held on record.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Although I broadly support this Bill, I will highlight some of the objections that were brought to my attention by Cúnamh, which is an accredited body licensed regulated by the Adoption Authority of Ireland. Cúnamh is concerned that due to governance and legislative issues, when this Bill is enacted accredited bodies such as Cúnamh will no longer be able to provide adoption information as this information will be provided solely by Tusla. Will the Minister confirm the position on this? Cúnamh argues that according to official statistics Tulsa is losing approximately 150 social workers a year, yet this legislation in its current form is going to give the responsibility for information and tracing solely to Tulsa, resulting in the closure of agencies such as Cúnamh that have a long history and expertise in this area. While I broadly welcome this Bill and commend the Minister on her work, I believe there are certain issues that may yet need to be addressed on Committee Stage. The Minister has also alluded to this.</p>

          <from>Senator Fintan Warfield<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_404">I will be brief in an attempt to make space for others. I thank the Minister for joining us in the House. Information and tracing for our adoption services have been long sought by natural mothers who have been wronged and by adopted people who are seeking truth and justice. I commend the Minister's movement on the issue. It is made even more poignant after the revelations in March of the Tuam mother and baby home. I am sure there are many women across the State who hope that the baby taken from them back then was adopted and did not meet a horrific and unjustifiable end in Tuam. It is through the bravery of people such as Catherine Corless that those women received answers. It is, however, worth noting that the women whose children were sent overseas to the likes of Britain and the US cannot retrieve information through the proposed legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> Information and tracing are sorely needed not only to provide justice to those who have been wronged, but to infer rights for people in the future. Sinn Féin believes that the Bill before us today falls short and that its implementation will only hinder those seeking information and tracing. While Sinn Féin welcomes the Minister's commitment to explore amendments, we believe the Minister should go back to the drawing board and return with a Bill that contains unfettered access to birth certificates for adopted persons; automatic access for adopted persons to their adoption files; and a tracing service for those who wish to avail of it. Sinn Féin agrees with the Adoption Rights Alliance in its interpretation of the Bill as unnecessarily convoluted and far from the expectations of those it seeks to redress. For example, the lack of automatic access to full, non-redacted records and birth certificates is unnecessary. Birth certificates are often the key for an adopted person in his or her attempt to unlock their past and the measures contained in this Bill stifle what could be worthy efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> It is unnecessary and unwarranted to include a statutory declaration provision in section 41 of the Bill. In its 2015 pre-legislative scrutiny report, the Joint Committee on Health and Children said that " ...based on the weight of evidence and the legal submissions received from witnesses, the Committee can find no convincing reason for the inclusion of a Statutory Declaration in the Bill." To include a statutory declaration suggests to adopted people that they cannot be trusted to respect privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> The Bill further undermines adopted people by compounding information and contact despite being warned against doing so by adoption rights advocacy groups and in pre-legislative scrutiny. It goes against the advice that some adopted people do not want contact with their natural mothers at all, while others will wait for a period of time after obtaining their birth certificates before attempting to contact their natural mothers or family members. This is because adopted people often choose to absorb the information before progressing any further.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> As I said earlier, a noticeable omission of the Bill is the lack of provision on information and tracing for those who were sent, or whose children were sent, overseas for adoption. Considering that some 2,000 babies were exported to the US from the Magdalen laundries, a large cohort that the Bill could have provided for are not included. I can appreciate the sensitive and turbulent nature of making private information available especially between international parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> Even if it was to give truth to concerned natural mothers, Sinn Féin believes there was scope for attempts to be made in that regard. When one considers information and tracing in the context of adoption, we think of families being reunited and lifelong questions being answered for natural parents and their adopted children. In Ireland, the church-State relationship tore families apart as they did not fit into an acceptable model - as some would have seen it - and we owe greater truth and justice to the birth parents and adopted people who were the fallout of the State's failures. This Bill falls short of their wishes. Sinn Féin, therefore, believes the Bill to be a missed opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I join others in welcoming the Minister to the House and the opportunity to discuss and debate these issues. It is a very welcome step that we are looking to legislate on the access to information for adopted persons, on the exchange of information and for better tracing mechanisms. I accept and acknowledge this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> I will move on to the areas of concern, some of which the Minister has already acknowledged. The Minister gave some history of the changing nature of adoption in the State, but there is another aspect to the history of adoption in the State that was, perhaps, not as acknowledged. I know we will have a chance to discuss it later today and it is important. It concerns the aspect of the history of adoption in the forced adoptions and the experience of adoption under great duress. We know of the almost 2,000 children who were adopted to the United States of America. We know of adoptions that took place when women were in situations, effectively, of forced detention. The very difficult and problematic history of adoption needs to be acknowledged. Today, we are hearing discussion about balance and we need to acknowledge that there has been a deep imbalance done by the State. The rights of the adopted children and their birth parents have often been very low in the balance of concern of the State and of those involved in adoption in the past. When we talk about balancing the two elements it is important to recognise that both have, in the past, been subservient to other concerns. This is a key factor when we look at the context.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Minister has acknowledged that there are concerns about the question of compelling reasons and the question of clarity around that. I acknowledge that Senators Ruane and Kelleher share many of the concerns I mentioned. We may table amendments on later Stages so I hope we can work with the Minister on that. In respect of compelling reasons, well-being and life and health, it has been well enunciated by Senator Warfield that there are compelling reasons and concerns for adopted persons, indeed issues of life and death, where they may wish to be able to access information about their birth and heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> I will focus on the issue the Minister identified as being problematic, for which I thank her. This is the question of the no-contact undertaking which is there as a requirement at the moment. It is a matter of great concern. We know that persons have a right to their identity. If we want a recent mandate, we passed a referendum in this State which affirmed the rights of the child and under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the right to identity is a key part of that. An inherent part of that right to identity is the knowledge of one's past and family history. I believe section 41 severely challenges and undermines that right. It shows disrespect to adopted persons and places them in a different situation. No other group of citizens in the State must sign disclaimers, waivers and undertakings to access essential information such as their birth certificates. It is completely out of line with this. I know this issue has been of concern at UN level where the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW, has asked the Irish State to justify that element in the proposed Bill which sought required surviving adoptees to sign a statutory declaration undertaking not to contact their biological mothers as a condition for gaining access. This was a concern at CEDAW and, in response, the State again spoke about the right to privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Some have challenged that there is a blurring of the line between privacy and secrecy. There is, of course, the right to a private life on the part of a person seeking information. It seems extraordinary that somebody would be asked to sign and waive away their right to contact a parent as a default mechanism. Surely this is an interference in the private life of the individual who has been adopted. We do not interfere in the relationships between others. If there are situations of unwanted contact, we have mechanisms such as our legislation in areas such as harassment. For example, we have barring orders. We spoke about the presumption of information but what we are seeing here is people being forced to choose between identity and information. People who in many cases have endured great cruelty from this State are being asked to choose between their right to identity and relationship and their right to information alone. It is unacceptable. We need to be very clear that those who are adopted are not supplicants or applicants to the State. They are not looking for charity. In many cases, they have experienced what charity amounted to in this State in the past in its religious and other institutions. They are looking for justice and their proper rights on the same basis as any other citizen. That is what we need to grant them. I urge the Minister to reform this area on Committee Stage. We will certainly look to support her if she has amendments to that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Another point that relates to this is the double clause. We already have a provision, which is a problematic one, that allows for compelling reasons. It allows an individual to say that they have reasons they do not want their contact details shared. Why do we have that as one bar and the no-contact clause? Another problem with the no-contact clause, which also relates to the concerns regarding the transfer of the register, is the fact that where somebody has given no indication that they want contact, the assumption is that the no-contact clause would be used in that condition. We know there are situations where women were told their children were dead. There are many original birth mothers in the State who do not know whether their children are alive or adopted, who may not be in contact with the State on an ongoing basis and who have been given false information. These issues arise so there is a real concern about that default presumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> There is also concern around the lack of original copies in terms of documentation. It is one thing to be able to view one's documentation but to be able obtain original copies, which is important for people as they move through their lives, is another thing. If they make their lives in a new country, they should have original and appropriate documentation and be able to use that on the birth certificate they recognise as their own. An edited document from a statutory agency is not the same thing, so I hope the Minister also addresses that concern. The question is not for those who have been through the adoption system in Ireland to prove their trustworthiness. We need to move away from the stigma that has been associated with this area-----</p>

          <p eId="para_420">The State must restore trust in its citizens. I welcome the Minister's proposed amendment on Committee Stage regarding the National Archives. I think that is appropriate for this paperwork. As well as the concerns of all those individuals relating to tracing and the appropriate treatment of records, we also need to acknowledge that the State has a duty to be able to amass these and look to this in an appropriate way as part of our collective history. In particular, where records have been inaccurate, it is important they are still transferred and included. I commend that amendment and look forward to it. I look forward to the next Stage of this debate.</p>

          <from>Senator John O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T14:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_421">I am pleased to speak about this legislation. I welcome it and believe it is long overdue. As previous speakers have said, it may not be perfect, and the Minister has acknowledged that herself, but it is a very genuine attempt to improve the existing legislation and I commend the Minister on that. It is very important that this Bill gives birth parents and relatives a legal right to information and tracing services. A legal right is a legal right. In the past, it was a grace and favour arrangement where if someone was lucky, he or she got information. If that person knew how to go about it - searching records, archives and the register of births, deaths and marriages - that person might find his or her mother, son, daughter or whatever loved one that person was looking for. However, we have learned from the mistakes of the past. Unfortunately, it may be too late for some but it is important legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> I note that Tusla will undertake an awareness campaign when the legislation comes into operation to publicise it and provide information on what details can be given and the circumstances in which this can be done. This campaign should not just be run in this country but should be widespread because the Irish diaspora is all over the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> It is a very comprehensive Bill and I commend the Minister and her officials on the thoroughness and genuine attempt to cover all the angles. Tusla will offer support and guidance to adopted people and birth mothers. It has given consideration to every variance and sensitivity and there are options for appeals for anyone not satisfied with the determination of Tusla or the Adoption Authority of Ireland. I am aware that Tusla has been doing a lot of good work and provides professional advice and guidance. I know of an adopted person who had dealings with Tusla in recent years. They met their birth mother for the first time in their 40s. They received counselling and advice. Matters were anonymous in the sense that no addresses were given. There was written contact with their mother before both parties met. The person and the birth mother were supported through the process, boundaries were agreed and a meeting was arranged. The adopted person met their mother as a result of the process they went through. They are working on building a tentative relationship. It is not easy. There is a lot of hurt and there are many years to catch up on with an elderly and frail birth mother who lives in the UK. That is why this legislation is so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">It will allow people who are 18 years of age to access their birth information if they so wish. They will have time to build relationships and they have an entitlement to this information.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> The Minister and her officials have obviously examined this matter from many angles and appear to have gone to great lengths to cover every eventuality. Most importantly, they have taken a human approach in dealing with the sensitivities involved. I commend all of them on that and on the work that has gone into drafting this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">I welcome the Minister and thank her for the constructive engagement with her and her officials in respect of the Bill. I am delighted that, as she stated, the Bill is being introduced in the Seanad. I acknowledge the presence in the Gallery of Susan Lohan and Noelle Brown, I applaud the great work done by Claire McGettrick and others at the Adoption Rights Alliance and I thank Dr. Fergus Ryan and Dr. Conor O'Mahony, whose input I have sought in preparing for today and in working on the Bill more generally. I also acknowledge the work of our former Seanad colleague, Averil Power, who previously introduced a Bill on this issue that passed all Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> The first thing to say is how much I - and, I am sure, all others present - welcome, in principle, the introduction, finally, of legislation that will enable adopted persons in Ireland to access information about their origins. The issue of the right to an identity is, as others have said, vitally important. Not only is it a human rights issue recognised in international documents - such as in Article 7 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child - it also has a visceral effect where it is denied. As someone who represented many survivors of abuse before the Residential Institutions Redress Board, I saw very close quarters how the denial of a right to identity affects those who have lived with it for so many years, and to whom this Bill seeks to provide some redress. The right to an identity is also protected under the European Convention on Human Rights. In the case of Godelli <i>v.</i> Italy, the European Court of Human Rights, in September 2012, delivered a judgment which stated emphatically that the right to an identity, including the right to know one's parentage, is an integral part of the notion of private life under Article 8 of the convention. It found a breach of Article 8 where Italian law gave blind preference to the privacy rights of a birth parent over the right to identity of the individual in the case, a 69 year old who had been denied her right to identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> We are conscious of the context in which we speak on the Bill and, as I said, it is very welcome to see that it will for the first time provide adopted persons with this mechanism. However, as others have done, I wish to offer some constructive criticism as to how I think the Bill could be improved upon. This is not in any way to take away from the huge progress the Bill represents, particularly in the context of the provisions on tracing, the retention of records and the establishment of a proactive register of adoption contact inquiries. All of that is hugely important. However, I wish to engage in constructive criticism in respect of Part 5, which concerns the provision of information. I will make two general points of critique and two very specific points on which I know the Minister is open to working.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> In the context of making a general critique, many, including the Adoption Rights Alliance, have commented on the unduly cumbersome, complex and tortuous provisions of Part 5. The way in which Part 5 is drafted seems to make it unnecessarily inaccessible. In her lengthy speech, for which I thank her, the Minister set out - very comprehensively - the provisions of the Bill. This illustrated very clearly the extent of repetition in the Bill. It seems that some very straightforward redrafting could be done to ensure that some of that repetition could be removed and, for example, that the various provisions surrounding different persons who seek information could be streamlined. This is a general point but what I am suggesting would have an important effect. This is a substantive rather than a merely formal problem and it feeds into my second general critique.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The cumbersome way in which the Bill is drafted suggests that it is based on a premise or presumption that it favours privacy rights over identity rights. This is a crucial point of criticism that the Adoption Rights Alliance has made. For far too long, the stifling social mores and repression of the Catholic Church and others have dominated family law and policy in this country. Professor William Duncan has referred to the stigma that attached in the 1950s, when we first introduced formal adoption procedure, to birth outside marriage. He has stated that the relevant Act, in light of this stigma, introduced a secret and sanitised adoption system whose hallmarks were anonymity and confidentiality for the natural mother along with a clean break - a complete severing of ties - between natural mother and child. We have moved a long way from that, happily. Unfortunately, however, it is still the context in which the Bill appears to have been drafted. We need to ensure that the Bill illustrates clearly that privacy rights do not trump identity rights. I do not wish to disparage or in any way dismiss the real concerns many birth parents may still have about privacy - the Minister referred to this - but we have very clear guidance from Conor O'Mahony and other experts that we do not need to be quite as strongly deferential to the rights of privacy in our drafting of this legislation. The I. O'T. <i>v.</i> B. decision of the Supreme Court in 1998 does not seem to me, or indeed to others, to require that we weigh the balance quite so heavily in favour of the right to privacy over the right to identity.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> This brings me to the two specific points I wish to make, which concern exactly this point of the way in which we balance the right to privacy and the right to identity. Others have referred to section 41 and the undertaking, and I thank the Minister for her indication that she is willing to consider how to address this point. I know she has moved on this already - from the statutory declaration to the undertaking - but the question is whether an undertaking is necessary at all now that it has been reduced to its current status in section 41. Dr. O'Mahony refers to it as a mere fig leaf. Breach of it carries no consequences, so it would be a strange Supreme Court decision, he suggests, that would find the constitutionality of legislation to turn on the presence or absence of a fig leaf. Why not just remove the provision altogether? Alternatively, the Minister could make provision for an option, such as that provided for in Averil Power's Bill, that those who do not wish to sign undertakings would have an alternative option, such as a meeting a social worker or counsellor, as provided for. Provision for such a meeting would have to ensure that it would not become unduly burdensome on those seeking to avail of the option, but this is a simple and practical way to get around the difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The more I reread section 22, the compelling reasons clause, the less point I see to it. The definition in the section has been tightened up and the words "such as" have been removed. To my mind, it still suggests that there may be compelling reasons present other than the likely endangerment of the life of a person. Therefore, at the very least, the word "only" should be inserted in section 22 to make clear that is indeed the only scenario in which the information should not be provided. However, if that is the only scenario which would be an obstacle to the provision of information, we have other legislation to deal with it. Senator Higgins referred to this. There is criminal justice legislation in place. If the threat is that serious, that legislation could be used. My concern and, I believe, that of others is that this again betrays a distrust in the adopted person and an unwillingness to allow for unfettered disclosure. Furthermore, in a practical way, this provision could be used as a stalling tactic or delaying mechanism whereby someone could say that he or she thinks there are compelling reasons for the non-disclosure of information. Ultimately, the authority, the agency and then the Circuit Court could say no, yet one could find oneself months away from the provision of information. As a result, there are practical and principled reasons we should simply remove the compelling reasons clause altogether.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> I have been asked also to say a word about a number of other minor points. The definition of "relative" could be reconsidered. If spouses and civil partners are included, for example, why not cohabitees? I have been asked specifically to say a word about birth mothers, who are themselves anxious to find and maintain contact with children they gave up for adoption - that also needs to be said - and who may find their efforts thwarted not necessarily by the adopted child but by others. As I have said to the Minister and bearing that in mind, it might be worth stating in section 20 - by way of a facilitative provision and in order to get that message across - that the agency shall encourage all parties to make contact in this way.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">Finally, we need to be careful that this vitally important Bill clearly discloses a level of trust in adopted persons and attaches a great deal of weight to their rights to know their own identities. Unfortunately, some of the provisions in the Bill appear to be based on a distrust of adopted persons and to refer back to an old culture of concealment and secrecy. The Tuam revelations have shown us only too well what that has led to in the past, so we need to be careful about the drafting. Nonetheless, I welcome the Bill in principle.</p>

          <from>Senator David Norris<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_436">Like Senator Bacik, I welcome the Minister. I thank her for her detailed analysis of the Bill and her willingness to extend the time for debate. She has shown quite a lot of flexibility and there appear to be a number of amendments in the pipeline, which is very welcome. Regarding the names she provided in respect of the entities from which the State obtained records - St. Patrick's Guild, the Bessborough mother and baby home, Sean Ross Abbey, the Tuam mother and child home - I must say, what a list of infamy.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I understand the Minister says she will bring all records under the National Archives, presumably that includes the existing national adoption register. Nothing will be excluded, nothing will be shredded or got rid of, because it seemed to me there was something of a grey line there where she said that we would not transfer everything because it would be cumbersome and difficult. </p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Suppose someone breaks the agreement, is there any penalty? I did not see one. What happens to them? On the compelling reason, is it really the case that it would have to be a threat to life? Envisaging the actual death of the person is a very high bar to put in place. </p>
          <p eId="para_439"> There are a number of principles which should be adopted. Firstly, no adopted person should be asked to sign a statutory declaration before being allowed access to medical information. Of course it should be given, it is vital. This kind of thing is so important for medical treatment. All files relating to adopted people should not be given to Tusla but to an objective organisation so that it can be maintained. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> I wish to put a couple of voices on the record, those of people who have been in this situation. I was contacted by a woman who said that if the Bill is enacted in its present form it would lead to further stigmatisation and so on. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_441"> "My own husband's mother was 14 years old having him and she was made to give him up for adoption. She has no recollection of signing adoption papers and at 14 years how can one sign a legal document without a guardian?"</p>
          <p eId="para_442">That is a very good question. At age 14, how can one possibly be assumed to have the legal capacity to do this? </p>
          <p eId="para_443"> On the removal of the proposed mechanism to provide statements drafted by Tusla in lieu of copies of original records, this is actual personal information. Why should third parties go trawling through someone else's personal information and then give them a type of digest form? </p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I have another very moving letter but I do not have time to put it all on the record. It is from the founder of the Irish First Mothers group. This is a very important group of people. Her first child was born in April 1974, and she spent four months in the Good Shepherd convent. She was aged 19. She nursed her child for seven days before the child was taken from her. </p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I have had contact from Pact. It welcomes the Bill, by and large, but it is concerned about the closing down of the various agencies. There are six of them: Here2Help, Cúnamh, Clarecare, St. Brigid's, St. Mura's and Barnardos. It would be a pity if they were denied a role in this area. The removal of the services provided by these accredited agencies would cause uncertainty to the added waiting time of adopted persons, birth relatives and adoptive parents. Receipt of birth information, undergoing tracing, having contacted birth relatives can be a very emotive journey. Adoptive parents already have a relationship with these agencies and this will now be interrupted. That could be emotionally disturbing for them. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> There will be a cut in adoption services when demand is likely to increase. We have heard about the Tusla adoption service. There are questions about Tusla, and it is already overstretched and under-resourced. Tusla has not given assurances that future information and tracing services will be adequately resourced. It will be the sole provider of adoption information and tracing services with the loss of considerable expertise and this will lead to a longer waiting time. Information and tracing services will no longer be subject to regulation by the Adoption Authority of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> The required signing of the undertaking not to contact the parent was discussed on Committee Stage, as the Minister knows. The requirement to sign a declaration was first introduced by the then Minister, James Reilly, in 2015. It was roundly criticised by 1,400 members of the Adoption Rights Alliance and by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children. It said that it could find no convincing reason for the inclusion of a statutory declaration in the Bill. Here we have authoratitive voices saying there is no reason for such an inclusion. In any case, birth certificates are already public records. This is the only group of people which is required to sign such a declaration. People from the diaspora looking to find their genealogical background do not have to sign a declaration saying they will not contact anyone.</p>

          <p eId="para_451">I will make one final point. The advice of Dr. O'Mahony was already briefly referred to by Senator Bacik. His evidence to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in 2015 was that it would be constitutionally sound for the Oireachtas to legislate to provide all adult adoptive persons unfettered access. That is the judgment of a senior counsel with a track record in this area. The reliance on the IO'T <i>v</i>. B judgment is only partially effective because they were individuals who had not been formally adopted anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> I compliment the Minister on introducing this legislation. I am grateful that she has indicated that she is considering amendments and look forward to the passage of a much improved Bill.</p>

          <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Katherine Zappone)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">I thank the Senator for staying this long.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> I will only say a few things now as we will have a lot of time to cover this ground in the following Stages. It is great that we are completing the Stage now. That is wonderful and I thank the Senators for staying along with me to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> As I began my remarks by saying I have a sense of urgency in regard to this legislation, I would like to move it as quickly as possible through the Seanad. As all of the Senators spoke, from Senator Daly to Senator Norris and everyone in between, it struck me that it will take a lot of work and great determination on all our parts in order to move it through as quickly as possible. There are a lot of issues regarding the Bill even as it stands and I acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> I thank all the Senators for welcoming the Bill and the work that went on to bring it to this point. Over the last number of years, and particularly the last year or year and a half, the officials in my Department have worked non-stop on this Bill, listening to the different concerns and putting it together, working with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. It has been a huge undertaking. It has been very complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Up to this point, the officials have tried to be as open as possible in order to take on board the comments and constructive criticisms. In light of the Senators' comments, I am struck that we still have a distance to go. I am committed to do that as quickly as possible. We might have some meetings with Senators before we get to Committee Stage but I ask for co-operation to put together a pragmatic, idealistic, human rights approach towards bringing this Bill to conclusion. Many of the Members in the Seanad may operate that way but we must do our very best to get the best for people who are adopted. I am committed to that. I do not see this as a solo run on my part or on the part of the Department in any way. I hope and believe that we can achieve this through cross-party and Independents working together. I promise to do all that is possible to move this through the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> I know many Senators welcomed generally that we have come to this point. Some are more positive than others about the way the Bill is structured, its outline and components, and I appreciate that. I heard some deep concerns about compelling reasons, even in sharing the speech here, going through the different types of people who can offer compelling reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">We have to do that piece of the Bill right, because there may be many people who can identify compelling reasons, or otherwise, depending on where we go in respect of that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Senators Warfield, Bacik and others in raising questions, especially around the human rights approach and the issue of trust in respect of adopted people. The Bill needs to reflect that we trust them. In order to do that, changes may need to materialise but we need to work hard to identify the most important changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Some Senators really challenged that the Bill as it stands might have a presumption in terms of privacy rights rather than identity rights. We acknowledge that it is still important to find a way to ensure acknowledgement and protection of privacy rights in addition to identity rights. Perhaps we have not achieved the proper balance yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> At the same time, there needs to be balance. Many Senators, including Senator Boyhan, raised the issue of Tusla and resources. Senators referenced money and social workers, etc. What I can say for now is that I have already raised that with the agency. Tusla has done considerable work already in terms of identifying what the agency needs and, in particular, the number of people needed in the agency, including social workers, among others. Within 2017 and 2018 I am committed to seeking the additional resources to do that. I have asked Tusla to undertake business case scenarios in the context of reducing the waiting lists and the time it takes to get information. This is relevant in the context of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill as well as in the context of the issues that have emerged with mother and baby homes. People want to have information and need to be able to trace it. Tusla will play a key role in this regard. We are aware of the need to prepare for this. Indeed, preparation has already begun.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I appreciate the comments welcoming the amendments relating to placing information in the National Archives. The points at issue include the provision, protection and preservation of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I am keen to reflect on all the comments and issues raised. I trust it is the hope and intention of everyone that the Bill reflects that we have moved into a new era and culture whereby we respect the separation of church and State. I have spoken on this question in the context of the Tuam issue. I was struck by the comments of Senator Bacik and how she coupled that issue with the question of trust and adopted people. That may be another manifestation. We have an opportunity with this Bill to provide another manifestation of or example that we are in that era.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Having said all those words, it may sound as if it is an easy task but I am aware that it is not. I appeal to Senators for their co-operation and for them to work with me. I expect that we will be able to achieve more than what we have now. It will involve some compromise but I hope we can get to a place where we are all happy.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I welcome the opportunity for statements on the second interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters. I welcome all our guests in the Chamber. Following a short first interim report last July, the commission submitted its second interim report to me in September 2016. This second report focuses on a number of issues which had come to its attention during its analysis of information and evidence collected up to August 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> I am conscious that it took some time before I was in a position to publish the latest report. As I outlined when I published the report on 11 April, the commission's recommendations gave rise to a number of very important financial and legal questions which the Government needed to consider prior to publication. This took some time because I wanted to look at every possible option in conjunction with my Government colleagues. I have acknowledged that the process was more complex and took longer than I initially anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Senators will be aware that the commission was established in 2015 to examine the experiences of vulnerable women and children in mother and baby homes over the period 1922 to 1998. It is due to report in February 2018. We are now more than two years into its three-year programme of work. This work by the commission is a vital step on the path we have commenced to establish the facts of what happened in and around these homes, and to give true meaning to the values we say define us as a people and a country.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The commission continues to make progress and I restate the Government's continued support for this important work. I record my thanks to Judge Yvonne Murphy, Dr. William Duncan and Professor Mary Daly for their valuable contribution and commitment to the public interest in this sensitive work. Furthermore, it is also now over two months since the commission confirmed the discovery of human remains at the site of the former home in Tuam, County Galway. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about that at that time. As this news and the contents of the interim report continue to be absorbed, I am mindful that there are many deeply personal issues which those directly affected by these issues understandably want Government to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I have visited the site in Tuam three times and met former residents and their families. I am acutely aware that many people are experiencing a great deal of anxiety and anticipation of what might happen next on these issues. I will first focus on the report itself and then take some time to update Members on a number of developments which I am progressing with Government colleagues to ensure we respond as effectively and as sensitively as possible to these developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> Much of the focus of the second interim report is on children who were unaccompanied by their mothers in mother and baby homes and county homes. The commission in its report suggests that where children were resident in mother and baby homes and in county homes without their mothers and these children were excluded from the residential institutions redress scheme, established in 2002 and which has since closed, or a similar such scheme, this should be re-examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The commission has stated that it is satisfied that the institutions it is investigating are, in the commission's words, "unquestionably" the main such homes that existed during the 20th century and does not currently recommend that other institutions be investigated. It does not recommend any changes to its terms of reference at this time but may recommend further investigations when its current investigation is completed. The commission considers that it would not be in the public interest to conduct further investigations into institutions which have already been the subject of investigation or where a State apology has been given and redress provided. It does not make findings that abuse occurred in these institutions but notes that its investigations are not yet complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> The commission recognises that people whose births were falsely registered have a need to establish their identity, but it also recognises that the false registration of births is a very difficult issue to investigate because of a lack of accurate records. For this reason, the commission suggests that an amnesty from prosecution may help to encourage those responsible to come forward and correct the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The Government carefully examined the commission's recommendation regarding redress and concluded that it was not possible to implement it. In reaching this conclusion the Government was conscious that the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect, and the Government also believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the question of redress in advance of any conclusions by the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> The challenges for Government in considering the recommendations of the commission at this interim stage of its work were further highlighted by the recently completed special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the residential institutions redress scheme. Due regard was given to the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General in finalising the Government's view on the recommendation. I understand the distress that this decision has caused some former residents. The commission's final report is due in February 2018, at which time the State's response to its conclusions on this issue and all matters regarding the treatment of former residents will be studied very carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> It must be acknowledged that previous redress schemes have been complex to administer and often difficult for applicants, but the future State response will be a matter for public debate when the commission completes its work. Although former residents have expressed some concerns about the specific amnesty proposal from the commission, I have committed to exploring further the legal and practical implications of such an approach with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> As I announced when I published the report, my immediate focus is on assisting those who were unaccompanied as children in mother and baby homes and county homes, with a view to offering health and well-being supports and services that will be of genuine and practical value to them now. I am making arrangements for a facilitated consultation process with former residents who were unaccompanied in these institutions regarding the nature and type of services and supports in the area of health and well-being that they consider would be helpful to them at this stage. I want to consult, listen and learn, and I will be making further announcements about this process shortly. I then expect to bring proposals to Government before the summer break in order that we can have appropriate supports in place as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> In responding to the increased demand for access to relevant information, I have asked Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to enhance its capacity for the provision of information to assist former residents who may wish to establish when they resided in a mother and baby home. My Department is working with Tusla to progress this matter as quickly as possible in tandem with our ongoing legislative reform to facilitate access to adoption records as provided for in the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill 2016, the Second Stage of which we have just completed here this afternoon.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> While the report states that the commission is not seeking an extension to its current remit, I have indicated that I want to conduct a scoping review to consider if broader terms of reference would help answer some of the questions which have been raised again in public debate. In this context it is useful to remind ourselves that the commission was established in response to public concerns about a specific type of institution, namely, mother and baby homes. The commission was established to address the specific concerns relating to the welfare of women and children during their time in such institutions and the arrangements for their subsequent exit or placement from homes. Many of the additional issues raised again recently were examined when the commission was being established. While I am open to examining the calls for an extension, it is essential that we do so with a full understanding of the considerable breadth and scope of its current terms of reference. They include mechanisms in order that any additional matters which the commission may deem to warrant investigation can be brought to the attention of Government, its work of listening to victims and survivors in a safe and supported context, as well as the ambitious scale of its fact-finding work.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The commission has significant autonomy to follow where the investigation takes it. This is important as the commission is examining records to which the State, or any other parties, would not have had access to previously. In responding to the call for all adoptions to be investigated, the commission noted that this would represent a vast undertaking and indicated that completing its analysis of adoption practices relating to mother and baby homes may facilitate the making of a recommendation on this question at a later point. In its report the commission commits to including relevant information on other institutions which have come to its attention in its social history report which will form a key part of its final report. At this future point, the report states that it may also be in a position to comment on the need for any further investigations in respect of these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> While the independent statutory investigation progresses its work, I have highlighted the need to look beyond the important legal questions surrounding mother and baby homes by developing complementary holistic approaches to grasp the truth of what happened in our country. I have asked Dr. James Gallen of the school of law and government, Dublin City University, to assist by mapping out a model of transitional justice which can further assist to publicly acknowledge the experiences of former residents and further enhance public awareness and understanding of this part of our history. Dr. Gallen is currently preparing a framework document which will be submitted to my Department in the coming weeks. </p>
          <p eId="para_527"> Since the commission announced the discovery of human remains at the location at Tuam, I have been working with Government colleagues to establish an inclusive process of engagement with former residents, their families and other stakeholders with a view to building a consensus on how the sensitive issues which arise can be addressed. In particular I want to acknowledge my helpful engagements with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> It is essential that this process respects the memory and the dignity of the deceased children who lived their short lives in this home. Galway County Council is the owner of the site and it will have a central role in progressing matters. I also understand that the council has been liaising directly with the commission and has written to the coroner around these matters. As part of these discussions, I advised the Cabinet yesterday of my intention to secure specialist expertise to provide technical advice and assistance. I believe decisions on the approach to be adopted would benefit greatly from expert technical guidance on international best practices in this highly specialised area. </p>
          <p eId="para_529"> I am anxious that decisions on the future of the site in Tuam are progressed as a matter of urgency and I hope to revert to the Government very shortly with proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> I thank the Seanad for the opportunity today to further address these issues and I look forward to the contribution of Senators.</p>

        <speech by="#JenniferMurnaneOConnor" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Senator Jennifer Murnane O'Connor<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_531">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive report. We in Fianna Fáil recognise the vital importance of the commission in delivering justice and accountability for all those affected by mother and baby homes. It is important that we focus on the mothers and babies. These mothers and babies must come first and they must have our sole focus. We recognise the considerable harm that has been experienced by survivors of the mother and baby homes and similar institutions in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> There was absolute shock and horror about the 796 babies buried in the mother and baby home in Tuam. It is incomprehensible. The babies were aged between 35 weeks and three years. Some were buried in graves, but most were in septic tanks. It is hard to even say the words. These children died of whooping cough, bronchitis, pneumonia and malnutrition. Mothers and babies were separated at birth, torn apart from one another. Some were adopted and sent to America for hopefully a better life. These babies, mothers and families need an ongoing commission of investigation into the mother and baby home. It has to be completed and I am glad to hear that the report will be back before us in the summer and will be finalised in February 2018. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> These women, siblings and families need to know what happened and where exactly their babies are. This is crucial. The views and experiences of all survivors of mother and baby homes will have to be listened to, respected and acknowledged, and from the Minister's report we now know that that is happening. We need to bring healing and reconciliation to survivors, community and the broader public communities and the State. We must ensure that the stories and experiences of these women and children are not forgotten and that their memory is honoured in a most respectful way. It should be an aim of the commission that these women and babies are never forgotten. Before we can move forward as a nation we must turn to the past and recognise its implications for today. </p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I noticed a press release that the Minister sent out on 3 March concerning Tuam and the human remains on the site. When the Minister was last here we had a survivor here from Tuam. Galway County Council was looking to have what it wanted to call a burial chamber at the site and preserve the site as a peace garden. Some of the survivors have had concerns about this. The Minister has been in Tuam and has made several calls. Does she feel that she is getting proper co-operation from Galway County Council? What is the feedback from the coroner on this report? Some of the survivors have concerns about this. This is a massive issue for them, and I am sure the Minister will listen. </p>
          <p eId="para_535"> On the Minister's most recent visit the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, was with her and they met with survivors. What were the survivors' requests? This is about the survivors, the people that we need to make sure we listen to. </p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I read another press release concerning the Bethany Homes survivors. Originally they were very disappointed that a commission had been set up. I ask the Minister that these survivors are listened to and that every concern they have is addressed. This is about people working together to try and solve an issue which is heart-wrenching for the survivors. I am sure that every day they get up they have to think of what happened to those babies. I am asking that this commission works with the survivors of the Bethany Homes, the Tuam mother and baby home and any other organisations that have been affected by this. We need to get a proper outcome so that these families and children are never forgotten.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#VictorBoyhan" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Senator Victor Boyhan<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_537">It is very timely that we are having these discussions back to back today. When we look at the mother and baby commission of investigation and consider what the Minister has said to us in her report I find it very disappointing. It will be another two years before this work is completed. I note that these are institutions and not homes. Somebody said to me recently that they did not live in a home but rather an institution. She told me a horror story. There is the mother and baby home in Tuam which has been much publicised, and horrific things happened there. I will be talking about that in a few minutes. There were also so many other institutions that people never heard about. The records were destroyed. The people did not have the education, well-being, confidence or the emotional state to go out and tell their stories. It is not easy to tell one's story.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I acknowledge the people who are in the Gallery today. I have met many of them. I have shed many a tear with them. It has gone on for years. We are meeting the same people and we are talking to the same people. I do not doubt the Minister's personal commitment but I note that she is an Independent member who is in the Government. That carries its own dynamic. She must look at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> The Residential Institutions Redress Act was established in which former Ministers indemnified many State agencies from horrific crimes on the basis that there would be a redress scheme. They defined abuse as sexual abuse, emotional abuse and physical abuse. In crude terms it was based on the Canadian system with which the Minister is familiar. They brought people over and they told their story and they got their hour or two. Someone then gave them a certain amount of points for each of these categories and then the survivors of the abuse received some form of compensation. It was a contribution really. In many cases the lawyers got more money than the victims in these institutions. That is a crime in itself. People were left exposed. They were thrown out of the redress board hearings broken. A woman told me of her experiences, where she got the bus back to Dún Laoghaire and had to then get back to Anglesey and back up to London. She got a miserable €7,000 for her heartache and pain and 16 years of hell in an institution in Dublin. They are facts, and the Minister knows many of the stories.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">It is important to look at redress in a holistic way as it is not about money. It is about how the State can make a very early intervention to assist people to get on with their lives through social housing, medical cards and independent counselling of their choice. It should not be Tusla, the HSE or institutional counsellors but those in whom people have confidence and with whom they can build relationships. They also need help with legal support because this is an ongoing need. There is a journey of healing, there is much deep pain and people need assistance in all these ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> In <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning there is a piece attributed to the Minister about bringing in expert advice and support relating to the Tuam babies issue and I would be grateful if she would share a bit of information about this. Significant quantities of human remains were discovered. A total of 17 out of 20 chambers on the site had something like septic tank structures and the age of death was between 35 foetal weeks and two or three years old. What is the role of the coroner in Galway and how will this role interplay with this?</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> I pay tribute to Catherine Corless, who has met the Minister, after which she gave an interview to RTE. She was asked about how she got on with the Minister and she said she had related to her what the survivors wanted. They wanted their families "out of that place". She said it was a tank and sewage area and that their main concern was to give relatives, brothers and sisters, the decent burial which was not given to them in the first place. She wrapped up by saying that many of them want DNA as well, to find out whether they have their own little brother or sister. That is a very human call and it is right that they be assisted and supported in that. She said her message was that this needed to be expedited with urgency as these were time-sensitive issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Many people were excluded from the original redress scheme because the then Government argued that it was difficult to define what was "institutional". Some people denied they ran an institution and refused to co-operate on the grounds that they were technically a school, or some other place rather than a mother and baby home. It was a scandal that the Government entered into the scheme in the first place, despite the advice of the Attorney General. There was a lot of splitting hairs about what constituted an institution and whether an institution was in receipt of State support or was State funded, leading to questions whether the State was culpable, but the State has a duty of care to all its children.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I have very serious concerns about granting an amnesty to anybody who perpetrated crimes and abuse against children in the State and I hope no Minister for Children and Youth Affairs makes the case for an amnesty in Cabinet. There can be no amnesty for any living abuser of children. There must be zero tolerance as it is too important and sensitive and people have lived with the pain for too long. We cannot heap more trouble and emotional issues onto them.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The Minister spoke of the importance of learning from international best practice and I know she is driven by the search for solutions. She spoke about transitional justice, which means finding out and recording the truth, ensuring accountability, making reparation, undertaking institutional reform and learning from the facts to achieve reconciliation. The word "reconciliation" does not quite sit with what I previously said about amnesty. There can be reconciliation but people cannot be exonerated and they must be held accountable. I hope the Minister takes on board these points as they are important. She has said she will carry out a further scoping exercise of other institutions, and I welcome that, but there are many institutions which have never been given the opportunity to tell their story. Nobody has addressed their needs but they are also very important. Let there be no amnesty for child abusers in this State, whether it is for historic abuse or abuse now or in the future.</p>

          <from>Senator Catherine Noone<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_546">The focus in this report is on children who were unaccompanied by their mothers in mother and baby homes and county homes. As such, it is an issue that must be treated as sensitively as possible. As Senator Murnane O'Connor said, the people involved deserve respect and dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The commission was originally set up to inquire into the conditions in mother and baby homes and county homes in the period between 1922 and 1998. Following a short first interim report last July, the commission submitted a second interim report in September 2016. This deals with a number of issues that had come to its attention during its work and analysis based on information collected up to August 2016. The commission is currently examining the experiences of women and children who lived in mother and baby homes over the period 1922 to 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> In its interim report, submitted last September, the commission suggests that the exclusion of children who were resident in mother and baby homes and in county homes without their mothers from the residential institutions redress scheme, which has since closed, should be re-examined, and I welcome this. It is satisfied that the institutions it is investigating are unquestionably the main such homes that existed during the 20th century, and it does not currently recommend that other institutions be investigated. It is not recommending any changes to its terms of reference at this time but may recommend doing so in the future. It does not make findings to date that abuse occurred in these institutions but notes that its work is not yet complete. It recognises that people whose births were falsely registered have a need to establish their identity but recognises that the false registration of births is a very difficult issue to investigate because of a lack of accurate records.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> The Government has carefully examined the commission's recommendation regarding redress, and has concluded that it is not possible to implement it at this time. It is my understanding that the Government is conscious that the commission has made no findings to date regarding abuse or neglect, and believes it would not be appropriate to deal with the question of redress in advance of any conclusions on this issue by the commission. Moreover, it is my understanding that the redress scheme was complex to administer and often difficult for applicants. Senator Boyhan referred to this and I hope it will be rectified in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> It also has to be acknowledged that previous redress schemes have been extremely costly. As a society, we will need to make major decisions about what we spend our money on in the future. It may be that targeted supports would make more sense than redress schemes. It is my understanding that the Minister consulted in great detail with the Taoiseach, the Attorney General and other Ministers before this conclusion was reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> It is also important to note that the Government waited for the special report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the residential institutions redress scheme before reaching a final conclusion on whether the original scheme should be re-opened to cover unaccompanied children who had been in mother and baby homes and county homes. The focus should now be on assisting those who were unaccompanied as children in mother and baby homes and county homes with a view to offering supports that will be of sincere and practical value to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> I am encouraged that the Minister has committed to consulting former residents who were unaccompanied in these institutions regarding the nature and type of services and supports in the area of health and well-being that would be helpful to them at this stage. It is my hope that this consultation will be completed as soon as feasible, ideally before the summer break, which would enable appropriate supports to be in place as quickly as is possible. I am further encouraged that the Minister has enlisted the expertise of Dr. James Gallen of the school of law and government in Dublin City University to assist by mapping out a model of transitional justice as a means of giving voice to former residents of mother and baby homes and county homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">It is my understanding that the Minister will also carry out a scoping review, to which Senator Boyhan has made reference, of the commission's existing terms of reference to ascertain whether amending the terms of reference would enhance its existing work. Undisputedly, the commission's final report will be of fundamental importance to understanding the experiences of those who stayed in institutions of this kind. As such, it is imperative to allow it space to conclude its work and report its findings. In the meantime, I am very much encouraged that the Minister has committed to take whatever action she can to address the issues already raised. I commend her on her work and compassion to date on the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">I welcome the Minister back to the House. It is important that she allows for oral collation of the history. We should have it in our archives and the National Library for our children and theirs to remember. It is important that we do not ever forget.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> As Senator Boyhan has said, records were destroyed. There also exist records that were sidelined. Numerous papers were never filed or archived. There are documents lying haphazardly in various heaps in rooms - files containing the sensitive personal details of 1,000 women and their babies, thought to number about 1,500. There have been fraudulent birth and death certificates, illegal adoptions and trafficking of women.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> Sheila, Tony, David and Karl in the Visitors Gallery have spent a lifetime asking for the truth. I have only spent a few months trying to help them. They are here in Leinster House again. They have had no meeting with the Minister, although she is committed to survivor-led investigation and having survivors' voices heard. As they continue to be voiceless, I am tasked with putting their voices on the record of this House today. The Minister promised to see them and to report back before the summer recess. Given the time that is left, it seems her promise will not be fulfilled.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I want to give the Minister a timeline in respect of the records - the 1,000 names that have never come to light - that have been given to me by Sheila, David, Karl, Tony and others. We will go back to October 2012. Two internal memos and a briefing document from Dr. Declan McKeown of the HSE were sent to then assistant director of HS health intelligence, Dr. Davida De La Harpe, and the assistant national director of HSE child and family services, Mr. Phil Garland. They stated that a large number of files containing over 1,000 names-----</p>

          <p eId="para_563">It was stated that more than 1,000 names relating to Tuam and Bessborough homes had been found and that these files contained evidence of financial fraud, horrific levels of infant mortality, falsification of birth certificates and illegal adoptions. I will quote from an email that was forwarded to the people in the Visitors Gallery in October 2012. This was the beginning of it. It was from Declan McKeown - I have already said his name, so I ask the Acting Chairman to bear with me. He said he was writing as a matter of urgency and asked how they can disregard all these files. He stated the documents are falsified, there are records there, that it needed to be acted on with urgency and swiftly. He was calling for an investigation at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> These documents were then brought to the attention of Dr. Philip Crowley and Mr. Tony O'Brien, chief managers of the HSE. </p>

          <p eId="para_566">What happened to them then? This was in 2012 and we had complete silence and nothing was heard. The next time the documents reared their heads, it seems, was in 2014 when the interdepartmental group report on mother and baby homes was published. However, the 1,000 files were not included in that particular report. Instead, according to correspondence from the HSE, the files were handed over to Tusla. Once again, they disappeared into the ether. Is the Minister following all this? I have found it extremely complicated to understand and I have been guided by the people in the Visitors Gallery. They are making representations on behalf of the hundreds of mothers and children who are survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> On 29 July 2015, gardaí from Tuam met with Tusla and conducted inquires as regards the existence of this box of files. They stated in correspondence they were satisfied the survivors - whose names are redacted - are not mentioned in any such files, which confirms the existence of such files and confirms the Garda was aware of them in 2015. Tusla has confirmed that it still has custody of these files, as is confirmed by correspondence dated April 2016. In reply to correspondence from a survivor in April 2016, the Garda superintendent from Tuam, whom I will not name in deference to the Acting Chairman, stated An Garda Síochána at Tuam had not instigated a criminal investigation into this matter, namely, the HSE internal memo from 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> In May 2016, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, was informed of these files by letter from a survivors' group. In August 2016, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald stated that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs had not been made aware of these files. In September 2016, a survivor made a complaint about them to Tuam Garda station. That month, the superintendent from Tuam stated that he was not aware of any criminal investigation into the HSE internal memo.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> In October 2016, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, stated that she would forward information to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. It is in the Minister, Deputy Zappone's office now and has been for some time. The Garda Commissioner is also aware of it and was to conduct an investigation but nothing has happened. How can we have something from 2012, when the Devil and all knew about it? Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, Senator James Reilly, Deputy Katherine Zappone, the Garda Commissioner - they all knew about these files of 1,000 women and their babies yet nothing was done about it. When the HSE said it would do its own investigation, nobody thought to go back and ask the HSE where that investigation was.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> This country has failed those women and children along with many others. Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, Senator James Reilly, Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan, and the Minister, Deputy Zappone, are failing them. It has been a consistent pattern for years that nobody wanted to know. It has been, at best, concealment of documentation from the very outset. There has been a State cover-up of every step of the litany of abuse, neglect and cruelty wrought on these women and children. I do not know what else is in these files but I will forward them to the Minister again. I do not have the forensic knowledge and capability to examine them in detail. Nor is it Tony, David, Sheila or Karl's job to do so. They have done their part.</p>

We cannot mismanage this again but it is exactly what we are doing. I think it is more than mismanagement. It is a deliberate concealment of the historic files of 1,000 women and perhaps 1,500 babies. It distresses me and I am sure it distresses the people in the Visitors Gallery, who have been here time and again and have asked for redress and understanding. They have asked for a truth commission and an expansion of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation into the mother and baby homes. How can we have that when we do not even have those files and are ignoring them? They were pushed under the carpet again but they are out now. They are resting in the Minister, Deputy Zappone's Department and with An Garda Síochána.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I thank the Minister for coming to the House. On one of her previous appearances in the Seanad, we discussed the issue of a former home in Tuam. I welcome her acknowledgement that the information that emerged in the Tuam case was not a surprise and the issues were known. It is, therefore, somewhat disappointing that the Government, including the Minister in her statement, is rowing back in respect of this issue. I refer specifically to the statement from the Government that there have been no findings of abuse or neglect. It adds insult to injury to hear that, based on an interim report, decisions will be taken on the basis that there is a blank slate and there have been no findings of abuse and neglect. Abuse and neglect are evident in every file and record we care to read and in every place in the ground we have been asked to look. If we do not know that abuse or neglect took place, for what did the Taoiseach apologise to the survivors of Magdalen laundries? We know there has been abuse and neglect. The task of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes is to determine the extent, depth and various awful iterations of that abuse and neglect and offer guidance on how to move forward. We must begin from a position of acknowledgement and honesty, which I appreciate is one the Minister took in the past. I urge everyone to move forward in that same spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> In the limited time available, I will speak about some of the key recommendations of the interim report and the response to them. The report suggests some children were excluded from the remit of the previous residential institutions redress scheme and the re-opening of the scheme or introduction of a similar scheme should be examined. It is extraordinarily disturbing that the Government has suggested pre-emptively that it will mot be possible to implement this recommendation. I acknowledge the Minister's statement that the issue needs to be revisited when the final report has been produced. However, the message emerging on how we value or do not value the concerns regarding redress is completely unacceptable and must be examined. When arguments of cost are brought into the discussion, we must be clear that redress is non-negotiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> Not only will it be necessary to establish another scheme but it also may be beneficial to do so because we must ask whether the indemnity agreement signed in 2002 would apply to a new scheme or applies only to the original scheme. What are all the provisions of the original indemnity deal and what constitutional challenge could be taken to it? What examination is taking place? It is extraordinary that we would write off not only the lack of contribution to the redress scheme but also the failure to re-examine the issue of indemnity in light of the considerable new and different evidence that has come to light in areas such as forced work, vaccinations and forced adoption. These issues were not on the table when the deal was originally and wrongly signed and must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> We give tax breaks to corporations and provide major tax reliefs for private pensions. We are making many decisions on the budget. We must budget on the assumption that the State will contribute to redress. What is the Minister's position on the need to re-examine the redress funds?</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> The issues we are discussing are not crimes of the past because the moneys made and paid by the State to the institutions are still in play. The Bon Secours order has a hospital programme and has established modern and complex company structures, as we saw recently in respect of maternity services. The profits and benefits that accrued during the period of exploitation are still in circulation and must be examined. For this reason, there cannot be an amnesty at this point given that we are emerging from a period of ongoing obstruction of information and justice and when the acts in question, even if culturally sanctioned, were criminal under the Constitution and in law, even at the time they were committed. We must ensure that regardless of the cultural sanctions that applied at the time, crimes committed in the 1960s or 1970s which led in many cases to death and long-term damage remain crimes and must be investigated. Many of those who engage with the commission of inquiry want to be clear that in engaging with the commission they are not compromising the possibility of criminal investigation into what were in many cases criminal acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> When we consider indemnity, a similar question mark arises in respect of amnesty. In terms of transitional justice, while I have sympathy with the view that we should seek to do this work, I suggest that we have not yet reached that point because we are facing extraordinary obstacles in terms of willing participation in the redress scheme and willing sharing of records by many of the major actors. Transitional justice cannot be between society and the perpetrators of the abuses. We cannot in any sense bypass survivors whose voices must not be used to promote a healing process for society. One of the most extraordinary experiences I observed in my time in the United States was a healing and reconciliation process which took place between those who protested against the Vietnamese war and those who fought in that war. Extraordinarily, the Vietnamese people were missing from the process. If we have transitional justice, it must not be associated with an amnesty and the voices and experiences of survivors must be at front and centre stage. </p>
          <p eId="para_583"> I urge the Minister to meet representatives of the Irish First Mothers group. Many people who have been hurt are entitled to be angry and frustrated. The Minister referred to meeting unaccompanied persons in the institutions. The voices of the mothers of the children who spent time in these institutions have not been adequately heard. I am conscious that I will not have time to share the words of survivors but I hope I will have another opportunity to do so. There were 472 deaths in the Bessborough Home in 19 years. People who spent time in the homes speak about crying every night, being tracked down when they escaped and forced to sign adoption papers and-----</p>

          <p eId="para_585">My final point is a technical concern related to the future operation of the commission of inquiry.

People are unclear about which of these committees they have been engaging with.

          <p eId="para_589">The scale of the undertaking by the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes is truly staggering but the work is absolutely necessary. We simply must get to the truth by investigating the concerns relating to what appears to be deficiency of care of unmarried mothers and their babies in some of these homes from 1922 to 1998. Over this 76 year period, it is believed that at least 35,000 unmarried mothers spent time in homes run by religious orders in Ireland. At part of its remit, the commission is investigating 14 mother and baby homes and four so-called county homes that operated throughout the State at different times between 1922 and 1998. The terms of reference of the commission are broad and examine a range of things, including living conditions, infant mortality, burial arrangements, illegal adoptions and women's pathways in and out of these institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> Many issues relating to these homes are disturbing, none more than the issue of infant mortality. It is known that almost 800 infants died at Tuam in Galway and that a site in Castlepollard in County Westmeath is believed to hold the remains of up to 3,200 babies.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> The concerns about these mother and baby homes initially came to the attention of the public following reports of possible mass graves in the grounds of the former mother and baby home in Tuam. To our horror, the commission of investigation confirmed earlier this year that significant quantities of human remains were discovered buried on the site of a former home run by the Sisters of Bon Secours in Tuam. The children were aged from 35 foetal weeks to between two and three years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> Despite the revulsion we all feel, we must continue the search for answers for all those affected. In that regard I welcome the news today of the Government commitment to seek expert technical advice in respect of the possible identification of the remains of these children.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I look at my own six-month old daughter, Francesca, and I shudder at all these terrible revelations. I find all of this depressing and distressing. Equally, I am encouraged by the good work of the commission tasked with providing answers to what was a dark episode.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> I take this opportunity to commend Catherine Corless who exposed the mass baby grave in Tuam. Without her perseverance we may not have had this commission at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> The second interim report of the commission was published last week. The commission noted the exclusion of children who were resident in mother and baby homes without their mothers from the residential institutions redress scheme established in 2002 and has suggested that scheme should be re-examined. This is part of a number of key items in the interim report. I understand the Minister will consult all those affected with the intention of bringing proposals to Government before the summer break.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> We know the commission has much work to do to establish how some of these homes failed young mothers and their children. Whatever happened in some of these homes, the commission of investigation is shining a light into some of the darker corners of institutional care. We must never forget what the mothers and children who are deceased and the survivors went through. In this regard the commission's work will at least pay respect to those who suffered in so-called places of care.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> Nelson Mandela once said that there can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way it treats its children. I wish the commission of investigation the best in its work. Whatever its final conclusions, the commission is already doing good work in exposing a dark aspect of Ireland that must never be repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> I spoke in the debate on the Ryan report in the Dáil many years ago. We grew up in our lives blaming everyone else but ourselves. We have no one to blame but ourselves in this society. I am referring not just to politicians, those in education, the Catholic Church, doctors and so on. We cannot blame the Germans or the British for this. We have ourselves to blame. We need to ensure we shine a light in the darker corners of a disturbing past. I wish the Minister all the best in her endeavours.</p>

          <p eId="para_599">I welcome the Minister back to the Chamber. I welcome those present in the Gallery for this important debate. I acknowledge that the issues we are debating relating to the second interim report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes are closely related to the issues we debated earlier on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill. Both relate to Ireland's shameful history of treatment of women and children. Both relate to our history of confinement and concealment of births outside of marriage. Both relate to the appalling stigma that the State allowed to encapsulate or enshroud women and children for so many decades of our history, right up to the recent past in the 1990s. It is important to have the two debates together.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> I acknowledge the work of the local historian, Catherine Corless, whose painstaking work in unearthing the horrific reality of the Tuam mother and baby home gave rise to the establishment of the commission in 2015. Her work in taking out the death certificates of each of the 796 children who had died at the Tuam mother and baby home gave rise to the commission and to such immense public outcry about the scandal of Tuam.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> The three-person commission is chaired by Judge Yvonne Murphy and includes Professor Mary Daly and Dr. William Duncan. I pay tribute to their immense work and expertise. I know Dr. William Duncan personally. He taught me family law and he has taught many generations of students at Trinity. He has unparalleled expertise on family and adoption law. Indeed, I quoted him earlier during the debate on the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill. Professor Mary Daly's historical expertise is singularly important. Judge Yvonne Murphy had done a great deal of work previously on unearthing scandals around institutional abuse in Ireland. She has unparalleled expertise. The commission is doing valuable work.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I wish to deal with the recommendations in the interim report. First, I acknowledge the scope of the work undertaken within the current terms of reference. The terms of reference include the 14 so-called mother and baby homes as well the four county homes. I note Senator Boyhan's comment in this regard. The report refers to 70,000 women and more children having gone through those homes and institutions. It is a vast amount of work. The first interim report was produced in July 2016. At that point, more than 500 people had expressed an interest in engaging with the confidential committee. The commission hopes to engage in a comprehensive historical analysis covering the decades from 1922 to 1998. This is an enormous body of work that will do immense service to the State when we see the final report published in February 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> I wish to turn to the issues addressed in the second interim report. There are three discrete and contained issues. The first relates to children who were unaccompanied in these homes. The commissions says it understands a substantial number of children were resident in these institutions without their mothers. The commission is dealing with the exclusion of these children from the residential institutions redress scheme. The commission makes a compelling case for the inclusion of these children in the redress case. It makes the clear point that one of the institutions covered by the Act relating to the redress scheme, St. Patrick's on the Navan Road, is also under investigation by the commission as a mother and baby home. The commission maintains it is simply not logical to include St. Patrick's in the redress scheme but not other institutions under the scheme where they relate to unaccompanied children. The children who were resident in those homes without their mothers are clearly in the same position as the children who were included in the redress scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> The commission has referred back to the debates in the Dáil and Seanad at the time of the establishment of the redress scheme. It has made that point that the Minister said at the time that inclusion in the scheme did not imply that a complaint of abuse or a finding of abuse had been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> In the light of the clear and logical finding of the commission it was disappointing to see the Government decision to exclude these people from redress. These people are adults now and some are of advanced age. This must be revisited. Others have pointed this out as well. At the least, it must be revisited when the final report of the commission is made in 2018. As the commission has clearly said, inclusion in the redress scheme did not imply a complaint of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I am speaking on my experience and I acknowledge my experience in this matter as a barrister who has represented many survivors of abuse before the redress board and as someone who has been critical of many aspects of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">It is important to say that it does not necessarily have to be the same redress scheme. To exclude these survivors from a redress scheme seems illogical and, as the commission said, unjust. The Minister's speech and the Government's official response to the report in April and published online refer to the costs of previous redress schemes. The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out that the cost of the residential institutions redress scheme was €1.25 billion compared with the originally forecasted cost of €250 million. I have said, as has Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, that part of that cost must be laid at the doors of the religious orders and the Government of the day. In the dying days of the Government in 2002, the former Minister, Michael Woods, pushed the scheme through the Dail without, it seems, sufficient advice from the Attorney General. This enabled an indemnity scheme for the religious orders which should have been paying far more of the final costs of that scheme. Instead they saw an indemnity given to them by the State. That issue must be revisited by any redress scheme and it would have an implication in respect of cost to the State. Even if one is looking in practical terms at the costs to the State as a reason, one cannot simply refer back to the costs of previous redress schemes as a reason for excluding survivors from a redress scheme who should, logically and justly, be included. The commission makes a very clear case for that. All Members have spoken very strongly on the need to revisit this decision to exclude survivors from redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The recommendations are less conclusive on the other points made by the commission on including other institutions. On including other institutions within their own remit, the commission makes the point that while 160 institutions have been argued for inclusion, some have already been investigated by the Ryan report and others, but it says there are about 70 institutions that have not been under investigation or are not now by this commission. Many of these are private nursing homes. Currently, the commission does not make a strong case for including these in the remit. It does say, however, that there is a clear criterion that should be used for the inclusion of institutions such as these. The commission says "There is really only one question to be asked in respect of eligibility [for inclusion] - did a public body have a regulatory or inspection function in respect of that institution?" That is a hugely important recommendation by the commission. That is what should determine inclusion in State commissions of investigation and redress schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> It is also chilling to see the quote the commission gave from a 1927 State-run commission. The report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor referred to the existence to some of private maternity homes that were catering for women who had had children outside of marriage. The commission drew attention to different evils, particularly the connivance by the management of these homes in the secret disposal of children to unsuitable foster parents and the consequent high death rate among the children. We see this as a recent revelation-----</p>

          <p eId="para_611">-----when as far back as 1927 the State was on notice of the appalling treatment of women and children in homes such as these. Others have spoken on the other issues raised by the commission, including the false registration of births, the dreadful cases of illegal adoptions and the difficulties for many adults who are now trying to establish their right to an identity. Some people have condemned the idea of an amnesty. We should look carefully at that. A partial amnesty, for example, may be possible for birth mothers who, under duress, may have given false information. This makes sense to me and it might enable people to come forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> I will conclude with a quote from the writer Noelle Brown who was born in the Bessborough Mother and Baby Home and who is in the Gallery today. She said, "I want to feel equal to every other citizen in Ireland, and not remain a reminder of our terrible past." To do that we need to know more about it and uncover, expose and disclose the terrible pain and suffering that so many women and children were forced to endure at the hands of the State and religious orders for so many decades.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire arís. It is not long since we have had a debate on these issues in March. I asked quite a number of pertinent questions at that stage and I have seen answers to some of them but not all of them. I will pose quite a number of questions during my deliberations here, and if the Minister cannot address them in her full response, I ask that her officials would come back to me with answers on all the questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> There have been many platitudes about respect and compassion, but the overriding sense I get from many survivors is anger, especially anger at a lack of co-operation from what they see as the organs of the State. The particular line mentioned about the report not making findings that abuse occurred in these institutions has certainly sunk the credibility of the commission in the eyes of many people, especially the survivors who gave us evidence of their own stories of abuse that happened. There is also the fact we know there are corpses buried in Tuam and people are astounded that the commission made the comment about abuse. Its credibility has certainly come into question with many of the survivors.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I was very critical of Galway County Council, and I still am. Reference was made to Catherine Corless and the fantastic work she has done. Catherine Corless does not want pats on the back. She wants access to records. She has been at a meeting with the Minister and Galway County Council and she is looking for access to certain records. Catherine Corless was told she could not have access to those records because she was not an academic. We asked questions subsequently and we are now told that the records are with Tusla, which is under the Minister's remit. Has the Minister directed Tusla to make those records available to Catherine Corless and, if not, will the Minister do so? Ms Corless wants to continue her deliberations and everyone is praising her good work, so let us let her get on with that work.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> There are many questions to be answered about the Government's role and by Ministers in this regard. There was a Cabinet meeting yesterday, and I also queried this in March. We have questions about who put the women into the homes and who was aware of what was going on at the time. There are records of money transactions between local authorities, the homes and different organisations. People signed off on birth certificates, death certificates and baptismal certificates. People in the establishment at the time were aware of what was going on. There must be files in the Department of Health, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment<b>
						</b>that relate to these issues. Did the Minister ask her Cabinet colleagues yesterday to come clean and do a clear audit of their own files to bring forward to her any information relating to any of these issues in order that she can see the information and make it available publicly? If she has not done this then perhaps she could explain why not. It needs to be done because people knew what was going on. There are many who believe that what is happening again with this commission is the State closing ranks to protect the State and protect the establishment. People also believe that political dynasties locally in Galway were very much in cahoots with the authorities there, be they local politicians, doctors, gardaí or people within the establishment, and they have a vested interest in making sure all the information does not come out. This also needs to be questioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> In March, I also asked about passports being issued for children who were trafficked abroad. If passports were issued, will the Minister ask the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to check its records of who authorised and issued the passports? If the passports were not issued, was there any correspondence at the time as to how children were allowed to be trafficked out of the State without a valid passport? I want to know what the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the time was doing and what its officials knew about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, attended the meeting with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, Catherine Corless and Galway County Council. What did his Department know about the files relating to Tuam, about planning permissions, extensions to the buildings, the building of a playground, the building of car parks and the burial grounds? What information is in the Department Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government's files on all these issues? If it is being kept quiet, why is it being kept quiet?</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> In March, I also raised the issue of a number of other sites in Galway about which people have questions. I noted there is a building called St. Anne's on Taylor's Hill. Has this site come to the Minister's attention and has she raised it with Galway County Council at the meeting? If not, will she do this? I am also told there is a burial site at Prospect Hill at County Hall. Questions are being raised about how many bodies are buried at that site. I understand there are children buried there and we need to find out a little more about that. People are also asking about the industrial school in Letterfrack and if there are issues about the burial grounds there. I ask the Minister to ask Galway County Council about these issues, if she has not already done so. Let us get to the truth of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> There are court cases ongoing on access to files. I have sat in on court cases where Tusla has fought tooth and nail to prevent people getting access to their siblings' records which are held with Tusla. Will the Minister direct Tusla to make the files available to those people instead of dragging them through the courts repeatedly?</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> My colleague in the Dáil, Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, has asked when the exhumations may take place. Does An Garda Síochána have an active role in the progression of those exhumations? If not, why not? What discussions are taking place between the Minister's Department and the Garda in Galway? What discussions are taking place with the coroner's service?</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I also asked the Minister in March whether extra resources would be made available to the coroner's office and if forensic archaeologists would be employed to carry out the exhumations so that criminal proceedings could be taken and that any evidence in the graves would be treated properly and would be usable in the event of criminal prosecutions being taken. We need action. The people in the Gallery, whom we welcome, need action. Compassion is not enough. Sympathy is not enough. We have a duty as politicians and Ministers to deliver. I call on the Minister to do that and I will support her in that regard.</p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_623">I welcome the Minister and her officials to the Chamber. I am very pleased this debate is taking place today as it is long overdue. I welcome the commitments to offer support and services to people who were resident in the homes, in particular in the areas of health and well-being. The State has a clear duty in that regard, and we need to ensure proper support is provided. I commend the commission for carrying out its work in a sensitive manner, and the Minister for pushing the issue forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> As has been noted, there was a delay in the publication of the report which was completed in September and presented to the Minister until it was finally made available to the wider public seven months later. Given the highly sensitive nature of the issue and the great importance of the commission's work to so many lives, such a level of delay is unacceptable. We cannot leave people in the dark.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> In terms of the delay, the line from the Department is that the Government spent this time discussing the legal and financial implications of the report. That seems to have amounted to seven months worrying about the potential cost of a redress scheme for people who were resident in the homes, before the announcement last month that redress would not be offered at this time. That is deeply concerning. The report itself is clear that "children who were resident" at the homes "have a real cause for grievance" at having been excluded from redress schemes to date. The report is clearer still in stating that, "logically, children who were resident in the Mother and Baby Homes and all County Homes should be eligible to apply for redress in the same way and under the same conditions" as children covered by previous redress processes relating to the industrial schools and orphanages. In essence, the report is saying that the State should own up to the abuse carried out in the institutions, as it has had to do in previous decades. I do not think that is a very controversial proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> We are aware that at this point the commission is in the middle of its work and has not yet produced findings of abuse or neglect in the mother and baby homes. It is on that basis that the Government has stalled on redress, but it seems deeply unfair and unsympathetic to respond by simply quoting the cost of previous schemes and, essentially, pouring cold water on people's hopes that a fair and just redress scheme can be rolled out if the final report is clear on instances of abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The Minister told Dáil Éireann last month that the Government "has not closed off redress" as an option, but there is a big difference between quoting the costs of redress and not ruling such a scheme out, and offering a compelling, humane commitment that the State will do right by the survivors of the institutions once the final report is published, including a potential redress scheme. This is not simply about cost, this is about justice for people who have been subjected to horrific mistreatment. Beyond that, survivors and former residents groups have been clear in that they want the Government to step up here, to take ownership of what happened, to acknowledge the State's role in the institutions, its failure to provide the proper care for mothers and children, and to formally apologise. We should not underestimate how important such an apology could be for so many people, and I urge the Government to ensure the State does right by them in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> The commission's final report is due in February. Before then, two clear commitments must be made. First, survivors and past residents groups will be adequately engaged and listened to, and their voices will be heard when requested. Second, that there will be adherence to the agreed timetable. As has been noted, the delay in publishing the interim report caused a significant deal of stress for many people and I ask the Minister to commit to preventing further delays and ensuring that the commission's findings will be published on schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> The organisation Irish First Mothers has set up its own inquiry in order to gather the testimonies of women who were in the homes. I wish to highlight in this Chamber some of the voices of the women who have offered their testimonies during the process. One woman described her experience of having an episiotomy at the age of 14, without professional medical attention and being denied pain relief during a labour that lasted more than three days. It is incredible that she physically survived such an experience. Having run away to London, determined to find a way to keep her child, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, she was tracked down and forced to sign adoption papers to give up her child. Reflecting on her experiences, including the years where she suffered the weight of shame and judgment and the desire to find her son, she said she often thinks if she had committed murder she would not have got such a sentence. That is only one of the testimonies. It is time now for serious and dramatic change.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">I am happy to come back because I do not know whether I will be able to answer all the questions that have been raised. If that is so, perhaps there is another way to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> In response to some of the questions Senator Clifford-Lee posed, in particular about the coroner, as she may know, the coroner is independent in the discharge of his statutory responsibilities but, to date, he has determined that there is not sufficient evidence to enable him to open an investigation within his statutory remit. However, those are matters for the coroner and it is open to him to consult with the Garda or any other person in his consideration of those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> I am aware of that, which is one of the reasons I have taken decisions to look for expert technical advice in terms of questions related to the Senator's second set of questions, namely, what were the survivors' requests when I went to Tuam. Largely, they fell within two areas; one of which is information and access to records. A number of Senators raised those questions. I wish to ensure the survivors have information and access to records, particularly regarding Tusla. My understanding is that in order for that to happen we need to pass the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill to provide legislative and statutory underpinning for the provision of those records. That is the reality and that is why it is important to move the Bill forward as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> Second, the survivors asked for an exhumation. They identified that they wanted further excavation and exhumation with the opportunity to identify the remains. That is again why, in terms of the Cabinet meeting yesterday, I said I was going to access technical advice in order to help us move forward in making those decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The decisions in regard to extension of the excavation and the possibility of identifying the remains rest with the Government. The advice being provided to us will help me to develop proposals in regard to moving that forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> On the preservation of the site by Galway County Council, I understand that the proposal for a garden and protection of structures on the site has been postponed pending further consideration of what should happen at the site. This issue will form part of the consultations with the survivors. I, too, am engaging in a consultative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Many Senators raised the issue of the Government's response to the second interim report in terms of its decision not to implement that recommendation. In terms of the commission's rationale that the exclusion from the redress scheme of the unaccompanied children in the mother and baby and county homes was not fair or logical, I agreed with that and I have shared that with my colleagues. Although that agreement was not shared across my colleagues, I agreed with that assessment having looked at it very carefully. The next question is whether we should, therefore, provide access to the institutional redress scheme. We spent a lot of time examining whether that is possible or preferable. Ultimately, I made the decision with my colleagues not to re-open that scheme. The decision is not to close off redress but not to open up the scheme because, practically, to get access to the scheme survivors would have to prove abuse as an unaccompanied child, which is a child of between zero to three years. This is the group of people we are talking about. They would have to prove abuse and they would also have to go through the process of identifying that they were unaccompanied and get access to records to do that. In terms of our discussions, we had before us many examples of people who did access the residential institutions redress schemes and the difficulties in terms of that experience. This was not just about cost. As I said, people would have to go through all those steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the scheme identified that for Government to make decisions about redress for the future, it is important it is able to estimate to the greatest extent possible the cost in that regard. I asked the commission on many occasions how many unaccompanied children there were but it could not tell me that. Those were the reasons, from my perspective, for the decision not to go towards the residential institutions redress scheme. I was disappointed that we were not able to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The next question for me was what we could offer the unaccompanied children who were the focus of the commission's second interim report. I obtained the agreement of my Cabinet colleagues for supports, including mental health and well-being supports. We are putting in place a process to consult the survivors on what would be the best supports for them. We propose to put in place a meaningful process. The redress possibility will be re-examined when the commission of investigation reports. As a Minister I have to take account of a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General. We have learned some things from this scheme and others. If we are to put in place a scheme, we have to take account of those learnings.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> On the issues raised by Senator Devine about the 2012 report, the files were surrendered to the HSE when the homes were closed. The information in question was examined by the HSE as part of its input to the examination of the Magdalen laundries. All the issues of concern, which I share, are within the remit of the current commission. It is important to point out that these serious concerns about high death rates and adoptions pre-1952 were known about prior to 2012. The issues which the Senator has raised are being examined by my Department and the commission of investigation. I will meet people as part of the consultation process in terms of responding to the issues that have been raised regarding the commission of investigation's report. Many other important questions were raised and I would be happy to come back-----</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_680">The purpose of the Bill is to make it mandatory that all medical practitioners must provide evidence to the Medical Council of the level of medical indemnity insurance cover they hold. They will do this initially on first registering with the council and each year thereafter on renewal of registration. Medical practitioners will not be placed on the register of the Medical Council, that is, they will not be able to practise as a medical practitioner in Ireland unless this evidence is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The legislation gives the State Claims Agency, which has appropriate experience in the area of medical indemnity insurance, the power to specify the minimum levels of indemnity required for different classes of medical practitioner. This policy change requires that a new function be given to the State Claims Agency, under section 8 of the National Treasury Management (Amendment) Act 2000. There is currently no legal obligation on a medical practitioner to have medical indemnity insurance cover. As a result, some patients and the users of medical practitioners’ services may find they are unable to seek redress in the event of a medical mishap or negligent care from a medical practitioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> The Bill was introduced on Second Stage in the Dáil on 6 December 2016. There were no amendments proposed by members of the Dáil. However, Regulation 95 of SI 8 of 2017, which was made by the Minister for Education and Skills in January this year and which transposed the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualification) Regulations 2017, amended the original text of sections 45 and 50 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007. This necessitated three technical amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. Two amendments were required to section 7 and another amendment to section 8 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, to take account of the new wording in those sections as a result of the changes made to the text of sections 45 and 50 of the original Act by the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I now wish to report on the amendments made to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 amend section 7 of the Medical Practitioners (Amendment) Bill 2014. This section amends section 45 of the principal Act to introduce a new section 45(1A) after section 45(1). Section 45(1A)(a) requires a medical practitioner to provide evidence, in the manner which the Medical Council may specify in rules, of the minimum of indemnity which applies to his or her practice. </p>

          <p eId="para_688">Yes, amendments Nos. 1 and 2. Section 45(1A)(b) requires a medical practitioner who is not engaged in medical practice and who therefore does not fall into a class of medical practitioners who must have medical indemnity, to provide evidence that he or she is not engaged in practice, again in accordance with rules which may be set out by the Medical Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> Section 45(1B) had introduced a new section 45(8) after section 45(7) of the Act, to specify that the Medical Council cannot register a medical practitioner who falls within a class of medical practitioner which requires indemnity, unless the medical practitioner has provided evidence of his or her minimum level of indemnity cover, as may be set out in rules under the proposed section 11(2)(va) of the Act. However, two minor amendments to that text are required for the following reason. Section 45 of the Act was amended by the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualification) Regulations 2017. These regulations, transposed through SI 8 of 2017, were signed into law on 17 January this year by the Minister for Education and Skills. The regulations transposed Directive 2013/55/EU of the European Union and Parliament on the recognition of professional qualifications. In Regulation 95(1)(e), sections 45(4), 45(5) and 45(6) of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 were deleted. An amendment is therefore required to the text of the current Bill to state that section 45(7) has now become section 45(3). This is amendment No. 1, which was introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil by the Minister. Following on from that, the next subsection will become 45(4) rather than section 45(8). This is amendment No. 2, which was proposed by the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_696">The speaking note which I have is on amendment No. 3. Section 8 of the Bill amends section 50 of the Medical Practitioners Act 2007 to require that a visiting European Economic Area, EEA, practitioner may not practise medicine in the State unless he or she furnishes evidence, in accordance with Medical Council rules, which will be made in accordance with section 11(2)(va) of the Medical Practitioners Act. The original text of section 50 of the 2007 Act was amended by Regulation 95(1)(i) of the transposing regulations of the European Union (Recognition of Professional Qualification) Regulations 2017, that is, SI 8 of 2017. As a consequence, the text of section 8 of the current Bill must therefore be amended to take account of the new wording in section 50 of the Medical Practitioners Act and to ensure that the original purpose of this section is achieved.</p>

          <p eId="para_700">The amendment is on an extremely important issue. In 2009, Senator Reilly introduced a Private Members' Bill. The then Minister for Health, Mary Harney, at that time in late 2009 or early 2010, undertook to take action on this matter. I subsequently raised the issue in 2012 when I published another Private Members' Bill along similar lines to this Bill. The big concern was about doctors coming into Ireland to do cosmetic surgery. Is the Minister of State satisfied that this amendment ensures that someone coming to the country for a week to perform cosmetic surgery in a private facility would have adequate insurance? That was one of the principal reasons the legislation was brought forward in 2009 and again, by myself, in 2012.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">I will be very brief. I welcome this Bill. I am astounded that we did not have this before. It seems neglectful in respect of the trauma patients might be put through. Coming from the perspective of health, in the past there have been people, of whom I would be very aware, who have not been up to scratch and whose practice would not have been the best. Despite that, these people seem to have gone through the rigmarole of An Bord Altranais or whatever. Several years ago it was discovered that these certificates were fraudulent. English authorities contacted An Bord Altranais to say they had found many of these fraudulent certificates. It is a double-whammy of checks and balances if one has to have the insurance and be with the Medical Council. It will make it a lot more difficult to fly below the radar and have extremely poor practice for those who may never have been trained at all. I welcome the Bill and the protection of patients. We need to have redress in respect of what may go wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_706">I thank the Minister of State for bringing this Bill through its final Stages. As I said earlier, this matter first came to light in 2008 and 2009 in respect of cosmetic surgery. There was a concern that procedures were being carried out and the medical services here had to pick up the pieces.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">There were people performing procedures who did not have adequate insurance. Senator James Reilly, when Fine Gael health spokesperson, brought forward a Bill to deal with this area in 2009 and the then Minister, Mary Harney, said she would deal with it in early 2010. It was not dealt with, however. I brought forward my own Bill in 2012, having consulted with the Medical Council and Ciarán Breen in the State Claims Agency. Representatives of the Medical Protection Society, MPS, came in from London to meet up with me and those of us working on the Bill because it was concerned there were several medical practitioners who did not have insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> My Bill was debated in the Seanad but it was parked because the Department was dealing with it. The big question was how one judged the level of insurance. The Medical Council would not have the expertise to set out the criteria in that regard. In fairness to Ciarán Breen in the State Claims Agency, he came on board giving help and advice on the insurance issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> With the Department, the Medical Council and the State Claims Agency working together, we have moved forward with this legislation. I cannot drive a car unless I have insurance. Neither could I practise as a solicitor without insurance. However, there are medical practitioners who are practising without insurance. That situation will prevail until this Bill is signed into law. While 99% of medical practitioners have insurance, some do not. In Cork city, for example, I came across a radiologist providing services but who did not have insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I welcome this long-overdue Bill. I thank the Department’s officials for their help and assistance in 2012. I also thank the State Claims Agency, the MPS and the Medical Council for the assistance they gave. I am delighted the first Private Members’ Bill I introduced, although it is in a different format, will at least be law within the next week.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_711">The levels of overweight and obesity have been increasing despite the fact they are preventable. Childhood obesity and emerging inequalities are now recognised as key issues which need to be addressed. In fact, childhood obesity is reaching alarming proportions in many countries, which has the potential to negate many of the health benefits which have contributed to increased life expectancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> One in four schoolchildren and one in five teenagers are now overweight or obese which can affect their immediate health, educational attainment and quality of life. Obesity carries a stigma in childhood and may be linked with bullying. Children with obesity are likely to remain obese as adults and are at risk of chronic illness. The Health Service Executive’s childhood obesity surveillance more recent data indicate that rates of overweight and obesity have shown decreases at age seven and stabilisation at age nine. However, the overall incidence is still a cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Overweight and obesity are significant risk factors for many chronic non-communicable diseases. The links between obesity and heart disease, stroke, cancers, type 2 diabetes, mental ill-health, respiratory problems and musculoskeletal conditions are well established. These chronic conditions account for approximately three quarters of primary care visits and hospital admissions. To tackle the growing problem of obesity in the population in general and children specifically, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and I launched A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016-2025 late last year. It sets a short-term target for a sustained downward trend in levels of excess weight in children and a reduction in the gap in obesity levels between the highest and lowest socio-economic groups by 10%.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The obesity policy is the result of the Government’s desire to assist people to achieve better health and in particular to reduce the level of overweight and obesity, thus enhancing their quality of life. It has been informed by a comprehensive consultation with major stakeholders, health experts, health care providers, children and young people. The policy covers a ten-year period up to 2025. The vision is to turn the tide of the overweight and obesity epidemic. The overall aim is to increase the number of people with a healthy weight and set us on a path where healthy weight becomes the norm.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Obesity is a complex problem with nutritional, activity related, psychological, biological and social determinants. Consequently, any realistic solutions must be multifaceted and be implemented as part of a suite of measures. The obesity policy adds to the comprehensive suite of policy and legislation developed under the Healthy Ireland policy. The policy acknowledges the importance of an integrated approach across the Government to tackle the social determinants of health and well-being, and in particular those which contribute to health inequalities in the population.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> No single sector or agency is able to solve this issue on its own. Individuals and families need to be supported to make informed choices in healthy eating, being physically active in order that they can achieve and maintain a healthy weight. The obesity policy and action plan strives to empower individuals, families and communities to enhance their own skills to improve their health. Many of the actions outlined in the obesity policy have already been commenced. For example, the Department of Health has published a working paper to inform consideration of a sugar-sweetened drinks levy from a health perspective. The policy objective is to reduce rates of childhood and adult obesity in Ireland by reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, particularly among young people. The Department of Finance has consulted on its introduction in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Preparation of legislation on calorie labelling to help educate the general public on the calorie content of food portions is ongoing. A voluntary calorie posting scheme in existence since 2011 has been evaluated and a public consultation also took place in 2012. The results of both the evaluation and consultation are feeding into the development of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> Work will commence in 2017 on a new proposal for a nutrition policy and action plan. A working group has been established to develop a code of practice on food advertising and promotion, including product placement and sponsorship. It is anticipated this work will be published in 2017. A food reformulation working group is being established to reduce the sugar, fat and salt content of foods and beverages, in line with the EU food reformulation project. In the HSE, the new clinical lead post for obesity is currently being advertised. The healthy eating-food pyramid guidelines have been updated by a multi-agency working group, lead by the Department of Health, and were launched in December 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> In addition to these measures, what we do in our homes, schools and communities to help build healthy habits for all children and families is vital to childhood obesity prevention efforts. These healthy habits are critical in helping those children who are a healthy weight now to stay a healthy weight, while those who are overweight or obese achieve a healthier weight as they grow and develop. The key healthy habits are to reduce portion sizes, eat plenty of fruit, vegetables and salad every day, manage treat foods, replace sugary drinks with water, make being active fun and part of every day; have less screen time and encourage more sleep.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> Last year, I launched the healthy food for life campaign, which contains as an important message four of these key healthy habits. The campaign involved several stakeholders, particularly the HSE, which co-funded the campaign materials. In 2016, the health and well-being division of the HSE established the healthy eating active living policy priority programme. Its remit is to mobilise the health services to improve health and well-being by increasing the levels of physical activity, healthy diet and healthier weight across services users, staff and the population as a whole, with a focus on families and children. The programme co-ordinates and drives the implementation of a series of evidence-based actions across the health services and with external partners to strengthen capacity to promote healthy weight and prevent childhood obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> Three out of five adults and one in four children are overweight or obese. The unfortunate truth is that, as the World Health Organization has predicted, Ireland is on course to become the most obese nation in Europe by 2030 unless we take action now. Tackling childhood obesity is a key priority for me as Minister of State.</p>

        <speech by="#AidanDavitt" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Senator Aidan Davitt<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_722">We are very supportive of the action plan. The Minister of State has been before the House previously to discuss her plan, and what is contained in it makes quite a lot of sense. Some of the figures she has read out are amazing. One in four Irish children is overweight or obese. Two out of three adults are overweight or obese. The cost to the State of overweight and obesity is approximately €1.13 billion annually, directly and indirectly. The WHO has forecast that Ireland will top the European obesity league table in the next few years. As the statics really jump off the page, it is about time a Minister decided to tackle this worsening issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Fianna Fáil supports the development of a national plan for physical activity. In this regard, I notice there has been much talk recently about exercise in schools. I have a brother and sister who are PE teachers. It is amazing how certain habits start at home. The number of kids who come to PE class with notes and have excuses to try to opt out of PE is very frightening and has become a greater problem over the past number of years. Parents must examine this and take it seriously. There are evidently certain circumstances and cases in which people, for whatever reason, may not be able to swim or engage in a certain physical activity, but this seems to be becoming more prevalent. Schools play a very important role in tackling this because school is where many of our younger people either will or will not get a grá for physical activity. This is a very important starting point.</p>
          <p eId="para_724"> Fianna Fáil wants a 20% tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, as we have proposed previously. It would generate approximately €60 million in revenue. Fianna Fáil wants to see an expanded prohibition of TV advertising of high-salt and high-sugar foods, as the Minister of State will be aware, and as we have discussed. We also wish to promote active travel, such as cycling lanes and safe walking routes to school, among the population generally. We had started to roll this out and, in fairness, it has been continued by Fine Gael over the past number of years. We wish to target resources at schools and communities of lower socioeconomic standing. In this regard, better education in particular will be very important. So many foods can be so much cheaper and easier to use. The easier option may not be cheaper, as we could prove by examining the cost of much fresh fruit and so on but it does not end up being cheaper as in the long run, it will cost the State a lot of money. Education on food and exercise is therefore a very important tool. There is no national standard to measure what food is healthy, tasty or nutritional in secondary schools. Primary level is also very weak in this regard. Fianna Fáil wants specific planning protocols to create no-fry zones in the vicinity of schools. I remember from my time on the council that schools were always taken into consideration when it came to public houses, bookmakers and fast food outlets but it amazes me nowadays to see some fast food outlets are getting planning permission in close proximity to schools. It really is incredible. This is a very important area as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> Fianna Fáil is disappointed that the issue of vending machines in schools was not examined. If there are to be vending machines for snacks, what could be included in them? Again, fresh fruit and better options are a must in any vending machine in a school. This would have to be implemented. We wish to see the school meals programme extended in disadvantaged schools and non-DEIS areas. As we know, immense work has been done on the DEIS areas over the past number of years but many schools teeter on eligibility for DEIS status and the roll-out of proper meals in these disadvantaged areas would be a great help.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> Some of the figures the Minister of State has read out have been shocking. As I said, one could mull through the different figures and facts all day and one after another would cause surprise. In this regard, Fianna Fáil has been happy to support the action plan. We talked about it in the House the other day as well. The Minister of State has our support. I hope she will take into consideration the few recommendations and alterations we propose regarding the involvement of schools and exercise, vending machines in schools and education on foods. These are very important. As for the marketing and advertising end of things and what can be done in that regard, we believe a sugar tax is a prudent way forward. It has been talked about for quite a while and has been kicked around but we believe now is the time. It could be rolled out on a small scale and see how it goes from there. We saw even in the past few days the problems caffeine drinks and added-sugar drinks have caused, with the death of a young chap very recently. We believe this is an area that must be clamped down on. The reality is that younger people are being told lies through marketing and advertising campaigns, such as the advertisements for a drink that says it gives you wings and all sorts of rubbish.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> We appreciate the Minister of State's presence. She has been a big advocate of this since her first day and, indeed, we talked about it I think on St. Stephen's Day or the day after when we met in the studio of Radio 3. She spoke about the roll-out of it then and she has been good to her word.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_728">Sometimes I get a little fed up being here. We are not passing legislation. We are just making statements. We should spend our time introducing legislation, and legislation such as this is so important for our future, our young and their health - not just their physical health, but also their well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I have to hand it to the A Healthy Weight for Ireland document. I have gone through it but it fails to set meaningful targets that would actually do something. It is much more positive on measures to tackle childhood obesity. Yes, we should reduce obesity levels - that is a given - but I am not confident the required measures are in this inspirational roadmap laid out for our children. I acknowledge the key actions grid towards the end of the document, but actions must be directed towards those groups which the report itself states are most at risk, such as those living in disadvantaged circumstances, as stated clearly on page 13. The Department of Health stated that there is currently no grant scheme to support community initiatives to promote healthy living initiatives. Strategies become dust-collectors on shelves unless one involves local communities and hands over to them the power to work on them and have ownership of them. Can this be done without adequate resourcing? That we should develop this whole-school approach to healthy living is a great sentiment but who will foot the bill? The teachers? No. The parents? Definitely not; they are overburdened.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> However, we should not waste any time making this legislation. I offer a suggestion to the Minister of State. Action point 1.9 of her strategy seeks to develop proposals for a levy on sugar-sweetened drinks, while action 1.10 examines other fiscal measures to reduce unhealthy food consumption. Sinn Féin's pre-budget submission on a sugary drinks tax and the proposals we put forward in this regard came nearly a year ago. There should be a 5% sugar-sweetened drink tax, and the revenue from that tax should be reinvested to promote healthy lifestyles. The proposal was not about punishment or increasing the cost of such items for revenue creation, which would be felt, of course, mostly by those in lower-income families. Rather, it was about deterring certain behaviours and the consumption of these unhealthy drinks altogether. In an ideal Ireland, revenue from the sugary drinks tax would be extremely low because we would see children drinking water in our schools and homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Yesterday, I visited my alma mater St. James's national school in Basin Lane, Dublin 8. It was the first to achieve the Early Focus project in this fairly disadvantaged area. They described the project to me as being about physical and mental well-being. They bring the children in and many of them may not have had breakfast. The project allows for breakfast and they are teaching the children to love water. It is difficult for a child, who has probably been brought up with the blackcurrant and orange squash and the fizzy stuff, to appreciate and love water. Once they do, they find themselves a lot more alert and more able to listen. They are more confident also. I recommend that the money we could save from sugary drinks to go into that sort of project and roll it out across primary schools. It has done wonders at the St. James's school and they have the achievement award to prove it. They are the first in the country to do so. I am immensely proud of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> When we consider the resourcing, we could look at what is being done in Britain. Income from their sugar tax will be ring-fenced for school sports up to 2020, as well as being used to expand the numbers of breakfast clubs and to fund some schools. Perhaps the Minister of State could explain why she allowed the money that could be saved to run away from her. If we implement the school sports programmes and the healthy breakfast areas, it would result in positive changes in the trends for childhood obesity. One cannot increase the price of something without offering an alternative. With a choice between an unhealthy breakfast and nothing, one will stretch for the unhealthy option. If we really want children to eat better, we must reinvest the tax and offer them an alternative. We are not pioneering in this respect; there is precedent in Britain and in Mexico. Mexico had a higher rate of childhood obesity than the United States of America, which is astounding, and it passed a sugar tax that will be reinvested into health promotion. They recognise that the potential for economic harm from reduced junk food and soft drink sales is now insignificant compared to the damage that will be done in ten years if they did not invest in this way and if they allowed obesity to continue. One of their core reinvestments will be ensuring that every school has fresh drinking water for pupils. We have water in abundance here. If we make it more expensive to buy sugary drinks, we must reinvest to provide water. We must commit and pledge to provide fresh, clean, accessible drinking fountain in every school across the State. This type of proactive taxation and reinvestment is the only model that will work to tackle childhood obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, has already decided that the sugar tax will be reinvested somewhere else when it is introduced next April. I do not know where that somewhere else is going to be. If we do reinvest the funds elsewhere, the tax that could have been saved, we might consider the ordinary families who struggle with their obese children and who try to find motivational coaches. There is a privatisation of that sort or agency that takes their money and tells them they will take the weight off their child or teen. If we really want to tackle obesity, we need to generate a revenue to streamline it directly into dealing with it. If we tax the 5%, we have something to reinvest in promoting healthy living for children. The WHO report was published today and it is quite astounding. Some 200,000 adolescents and children worldwide were asked about their lifestyle in questionnaires. The report shows the amount of time they spend in front of a screen, the amount of time they do not engage socially and the time that they do not exercise their bodies and their brains. They do not get to use their imaginations in playgrounds, chatting to their pals or making up games when time is spent on one screen and when that is their view while buried in that screen. It is quite alarming.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Perhaps the Minister of State will also comment on what was described earlier during the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. The committee heard that a large meal could be as dangerous as the impact of alcohol on driving.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_735">I thank the Minister of State for coming forward on this matter. It is a major challenge in this State. The former Senator Eamonn Coghlan, who has a lot of experience around physical activity, always raised the issue of physical activity in schools. We have much work to do in the area of physical activity for children. People have better energy levels, improved self-esteem and mood when they engage in physical activity. We have a major challenge where we have the whole knock-on effect of overweight people and obesity. Four in five children in Ireland are not meeting the guidelines for physical activity. In Northern Ireland, it is three in four children. People slip into situations where they do not have enough physical activity. A survey has shown that the average amount of time that pre-school children spend watching television daily is 2.2 hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Some of the issues have changed. Consider, for example, the simple activity of getting to school. In 1981, some 50% of children walked to school. I know there are risks associated with children walking to school but when they do not walk to school, the activity is removed. By 2014, walking to school was done by only 25% of children. This is a change and we have not made up for that in relation to physical activity. Eamonn Coghlan had strong views around how we can change this within schools. Once children see their classmates involved in an activity, they too want to become involved. This is something we could keep in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> On obesity and children who are overweight, I was speaking to a medical practitioner who gave a talk to GPs. The issue was raised about how GPs discuss it with parents. GPs said that they would not bring up the issue of their child's weight with parents. One GP gave the example that when he did bring it up with a mother, she left the practice altogether, along with her husband and children just because the GP raised the issue of her child's weight. We need to be careful how it is approached. For example, 54% of parents who had an overweight child were not aware that their child was overweight. Some 20% of parents with an obese child were not aware that their child was obese. There is a huge learning process to go through and we need to work on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> Moving on from schools and parents, sometimes questions need to be asked about the food we provide in our hospitals and the services in our health care sector and if the food is meeting the criteria for healthy living. People in many hospitals are getting very proactive in rolling out meals. Hospitals have been asked why they serve chips and they reply that this is what the patients want. What the patients want may not necessarily be for the benefit or in the best interest of the patient. In fairness, hospitals are beginning to look at this issue. It is about giving new ideas to people when they are away from home and to show them there is a healthier way of living and it is about food. There is also a need for the issue to be very carefully managed when it comes to children in hospital. Careful management is also needed around what is offered in vending machines in schools, or in any facility, and whether it is healthy eating. Some schools have been very proactive about withdrawing vending machines.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">This is despite the fact that they were good income earners for schools. We have a lot of work to do and there are many areas to tackle through our education and health systems. We have to involve medical practitioners, community nurses and many other people in a programme to tackle childhood obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> In my constituency, Cork North-Central, where income levels are not very high, there is a proactive programme which involves parents. In one family, the first two children are into crisps and fizzy drinks but the parents got involved in an education programme and realised there was a better way of looking after their children. As a result, the third child is focused on eating fruit and other good food and this has made a huge difference to the parents. I sometimes wonder if our education system leaves out areas related to living and lifestyle. The youngballymun project and the Knocknaheeny project in Cork have made huge progress with parents in healthy eating and in living better and longer lives. The benefits of eating healthily go to parents as well as their children and it is important that we focus on all these areas.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDolan" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Senator John Dolan<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_741">I appreciate the support we have received from Healthy Heart, which makes a number of points on the gap in policy, food in schools, marketing to children and families on low incomes. It states that school food accounts for a growing proportion of children's food intake but is not subject to any national guidelines or standards, despite the identification of obesity as a major threat to the current and future health of this generation of children. The haphazard approach to food provision also extends to the State-funded school meals local project scheme and the school completion programme. It states that these are excellent programmes but that they incorporate no mandatory requirement for the supply of healthier food options or for monitoring the quality of food provided. The most recent step in the organisation's fight to protect children from obesity is a petition - Stop Targeting Kids - aimed at the marketing of foods which are high in fat. A report published by Irish Heart last summer, Who's Feeding the Kids Online?, exposed how junk food companies are targeting children in a much more individualised way online than they ever could through television advertising. High-tech analytics are used to target children, which is both insidious and very dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> We have to realise that many people live on low incomes but the most recent results from the childhood obesity surveillance initiative, COSI, reveals a higher level of overweight and obese children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds such as those attending DEIS schools. We have to respect people who have a disposition to obesity, as we do people who are actually obese, and it is important not to apportion blame in these areas. These things have to be challenged but it must be done respectfully. Food is fuel for life - our mothers knew that. They did not have to go and read it somewhere to find out. It is fuel for our bodies, our minds and our spirits. Food is not a commodity to be traded. It is the life, soul and health of a nation and its children and adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> It is also important not to see this as a First World problem rather than a Third World problem. Third World problems are characterised as situations where people do not enough food on which to live because they are forced to produce cash crops and sell them to get hard currency. I do not accept that. This is has been allowed to become a problem in the First World because we have not treated food as a necessary ingredient in being healthy, rather we have treated it as a commodity which we can have as we please.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> At the end of June last year, Brexit hit us out of the blue. There is no way anyone can say that childhood obesity has come out of the blue. We have known for decades that this was the direction in which Ireland and other countries around it were moving. I have spent my life working in the area of disability and I know where obesity leads. It gives rise to a range of conditions such as diabetes, which is next door to stroke, amputations and eye problems among others. Ministers say they would love to be able to do more for people with disabilities but do not have the money. This issue is about stopping people developing disabling conditions and it has to be seen as a major investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> There has been a complete cultural change in respect of this issue and there is an increased awareness of its seriousness. The Minister said that tackling obesity in childhood is a key priority and I do not doubt that. I do not believe there is anybody in the Oireachtas who does not believe it is an issue for children and adults, though some Members have differing views on climate change. However, we need to get serious about how it is dealt with. Cultural change is one of the ways. Supporting good behaviour, such as with "no-fry zones", is another way of dealing with it, as is involving communities in schemes such as getting kids to walk to school. Education is another area to focus on and public planning plays a huge role. The planning of the past has happened, however, and we have a contest between roads and the ability of children to walk safely to schools, which is an issue that we will not solve overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> At the beginning of the Second World War, the people of Britain were told that they would starve if they did not double food production.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">They appealed to the farmers of Britain to increase production. Farmers, whether they are in Britain or Ireland, if they can produce more and sell more, they are up to the challenge. Their reply was that they could not produce more. However, they finished up doubling their production. The point is that if one has to do something, one will find a way to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Child mortality in Britain after the Second World War and after rationing and all that went with it had been significantly reduced from pre-war levels. Let us think about that. Food was being rationed, but it was rationed in a way that women and mothers got the milk and children got the nutritious food. A major effort was put into educating families. We have to declare nothing short of a war on childhood obesity and take control from the hands of those driving the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">I thank the Chairman. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, to the House. I have had many conversations with her on this issue. I have long been a voice on the issue of obesity, in particular childhood obesity, not least because of personal experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> The prevalence of obesity has rocketed in Ireland in recent times, with 61% of adults and 25% of children currently overweight or obese. There is no disputing that obesity is a major public challenge. I agree with Senator Dolan's points in this regard, particularly in regard to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and the significant burden it places on the individual first and foremost and on health spending. One of the most recent reports compiled by the World Health Organization, WHO, on the issue predicted that Ireland was on course to be the fattest nation in Europe by 2030. As the situation stands, 61% of adults are either overweight or obese. With one in four primary school children either overweight or obese, we are on track to have more obese adults in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> According to A Healthy Weight for Ireland - Obesity Policy and Action Plan, the prevalence of overweight and obese children was higher in schools in disadvantaged areas than in other schools. I think that is well known. In most deprived areas, just over one in four people aged 15 years and over is obese compared with fewer than one in six in less deprived areas. The direct and indirect cost of obesity is estimated at approximately €1.13 billion. As has been highlighted by several experts in recent years, sugar consumption is one of the main culprits, not only for obesity but in the level of tooth decay. The level of tooth decay has been described by Dr. Anne Twomey, vice president of the Irish Dental Association, as catastrophic. An alarming number of young children and babies are developing cavities and decay at a very early age. According to a report from the Royal College of Surgeons in the United Kingdom, extractions among children under the age of five years has risen by almost 2,000 a year in the past decade. Experts say a combination of poor diet and too much sugar is to blame. Ensuring sugary drinks and foods that are targeted at children are more expensive is one way to prevent tooth cavities and childhood obesity.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> Although I have warmly welcomed the introduction of the obesity policy and action plan and commend the Minister of State's work in this area, I believe more can be done. I agree with the point Senator Dolan made that this is not a problem that can be cured overnight. I was a member of a delegation that went to Amsterdam recently where they are ahead of the curve on this issue. One of the things I learned was that it takes patience to sort out this issue. It will take years, it did not happen overnight and will not be solved overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> While food served in schools accounts for a growing proportion of children's food intake, it is not subject to any national guideline or standards, despite the identification of obesity as a major threat to the current future health of this generation of children. The haphazard approach to food provision also extends to the State-funded school meals local project scheme and the school completion programme. These are excellent programmes in many respects but incorporate no mandatory requirement for the supply of healthier food options and there is no monitoring of the quality of the food provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The Irish Heart Foundation conducted a survey in 2015 on food provision in post-primary schools and examined what second level students were eating, models of food provision and whether national standards are needed or wanted by school authorities. The research found that 37% of schools offered full hot meals and 30% offered cold snacks such as sandwiches. Nearly 70% of schools offered hot snacks, including sausage rolls, pizza slices and paninis, all calorie-laden stodge. A quarter of schools have tuck shops and 47% had vending machines, when we know the problem we have with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> I agree with Senator Dolan's point on the marketing of foods high in fat, sugar and salt to children in the digital media and on television, but also in non-broadcasting media such as commercial sponsorship in schools and codes of practice in shops. The "Stop Targeting Kids" petition is the latest step in the Irish Heart Foundation's fight to protect children from obesity, following research published last summer. In that report, it was exposed how junk food companies were deliberately targeting children in a much more individualised way online than they ever could through television advertising and using high tech analytics to target children. These analytics should be used in reverse. We should ensure companies promoting these products actively avoid children.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> I will outline what can be done. We need to ban television advertising, product placement and sponsorship of food and drink. We need the introduction of a statutory regulatory system for online and digital advertising. We need to designate schools as protected environments, free from all forms of marketing, and develop a code of practice to control placement of unhealthy foods at toddler and child level at supermarket checkouts, and in fairness retailers such as Tesco have taken a responsible approach. We need to restrict the sponsorship by food companies of children's sporting events and limit the provision and sale of fatty snacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> The Government has a duty to support disadvantaged communities to realise the benefit of family food incentives because disadvantaged communities have the highest levels of obesity. Considering ways of making healthy food accessible and affordable for people on low incomes has to be a priority. Actions to address the social determinants of health and to reduce health inequality, such as incorporating health impact assessments and health equity impacts, is a necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> With regard to obesity during pregnancy, a study conducted by the Best Start Resource in Canada has identified maternal obesity as a strong risk factor in the odds of offspring being overweight at aged seven years. This has been shown to increase by 3% for every kilo over the recommended weight gain guidance of the expectant mother. This is startling. I will write to the Minister on the positive measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> I commend the Minister of State on her work. We have a long road ahead in dealing with this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_764">It is great to see the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy in the Chamber. We are hearing of the growing problem of childhood obesity and the ways in which we might begin to tackle it. The issue is complex, with part of the problem being access to good nutrition and part being a balance of physical activity. I would like to focus on girls and young women's lack of involvement in exercise and sport, in particular the drop-off rate in activity that seems prevalent among girls as they go through secondary school. This gender difference has serious consequences for the lifetime health and well-being of these young women and girls.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> I am a mother of three girls and I have always been interested in and engaged in sport and other physical activity, especially surfing. I still enjoy teaching young people to surf on my native strand in Tramore.</p>

        <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_277">

          <p eId="para_766">Cool dude.</p>

          <p eId="para_767">I can see the fall-off in interest among girls and young women from the age of 14 up to 18 years. The emotional and social pressures of puberty and school life as well as the big picture social pressures from magazine, popular culture and their own peer network seems to orientate to one thing, that physical activity, organised sports in particular, are not things that girls in their teens are meant to be engaged in.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">One of my daughters went through this phase, being interested in surfing and other sports one day and dropping them when she was in first or second year in school as social pressures tilted against her. Cycling to school is a case in point, the recent census at school project, a small survey of the travel and life patterns of young people in Ireland, showed that for every nine boys cycling to school, only one girl does so. That is an extremely low base, for example, only 1% of students in Waterford cycle to school. Young women have the desire to be healthy, but they are being held back from one of the easiest and most obvious ways of staying fit. In The Netherlands, a majority of students cycle to school, and there is a considerably lower level of childhood obesity there. This is a serious loss for our young women, and for the health of our country. Luckily, my daughter has returned to her sporting ways, and is now the secretary of the National University of Ireland, Galway, NUIG, surfing club. Many young women, perhaps most, however, do not and instead choose to focus on a much less balanced approach to health that affects their food intake and neglects exercise and physical activity. This has long-term consequences for their health.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> What is at the root of this problem? Why are young women losing interest not just in competitive sports, but in other forms of physical activity, and what can we do to address it? We know anecdotally and from observation that a central part of the problem is that sports are not considered cool, or even socially acceptable as an activity for young women and girls to engage in. These social pressures are extremely difficult to quantify, but they are strong and self-reinforcing. They are supported and expanded through public pressures from media, and also through gender stereotypes and media focus. We saw only recently the Football Association of Ireland, FAI's, attitude towards Ireland's women's soccer team, that women in sport, and women's sport, cannot expect the same profile, coverage or benefits as those given to their male counterparts. Stereotypes about the role and behaviour of women are also to blame, and harder to tackle.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> I hope the Minister of State will consider some of the following in her approach to the issue of obesity under discussion today: we need to understand the various reasons behind the drop off in interest in sports among girls aged between 12 and 18 years. To do this, we need to hear from this age cohort, through expanded surveys and feedback from experts, teachers and parents. We need to identify those aspects that are readily addressable, and those that are part of the more global issue of female self-image and gender stereotyping. We need to deliver physical activities in schools and community settings that are tailored to be enjoyable and attractive to girls. One of my daughters went through this phase, as I said. We need to incentivise a more positive approach to physical activity. Cycling to school is a good way to start. Car free zones around schools is a good policy response to get people walking to school and we need to look at the big picture to alter the way young women think about what it means to be a woman today, and help foster an image of engaged and healthy activity as part of a balanced lifestyle.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_771">I thank the Senators for their very useful thoughts and observations on childhood obesity. I acknowledge their support for what the Government is doing to tackle this problem. It is extraordinary for us now, and for me as a parent, to see children presenting in doctors' surgeries with conditions that would have been considered adult conditions, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Senator Colm Burke referred to the doctor who told the parents that their child is obese. Our front-line staff are the doctors, the dentists, and the nurses in general practices. Attention needs to be paid to them. If parents take and follow their gentle suggestions, they will find that not only will their children's quality of life be enhanced, but their behaviour also will improve if they reduce the amount of sugar they consume. Education needed on that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Senator Davitt and all the other Senators mentioned physical activity. The national physical activity plan was launched almost two years ago and is a very important component of the overall healthy Ireland framework because we must take a whole of society and cross-departmental approach to this. We want to try to make the healthy option the easier one for all of us, particularly our children. The active school flag is a marvellous programme in which over 650 primary schools are engaged. They take steps to encourage physical activity among the children and the emphasis is on activity, not competitive sports. That is a really important distinction. I had the pleasure of visiting St. Clare's national school in Ballyjamesduff which not only won the national active schools flag award in Ireland, but went on to win the European active schools flag award. It is really leading the way. The schools, parents and communities are very engaged in this programme, not to mention the children who are benefiting. </p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Several Senators mentioned the lower socio-economic communities. We were delighted with the establishment of the healthy Ireland fund last year despite not having collected a cent yet. We are focusing on children and those in disadvantaged areas with that fund. We are working on the criteria and see great opportunities there. The no-fry zones were referred to. Wicklow County Council led the way on this and the Department is examining how this can be rolled out across the country. Senator Devine mentioned free drinking water in schools and we are certainly advocating that and will try to ensure that children have access to drinking water in schools. The World Health Organization, WHO, report was mentioned. While we are focusing on our issues this is a problem in certain developed countries around the world. Everybody in the European Union, EU, is focusing on this. </p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I was asked about eating a large meal and driving. Never drink and drive is the message. Someone who feels tired after a large meal should have a snooze before getting behind the wheel. Senator Burke mentioned the former Senator, Eamonn Coghlan, leading the way in physical activity and parental awareness. If they know that children need a minimum of one hour's activity a day, that is something to strive for, and it could be divided into four 15 minute blocks as long as they get that crucial minimum. People will welcome the fact that from this year wellness will be a subject in second level schools. </p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Others mentioned young girls. Teen years are very challenging because of the pressures of social media and having always to aspire to be like certain people. We want to encourage young girls to choose physical activity. They do not have to be competing. They can walk, run or cycle, as long as they are aware that they need physical activity. That is crucial, as is eating healthily and well. Senator Dolan's point about being respectful and helpful to families on low income was a good one. This is not intended to blame people but to encourage them to make good decisions that enhance their quality of life. That is what we really want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I also mentioned the national standards for food. We have a national nutrition plan. We are working on that this year and that will take into account everywhere that food is produced, including schools. Senator Noone mentioned the WHO. We certainly do not want to be branded the fattest people in Europe by 2030. </p>
          <p eId="para_777">While it is correct in respect of Amsterdam that patience will be required in this area, at the same time, we must be proactive. Senators will be aware that communities are becoming very engaged, for example, through Parkrun events and activities arising from the "Operation Transformation" programme which engages people every year. More cycle lanes will make it easier for people to engage in physical activity. </p>
          <p eId="para_778"> A number of Senators, including Senator Noone, referred to online advertising and specific algorithms that can target children. As with many new technologies, we are playing catch-up to a great extent. However, the Department is working with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland on a new code to restrict the marketing of food and drink to children. The children's code is being revised and we have made submissions in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> I thank Senators most sincerely for their observations. A Healthy Weight for Ireland: Obesity Policy and Action Plan 2016 sets out ten steps forward. We recommend a number of actions the Government can pursue to assist people in their efforts to prevent and reduce obesity. The Department is making progress on the implementation of the many priority actions set out in this policy. As I indicated, the Health Service Executive is recruiting a clinical leader on obesity, who will take a lead role on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to the House and thank him for appearing in person for the Second Stage debate. I also thank Senators from all parties and none who indicated support for the Bill, which is much appreciated. I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, for his support. </p>
          <p eId="para_782"> In 1998, I and a number of other parents, some of whom are in the Gallery, sought an amendment to the 1997 Act to close off a loophole which provided parents of children with an intellectual disability with a derogation from the requirement to attend school. This provision was being used rather cynically by the Department of Education to obviate its obligation to provide education for these children. I remember the occasion well. We had been invited to the House by the then Senator Dick Roche. It was as a result of this issue that I became involved in politics and ended up on my local health board. It is only right, therefore, that I address it again today. I never thought then that I would introduce this Bill in the Seanad nearly 20 years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Autism spectrum disorder is primarily characterised by delayed or deviant communication in both verbal and non-verbal social interaction. Many people with autism and Asperger's syndrome do not recognise social cues. We all know, especially Senators, how we can communicate with each other non-verbally. Social impairment is a major issue and repetitive, stereotyped or ritualistic behaviour, including self-stimulation or "stimming" as it is known, are also characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. All of these features may occur in widely varying degrees of severity and in many different manifestations. They can be so severe that a child may be diagnosed at an early stage in life and require 24-hour care. In other cases, however, the symptoms are so mild that a diagnosis is not made until middle adulthood. </p>
          <p eId="para_784"> I will briefly address the struggle parents have endured in this regard. Rather than discuss the work of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger in the 1940s, I will go back only as far as the 1960s, which were not a good time for parents of autistic children. At that time, mothers had to endure the belief, made popular on chat shows by Bruno Bettelheim, that they were responsible in some way for their child's autism. Imagine the parents of a child who had been given a devastating diagnosis with no cure being subsequently told that they were bad parents. Women, in particular, were told they were cold and described as "refrigerator mothers". Fortunately, many mothers had good sense and one of them, Clara Parkes, a professor of English, had the courage to write a book in which she asked how she could be a perfectly good mother to two of her three children but somehow not a good mother to her third child. This view, she argued, did not make sense and was not logical.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> Professor Parkes and many others started a movement that questioned this approach. Bernard Rimland was heavily involved in this campaign and was very committed to the cause. I was astonished when he answered a telephone call I made one evening to his home in the United States because it was 1 a.m. in America. He spoke to me that time and answered a call from my wife on another occasion. </p>
          <p eId="para_786"> There followed a period of greater awareness and enlightenment, and the 1970s saw significant leaps forward in studying the nature of autism and its treatment. The first major twin study, which was carried out by Professor Michael Rutter in England, showed a genetic link in twins. Lorna Wing's book, <i>The Autistic Spectrum: A Guide for Parents and Professionals</i>, was a powerful counter to the book, <i>The Empty Fortress</i>, by Bruno Bettelheim who had coined the "refrigerator mothers" term. Lorna Wing believed not in a different syndrome but in a range of disorders.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> While the incidence of autism in the general population was believed to be 1 in 5,000 in the 1960s, the Camberwell study of 1979 showed it was closer to 1 in 500 and we now know it is 1 in 68. Whether the most recent figures indicate an increase in the incidence of autism alone or a combination of better awareness and diagnosis and increased incidence is still a matter of conjecture.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Ireland had its own champions in this area, Pat and Nuala Matthews, and they are present in the Gallery. It was not until 1979, however, that the World Health Organization officially recognised autism. As a member of a health board in the early 1990s, I spent a year trying to convince an inspector from the Department of Education that autism even existed. Having finally convinced him, he refused to accept the need for a different educational approach. </p>
          <p eId="para_789">Therefore, children in those days were diagnosed with great difficulty and, even then, there were few, if any, services available. They were seen as emotionally disturbed and were educated with emotionally disturbed children who were otherwise normal. This had a negative effect on both sets of children. The situation for adults was much worse. Autism spectrum disorder, ASD, specific interventions and services for adults were almost non-existent, reflecting the lack of understanding and investment in provision for adults.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> Research from the Irish Centre for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Research, ICAN, has highlighted that many individuals with ASD have symptoms of co-morbidities, including seizures, gastrointestinal disorders, sleeping problems, feeding and toileting problems. Adolescents, adults and older adults are under-studied populations. They have difficulties with social relationships, residential independence, employment, social inclusion and independent living skills. This is the month of mental health. These people have many mental health issues, with anxiety disorders and depression being much more common in adolescents and adults with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> As a group, people who have autism are more than twice as likely to die prematurely. Autism research finds the mortality rates to be two to ten times higher than normal among various groups with autism. People with autism die younger. Accidental injury was the leading cause of death at a rate three times higher than in the general population. The autistic child does not look back. The normal child will walk down a beach and keep looking back for reassurance. The autistic child just keeps going. I have my own story about that. On one occasion, our son got out under the gate unbeknownst to us when we were on holidays. When we realised he was missing, panic ensued. We hopped over the gate - I was a lot more agile in those days - ran down the road and another road, saw a group of people and asked them whether they had seen a child in nappies. They said, "Yes, he has gone that way." I was astonished that they did not stop him but we caught him. He was literally on the verge of crossing a main road, a busy main thoroughfare. He would not have survived. One of the more astonishing statistics is that children with autism are 160 times more likely to drown than children across the general population. Suicide and epilepsy rank only behind birth defects as the most common causes of death. Premature death for autistic people is higher across nearly all causes. We must address this and shift attention to addressing the preventable and treatable issues and conditions that drive these disturbing statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> In the short time I have I will talk about the difficulty for parents, particularly in the past, who are so desperate as orthodox medicine fails them that they will look to anyone who offers help. Of course, that makes them very vulnerable so they try things like methodology and craniology. I remember saying to my wife that when all those things failed, she would probably go looking for codology if she thought it would help because that is the desperation. People need to be protected from these charlatans, some of whom are medical people.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> While some progress has been made in our understanding of ASD, no consensus exists on how to screen and diagnose for it or provide clinical care or educate people with ASD. That is not just the case in this country but right across Europe. However, other countries do have an ASD strategy. England, France, Canada, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have strategies and we need one too. We need one in order that we can address this ever-increasing problem that will be a huge burden on the finances of this State if we do not intervene at the appropriate time, diagnose early and put in place the supports that can allow people with this condition to live a much more independent life. I do not know how much more time I have.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">I will truncate what I have written down. The Bill has various sections. Normally, I would go through them but I do not have the time. There are some very important things in it that are different, including things relating to advocacy and legal representation and, equally, the need to involve parents. We have excellent medical experts and allied experts in speech and language and behaviour therapy and other areas in this country but the expert on the child is that child's parent or parents. Unless both sets of experts are fully involved in the planning, care and delivery of any therapies that are needed, that child will not get the best result and society will suffer as a consequence because even the most profoundly affected of people on this spectrum can be more independent and have less challenging behaviour if they get the help they need. Lest there be any doubt about this, I will tell one story about visiting a major health institution regularly as a GP. I overheard one nurse saying to another, "His teeth will have to come out. We had better get the GP to sign him up to see the dentist." When I arrived, the gentleman in question got very disturbed. He used to bite people. He had bitten people's ears off and I had to re-suture them on and there was a lot of discontent about it. I arrived and said that I heard they were talking about X and was told we would have to get them out. I asked whether they thought that was the only way and was told that was what we needed to do. I said I would send for the dentist and get all his teeth extracted, but I then asked what they would do when he started thumping people. Would we amputate his hand or would we amputate his leg if he kicked them? Thankfully, there is a more enlightened approach now. Although I was the visiting GP and was not in charge of this person's mental health care, I could see that all he needed was to be given the space to eat his meals away from others and not be crowded by others who were equally challenged intellectually and would not understand his need for space. All that behaviour ceased.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> In short, what we need is a strategy that cuts across all Departments and acknowledges that every Department has a role to play and needs to be informed. I am very pleased that the Minister for Health is here to take this Bill. I know he has a particular interest in this and will drive it. This Bill will ensure in law that a strategy will be in place within two years. I hope it will be in place sooner than that and I am sure the Minister may have some good news for us on this. The Bill will ensure the strategy will be reviewed regularly and that there will be an onus on every Department to report back on progress made to provide the proper services because the Department has been properly informed about the needs. This need not cost a huge amount of money. What it needs is understanding, including an understanding of how to get the best value for money. I specifically have not been prescriptive regarding what this strategy should do in legislation. It is far too complex and it needs to be left to the strategy. I assure parents who are in the Public Gallery, supporters of this Bill, medical experts and NGOs that they will have an input into this strategy. If we need to table an amendment to achieve that, we will do so on Committee Stage. I will not presume upon the Minister's goodwill but I see him nodding assent.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> I again thank everyone in this Chamber from all parties and none and the more than 12,000 people who signed an online petition to support this. I ask them to keep supporting it and spreading the word because we do not want this Bill to run into the sand on Committee Stage. We want it to go through Committee and Report Stages in the Seanad and on into the Dáil where I have every faith and confidence in the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to see it through to the end.</p>

        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_798">I welcome the Minister to the House and very much appreciate him being here for this Bill. I thank Senator Reilly for bringing this legislation forward. It is very important. The one warning I would sound relates to the fact that Senator Reilly brought forward a Bill in 2009 when he was a Deputy relating to medical practitioners and the need for insurance. Less than an hour ago, we signed off on the final stages of the Department's Bill. I followed up Senator Reilly's 2009 Bill with a Private Members' Bill, but I am glad to say this Bill has now gone through. I hope we do not wait eight years for this legislation to go through because it is very important. It is so because of the families and people for whom the Bill aims to cater and provide the necessary supports. It is about developing an ASD strategy. It is very important we do this. It is about the Minister consulting each Department, the Executive and all the people involved in providing services for those with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">It is also about ensuring that there is a clear system of accountability, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> As set out in section 3, the autism spectrum disorder strategy concerns access to health care services, education, employment and any service provided by a public body, social inclusion, access to advocacy services and the provision of legal aid where required. It is about ensuring that any service, such as speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or behavioural therapy, is provided to people who require it.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> Senator Reilly mentioned dental services. In the past two weeks alone, I have dealt with two people with autism who required access to dental services. I was surprised by the initial advice that they had received. After I handled their cases, the advice that they got was different. I am glad that the situation has worked out well for both. This issue is not just about medical services. I had to intervene to ensure that those people got necessary dental services. One was a six year old child and the other was aged in their 50s. It is important that there be a proper structure in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> It is also important to note that people with this disability have a contribution to make. Senator Reilly is right in that this issue was parked down the years and we did not consider the contributions that people could make. My sister-in-law was looked after by her mother for more than 50 years and is now being provided with full-time care. She got involved in painting and drawing. Her mother had been told for 30 years that she did not have a contribution to make, but one of those paintings was exhibited at European level. Everyone has a contribution to make, regardless of the difficulties they face. It is important that there be a proper long-term strategy for people. It is also important that parents feel that the State is providing them with the necessary support.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> We are facing major challenges in terms of people who need State support. This is one of the issues that has arisen at the health committee in recent weeks. We must not park it. It concerns parents who provide necessary care but where age is catching up with them. They find that they are not getting the support they require. We must address this matter urgently. I know a man who has taken his daughter to a day-care facility every day for the past 50 years. He is 79 years of age and drives the 15 or 20 miles in the morning and again in the evening. He will not be able to do that for much longer. It is important that people like him be given the support they need. The strategy can deal with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> I welcome the Bill. It is comprehensive and well thought out. I hope that, in the not too distant future, this legislation will go through both Houses and be signed into law, given its importance. I also hope that I will not have to wait eight years.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_808">I thank Senator Wilson. I will begin by thanking Senator Reilly for introducing this important Bill. I share his desire to ensure that people with autism have access to the supports they require to enable them to achieve their full potential and maximise their independence, including living as independently as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> I welcome those who have joined us in the Gallery, are following proceedings online or have signed the petition highlighting the importance of this Bill and calling on Ireland to follow other countries in developing a comprehensive national autism strategy. The people in the Gallery at whom I am looking are the advocates, people with autism and families - I recognise many faces - who have been working for many years to arrive at a point in this country where we recognise the need to pull together the various elements of the State and have a national autism strategy - not a siloed mentality of something being a job for this or that Department, but a single national autism strategy. I thank these people for the tireless work that they have done in bringing us to this day, which has inspired and encouraged Senator Reilly to table this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> As most of those present know, autism is an issue that has been close to my heart for many a year. On a personal level, I feel that this Bill is significant. As a teenager when I sat in a cold hall on a February evening in Greystones in County Wicklow, having called a public meeting after being impacted by a family experience with autism and having asked people who were living with autism to come along and share their experiences, I could not have imagined that I would be in the Seanad as the Minister for Health proudly accepting this Bill to develop a national autism strategy. I assure everyone that I am determined to work with Senators and, in due course, Deputies on all sides of the Houses to ensure that we deliver this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> I welcome the cross-party support for Senator Reilly's Bill. All parties and Independents in this and, I expect, the Lower House will put their shoulders to the wheel so that we can devise a wonderful national autism strategy. There is often criticism of what people call "new politics", but if this and the Lower House deliver a national autism strategy in which we work together across party lines and political divisions, the new politics model will have delivered something very important for the many people with autism, their families and society as a whole, and it will say much about us as a country.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> I recognise the need for a strategic approach to enhancing the effectiveness and responsiveness of our services to meet the evolving needs of people with autism. This is becoming best practice in other countries, including our nearest neighbour in the UK. In devising a national strategy, we as a country are recognising the complexity of autism as a condition. Crucially, it allows us to consult with the autism community. All too often, we policy makers talk about and at people with disabilities. If we get this right, as we are determined to do across party lines, the consultation process in and of itself will enable people with autism to tell us what sort of society they want to live in and what services and supports they need. Consultation on the development of the national autism strategy is important in terms of providing us with an opportunity to tackle ignorance. Let us not fool ourselves - in many parts of society, there is significant ignorance of autism as a condition. Consultation will allow us an opportunity to raise awareness among our communities, neighbours, friends, policy makers and service delivery organisations. It will allow us to have a true national discussion about autism and the needs of those with autism and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> As Senator Reilly alluded to, the scope of the issues raised extends far beyond the scope of the health sector alone. Strong collaboration and joined-up thinking will be required from a number of Departments and stakeholders so as to ensure that we provide the best legislative solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">As it is not just a health issue, as I think everybody here would appreciate, but touches on the remit of each and every Department, I assure the Senators that I will provide the political leadership to drive this within Government and work with colleagues in other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> This evening I can announce two steps which will be very important in bringing us on the road to this strategy. I have requested that the HSE establish a working group spanning its different operational areas, which will look at the delivery of autism services in this country, consider the effectiveness of existing services, identify models of good practice - such models do exist in certain parts of the country - and identify where the shortcomings are. The working group will report back to me on service delivery and operational experience in respect of autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> The second measure is that my Department will commission an epidemiological research study into the prevalence of and future projections for ASD. As a society, as policy makers and as a Government, we can only properly respond to the present and future needs of people with autism if we actually do the research. What is the prevalence rate of autism in Ireland? What is its projected future prevalence rate? What is the demographic make-up of people with autism here? I know from my own background that there is many a young child with autism who has now grown up into adulthood. There are many parents of children with autism who are now getting on in life and wondering what will happen to their sons and daughters. The research commissioned by my Department will help inform our strategy. When, then, can we have a national autism strategy? If we get those two pieces of work done now, which is my intention, I plan to progress the development of a strategy in 2018 enhancing the health services' response to ASD.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> There is a clear overlap between these plans and the very important Bill presented by Senator Reilly. As I have said, a whole-of-Government approach will be required. We will need extensive consideration by the HSE, the Departments of Justice and Equality; Education and Skills; Social Protection; Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation; Children and Youth Affairs; and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government of the implications of the approach proposed in the Bill. I wish to name all those Departments for the record of the House, as they are all stakeholder Departments with which we will need to work to make sure we have a comprehensive strategy rather than one which just looks at the health piece, important and all as that is.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> It should also be noted that as we consider this Bill and as it progresses to other Stages, we will need a detailed examination of the legal implications and equity considerations arising. I intend to consult the Attorney General to ensure that there are no unintended consequences, including equality issues, as a result of making separate legislative provision based on a specific diagnosis. As a result of tonight's proceedings, my Department will request all Government Departments to consider the detail of the proposed commitments within their areas of expertise. I will work with the Senators and Deputies of the Oireachtas to feed these processes into the refinement of the Bill. I know Senator Reilly is very much open to engaging with Government and colleagues in order to make sure we have the best possible Bill, which will adequately and effectively reflect the cross-Departmental, multi-agency approach that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> I welcome the platform provided by this debate to put on the record the Government’s position. As I have already said, the HSE working group will now set about identifying models of good practice that can be replicated. We need to be very conscious of the current geographical lottery in respect of the provision of services. I have talked to parents of children with autism, and in some communities the service seems to be significantly better than in others. We need to identify where it is good, and that good practice needs to become the model rather than the outlier. We will also have the Department's research and will progress the development of a strategy in accordance with the piece of legislation which I hope will pass in both Houses. That strategy will be developed next year and, in response to Senator Reilly's point, will involve comprehensive consultation with people with autism, stakeholders and those working with people with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> Since 1996, the overarching principle governing the planning and delivery of health services and supports for adults and children with disabilities, including autism, is that they should be integrated as much as possible with services and supports for the rest of the population. The Government’s agenda in this regard is clearly set out in the current national disability strategy, NDS, which is based on a non-condition specific approach to the delivery of public services and the mainstreaming agenda. National strategies on disability policy such as the comprehensive employment strategy and the forthcoming national disability inclusion strategy have been led by the Department of Justice and Equality under the aegis of my colleague, the Tánaiste. This reflects the shift away from viewing people with a disability as a patient or as solely the responsibility of the health services, towards mainstreaming supports and services into local communities and wider society.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> The national disability inclusion strategy, which will shortly be brought to Government by the Minister for Justice and Equality, will take a whole-of-Government approach to improving the lives of people with disabilities. This strategy contains a specific programme of actions on ASD. As many who are following this debate will know, the strategy contains eight themes: equality and choice; joined-up policies and public services; education; employment; health and well-being; person-centred disability services; living in the community; and transport and accessible places. Under those themes, 32 key objectives are identified. These are in turn supported by a range of specific, measurable - that is very important in any strategy - and time-sensitive actions that relate to the areas of education, employment, provision of public services, health, transport, and personal safety and autonomy. </p>
          <p eId="para_822"> I will dwell briefly on the issue of employment, which is becoming increasingly important. The role of the State in respect of people with disabilities is not just to write cheques to fund service providers. Its role is to meet the whole needs of the person with a disability. Many people with autism have a huge contribution to make when it comes to employment. They have skillsets in many areas, as Senator Burke outlined in respect of the area of art. We have to provide people with an opportunity to contribute fully to society. That is what they want and a comprehensive employment strategy is very important in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The national disability inclusion strategy is envisaged as a living document. We do not need another report to put on a shelf. It needs to be a living, breathing, evolving document. Implementation will be supported by independent analysis and advice from the National Disability Authority, and also by periodic review and oversight by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy. As many people know, a significant programme of reform is under way in respect of how we approach the provision of disability services. I had an opportunity recently to bring legislation through these Houses which provides that any child in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance has an automatic entitlement to a medical card. That is one piece of stress less for families that are already often under pressure. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The Department of Health and the HSE's Transforming Lives programme aims to bring about significant and far-reaching change to the delivery of disability services. The national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people aims to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery. The early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme led by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs incorporates a focus on the developmental level of children with disabilities, their functional ability and their needs. It does not focus on diagnosis, recognising that many children may not have a formal diagnosis at the time of presenting at pre-school. </p>
          <p eId="para_825"> The Department of Education and Skills will continue to provide a range of supports for schools which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs. The Department invests over €300 million annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools. The number of special classes has increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country in 2017, of which 888 are special ASD classes. This includes 126 early intervention classes to support pupils with ASD. </p>
          <p eId="para_826"> I have mentioned the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities, which sets out a ten-year strategic approach to our commitment to increasing employment opportunities for people with a disability, with a view to increasing the numbers and proportion of people with a disability in the work force. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is leading work on a task force on personalised budgets. It will make recommendations to the Minister of State by December 2017 on a personalised budgets model which will give people with disabilities more control in accessing health-funded personal social services, giving them greater independence and choice in accessing services which best meet their individual needs. Under the national disability implementation plan, we will shortly see a programme of actions on autism in keeping with the cross-Departmental, whole-of-Government social model approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> Despite all of the work that has been done, I want to be very clear that the need for a national autism strategy is compelling. I believe that debate is over. We must now get on with passing this piece of legislation, engaging on the detail of the provisions to ensure we have the best Bill possible, and involving all of the relevant Departments and agencies. I am giving the Senators a timeline tonight; I wish to see the strategy developed in 2018. We will get on with the two pieces of work I have outlined, namely the HSE working group and the research study, while these Houses are progressing the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_828"> There is so much more to do in this area. In particular, I want to talk about the difficulty facing parents in accessing services and therapies, and the particular challenges for those children with autism who are now becoming adults with autism and our need to address educational and employment opportunities for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">We must and we will do better in this regard. Last year, we hired 83 additional speech and language therapists to work in our early intervention teams but we have come from a very low base after a number of difficult years. I give a commitment to Senators that we will continue to properly staff and resource our early intervention teams so that we can tackle what are, in certain parts of this country, significant delays in terms of people accessing therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> Again, I congratulate Senator Reilly for introducing this Bill. I also congratulate the Seanad, on an all-party basis and grouping basis, for accepting this Bill, which is what I expect the House will do this evening. I thank all of the advocates for their work, personal stories, testimony and tireless campaigning over many difficult years to bring us to this point. If we work together on this matter we can progress this legislation and we can have a national autism strategy in this country by next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">I thank Senator Reilly for bringing forward this legislation and for his enlightening and emotional contribution. Fianna Fáil fully supports the Bill. I have a speech in front of me that is full of statistics which highlight where mistakes have been made in the past not only by this Government and that which preceded it but by Governments that were in power over the past decade or so. However, I shall not use such information. In light of the legislation before us, this is a positive evening for the Seanad and I very much welcome the contribution made by Senator Reilly. I also welcome the initiatives that the Minister has outlined. I encourage him to work to a tighter timeframe than the one he outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Interestingly, while researching this matter, I learned exactly what autism spectrum disorder means. The Mayo Clinic has defined the disorder as a serious neurodevelopmental disorder that impairs a child's ability to communicate and interact with others. The disorder also includes restricted repetitive behaviours, interests and activities. These issues cause significant impairment in social, occupational and other areas of functioning. In 1996, a declaration by the European Parliament stated that people with autism should have the same rights enjoyed by all EU citizens, where such be appropriate and in the best interest of the person with autism, and that these rights should be enhanced and enforced by appropriate legislation in each member state. Diagnostic services, individualised education, family support, housing, vocational training and lifelong care will all now have to be adequately addressed and appropriate services will have to be provided. The legislation before us will go a long way towards fulfilling what was sought in the declaration to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> In the context of the Bill, I commend a lady from my constituency of County Monaghan, Lisa Marie Clinton, who has received an array of awards. Most recently, she won the award for Monaghan's best start-up business in Ireland and best entrepreneur competition for her company AVAIL, or Assisted Visuals Achieving Independent Living. The company provides an e-learning app and web portal for children and adults with intellectual or development disabilities, namely, autism. With a bit of support from the local enterprise office in Monaghan, Lisa Marie has created a revolutionary tool that promotes lifelong learning and helps children with autism to live as independently as possible. It is people like Lisa Marie who need to be commended, supported and encouraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> Again, I congratulate Senator Reilly for bringing forward his legislation and I ask that arrangements be made to take Committee Stage as a matter of urgency. I give the Senator a commitment that my party will support him in that regard.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Senator Aidan Davitt<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_840">I agree with Senator Wilson and I commend Senator Reilly on the great work that he has done in respect of this Bill. Senator Reilly has talked to me about the Bill. He has been a passionate campaigner for autism services and he has canvassed far and wide for people to support his Bill. I am delighted to be here this evening with my colleague to support Senator Reilly and move the legislation forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> I wish to note a small matter. The Minister spoke at length about a timeframe. I know that he may need to conduct some legal checks and whatever else. Having read the Bill, I believe it is realistic and I would be surprised if it generated many hiccups. We have already heard a bombshell of news about a timeframe this evening. We would be delighted if the Minister surprised us by shortening the timeframe for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Through my own experience with autism in Mullingar, I know that great work is being done by the Saplings school there and by Autism Ireland at its centre in Multyfarnham. Much work has been done in the general Westmeath area in terms of autism and many of it has been self-funded. There are hardworking groups in Mullingar. Saplings Limited is a great example in how to provide autism services and care for really young people. Praxis Care and a few other organisations provide care in the region and are trying to secure a larger foothold in the community. I appreciate all of their efforts. We have a reasonable base so we should be able to move autism care forward. Education is very important and I thank Senator Reilly for bringing forward very good legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#MaireDevine" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Senator Máire Devine<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_843">Sinn Féin supports the Senator Reilly's Bill, which I warmly welcome. It has been a long time coming. The Bill deals with awareness-raising, advocacy and data collection, which will be very important into the future, and it is very welcome. If the legislation is enacted, these elements and all of the others it contains will make a real difference to the lives of persons and families affected by and dealing with autism in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> I usually stand up in here and am a bit of a grouch. I do not want to sound like a grouch. I just want to point out the real and present danger that what is intended by means of this wonderful Bill will not be realised unless the Minister provides adequate resources. The austerity years devastated families that had members with disabilities because they were left alone in their struggle. When I was a member of the nursing profession, I witnessed the isolation, fear, laughter, tears, despair and emotional rollercoaster that such families experienced at that time. They had very little back-up or support from the State and what did exist was mercilessly stripped away.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> In terms of therapy supports, there is an 18-month waiting list for people with disabilities to be assessed. Such a situation completely disregards the Disability Act 200, which stipulates that assessment should take place within three months. The strategy stipulates that the State "should make provision for individual assessments of persons with autism spectrum disorder." How can that be achieved without real moola being provided? Funding is needed. In the absence of additional resources, these unacceptable waiting times will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The current assessment of needs is being implemented adequately under the Disability Act. Those with autism already receive an assessment and access to health care. However, parents are forced to spend hundreds of euro every month on private therapy for their children due to the lack of capacity in the public health care system. As the Minister knows, we need more speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists and psychotherapists in our public health service. Many of these health care professionals were culled from the health service when it was on its knees.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> What is there to disagree with in this Bill? It mentions the specialist need with regard to autism. I warmly welcome any specialist service that will be provided to people and their families. We could focus on special needs assistants, SNAs, in schools, but that is probably for another phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> This is a day to congratulate the Senator and to commend him, the people in the Gallery, and the petition for classrooms to be opened in all primary and secondary schools in Ireland. This is also a day to urge the Department to listen to the concerns of parents and teachers alike who signed the petition. They have told me of the many roadblocks they have to go through. Those involved in a school in Walkinstown continually fund-raise for its ASD classroom, but that cannot be sustained in the medium to long term. There would be burnout. I thank Senator Reilly for his emotional presence here today which reflects everyone else's experience. Members of this House reach out to the Senator and to those in the Public Gallery who allow us to hear at first hand the long-fought battle that has tested and reduced people's financial and emotional resources. It is two people standing up for people's rights and their children's rights and their children's future. We have been forced to become a more caring, understanding and embracing society and I am proud to live in it today.</p>

          <from>Senator Gabrielle McFadden<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_849">I welcome the Minister to the House. It is great that he is here for the Second Stage of this Bill. I know he has a grá for the topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017. As has been said, it seeks a national strategy for children and adults living with autism spectrum disorders. I warmly applaud my dear friend and colleague, Senator Reilly, for spearheading this forward-thinking initiative. The Bill has been designed to ensure those affected by ASD receive the necessary resources and support they deserve throughout their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Everyone with ASD is unique. It is universally acknowledged that early diagnosis and early intervention with evidence-based practices make a great difference to a child with ASD. Current waiting lists for assessment are between nine and 18 months. However, in many counties throughout the country, families have had to wait years for a diagnosis. Even if a family is lucky enough to get a diagnosis, there is often no intervention or service to follow up the diagnosis. There is no autism team in two midland counties, for example. Waiting lists for clinical psychology, speech and language therapy and occupational therapy can be up to three years. A national autism strategy would help to highlight this shortfall in appropriate support.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> In this vacuum, many families have no option but to search the Internet for help. As a result, the autism community in Ireland is flooded with unproven, unregulated and often dangerous interventions such as miracle mineral supplement, MMS, which promise cures. There is a proliferation of interventions for people on the autism spectrum. However, research evidence for most of these interventions is scant at best. Applied behaviour analysis and positive behaviour support are the proven methodologies for improving the well-being and quality of life of people with ASD. The Government must ensure that staff who work with people with autism, either in education or health or both, are trained and skilled in these methodologies. It has a responsibility to publish guidelines on reputable evidence-based interventions, fund research, evaluate autism interventions and disseminate and highlight practices that are found to be effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Many people with ASD can achieve paid employment or third level education or both. Some people with ASD thrive in the more specialised academic environment of university. To get there usually requires an individual support plan. People may need support to develop a system of communication and support to understand social communication. It helps if these are in place from a very early age. Some require inclusive education, possibly with the help of special needs assistants. Some require an autism-specific unit attached to a mainstream school with applied behaviour analysis as a primary methodology. With the right information and guidance for families and communities, people with ASD can develop meaningful and satisfying relationships which support them to connect with others while respecting any wish for time alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> Ordinary environments such as waiting rooms, shops and cinemas can be terrifying for many people with ASD due to the sensory bombardment and overload therein. Behavioural methodologies have been very effective in identifying individual triggers, promoting emotional regulation and protecting an individual's mental health. Visual supports such as timetables, picture sequences and choice boards are a lifeline to many people with ASD. However, these methods need to be widely disseminated. The national strategy will, I trust, highlight interventions such as these and ensure they are disseminated as widely as possible, not just to professionals but to schools, families and communities in order that Irish citizens with a diagnosis of ASD can at last reach their true potential. I commend this Bill to the Seanad and I commend Senator Reilly on bringing it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ColetteKelleher" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_855">I welcome and support the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017 and commend Senator Reilly on bringing it forward. It is heartening to see so many people with autism, together with their families and supporters, in the House to urge us on.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> As has been mentioned, a growing number of people are diagnosed as experiencing autism each year. The latest estimates of the Cambridge University autism research centre indicate that one in 58 children have some form of autism spectrum disorder. As Senator Reilly suggests, agreement on realistic prevalence rates of autism in Ireland, along with a standardised a national assessment process such as that envisaged by the Bill, would allow us to plan for the support of people with autism as a standard practice and policy. That is not happening now.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> When I worked for the Cope Foundation, its north Lee autism spectrum disorder service was cited as a model of good practice in a HSE service improvement team report published in 2015. The north Lee ASD caseload grew from approximately 50 children in 2005 to more than 500 children in 2015. Instead of a commensurate expansion in resources from the State to cater for the increased caseload, the service experienced cutbacks. In an effort to reduce the cruel waiting times, an innovative smart assessment approach was developed which cut out duplicate reporting by the different disciplines involved. The length of time for the assessment dropped from 24 hours to 12 hours. This streamlined the assessment process and put the focus on the more important post-assessment support that people with autism need across their lifetimes to flourish. </p>
          <p eId="para_858"> Responding to the needs of people with autism requires lifetime and life cycle planning and a response involving all of society. The lifetime planning approach has been absent from the planning for the education of children with autism. Getting a suitable school place in primary, transitioning from primary to secondary and from secondary to training is disjointed to say the least. The mainstream population would not accept it. Why is this lack of planning and joined-up thinking visited upon children with autism, who prize certainty and often find change difficult? It creates huge, unnecessary anxiety and untold distress to them and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> Children and students with autism should be able to access a diverse and suitable education in a mainstream setting. The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 provides that children are to be educated in an inclusive setting unless this would not be in the best interests of the child. The provision of ASD classrooms which enable people with autism to navigate school successfully are key to making mainstream education accessible. These classrooms have specially trained staff and specialist equipment which helps students with communication, sensory and motor issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Allowing students with autism to attend mainstream education has a positive effect on the whole school, providing all students with an insight into and understanding of autism. The world is a diverse place, and our classrooms and schools should reflect that reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> There is currently a chronic lack of ASD classrooms particularly at second level. At present schools can and often do refuse to establish an ASD classroom when requested to do so by the SENOs working for the National Council for Special Education. This results in patchy and unbalanced access to education. Some students, even in urban areas, have to travel up to 20 km to school each day because local schools simply refuse to cater for them. Many students who had access to an ASD classroom at primary school will not get one at second level because of the current gap in provision. The National Council for Special Education has expressed disappointment at the restrictive and exclusionary practices of some schools and has looked for additional powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> In 2014 there were 13,873 students with autism in the school system, 63% of whom were in mainstream classrooms, 23% were in a special class and 14% were at a special school. </p>
          <p eId="para_863"> In the whole of County Cork there are 81 ASD classrooms at primary level catering for 480 students and just 41 at second level for 246 students. The Cork autism gap, the difference in places at primary and secondary in Cork, is 234 and this gap is replicated across the country. As a result some students will lose supports as they transition from primary to secondary. Others whose support needs develop at a later stage are being denied access. The need is greatest in co-ed or boys' schools as up to 80% of people with autism are male. A place in an ASD classroom can be more cost-effective than a place in a special school or supporting home schooling. </p>
          <p eId="para_864"> As well as introducing this Bill, I would be grateful if Senator Reilly and his Fine Gael colleagues would also lobby their other Fine Gael colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to support the amendment I proposed to the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill currently going through the Dáil, to give powers to the National Council for Special Education to instruct schools to open an ASD classroom, thus enabling children with autism to progress with their education, especially from primary to second level, without fear or anxiety, just like other children. </p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Also on education, there are significant issues for young people with autism or school-leavers as the group is often known. For example, in Scoil Ashlinn, a school for children with autism in Cork, two young people graduated in 2013 and ten in 2014. Despite no earmarked funding for school leavers, Cope Foundation somehow found a way to set up An Tuath Nua, a training centre offering a three-year training programme. This summer those ten young people finish the three-year training programme. I am not sure what prospects lie ahead for them or what resources are at their disposal. Most likely the ten young people and their families will not know either. This happens year-in, year-out for school-leavers, including children with autism. It is simply not good enough and I welcome that Senator Reilly’s Bill seeks to address this and other issues facing people with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> The proposed strategy set out in the Bill is comprehensive. Autism is a big spectrum. We need to keep focus on the person with autism, their individual rights and preferences. When one has met one person with autism, one has met one person with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> We must avoid the mistakes of the past that were made with people with intellectual disabilities which we are currently trying to undo and unwind. People with autism can often be the ones labelled as having behaviours that challenge. All too often we witness cases of over-medication and use of medical restraints, when in fact it is the environment and not the person that is at fault. </p>
          <p eId="para_868"> I commend the work of Dr. David Pitonyak, a leading US thinker on autism and one I have had the privilege of listening to and working with. He says that his practice is based on a simple idea that difficult behaviours result from unmet needs. In a sense difficult behaviours are messages which can tell us important things about the person and the quality of his or her life. People with difficult behaviours are often missing meaningful relationships; a sense of safety and well-being; things to look forward to; and a sense of value and self-worth. Dr. David Pitonyak would endorse this Bill, and judge it as being on the right side of history, moving firmly away from segregationist and institutionalised responses, to a rights-based approach to people with autism.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> It is important to focus on people throughout their whole lifetimes. The Bill envisages employment being key. I was really glad to read an article in the most recent edition of the <i>Harvard Business Review</i> which highlighted that many people with autism, dyspraxia and dyslexia have extraordinary skills including in pattern recognition, memory and maths. However, many traditional recruitment methods miss out. It is great to see companies like Hewlett Packard embrace neuro-diversity as an explicit workplace strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> I welcome the Bill and will help the Senator and Minister in any way I can. I am delighted to support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_871">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy to the House. I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris, for his remarks. I compliment Senator Reilly on his initiative not just in bringing the Bill before us tonight, but also in persevering and ensuring that we have this debate tonight. Senator Reilly, who is a good friend of mine, will forgive me for welcoming his wife Dorothy and his son Jamie to the Gallery. As the old cliché goes, behind every good man is a good woman. In this case, beside every good man is a good family. I know that Dorothy along with Jamie in their own right have been tremendous champions and advocates, on which I commend them. I do not think it is inappropriate to pay tribute to them or their work and advocacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> The Minister spoke about a national strategy being a living document. It is about the lives of all our fellow citizens. As Senator Kelleher said, it is about being able to access educational places, supports and services, and also treating people with respect and dignity. It is important that tonight's debate is about ensuring we have a strategy that reaches out across all parts of our country. We acknowledge that there are gaps and deficits and that there is a need for investment. Tom Cruise's infamous line "Show me the money" certainly must come to fruition here.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> I acknowledge that we are on a journey and we have all-party support for this Bill. In response to Senator Wilson's remarks, as Leader of the House I say we certainly will not be found wanting in bringing the Bill from Second Stage to Committee Stage. In his remarks the Minister mentioned consultation. I say to Senators Reilly and Wilson that we will not have any inordinate delay from this side or from this House in assisting this Bill in its journey across the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Others have referred to the people in the Gallery. It is important we thank the people in the Gallery, the members of all families and the people who are advocating.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> My godson in the United States is on the autism spectrum. He can dismantle a car and put it back together in a couple of hours, but certain simple tasks take him forever. When I appeared on local radio with P.J. Coogan this morning I was reminded of a conversation with my godson where he said, "You know, I'm seen as being different, but I'm not." P.J. Coogan, who has a son on the autism spectrum, mentioned this morning that in the past people would have been viewed as being odd, different or cast aside. Is it not wonderful that as a society we are now becoming inclusive through education and employment and through our policies?</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> That is why tonight is very important. It is about putting in place a national strategy. That gives it value and puts value on Government. Today we attended the launch of Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell's report on death and dying. It is about having a cross-departmental approach and ensuring that each person's uniqueness is celebrated and that the characteristics, values, personality and skills can be delivered to their fullest potential. As people will know from my speeches in this Chamber, I am a big fan of Maslow. We must always allow people to reach their full potential no matter who they are or where they are from. The Bill is about ensuring we value every person in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Senator Kelleher and I have a shared experience of being involved with Cope Foundation in Cork. Last Thursday night I was very proud to attend the 60th anniversary to represent my father, who is a former chief executive, as was Senator Kelleher, to recognise the importance of all people. That is why I have taken heart from the Minister's remark about the need for a whole-of-government approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">It is not about the Department of Health or a single Department. It is about education in respect of an autism spectrum disorder unit or the provision of a place, whereas Senator McFadden commented on getting intervention or diagnosis and Senator Devine referenced the waiting time to be assessed. It is about a whole-of-government approach. That is why the Minister's reference to the role of the HSE is important and I welcome the setting up of a working group. However, it cannot simply be a working group that will speak to itself and go no further. It has to be able to have consequences and a follow-on. That is why it requires political leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> A part of me would have loved it if Senator Reilly had been a Minister when we had money in our country, because he was a man in the Department who had a vision and who was in a hurry. I really wish he had been a Minister when we had money in our country. What we are seeing today in this Bill is the future part of his legacy. As Members, we need to have political leadership to ensure that we pass the Bill through this House and on to the Dáil without delay. That is why tonight's debate is absolutely healthy and necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> We all accept that waiting times are excessive. We need early intervention; it is absolutely necessary. Those of us involved in the education sphere recognise the importance of early intervention. If we invest early, it prevents later difficulties and consequences in our health system that could be avoided by such early intervention. It is important that we broaden our approach in education in terms of how we can improve access. Senator McFadden referred to the issue of inclusiveness and so on. Eight themes emerged in the Minister's speech. I will not go through them all because my time is up but it is worth looking at them and what they stand for or represent. They are a focal point for us and they must be part of what guides us.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I commend Senator Reilly. I thank all Members for their contributions and support on Second Stage. I hope we can work together to ensure the Bill becomes a reality, rather than letting the thing gather dust on a shelf. It is important that we act collectively.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GraceOSullivan" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_882">I welcome the proposal from the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to set up a working group to progress this legislation and collate data to support an autism strategy. I thank Senator Reilly and commend him on introducing this important Bill. Senator Reilly, myself, the Minister and many others in the Oireachtas have personal experiences of dealing with the often-disconnected services for family members of those with autism. Some families are at their wits' end trying to cope with the challenges that go hand in hand with the condition of autism. I have heard multiple stories from families with experience of autism with whom I have come into contact since my election last year. Theirs is often a tale of frustration and desperation as they try to get access to the various services necessary in the face of a sometimes seemingly uncaring bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> There is a serious lack of cohesion when it comes to support, as well as a widespread lack of information of the available services. Let us consider the example of the Maher couple from County Kilkenny. The autism of their son, Michael, has led to a situation where the family have been essentially confined to their home. They have suffered extraordinary stress as they have tried to cope with an increasingly challenging situation. The Maher parents are dedicated to the well-being of their 17 year old son. Michael's father had to give up his job so he could provide the care his son needed. Thankfully, in this case, Michael's parents have managed to secure a place at a school in Waterford that can give him the support he needs. Many others I have talked to have not yet been so fortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> We can see the mental health effects that disconnected services create. Those suffering from autism and those providing care for them can be deeply affected by the inconsistency in the way individual cases are handled, the lack of resources in schools and the feelings of being ostracised that accompany a lack of social and community involvement. A Waterford couple I spoke to told me of the difficulties they were having in getting public access to a child psychologist. Their daughter was left on a waiting list that was going nowhere. The mother referred to the way her daughter has been treated by the system as disrespectful and as a violation of human rights. She spoke of the hypocrisy whereby families who are not in a financial position to access private psychological services may be left on public waiting lists for years while the same service provider will provide appointments within approximately two weeks if the family is in a position to fork out €900.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> My eldest daughter, Emer, who is now 25, was identified at an early age as being on the autistic spectrum. She received back-up and support. She got physiotherapy and occupational and speech therapy from an early age. They have had a major impact on her development. Emer and my family received all the support we needed to ensure that she had the best possible opportunity to reach her potential. She got an excellent level of care that helped to shape her into the bubbly, popular, socially adjusted, proud and integrated young woman she is today. Here is the thing: Emer was born in the Netherlands and that was where we lived for the first years of her life. I am a proud Irishwoman but I am glad my daughter was born in the Netherlands, where we had access to a coherent and comprehensive system of services and supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> Where appropriate and timely interventions are available, we see positive outcomes. We need a national autism strategy urgently. We need an integrated approach. Families desperately need support. Families need to be spared the challenges of begging for care and access and for the right of their loved ones with autism to find the self-realisation adverted to by the Leader, Senator Buttimer.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I sincerely thank Senator Reilly for bringing this Bill to the House. I am happy to support the Autism Spectrum Disorder Bill 2017 and I hope it passes through the House quickly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MariaByrne" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_888">I welcome the Minister. It is great that he is here this evening to hear the debate. I compliment my colleague, Senator Reilly, on bringing the Autism Spectrum Bill before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> Much has been said tonight and I will not go over some of the things that have been said. One thing I have learned from talking to family members of those on the autism spectrum is the nature of the gap between the time a person is diagnosed and the time the person receives the services. While it has been acknowledged that the delay has improved considerably, there is still a need for more improvement in access to therapy services and seeing the psychologist. This time gap is seen as being the essential window of opportunity. Certainly, it needs to be narrowed. That is one area on which I am keen to focus in. Much progress has been made but autism affects so many people. Many families have members or relations who are on the autism spectrum. Certainly, it should not be budget dependent because these children are our future and it is important to secure early diagnosis. I visited an early intervention centres recently. It is not far from where I live. I spoke to the teachers and the families affected and it was an interesting visit. I learned a great deal from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> The Minister's announcement of an all-party approach and the committee he intends to set up within the HSE is welcome. I am keen to see parents and educators being represented as well as psychologists, those providing speech therapy services and all service providers and occupational therapists involved. It is important that the committee is broad.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> I welcome that there is cross-party support for this important Bill. I am spokesperson on education on behalf of Fine Gael. The lack of ASD units has been referred to by many speakers. While I welcome that there has been an increase in the number of special classes and special class places and that there are now 888 ASD units, many people have to travel long distances to access them. In some areas, there are no ASD units. I have been raising this issue with the Minister for Education and Skills, but perhaps it could be addressed by the cross-party committee when established. The committee could also address the lack of early intervention special units, of which there are currently only 126. The blueprint is good but we need to increase the resources to optimise the results. Services in the mid-west have been trying to follow international best practice and have set up child service teams which are top quality. However, as I said earlier and as mentioned by other speakers, access to these services is an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> I acknowledge the progress to date and the model of services provision. I welcome that we are being proactive rather than reactive and that everybody is willing to work together to deliver this important unit. At the end of the day, what we all want is quality of life not only for people with autism, but their siblings and families. While there has been a small increase in the number of speech and language therapists, I would like to see additional staff recruited because they have a huge role to play in terms of the development of these children.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDolan" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Senator John Dolan<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_893">Protocol requires me to address the Chair, and rightly so, but my instinct is to address the Visitors Gallery. I will do everything I can to help to progress this Bill through the Seanad. I am committed to it and I welcome it. I have no doubt that the Bill will be passed and that we will have an implementation strategy in relation to this matter, but I am not sure we will get the promise of it delivered. That is the risk. I will be happy to be 100% wrong in this regard but it is better to raise these concerns, which are based on my many years of experience dealing with disability-related strategies. This is a night of hope and I do not wish to be anything but hopeful in relation to this Bill, but we need to face up to the risks that are in our system. I do not believe that the Minister or anybody else involved in this area wishes other than to see this happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> The Minister stated that strong collaboration and joined-up thinking will be required across a number of Departments and stakeholders to ensure the very best legislative solutions are provided. That is an issue that has dogged public services in this country since Basil Chubb wrote about it in his book almost 50 years ago. We still have, in effect, 15 different governments, as he described it. We talk about joined-up thinking but it rarely happens, which is a real concern in relation to this issue. For this to work joined-up thinking across the health services, the Department of Health and a range of other Departments is required. </p>
          <p eId="para_895"> Reference was made to the national disability strategy implementation plan and the comprehensive employment strategy, in regard to which I would like to set out some facts. The comprehensive employment strategy was to form part of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan 2013-2015. Neither the Department of Social Protection nor the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation would have anything to do with sponsoring it. It was sponsored by the Department of Justice and Equality and was not delivered until October 2015, which was three months off the ending of the three-year period of the plan. The current strategy is sponsored by the Department of Justice and Equality and not the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the reason for which I cannot figure out. In regard to the 2013-2015 implementation plan, the commitment to put it in place was made in February 2011. It took two years to do that and it ran for three years. The follow-up implementation plan, which the Minister mentioned in his speech is soon to go to Cabinet, was to commence in January 2016. We are now half way through 2017. The chair of the implementation body for the comprehensive employment strategy, Mr. Fergus Finlay, said at the end of its first year of operation: "I do not think one job will have been created." I am not happy to make these points: I hope I am wrong, but I know how difficult it is to implement these measures. My remarks are not only directed to those in the Visitors Gallery but to my colleagues. </p>
          <p eId="para_896"> During the strike four weeks ago by Bus Éireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and its agent, the National Transport Authority, could not figure out that what they were doing was removing wheelchair accessible buses from three routes to make savings. Not one of the privately operated buses on those routes was wheelchair accessible, nor were they required to be so. If that can happen, then in terms of implementation in this area, we need to be very careful. Recently, Mr. Robbie Sinnott, who is blind, took the State to court so that he could do one thing that is guaranteed in our Constitution, namely, the right to vote in private. He was pushed to the limit and he eventually won his case. That is not an issue that is a huge drain on the public purse because elections and referenda are not held too often. </p>
          <p eId="para_897"> There are real concerns around implementation and the mindset among staff in the various Departments. The Department of Justice and Equality is responsible for the provision of a focal point for the promotion and co-ordination of disability policy, including the national disability implementation plan. A whole-of-government plan must be driven by the Taoiseach of the day and co-ordinated across various Departments. The Department of Justice and Equality can do no more than ask other Departments for their input. As I said, this is a matter for the Taoiseach. Brexit is not being dealt with by any one Department. It is, in the main, being dealt with by the Taoiseach. If disability as a whole-of-government issue is to be dealt with properly then it has to be dealt with by the boss, the Taoiseach, who will be provided with updates on actions on a weekly basis. These are areas where problems can arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> Senator Devine raised the issue of the resources with the Minister, Deputy Harris. Resources in the Department of Health is one issue, mindset is another. Resources and mindset in other Departments are equally important. This is a night of hope but we must be careful. This is not just about getting this legislation passed. The EPSEN Act 2014 came into force 13 years ago but significant parts of it have not yet been implemented. The Disability Act came into force the following year. The assessment of needs provision has not yet been triggered, except in the case of young children. </p>
          <p eId="para_899">A director of advocacy, a core piece of the Citizens Information Act 2007 relating to people with disabilities, has never been put in place and there are delays in implementing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. Let us not buy a pup. We have to travel in hope and in confidence but the legislation passed is not the legislation implemented and when it involves a number of Departments it is a really tricky deal. Successive Governments have not dealt with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> I thank Senator Reilly, whom I first met almost two decades ago on the former Eastern Regional Health Authority, when we were younger men. I am absolutely committed to doing everything I can in regard to this but people need to be very careful because what happens between Departments will either kill or drive and give life to this.</p>

          <from>Senator John O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2017-05-17T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_901">First, I commend Senator Reilly on introducing this Bill and on all the work and effort he has put into it. In recent years there has been more awareness of the autistic spectrum. Years ago it was just known as "autism" and the word was associated with people who had profound communication and behavioural difficulties. I taught for many years and I thought I was teaching disruptive pupils but that was not the case. Things have moved on but it has been a slow road.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> There is more awareness now, which has come about, almost accidentally, through the media. We sometimes criticise the media but some television programmes educated us on the issue. There were American and British television series where families had children on the spectrum, and through these kinds of programmes many people learned about the difficulties that people with ASD and their families face. We need to have a high-profile public awareness campaign, early screening and early intervention. We need a one-stop shop, consistency and awareness on the part of public servants, housing officials, the Garda and the public in general so they do not misinterpret the sometimes quite literal conversations and challenging behaviour of people on the spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I am pleased that this Bill has come to the Seanad this week as this is mental health awareness week and many people on the spectrum - and indeed those who care for them - have mental health issues. I have no intention of going over the provisions of this Bill section by section, but I note and welcome the stated purpose of the Bill, which is to address the inconsistency which exists across the State in respect of both the availability and type of services that are accessible to children and adults with autism spectrum disorders. We need consistency and to ensure that everyone gets the same services regardless of where they live. We need to ensure they are an entitlement and not a perk.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> I will talk about my interaction as a public representative with parents of children with ASD and I am sure my colleagues have similar experiences. The first problem parents come across is school admittance. I heard from one parent who received a phone call to say her child been granted a place in junior infants class as they had a cancellation, had one place available and her child was next on the list. She told the principal she would take the place and then told her that the child had just been diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. She was immediately told that the school could not take him as it did not have the facilities and it was too late to apply to the National Council for Special Education to have them in place for the following September. She appealed to the board of management of the school but it was too late for her child for that year and it was pointed out to her that she did not have an offer in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> This boy had been referred to the early intervention services with the HSE and had home tuition until a place in mainstream school was found for him. However, it was all a struggle, a battle and a fight for entitlements. My secretary asked the young mother of this boy if she was in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance. She had never heard of it. She was a young, single, working mother, struggling to pay bills and rent in private rented accommodation and, despite the fact that she had been dealing with the HSE for over two years, not one person told her she would be entitled to this allowance. Eventually she got it but getting it was not easy. She did not have copies of every assessment, every doctor's appointment, every psychiatrist's report, every speech and language appointment, every occupational therapist's appointment or details of every time she had taken him to an accident and emergency department when he had injured himself or broken a limb. Even if she did have all this to hand, she certainly did not have the facilities to photocopy them. That young mum was able and articulate but still needed help to get her entitlements. There are many parents of children on the spectrum who are not as able or articulate and who perhaps have learning or intellectual difficulties themselves. I believe that every family with a diagnosis of ASD needs to be allocated an advocacy person. I believe that the Department of Social Protection needs to simplify the application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> I want to talk about the Department of Social Protection because this is something that I know about as well from my work as a public representative. I am constantly horrified by the number of applications for domiciliary care allowance and disability allowance that are refused. I am equally horrified by how many of them are allowed on appeal. The 2015 annual report of the social welfare appeals office shows that in 2015, 313 out of 837 domiciliary care allowance appeals heard were successful. That is a huge percentage and, in effect, it means that 313 parents who should have been entitled to domiciliary care allowance for their child were turned down in the first instance and had to go through the process of an appeal before they got their entitlement. I am aware that domiciliary care allowance is not just for children on the spectrum but is for all children with a severe disability who require ongoing care and attention. The parents of all these children are concerned, worried and worn out, trying to love and care for their children to the best of their ability and who knows how many of them do not have the time, the energy or the inclination to appeal decisions. The figures show that a huge amount of those who do appeal are successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> Of the 5,220 who appealed disability allowance refusals, 1,443 were allowed on appeal. Again, that is 1,443 people who were in the first instance entitled to the allowance but had to go through all the hoops of an appeal before they got their entitlements. I believe that this Bill, in setting out the implementation of a cross-Departmental, multi-agency autism spectrum disorder strategy, will ensure that people get their entitlements. It is hugely important that we are all more educated about the difficulties and challenges of the autistic spectrum and that those who live with the spectrum should receive easy and equal access to services. I am satisfied that my colleague, Senator Reilly, has, with the introduction of this Bill, made great progress towards this becoming a reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_908">I commend my colleague, Senator Reilly, on this innovative and necessary Bill which seeks to provide for a multi-agency autism spectrum disorder strategy and to provide for related matters. On 8 May, Dóchas in Limerick city held a public meeting to which all public representatives were invited. We met parents and got an insider's view of what it is like to care for someone on the autism spectrum.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Senator O'Mahony made reference to one of the features they came across, namely, the inconsistency of services depending on where one lives. In one case, a child was living in County Limerick and did not qualify for the services because he was at school in County Cork. It is extremely important that we look to integrate consistency of overall services into the strategy, be it in education, therapy or mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> The next feature was the whole area of primary education. Many parents felt that the level of access to services-----</p>

          <p eId="para_915">The Minister of State has become very fit since taking on responsibility for public health. I thank her for being here today. She was earlier discussing childhood obesity. It reminds me that as Minister for Health, I appointed a civil servant at principal officer level to cover children, health and education in respect of that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I thank all the Senators for their positive contributions. It is a reflection of what we can achieve when we co-operate. I thank the Minister, Deputy Harris, for his very positive response and the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, for coming in as well. It has been a long battle. While we are by no means finished yet, this Bill can give us the tools to get there. People have pointed out that it will be difficult and asked how we are going to do it. How does one eat an elephant? By taking one bite at a time. The first bite is passing this Bill and developing the strategy. We must not let perfectionism get in the way of what is good. Then we must fight like hell to make sure the strategy is implemented and resourced. In footballing <i>parlance</i>, tonight we can celebrate winning a match but it is still a long way to the cup final. We will all have to stay on top of it to make sure we get there.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Over 12,500 people have signed the petition and put their own thoughts in it. There is no doubt about the necessity and frustration that people feel. One person's contribution referred to "diagnose and dump". Temple Grandin wrote a book entitled <i>Different ...Not Less</i>. We are all different, and so are people with autism and ASD. They are not less. They have so much to give us. My good friend, Senator Buttimer, mentioned my son, Jamie, who is in the Visitors Gallery. We were told he was mentally handicapped and not to worry. He did not go to school until he was 11. Now he is making a major contribution to research, studying stem cell research and autism. Adam Harris is also in the Visitors Gallery. He has become a leading advocate for people with autism. Also here this evening is another young man with autism, Seán Molloy. Who knows what great things Seán is going to do in the future?</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> There is so much that these wonderful people have to offer us. We can learn so much from them. Even if they do not become leading lights in any area, they teach us so much about ourselves. When I was Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I often said that to give is often more rewarding than to receive. Understanding what challenges others have to face in order to get by in a way that we take for granted is equally enriching. I appreciate the Minister of State waiting and will let her go lest we lose a vote.</p>
