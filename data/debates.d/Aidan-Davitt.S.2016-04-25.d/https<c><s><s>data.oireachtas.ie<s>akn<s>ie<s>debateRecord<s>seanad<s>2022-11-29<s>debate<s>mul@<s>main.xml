          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from the following Senators that they propose to raise the following matters:Senator Rónán Mullen - The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the reported decision to make telemedicine remote consultation a permanent feature of termination of pregnancy services.Senator Robbie Gallagher - The need for the Minister for Health to outline the methodology used to evaluate staff in the phase 4 job evaluation scheme for HSE support staff grades completed earlier this year.Senator Martin Conway - The need for the Minister for Health to make a statement on the proposed timeline for the establishment of a citizens' assembly on drug use.Senator Malcolm Byrne - The need for the Minister for Health to provide an update on the proposed primary care centre at Gorey, County Wexford and the HSE clinic building at Camolin, County. Wexford.Senator Seán Kyne - The need for the Minister for Health to provide an update on Saolta plans to redevelop facilities at University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park Hospital. Senator Ollie Crowe - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on the affordable housing schemes being progressed by Galway City Council and Galway County Council.Senator Marie Sherlock - The need for the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to make a statement on the status of the review of income thresholds for housing adaptation grants.Senator Erin McGreehan - The need for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine to make a statement on the carbon sequestration of agricultural land. Senator Emer Currie - The need for the Minister for Transport to make a statement on the frequency and capacity of the M3 Parkway to docklands train service. Of the matters raised by the Senators suitable for discussion, I have selected Senators Rónán Mullen, Robbie Gallagher, Martin Conway and Malcolm Byrne and they will be taken now. I regret that I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Marie Sherlock on the ground that it is a repeat of a Commencement matter raised on 9 November 2022. I regret that I had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Emer Currie on the ground that the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter. The other Senators may give notice on another day of the matters that they wish to raise.</p>

            <p eId="para_2">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, to the Seanad Chamber. The first Commencement matter is Senator Rónán Mullen's.</p>

          <speech by="#RonanMullen" eId="spk_3">
            <from>Senator Rónán Mullen<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T13:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_3">Go raibh míle maith agat agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I welcome the Minister of State although it has to be said that the issue I am raising today has nothing to do with international road transport and logistics or with postal policy and Eircodes. That is not to take from the Minister of State's very fine contribution as a politician and as a Minister of State. However, I requested that we postpone this until such time as there was a Minister from the actual Department dealing with the matter available but yet again the Seanad is not being treated with the respect that it deserves by the Government. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State or to her commitment or indeed interest in the issue I am raising.</p>
            <p eId="para_4"> The concern I am raising today is about the remote consultation or so-called telemedicine abortion and specifically the suggestion that it will soon become permanent. It was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> in an article of 12 November that the Government intends to make remote consultation and at home abortion a permanent fixture of Irish abortion policy. We have been living with this policy since April 2020 when it was first introduced as a response of the outbreak of Covid-19. However, the suggestion that telemedicine should now become a permanent feature of Irish abortion law is very serious. This is a radical change to the operation of the law, particularly in contrast to how it was envisioned when the Bill was drafted. When the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 was being drafted, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, assured members of the health committee that under the law, women would be seen physically for consultations and that absolutely termination of pregnancy services in Ireland would not be done by telemedicine. That was stated at a meeting of the health committee on 6 November 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_5"> In a letter from March 2021, the Secretary General of the Department of Health confirmed that once the pandemic ended, temporary telemedicine provisions in relation to abortion would lapse. Unfortunately, when most Covid regulations were lifted at the start of this year, the policy of remote consultations continued. This was despite the absence of an independent investigation or study into the operation of telemedicine abortion in this country. Indeed, the HSE acknowledged that it is wholly reliant on secondary literature from Britain.</p>
            <p eId="para_6"> If the Government intends to make this radical change to Ireland's abortion law, surely it should be done in a transparent and open way by bringing forth amending legislation to the current abortion Act to explicitly provide for terminations by remote consultation. At least then there would be an opportunity for parliamentarians to scrutinise proposals, highlighting some of the issues that have already been raised in this Chamber by Senator Sharon Keogan and me. There are many concerns about safeguarding and physical risk to women's health associated with telemedicine abortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_7"> The HSE acknowledged in a letter of 3 March 2022 that meeting the woman in person increases the likelihood of the provider being able to identify any coercion or domestic abuse. With remote consultations it is more likely that the most vulnerable women will fall through the cracks. Removing in-built safeguards like a physical consultation and the privacy afforded by a GP surgery is sheer recklessness. As was reported in the <i>Irish Examiner </i>on 24 October, a teenage Irish girl was locked in a room and given abortion tablets in order to force a termination. That is not an isolated incident. A recent Savanta ComRes poll in the UK found that 15% of women aged between 18 and 44 said they experienced pressure to go through with an abortion that they did not want. Telemedicine enables coercive abortion and makes it more difficult to help the women who desperately need help.</p>
            <p eId="para_8"> The Government's first priority should be protecting women in abusive relationships and the victims of human trafficking. In the light of these developments, one would have to wonder about that and about the Government's priorities.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T13:05:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_9">I thank Senator Mullen. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. He welcomes this opportunity to update the House on this important matter. I would like to thank Senator Mullen for raising the issue. The model of care for the termination of pregnancy service became operational in January 2019 following the enactment and commencement of the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_10"> Termination up to nine weeks' gestation is carried out in the community by GPs or doctors working in family planning and women's health clinics, providing clinical supervision and supporting women's self-management. Women with a pregnancy between nine and 12 weeks' gestation are referred for hospital-based care. The arrival of Covid-19 in 2020 required a substantial shift in how care was provided across the health service, including the adoption of measures to facilitate social distancing and reduce personal contacts and footfall in medical facilities as appropriate. As part of the Government's ongoing efforts to protect public health and limit the spread of Covid-19, the Department of Health and the HSE worked together in 2020 to agree a revised model of care which put in place arrangements to allow termination-of-pregnancy services in early pregnancy to be provided remotely. For the duration of the Covid-19 public health emergency the need for social distancing, reducing personal contacts and reducing the burden on medical practitioners were paramount. It became possible for a woman to access a termination under section 12 of the Health (Regulation of the Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 before 12 weeks from her medical practitioner by telephone or via conference consultation. Engagement is ongoing between the Department of Health and the HSE to monitor service provision, to facilitate the smooth running of the termination-of-pregnancy service and to resolve any issues that may arise. However, as restrictions began to ease, it became timely to revisit the model of care, to review its operation and to consider whether remote consultation, as part of a blended approach to termination-of-pregnancy care, should be continued after the Covid-19 public health emergency period. At the request of the Department, the HSE conducted a review of the revised model of care of termination of pregnancy, taking into consideration the experiences of healthcare providers, service-users and international best practice. The review found that the majority of providers in primary care feel that a blend of remote and in-person care is optimal. In-person consultations allow provision of personalised care and allow potential problems to be identified and mitigated, while remote provision improves access for many women and addresses geographical and logistical barriers. It also alleviates some of the difficulties associated with the mandatory three-day waiting period. The review also found that the provision of a remote consultation as part of the termination-of-pregnancy services was safe, effective and acceptable to both service-users and providers.</p>

            <p eId="para_11">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. What is going on is that the Government is driven by the advice promoted by campaigning groups that prioritise ease of access over various threats to women's health and well-being. I mentioned the issue of safeguarding, but the physical risks to women's health associated with telemedicine abortion should be also addressed. If no physical consultation takes place and a women self-reports the gestational age of her pregnancy incorrectly and the stage of pregnancy is underestimated, having an at-home, do-it-yourself abortion, with the pills supplied via telemedicine could lead to disastrous health consequences. Ectopic pregnancies could go unidentified. If a medical self-abortion is attempted on that, the potential for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy is heightened and that could lead to severe health risks. I wonder whether the Government cares about any of that or is simply interested in listening to what abortion activist groups want.</p>

The Government is committed to providing timely access to a high-quality safe termination-of-pregnancy service as close to home or the community as possible.

            <p eId="para_13">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> It is often the case that the nature of a person's job changes over time and a re-evaluation process may be required to ensure fair remuneration and conditions for staff. Such an evaluation has been carried out in the health sector recently. However, while most workers received a recommendation of higher grades, it appears that some categories of employee were completely ignored. Those not recommended for any upgrade include cleaners, laundry workers, domestics, groundsmen and gardeners. Naturally, these staff feel they have been ignored by the process and are asking why. The evaluation was a joint exercise between the union and the employer using a pre-established formula from early phases. A report, including costs, was recently submitted to the Department of Health for review.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">It is now with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform awaiting sanction. None of the recommendations has been implemented to date as we await a response from the Department. As I outlined, the evaluation of support-staff grades was conducted and housekeeping-domestic staff were the only department not to move up a band. These staff are deeply disappointed by this decision. They feel undervalued and taken for granted and can see no logical explanation for this decision. They are disillusioned with the union, the communications process and the way the evaluation was completed and are now considering industrial action. They feel the whole job-evaluation process was flawed and ask the HSE to take immediate action to rectify the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> Hospitals cannot be run without housekeeping and domestic staff. They are vital members of the hospital team. They are a vital cog in the wheel who do difficult and demanding work. They worked through the pandemic in difficult circumstances and they are essential staff that simply cannot be done without. It would be deeply disappointing and disruptive to the hospital system if they felt the need to strike. I ask the Minister intervene on behalf of the hardworking and dedicated people affected by this.</p>

            <from>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T13:15:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_17">I thank the Senator. I am taking this question on behalf of the Minister for Health. It is important to acknowledge the crucial work housekeeping staff carry out in our health service every day.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> The job evaluation scheme is an assessment of the responsibilities and tasks undertaken by support staff across the health service. Under the provisions of the Lansdowne Road agreement, it was agreed that this job evaluation process would be conducted in four phases. Phase one commenced in 2017 and examined personnel employed in central sterile services departments, CSSD; endoscopy and laboratory aides and assistants; and the broader laboratory family and theatre group. Phase 2 comprised healthcare assistants and multi-task attendants. Phase 3 looked at home help and home care workers. The scheme is now in its fourth phase and is evaluating the work undertaken by household attendants, catering staff and porters, together with any remaining grades provided for under the existing scheme that were not evaluated in phases 1, 2 or 3.</p>
            <p eId="para_19"> The methodology for evaluating the roles during the different phases involved an examination of a cross-section of staff by role type in a number of agreed locations covering healthcare services in acute hospitals, care of the elderly facilities, mental health facilities, community and other relevant services. At the beginning of the job-evaluation process, the national monitoring group was established, comprising senior HSE and SIPTU officials. During phase 4 the national monitoring group held regular meetings to discuss and review progress. Both sides worked to identify employees in these roles who would be willing to participate in the review process. The phase 4 evaluation team consisted of four evaluators. The methodology for the evaluation process was agreed by the national monitoring group. Job holders completed questionnaires that were analysed by evaluators. Site visits took place and in-depth interviews were held. The evaluators' job was to determine the nature of the role; the skills and competencies required to undertake the role; the size and scope of the role; and the range of tasks, responsibilities and demands placed upon a suitably-qualified employee performing it. Upon completion of each job-specific interview, the evaluation team scored the job. This score determined the grade band the role should fall into. The job evaluation scheme was established to assess the work undertaken by staff and, subsequently, to determine whether any changes in their bands of pay were necessary based of the specific set of determiners. Depending on the number of points received, a particular grade may be recommended to move from one band to another. However, equally and without prejudice, the number of points received may also determine that a particular grade should remain on the same pay going forward. All recommendations made were evidence based and determined without prejudice. The phase 4 report is under consideration by the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">I thank the Minister of State for her response.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> I said at the outset that these people - domestics, porters and other staff affected by this - are deeply disappointed that they have been overlooked. It is fair to say that many of these people are not on the highest grades to begin with.</p>
            <p eId="para_22">Many of them will be struggling financially, like many other people, to make ends meet. From a simple base, I find it difficult to understand how such an important cog in a wheel and such an important member of the hospital team has been left out. We can talk about methodology and all the rest until the cows come home but these people have been left behind. They put their shoulders to the wheel, as many other health professionals did, during the pandemic. Now, it would appear that through this process they are being forgotten. It is deeply unfair. I ask that the Government, the Minister for Health and others look at this again so that these people will be included, as they are entitled to be.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I thank the Senator. The Government acknowledges that current inflationary pressures present challenges and are a source of concern for public service workers. In acknowledgement of inflationary pressures and the rising cost of living, a review of the existing public service agreement, Building Momentum, was conducted this summer. This led to parties agreeing to an extension of the terms of Building Momentum by 12 months to 31 December 2023. As such, along with the pay increases due under the original agreement, public servants will also receive a further increase in basic salaries of 3% backdated to 2 February 2022, an increase of 2% from 1 March 2023 and an increase of 1.5% or €750, whichever is higher, on 1 October 2023. These additional pay increases due under the extension to Building Momentum were cost-of-living measures to help public servants over the next number of years. The Government is keen that all pay rises due are paid to public and civil servants as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Regarding the job evaluation scheme, there was no guarantee from the beginning that all grades evaluated would receive an uplift. The recommendations under phase 4 of the scheme were made without prejudice based on a specific set of criteria and scoring methodology. It is important to remind the Senator that no sanction has yet been received on the findings of phase 4 of the job evaluation scheme and therefore no recommendations have been implemented. As this is an ongoing process, it would be inappropriate to advise further at this point.</p>

            <p eId="para_25">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, to the House on this important issue. We all know that families the length and breadth of the country have been impacted by the drugs crisis. This crisis is impacting on counties, cities, towns, parishes, villages, streets and street corners and young, middle-aged and even older people. It is an epidemic, which Governments throughout the world are struggling to come to terms with. It is important to acknowledge the work of Europol in recent days and the astronomical success it had seizing so much cocaine. Unfortunately, that is on the tip of the iceberg; drugs are all over Europe and the world. This country is no different.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> Traditionally, people who were caught with illegal substances were dealt with through the justice system. Slowly but surely, we are seeing a health-led approach, rightly so. When I was member of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice I visited Portugal to see how the Portuguese were dealing with people who had an addiction to drugs and also those caught with drugs on a first offence. They adopted a health-led approach. They put a suite of services around these people, such as addiction counselling, health services and various supports. It was remarkably successful in helping to encourage people off drugs. The system that pertained in this country was a legalistic approach whereby people who were caught with drugs received a conviction. Convictions did not become spent and this could become an issue for anyone trying to go to America or other countries a few years later.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> I am glad to say the mindset in this country is moving towards taking a health-led approach. That is largely due to the work the justice committee did under the leadership of its former Chair, Deputy Stanton. The report the committee commissioned was ground-breaking and challenged the system at the time. It was supported by a suite of NGOs that believed the same thing. The problem is the prevalence of drugs in our society and how to deal with it in a more fundamental way. I welcome the proposal to set up a citizens' assembly to engage with citizens from all backgrounds and none on how to frame future policy on drugs. This will probably be the most important citizens' assembly done during the lifetime of this Government. I struggle to understand why there were citizens' assemblies on biodiversity and having an elected mayor of Dublin ahead of a citizens' assembly on drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">Drugs destroy lives; the Lord Mayor of Dublin does not. While biodiversity is an important issue, the more immediate issue is how to help save our communities from the ravages of drugs.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> When can we expect the citizens' assembly on drugs to be established? What will its terms of reference be? It cannot be pigeonholed into the single issue of whether we should legalise cannabis or take other specific approaches. The cannabis lobby is strong and we all have engaged and listened to arguments about medicinal cannabis. That is a separate debate. I want the terms of reference of the citizens' assembly on drugs to be broad and to allow scope to drill down and look at best international practice and how we can bring those good practices in other countries into play in Ireland. I worry that the terms of reference could be too focused and narrow. While they are important, what is most important at this stage is that we get a date for when the citizens' assembly will be established and we will be able to study the terms of reference. Perhaps we could have a debate in the Houses on the terms of reference when they are made available.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I thank the Senator. I am taking this Commencement matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. I welcome the opportunity to update the House regarding this topic. Senators will be aware that the Department of Health co-ordinates the implementation of the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery, which is a health-led response to drugs and alcohol use. We have identified six strategic priorities for the remaining period up to 2025. These priorities reinforce the health-led approach to drug and alcohol use and capture the commitments in the programme for Government. Strategic implementation groups have identified actions to implement the priorities under auspices of the national oversight committee. The groups reflect the partnership approach and give a stronger voice to civil society in implementation of the strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_31"> As Senators are aware, the programme for Government includes a commitment to convene a citizens' assembly to consider matters relating to drug use. The Government is committed to establishing the citizens' assembly on drug use, along with a citizens' assembly on the future of education, at the earliest opportunity in 2023 following the completion of the assemblies currently under way. The timelines and terms of reference for the next assemblies will be a matter for the Oireachtas to agree. It is anticipated that the Government will consider the matter early in the new ear, following which motions will be put before Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann for debate, setting out timelines and terms of reference for the new assemblies.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The Department of Health has commenced preparations for the citizens' assembly on drug use and discussions regarding the assembly have taken place at the national oversight committee for the national drug strategy. The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, is positive about the potential contribution of the citizens' assembly to the Government's health-led response to drug use. Drug use affects all members of society, as the Senator said, whether directly or indirectly, and imposes a significant financial and social cost. Involving citizens in decision-making on drugs policy is therefore appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> There are two issues in particular that the citizens' assembly on drug use could consider. The first is how to better meet the diverse health needs of people who use drugs, while the second is how to prevent the harmful impact of drugs on children, families and communities. It is important to have an international component to the citizens' assembly so there is an exchange of good practice from the British-Irish Council work sector on drugs and the EU drugs strategy and action plan, especially on alternative approaches to coercive sanctions. The voices and perspectives of young people on issues regarding drug policy should also inform the deliberation of the citizens' assembly on drug use. Officials from the Department of Health are engaging with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth to undertake a consultation with young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_34">I thank the Minister of State for giving a specific timeline. I take it the citizens' assembly on drugs will be up and running by the end of quarter 1 2023, which is welcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">I also welcome the suggested potential discussion points that will be in the terms of reference regarding the health implications of drugs on our citizens, and indeed, the implications of drugs on young people and children. They are certainly areas which should be examined by the citizens' assembly on drugs which is now anticipated to take place early in the new year. That is very welcome. I also encourage people with an interest who are watching in today to contact the Minister of Health and write to him with their views, ideas, and suggestions as to what the citizens' assembly should do because this will be a once in a generation opportunity for the people of Ireland to frame drugs policy going forward. That is something that is very welcome and I encourage all stakeholders and citizens to engage ahead of the drafting of the terms of reference. I look forward to debating the timelines, and indeed the terms of reference, in this House when they are published and when the motions are brought before us by Government. Again, I thank the Minister for providing a very specific timeline which is welcome because I know this issue is coming up in Dáil Éireann later on today - or certainly this week. I think we are in a position today in the Seanad to announce that this citizens' assembly will take place early in the new year. </p>

            <p eId="para_36">I thank the Senator and assure him of the Government’s commitment and determination to implement the health-led approach to drug use as set out in the national drug strategy. Not only does the programme for Government commit to the citizens' assembly on drug use but it also commits to implementing the health diversion programme for people who are in possession of drugs for personal use. This programme will connect participants with health services, provide a pathway to recovery and allow participants to avoid a criminal conviction. An implementation group chaired by the Department of Health is finalising plans for the commencement of this programme and the HSE is actively expanding its capacity to provide health interventions and support for people who are found in possession of any drugs for personal use. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Feighan, looks forward to the commencement of the health diversion programme which will represent a radical change in how people who use drugs are engaged with by the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh Gníomhaigh, agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I appreciate him taking the time to address this issue. This is an issue which I also raised as a Commencement matter on 11 May. It concerns two healthcare facilities in north Wexford. One is the opening of the planned primary care centre in Gorey and the other is the case of a building which has being closed for eight years but is still owned by the HSE; that is the health centre based at Camolin, County Wexford.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> We have been told consistently about the opening of the primary care centre in Gorey. In fact, 18 months ago the HSE said everything was on track. On the basis of answers it gave then regarding the developer being in place and planning permission and so on, it should have been opened by now. The most recent correspondence I received from the HSE was from 14 October when its representatives said that the project at Gorey was ready to proceed once some parking issues had been removed. I was told on 14 October that everything else such as planning permission and funding was in order. I have since been seeking an update as to what the position is. Gorey in north Wexford, as members know, is one of the fastest growing areas in the country. There is an urgent need for further primary care in healthcare and we had anticipated that this new primary care centre would be open by now. I am hoping the Minister of State will provide an update on the position of this centre in her response. </p>
            <p eId="para_39"> The second issue I raise concerns the health centre in Camolin. This is a fine building which is owned by the HSE. It was closed amid much local opposition in 2014 and essentially the HSE has done - as far as I can see - nothing about it in the eight years since. It has not been operating as a health centre and it has not been converted to accommodation or for use by community groups. In 2018, the HSE stated it would approach various agencies and if they were not interested, it would put the building on the market. This is, of course, where they did not respond to the interests of locals about taking it over. When I asked the question in May this year, I was told that this was still being done and that the title of the property was being checked. Therefore, eight years after the HSE closed this very fine building and after many queries going in, the HSE was still checking the title. The Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, who took the Commencement matter in May, indicated and agreed with me that it was simply not acceptable that it was taking that long. </p>
            <p eId="para_40">I sought an update from the HSE on 14 October and 11 November but failed to get a response on what is happening with this closed health centre in Camolin. The HSE said it was going to approach various agencies and, if that did not work, it would put the building on the market. I am not aware of any other local State agencies that have been approached about taking the building over and, as far as I am aware, it is not on the market. Following eight years of closure and complete inaction by the HSE, I hope the Minister of State will be able to impart some knowledge as to what is happening with this building, particularly when, as we know, there is a huge demand for property whether for housing to home displaced persons or refugees, or for community groups or other purposes. The fact that this fine building remains there and the HSE has done nothing about it remains a big concern. I hope the Minister of State will be able to update us.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Health, who asked me to thank the Senator for raising the issue and welcomes the opportunity to provide an update to the House on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> With regard to the HSE clinic building at Camolin, County Wexford, which is a former health centre that is currently vacant, this is a detached building on its own site that is owned freehold by the HSE. In line with the ongoing Government initiatives in respect of sourcing suitable properties for use in the provision of accommodation under Housing for All, and also as part of the Ukrainian accommodation response, the HSE has offered the site to the Land Development Agency, local authorities and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The Department of Health and the HSE acknowledge the urgent and important work done in conjunction with other Departments and bodies to source properties suitable for providing accommodation and will continue to contribute to efforts to address the current urgent policy imperatives supporting Housing for All, in addition to the provision of accommodation to Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I thank the Minister of State for taking the question. With regard to the primary care centre in Gorey, I note the words used by the Minister of State were that the "process was almost complete", which is the same answer I got previously and the time before that. I do not see why we cannot proceed. I realise there is an issue around parking but if everything else can proceed, let us, for want of a better phrase, park that issue and resolve it separately. We need the primary care centre. The parking issue can be resolved. I do not want to have to stand in the Chamber again next year asking the same question and be told once more the centre is almost complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_44"> At least, we have some further information regarding the clinic building in Camolin. It is not entirely clear. What looks like has finally happened in the past few weeks is that the HSE is offering this building to house displaced persons from Ukraine. From reading the Minister of State's response, that looks like what is being offered. I would like clarity on that. I am quite happy that the building be used for some purpose. This seems to be what the HSE is indicating will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_45">I welcome it if it is the case that at least it is put to short-term use but it is not entirely clear from the answer if this is what is planned, or if it is once again just some form of speculation. It is also not clear that the legal title issue has been resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_46">I can ask the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, to come back to the Senator to give him specific clarification as I am taking this question on his behalf. On behalf of the Minister, I again thank the Senator for raising this matter. The Minister understands how vital these developments are for local communities across the country. With regard to the vacant clinic building, as mentioned, the Department of Health and the HSE are committed to supporting the work being done to address the urgent need for properties. At the present time, no decision has been communicated to the Department of Health in respect of the use of Camolin health centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> Investment in primary care services and facilities is an important part of the Sláintecare vision and the development of primary care centres remains a strategic priority for the Government. These facilities provide a single point of access to health services and offer a means of supporting people to live independently in their own communities for as long as possible. Significant progress continues to be made in the development and roll-out of primary care centres and 160 are now fully operational. Thirteen of these have opened this year alone and a further 19 are at various stages of the construction and equipping process, with five of these scheduled to become operational before the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The Senator will, I am sure, be aware that Wexford has benefited and will continue to benefit from the Government's investment in primary care. Further to the new primary care centre for Gorey that we have been discussing today, a centre in New Ross is also in the early stages of planning. This is in addition to the four Wexford primary care centres already operational, including a new primary care centre in Enniscorthy which opened this year. I am sure we can all agree that these purpose-built facilities have a key role to play in supporting the health of local communities and in transforming the way we deliver healthcare in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">Today, I wish to raise the case of Alejandro Miszan, the nine-year-old boy from Enniscorthy who was mauled by a pitbull at the weekend. The story is covered by the media. It is told in particular detail by Ms Amy Molloy in the <i>Irish Independent</i> but Alejandro's brother, Raul, was on RTÉ as well this morning outlining the impact that this incident has had. The injuries that this nine-year-old has suffered are life-changing but this event has not only impacted on him; it has also impacted on his family, on those who would have seen the attack and, indeed, on the wider community in Enniscorthy in County Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Unfortunately, we are seeing far too many of these attacks by some of these dogs. As the House will be aware, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 place particular restrictions on 11 different breeds. There are requirements that these animals must be muzzled in public and, indeed, that they should be held on a strong lead at all times by somebody over the age of 16. It is clear because we know there was another attack in Dublin earlier this year. In fact, Dogs Trust Ireland reported that in 2020 there were 320 people hospitalised due to dog bites.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> I hope that Alejandro and his family can come through this as well as they can. I pay tribute to the crew of Coast Guard Rescue 117, who airlifted the boy to Crumlin Children's Hospital, and to those who work in Crumlin, but we need to do more. These attacks are becoming far too common. Ms Molloy reports that between 2016 and 2021, there were 1,705 attacks on humans by dogs. There is also concern about attacks on livestock. </p>
          <p eId="para_53">In the same period, there have been 1,351 attacks on livestock, according to the Garda. Clearly, the regulations that are in place are not strong enough. It must be asked whether we should continue to allow some of these dangerous dogs to be licensed at all. I fear it is only a matter of time before a child potentially loses his or her life as a result of one of these attacks. For the sake of those children, and particularly Alejandro and what he has experienced, we need to take action. I ask that we look at a review of the control of dogs regulations. It is time to consider a ban on these 11 breeds, or certainly stronger regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I ask that the Leader contact the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding an issue that has been raised by former Civil Service and Coillte pensioners, many of whom are on fixed incomes and have received no pension increase since 2007. The Forestry Act 1988 established Coillte and provided for the transfer of staff from the then Department of Energy to Coillte. Sections 43 and 44 set out the key provisions of the Act applying to the transfer of staff. The Act provided protections to the staff, which they relied upon, including a statutory requirement that their terms and services of employment would be no less favourable than those applying to the Civil Service. In addition, section 44(4) provides that the pension scheme "shall be no less favourable in its conditions than those enjoyed by the transferred members from 1 January 1989". Prior to that date, transferred staff had access to a non-contributory pension scheme within the Civil Service, with the long-established practice whereby pensions were increased in line with general pay increases. Coillte continued to operate the pension scheme in the same manner until 2008. Notwithstanding the protections afforded under the Act, there have been a number of employee pay increases without corresponding increases in the pensions of retired staff. While some members may have access to a State contributory pension, many others rely solely on a pension that has not increased since 2007. It is clear this stage that the actions of the company, with the apparent consent of the Minister of the day, have brought the staff transferred from the Department of Energy to Coillte to less favourable conditions than those enjoyed prior to the establishment of the company. In particular, the company's actions have sought to break the link between pay increases and pensions. I ask the Leader to contact the Minister. This is a national campaign by former Coillte civil servants and pensioners. We are talking about approximately 1,443 pensioners. I believe they have a strong case, based on the commitments given when Coillte was established under the Act. I will certainly be raising the matter directly here at a future date if possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">It is high time we had a serious adult conversation about immigration in this country. By serious, I mean both appreciating the gravity of the situation and seriously looking for a solution as a result of that. By adult, I mean a conversation devoid of name-calling or labelling other speakers to allow people to dismiss their points out of hand, rather than engaging and addressing valid concerns. Up until now, perhaps we have had time to indulge that particular parliamentary laziness but that time has passed. It is time to sit down, acknowledge the problems and begin to hash out some solutions. Us Irish are a placid bunch. It takes a lot to get us riled up. Successive Governments have relied on this and implemented policies that the citizens of other countries would not stand for, but we are getting there. We do not do French-style protests but we did with the water charges and it worked. We are heading there now again with immigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I am sure many nicely-bound roadmaps and strategy documents exist laying out the Government's approach to inward migration into this country but what it looks like on the ground is this: the Government will not refuse migrants for fear of being called racist, xenophobic or uncaring. Having nowhere to adequately house these migrants, the Government must spend millions of euro renting hotels and converting office blocks in the greater Dublin area and surrounding counties, almost exclusively in areas that have historically been working class and-or commuter or satellite towns. Having secured such premises, the Government rents private buses to transfer large crowds of migrants into these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">If the locals are lucky, they may get some warning. The migrants are provided with a few paltry meals per day and left to their own devices. It seems in many cases they are left to wander around the towns and engage in antisocial behaviour such as fighting or harassment. Does that sound like caring for anyone? It does not benefit the locals and it does not sound as though it benefits the migrants either.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">This country, due to the policies of successive Governments, does not have the structural capacity to take in tens of thousands of migrants annually, yet this Government continues to do so. It is a policy devoid of reason and something has to change. There is still time to stop this from getting any worse. Let us start by having an adult conversation in this House with the relevant Ministers.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">Ireland is by no means full. That rhetoric is quite dangerous and normally utilised by the far right. Senator Keogan needs to understand the difference between a migrant and an asylum seeker or refugee. People come here fleeing conflict, war and climate devastation in their countries and communities certainly need to be prepared and enabled for that. The vast majority of communities are open to that and prepared to open their arms to refugees and asylum seekers. The migrants the Senator speaks about come here to work in our healthcare service and hospitality sector and provide first-class services to our people. I am well up for an adult conversation but I want it to be rooted in reality and facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> I wished to begin by reflecting on last Friday's judgment in the Aidan McAnespie case and commending the McAnespie family for their campaign of more than 30 years to fight for truth and justice for Aidan. The family finally had their day in court and their message to all other victims campaigning for truth and justice to never give up resonates with all of us. I know a number of colleagues called for a discussion last week on the issue of the British Government's so-called legacy Bill which, at its core, seeks to shut down those avenues of truth and justice for all families. I reiterate and support that call to have a debate on the British Government's legacy Bill, which Senators will remember this House unanimously rejected in a motion at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> Today is also UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. It is, therefore, timely that we ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to update the House on what measures the State is taking to address Israel's policies of apartheid and how we are supporting the Palestinian people in their efforts for justice and peace. Perhaps it is worth considering, something we can explore this outside the Chamber, inviting the Palestinian ambassador to the House for next year's UN International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People on 29 November and flying the Palestinian flag above Leinster House in an expression of solidarity, given that we also fly the UN flag.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">I wish to raise Defence Forces issues with the Leader once again. I read a number of comments by Lieutenant Colonel Conor King, general secretary of the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, in advance of its annual conference, which takes place in Kildare today. This morning, Lieutenant Colonel King outlined his fears about the growing retention crisis in the Defence Forces, stating that the forces had lost 500 personnel across all ranks in the past 18 months and that the total force now numbered 7,750, including those in training. We are all aware that the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces calls for a serving strength of 11,500 personnel. Like its fellow representative association, Permanent Defence Forces Representative Association, PDFORRA, RACO will today state that the failure to implement the working time directive is having a detrimental effect on recruitment, retention, morale and work-life balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> The Minister for Defence recently attended the House for a debate on neutrality, but a number of questions that colleagues and I posed to him remain unanswered. We are nine months on from the publication of the commission's report. For the sake of the future of the Defence Forces, we need to see action on the working time directive, which is one of the report's recommendations. I support both representative associations in their call for action on this important matter. Will the Leader dedicate some time early in the new year for a debate on the first full year of the report's publication and where its recommendations stand?</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> I also support recent calls for a debate with the Minister for Transport on a growing number of issues around public transport, including rail. In recent weeks, I have been contacted by a number of commuters who are experiencing problems at rail stations throughout south Kildare. In a previous Private Members' debate, I mentioned that the disabled toilets were not open at Newbridge and other stations. I have been informed that they will only be open when staff are present, but it seems that is not happening in practice. The Leader can imagine the problems this causes for people in need of such a facility in an emergency. There are also issues with the opening of waiting rooms, with the one in Athy rail station closed for a considerable period. I am informed that this is because of staff issues. I have been assured by Irish Rail that it is working on resolving these issues. In light of the unpredictable winter weather that we are experiencing, though, doing so must be a priority for Irish Rail. It is not good enough that commuters paying substantial fees are left out in the cold.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> I support the call by the chairperson of the Kildare Down's syndrome group, Ms Cassandra Ryan, for a temporary premises to house the great work it does. Ms Ryan made a call on my local radio station, Kfm. With Councillor Angela Feeney, we supported the group's calls for assistance from the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, at its current premises. Thankfully, the group has received an extension until June. Ms Ryan informed us this morning that the group had located a permanent site but that, due to planning and building issues, it would not be ready for 18 months. Hence our call to anyone who may be able to assist the group with a premises from June for that 18-month period. Through a number of parents who have contacted me, I am aware of the great work that the group carries out and I hope that someone will be able to assist it with a premises.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">I wish to discuss the horrific mauling of Alejandro Miszan and the seven or eight other such cases that have happened throughout Ireland this year, mainly to young kids. When researching this issue, I saw that a woman who had two small dogs with her had been attacked and severely disfigured by a listed dog. There is a list of ten restricted dog breeds. Owners are responsible for their dogs and control of same.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">We have the Control of Dogs Act 1986. The Act was updated in 1998 and other amendments have subsequently been made. The legislation stipulates a maximum fine of €2,500, which is at the strongest end of the punishments in this case. The legislation contains a lot of on-the-spot fines and whatever else as well. It is a common sight to see the breeds on the proscribed list of dogs not muzzled in public. One can see them anywhere in Ireland when one walks through a park. The owners should know better and realise that their dogs should be muzzled at all times when in public. As laid out in the law these animals are meant to be muzzled, be on a short lead, and the person in charge of them must be over 16 years of age. The law is very specific, clear and easy to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I ask the Leader to convey up the line that we must strengthen these laws. Also, we must ensure that the owners who break the law should have the full rigour of the law brought to bear on them and i would go as far as to say that should be up to and including jail terms. It is unacceptable to have these animals loose and running around, particularly in parks where there are likely to be children. I firmly believe that anyone who thinks they can do so should face a jail term. </p>

          <p eId="para_83">I agree with what my colleagues, Senators Davitt and Malcolm Byrne, said about these dogs. I would love to know how many people have been convicted for breaching the legislation in terms of not muzzling their dogs and I think that it would be an interesting statistic. I hope that we will now have a national debate on this issue. More of these animals should be added to the list of prohibited breeds. Of course, our sympathies go to the family of the young man in Wexford who was attacked and our thoughts are with him at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> I welcome the human tissue Bill that has gone through Cabinet today. The Bill is long overdue. The work was commenced by the health committee, which was chaired by Senator Buttimer during the 2011 to 2016 Oireachtas term. The committee did great work to advance this very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> I believe that most people in society would willingly carry an organ donor card. However, they do not get around to it for one reason or another so do not have one in their possession and are deemed, at this moment in time, as not being carriers such cards. Thankfully, that situation will change and people can just opt out if they do not wish their organs to be donated in the case of an accident where a person, unfortunately, loses his or her life. Such legislative provision is a great day's work. </p>

I also welcome the approval from Cabinet today. I commend the Leader of the House, Senator Regina Doherty, who was with me on the health committee. I, too, lament that it took so long for the legislation to reach this point. Senator Conway asked the very good question why it took so long.

Those of us from Cork recognise that the roads in our city are gridlocked and at full capacity. Representatives of TII will come before the transport committee this evening. I appeal to them to continue to improve the road signage as motorists approach Dunkettle from the east and west and, in fact, from all sides.

          <p eId="para_103">I bring greetings from Poland, where I attended an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, meeting last week in the parliamentary Chamber in Warsaw. I visited alongside Senator Cassells and Members of the Dáil and we were assisted by members of the Irish Embassy in Poland, who always do us proud, receive us well and brief us well. Two things were palpable during our visit. First, everywhere we went, we were met with endorsement and warmth from the people of Poland for what the Irish people have done for their country over many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> More important was the response from the many Ukrainians we met and spoke to at the OSCE meeting. One Ukrainian delegate read a short letter a little six-year-old boy called Ivan had written to St. Nicholas. The boy said in the letter he would not ask for the tricycle or toy train he asked for last Christmas and did not get. Instead, he had three requests, namely, that his father would come home, he would have light and he would have water. It was a very moving letter. The president of the OSCE suggested that we turn the entire Parliament into darkness and she then asked everyone to turn on the torch on their mobile telephones. It may be seen on the OSCE website and on Twitter how the beaming lights from the telephones of hundreds of delegates from all the jurisdictions of the OSCE shone on the ceiling of the Chamber. It was a reminder, albeit for a few minutes, of the darkness, isolation and loss the Ukrainian people are having to endure. The switching on of the light was a powerful gesture and I would like other Parliaments to take an opportunity to do the same between now and Christmas. The building was in darkness for five minutes and then we took our mobile telephones in our hands and shone out that light. It was not a very powerful light but it was a powerful and moving message.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Ukrainians are deeply moved by and thankful to us as a nation for what we have done for their people. I hope we will continue to do the same in a spirit of hospitality, kindness and generosity. I ask that we be patient and understanding of the difficulties in local communities. Yes, integration is very important and many people want and choose to remain in our country. I hope we will big enough and our arms wide enough to embrace them and keep them here. It is important that this House is regularly briefed on what is happening. We support what is happening and we also acknowledge that there are communication issues in communities that must be overcome. Let us be resolved and determined to be reasonable and responsible, to show political leadership and to embrace the challenges facing the people who seek a safe home in our land.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">As we approach Christmas, it would be timely to have a debate on the retail sector and how important it is to the Irish economy. Coming from a Border town like Dundalk, I have seen over the years how resilient both the retail sector and consumers have to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Over the decades we have had to deal with currency fluctuations on both sides of the Border, Covid and Brexit. An example of how we have become very resilient and developed individual ingenuity is the shop local voucher scheme that was initiated by Dundalk Chamber of Commerce five years ago. It was the brainchild of two local business people, Paddy Matthews and Paddy Malone. It started off as a €500 tax-free cash voucher given to businesses to gift to their employees instead of cash at Christmas. The concept was that it was usable in all local shops in Dundalk. What is most important about it is that it is a great way for a business to give tax-free money to its employees and the money goes directly back into the local economy. In each of the past five years, €1 million was raised. We are now in the last days of November and we have already reached €1 million. That figure is expected to reach €1.5 million by the end of the Christmas season. It is a great example of how to make sure money stays in a local economy. Dundalk was the pioneer of this approach. It has now been expanded to one or two other chambers of commerce. It is no longer just about business. We now have grandparents buying these vouchers for their grandchildren. In a year when shopping local is so important it is a great way to keep money in a local economy. It is something that other chambers of commerce throughout the country should consider. The budget for 2023 increased the amount it is possible to gift from €500 to €1,000. It is a great example of how the budget is putting more money into people's pockets. I would appreciate a debate on the Irish retail sector at some stage before Christmas.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">I will begin by welcoming the changes to the regulations on who can give blood. I am delighted that the ban on donations from men who have sex with men has come to an end. Many people played a role in this, including these Houses, NGOs and the Government. LGBT activists and groups have long advocated for reform of this discriminatory restriction. All donors will now be asked the same questions about their sexual activity regardless of gender or the sexual orientation of the donors or their sexual partners. This change will ensure a blood provision service that ensures patient safety and embraces inclusivity. I am delighted that men who have sex with men can now provide much-needed donations to the Irish Blood Transfusion Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> It is more than a year since welcomed the report on a family-friendly and inclusive Parliament. The recommendations contained in the report have the power to be transformative to the Houses of the Oireachtas and the lives of those who serve and work here. They are also accessible and achievable within this mandate. We are now halfway through this mandate and many of the key recommendations have not yet been implemented, including arrangements for proxy voting, greater flexible and remote working arrangements and the scheduling of a referendum to amend Article 15. I am particularly concerned about the delay in implementing recommendations that seek to address threats of political violence and harassment. Such abuse often originates online and can escalate into personal abuse and concerns about physical threats. No one should have to face threats to their safety and well-being in carrying out their duties as a representative. Unfortunately we know such threats disproportionately target women, the LGBT community and other minority representatives. These incidents directly impact the number of people from these groups who put themselves forward for election or re-election. A safe and healthy workplace free from such threats is not only necessary to ensure a diverse and inclusive Oireachtas but it is fundamental to democracy itself. The recommendations that specifically address these threats must be implemented as matter of urgency. It is time for all of us in the Houses to implement the full range of practical steps recommended by the family-friendly and inclusive Parliament report.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">Back in July 2021, a number of security firms received a High Court injunction preventing the Minister from moving ahead with an employment regulation order which I understand would have improved significantly the pay and conditions of staff who work in the security sector. Nothing further appears to have happened since. Many of these people work very long hours. They work very hard and are almost always in the front line. If possible I would like a debate on this issue in the House at the earliest opportunity given that costs have increased for families and working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">There has been a significant increase in the cost of living. These people working on the front line, many of whom work in our hospitals and do a really difficult job right around the clock, deserve to be paid. The Government has a wider project in place to secure a living-wage agreement and it has indicated this will be introduced in the coming budgets. However, that does not cut the mustard for people working in the security sector facing Christmas and all the burdens that come with it. For some, it is a joyous time. For those on low pay, it is a traumatic time, trying to meet the cost of bills while, at the same time, trying to provide a Christmas for their family. I ask that the Minister be invited to the House to explain what he intends to do in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">I wish to reflect on a public meeting I ran with my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, and Senator Sherlock in the Dublin Skylon Hotel, Drumcondra. It was about drugs policy and the decriminalisation of the drugs user. We had some incredible speakers on the panel, including former Dublin GAA player, Philly McMahon, Fr. Peter McVerry, who everyone knows about, and Anna Quigley of CityWide, who is probably the most knowledgeable person on anything to do with drug use and drug policy in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> It was a privilege to listen to people who have experienced addiction and whose families have been affected by it. We listened to stories from the audience and it was moving to be in a space in which they felt safe enough to talk about their personal addiction experience or how addiction affected their families and cost lives. One person said it cost multiple lives in her family and, by the luck of the draw, it did not affect her and she went down a different path. That should not be how things happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> There were some really difficult stories about family members who were lost. We did not prescribe how people would respond to the public meeting, but everyone who spoke from the panel and those who spoke about their personal experience, all agreed about decriminalisation and that if those addicts had not been criminalised, their lives would not have gone the way they did. A person spoke about how his brother being put into prison ended up being a rite of passage and made the situation even worse. His brother became one of the cool kids in his community and was even more hardened in his drug addiction. It was a rite of passage to be part of the grown-up gang of drug dealing and selling, and he died a couple of years later. Instead of treating a person's addiction, we try to criminalise it. Every person who spoke asked that if they or their family members had not been criminalised, what would their lives have looked like. It was profound that they all spoke about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_115"> We will table a motion in the Chamber tomorrow about drug policy reform and the decriminalisation of drugs, which will call for a date for the promised citizens' assembly on drugs. People who came to last night's meeting will be in the Public Gallery. They are people who have real, lived experiences of their own drug use or of drug use in their communities. They want to see Senators and the Government to taking a leading role in this regard. We have to have a citizens' assembly and we need to decriminalise it. Society is way ahead of the politicians. That meeting informed me as to where the people are on this subject, and it is time that we as politicians caught up.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">Others have mentioned that today is International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and I want to say a few words on this. There will be a vigil outside the GPO at 7 p.m. with the Palestinian ambassador. It would be great to see a large turnout at that because it is important to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> We rarely hear the figures of those who have died in the occupied territories. Since 1 January 2008, nearly 15 years ago, some 6,129 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied territories of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, including 1,389 children. Three lives were lost as of this morning. It appears we are somewhat immune to the deaths given hardly a day goes by that a Palestinian is not killed.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">There is also, and it is right to call it out, a hierarchy in death for the Palestinian people, whereby the world repeatedly tends to look away. There was a prime example of this in one of our broadsheet newspapers last week. A 555-word article that was about, rightly, the tragic killing of an Israeli teenager in Jerusalem ended with the sentence "Elsewhere in the West Bank, a 16-year-old Palestinian boy was killed by Israeli army gunfire on Tuesday night in clashes in Nablus". There are always "clashes" when a Palestinian child is killed. Palestinians deserve to be treated equally through their lives, and that extends to their deaths as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_119"> To end, I remember especially the Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who was brutally killed by the Israeli army in May while reporting and doing her job as a journalist from the occupied West Bank. There are strong reports she was targeted by the Israeli army. She was only 51 years of age. We cannot forget Israel's first reaction after her death, namely, the heavy-handed raid of her home and the confiscating of Palestinian flags. The Israeli authorities then refused to conduct a criminal investigation by saying there was no suspicion a criminal act had been committed. Those of us in Ireland should recognise that reaction. Again I ask Members to show solidarity to the Palestinian people and if they can, to be outside the GPO at 7 p.m.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I raise a matter related to the regional hospital but this time it is not the waiting lists, though in another way it is. I refer to the long Covid clinics, which were due to open but have not yet opened. There are at least 24 people on a waiting list. While they are receiving care within the hospital and are being triaged, there are many people who have respiratory problems and other issues associated with long Covid. I call for the clinic to open as soon as possible. These people feel ill and it must be followed up on.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The other issue with the hospital is one I raised last week. There is a shortage of many specialists. I believe the issue with the Covid clinic also has to do with getting specialised staff. There must be some sort of incentive to encourage people, especially those with relevant qualifications, to apply for jobs. There needs to be a fresh way of thinking to get continuity and encourage people to apply for jobs. Working in the medical field is a very important role but we must encourage people to stay here and work in the various roles. We need to think afresh and find some way of incentivising and encouraging people to stay and work in our hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">One of the proudest things about being a person living in Ireland is our generosity of spirit. That generosity extends to the welcome so many families who have come here from Ukraine have received in towns and villages across the country. Ballinasloe College of Further Education has people coming to it from Athlone to study English. The college authorities have spoken about how the students are absolutely incredible. These young people include teachers, doctors and nurses from Ukraine who are trying to improve the life they have, learn our language and be part of our society. There are around 12,000 of those people working here and we have nearly the same number of children again attending our primary and secondary schools. We saw that generosity of spirit on "The Late Late Show". Was it not wonderful to see the camaraderie between the young children, especially where families are in pledged accommodation?</p>
          <p eId="para_124"> I would like to mention an event I attended on Saturday evening in Castleblakeney, which is just outside Ballinasloe. Due to the lockdowns, I have not been to many events like this but it was a fund-raiser for a school for the blind in Ethiopia. A number of tradespeople from the local area, including plumbers, electricians and builders, are going there to construct dormitories. </p>
          <p eId="para_125">There are approximately 300 blind children at the school in Sebeta, which is just 30 km outside Addis Ababa. The tradespeople are going to be working on the school and the community is trying to fundraise for it. I commend the generosity of spirit of Irish people at a time, after lockdown, when we have become more inward-looking than outward-looking. We need to consider what we can give back and how, and do so every day.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I thank colleagues for the variety of topics that have been raised. I agree with Senator Dolan. It is not just post Covid; we have always been known for being very giving as a nation. Through the years, there have been plenty of stories, similar to hers of that community going to Ethiopia, of Irish people going to build schools for the blind across most of Africa or south-east Asia. Long may it last. I thank her for raising that.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> Senator Maria Byrne raised the need for a long Covid clinic at the regional hospital in Limerick. I suggest we need a long clinic in every county. I listened with dismay to Dr. Jack Lambert telling us that speciality doctors at the Mater Hospital are looking to continue the long Covid clinic they have had there for several months but there has been a refusal to give them the money for that. I wrote to the Minister yesterday to find out what is the problem. It may be that there is no policy on long Covid but, given that thousands of citizens are still suffering from the symptoms of long Covid, we definitely need such a policy. I will raise the concerns of the Senator, particularly in respect of Limerick and the shortage of specialists there.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> Senator Boylan highlighted that today is International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and there will be a protest of support outside the GPO at 7 o'clock this evening. I thank her for bringing that to our attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> Senator Hoey spoke about a meeting she and her colleagues held regarding drugs and the need for decriminalisation. We need to bring forward the drug policy reforms in the ongoing review at the Department of Justice sooner rather than later. I thank her for raising that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> Senator Dooley sought an update on an employment regulation order and the injunction that was taken out by a particular security firm against the new pay and conditions that have been agreed by the Minister. I wish to put on the record of the House that I have been informed the Minister will challenge that injunction in the coming days.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> Senator Warfield spoke about the welcome changes with regard to the people who can give blood. He also sought a review of the report on a family friendly and inclusive Parliament that was published a year ago. We might raise that at the next meeting of the Committee on Parliamentary Privileges and Oversight. </p>
          <p eId="para_132"> Senator McGahon is looking for a debate before Christmas on the retail sector. I normally stand up here and say I will do my very best to facilitate such requests but the clock is ticking in respect of the next couple of weeks and the list of things Ministers want to do is getting longer, so I am not sure the House will get to have such a debate before Christmas. I will try, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Senator Boyhan spoke about a moving event he witnessed the other week at the OCSE debate at the parliament in Poland with regard to solidarity for immigrants who have had to flee Ukraine and have come to all the corners of the European Union. He referred to the welcome received. It was particularly poignant when he spoke about the little letter to Santa from Ivan, who is looking for his daddy, for light and for heat. We all need to check ourselves when we think that we probably have difficulties in our lives. We should compare our difficulties with those of some citizens across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> Senators Conway and Buttimer welcomed the human tissue (transplantation, post-mortem, anatomical examination and public display) Bill agreed by the Cabinet this morning and being published today. I will try my best to find out for Senator Conway why it has taken so long, but we are all well aware of issues that have taken far longer. A particular policy I had when I was in the Department was started some 20 years ago by the late Seamus Brennan but it still has not come to fruition. We will do our best to find out.</p>
          <p eId="para_135"> Senator Buttimer sought a debate on the purchase, agreed this morning, of 90 new battery-powered train carriages. I expect we will have a debate on COP27 between now and Christmas. I am just waiting on a date from the Minister in that regard. I know that is not really related to the 90 new battery-powered train carriages but I am sure we can include the issue in that debate rather than having a separate one.</p>
          <p eId="para_136"> Senator Davitt, and Senator Malcolm Byrne in leading off on the Order of Business, spoke about the absolutely tragic situation of Alejandro Miszan. I heard on the news that not only has the little boy's entire bottom lip been destroyed and taken away from him, he cannot breathe independently. As you can see from the photograph of his little frame, he is only a baby. I will certainly join with both colleagues in seeking a review of the restrictions in respect of 11 breeds of dog but it is clear the regulations that currently exist must not have been in place yesterday. We need to have stricter responses.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I wish that little boy a speedy recovery and extend my support and solidarity to his whole family. </p>
          <p eId="para_138"> Senator Ward asked for a debate on our Defence Forces, given that there is a growing retention problem. I will try to arrange that as soon as I can after Christmas, particularly with regard to the Commission on the Defence Forces report. We will have that debate as soon we can in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke about the McAnespie case and the review last week, which I am sure was extremely welcome after years of looking for justice. It gives us mind to never, ever give up. When you know you are right, it is important to keep going and eventually things will come. The Senator sought a debate on the British Government's legacy Bill. I will try to organise that as soon as I can after Christmas. </p>
          <p eId="para_140"> To respond to Senator Keogan, I hope we always have adult conversations in debates because we are adults. We should never get to a scenario where we are calling each other names, for whatever reason. I do not disagree with the Senator insofar as there are some concerns being raised by people in communities which need to be addressed. I do not think the Government disagrees either, which is why this issue is part of the negotiations on changes in Departments over the next couple of weeks. However, when the Senator says we have immigrants roaming around towns causing antisocial behaviour, it is not fair. They are genuinely human beings fleeing from situations which I do not think we can even begin to imagine. We need to be conscious-----</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T15:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_152">I thank the House for facilitating the Bill this week, which I am pleased to bring forward. It was something that we discussed quite a lot here individually with Senators as well, who were asking for a scheme such as this in response to what happening with Ukraine and the pressure it is putting on businesses here as well. The scheme has worked quite well through the past couple of years in other forms as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_153"> The Bill will facilitate the creation of the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme. The scheme will make low-cost lending available to small businesses, fishers and farmers without collateral or personal guarantees. Lending will be at reduced interest rates and allow for those businesses to spread the current rate increase in their costs over the medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> The purpose of the Bill is to make certain amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012, as amended, to help businesses access essential liquidity through their banks and other financial institutions. Businesses often need loans to cover cash flows and this need has been deepened by the spike in cost increases since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> The Bill also includes a short technical amendment to the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021. This will enable the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine to enter into further agreements with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, to facilitate access to finance for qualifying enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> The first thing is to understand the need for this, and most Senators will. I will explain to then in general why the Bill is so necessary. The impact on the economy due to the invasion of Ukraine and the knock-on effects on costs, especially fuel, has resulted in a surge in operating costs for businesses and a drop in confidence across the board. With the increasing duration of elevated energy prices, the negative economic impacts are being felt by all sectors and will continue to be felt for a number of months ahead. The consumer price index of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, states that costs rose by 8.2% between September 2021 and September 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">The highest level of inflation for 38 years was recorded in June 2022 at 9.1%, a level not seen since 1984. September marked the 12th straight month where the annual increase for the CPI has been at least 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> These increased costs will cause significant strains on the working capital position of SMEs. They will need to spread the costs of the next 12 to 24 months over a longer timeframe to avoid heavy cash flow losses. The increase in energy prices, as well as other raw materials, such as fertiliser and feed, are driving price inflation. This is affecting every sector from butchers to clothes shops and from food processors to cafes. We can already see the impacts of that on the high streets, with some businesses under extreme pressure and some businesses reducing their hours or, in some extreme cases, having been forced to close as well. This is in response to that, to enable them to have the working capital or access the finance they need to get through the next couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> These developments may damage profitability and growth, thereby resulting in a reduction of economic activities, potential job losses and business closures. We must protect those hard-earned jobs. As I said in the other House last week, we have more than 2.5 million people at work and we cannot take that for granted. The number one response of any Government to protect the jobs one has as well as try to continue to grow more. I recognise that jobs come and go and one always must have more jobs coming into the system in the years ahead as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> Businesses will need assistance to adapt their operations to a changing business environment, to restructure suppliers and their cost bases. Confidence is being negatively impacted by the ongoing uncertainty and an important part of the rationale for Government intervention is to rebuild confidence. A significant and ambitious credit guarantee scheme will assist lenders in providing liquidity to these companies and send a strong signal of support and confidence to both lenders and borrowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> For context, as there are quite a number of champions for the SME community here, I reaffirm that there are approximately 270,000 SMEs in Ireland, based on CSO figures. Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, account for 66.4% or two thirds of all persons employed in businesses in Ireland. Small and medium-sized enterprises generated 43.6% of total turnover in the business economy and 36.9% of gross value added was attributed to these enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> They are the majority of businesses in every county in Ireland. They are the dairy farmer, the family-owned newsagent and the software start-up. They create jobs and generate wealth in locations where large businesses do not establish themselves. They are in every sector and the people who own and work there are from every background. Small and medium-sized enterprises are very much the fabric of Irish society. They are more than just numbers. That is why I, and my Department, are so keen to provide any support we can to keep these businesses afloat.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme should be viewed as one arm of the Government assistances being offered to businesses. It cannot and does not claim to be a panacea to every issue businesses are facing in the current environment but it is an important element of the Government’s offering. These measures will allow businesses to tackle and overcome the expected costs pressures of this year and next.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I would have said previously when we discussed other similar credit guarantee schemes that when it comes to crises such as this and businesses are trying to plot their way through it, generally the way through it is a combination of tapping into some of the Government grants and schemes that are there, access to low-cost finance at the right price that is de-risked by the State which is what this scheme does but also sadly having to dip into their own reserves as well. It needs all three and an effort by everyone to get through a tough time. There is no point in kidding ourselves by saying to businesses that they will get through this without borrowing. That is probably unlikely. That is why our duty is to make it as cheap as we possibly can and as easily accessible as we possibly can as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> The first of the supports announced in the recent budget is the €1.25 billion temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, providing qualifying businesses with up to 40% of the increase in electricity or gas bills up to €10,000 per month. It will help small businesses most, but also medium and larger businesses. It will be administered by the Revenue Commissioners, backdated to September, and will run until at least February 2023. Much information went up over the weekend about that. Hopefully, we will see businesses making the applications and drawing down funding this side of Christmas. They will be able to continue funding thereafter in the new year as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> The second support that was announced in budget 2023 is a €200 million targeted Ukraine enterprise crisis scheme. This is designed to assist viable but vulnerable businesses in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors which are suffering the broader effects of the war in Ukraine, as well as increasing energy costs. One strand of the scheme will provide up to €2 million in grant aid for energy intensive companies impacted by the exceptionally severe increases in gas and electricity costs. It will be administered through Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Údarás na Gaeltachta and eligible businesses must produce an energy efficiency plan which shows how they will get their energy costs down. That is open already for applications. There will be strong demand for that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Operating in tandem with the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will be the new growth and sustainability loan scheme. This will make up to €500 million in low-cost investment loans of up to ten years available to SMEs, including farmers and fishers and small mid-caps, with no collateral required for loans of up to €0.5 million. A minimum of 30% of the lending volume will be targeted towards environmental sustainability purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Amendments in the Bill to the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021 will facilitate the Department in establishing the growth and sustainability loan scheme. </p>
          <p eId="para_169"><b>
						</b>Today we are debating the legislation that will make the amendments necessary to implement a specific Ukraine credit guarantee scheme. This will replicate many elements of the highly successful Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. That scheme resulted in more than €700 million in lending to 9,850 businesses. This helped maintain 81,000 jobs in just 21 months of availability. Under the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, the State will guarantee 80% of the loans included in the scheme. Lenders will retain 20% of the risk to ensure they have skin in the game. Viable businesses will be supported. The aim of this scheme is to make it much easier for that money to be made available to those businesses and to cut out some of the delays we often see. The scheme will include farmers, fishers and small mid-caps with under 500 employees. This is something we can do under flexibilities from the European Commission in its temporary crisis framework on state aid, introduced to respond to the aggression by Russia against Ukraine. It is similar to the framework that the Commission created for the Covid pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_170"> The Bill is aimed at putting in place State-backed guarantees so that businesses that employ up to 499 people can go to the banks and other participating financial institutions for lending across a range of financial products. If a business defaults in its repayment of those loans or overdrafts, the financial institution can then call in the guarantee from the State, which will cover 80% of the outstanding debt. The financial institutions will still have to carry 20% of that default themselves. The State is providing significant certainty to the banks with this guarantee as we propose to also remove the portfolio cap for the financial institutions. Due to these measures, it is a requirement that all financial institutions taking part demonstrate a reduction in the interest rate charged to enterprises for those loans and other financial products covered by the scheme. As part of state aid requirements, the businesses will pay a fee to the State for a guarantee related to their borrowing. I assure Senators that this fee will be far less than the interest rate reduction legally required from the finance provider.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"><b>
						</b>I will now explain the key elements of the Bill. Section 1 provides that references to the Act of 2012 mean the Credit Guarantee Act 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> Section 2 amends section 2(1) of the Act of 2012 to provide for the inclusion of a new definition of "Ukraine credit guarantee scheme" in the Act of 2012, which is needed for other changes made elsewhere in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Section 3 amends section 3 of the Act of 2012 to allow for the extension of classes of enterprises that can qualify for the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme to include small mid-caps. Primary producers, that is, farmers and fishers, also qualify.</p>
          <p eId="para_174"> Section 4 amends section 4 of the Act of 2012 to include the new Ukraine credit guarantee scheme within certain subsections of that section, thus giving the Minister the power to give guarantees. The section also disallows sections 4(3) and 4(4) of the Act of 2012 for the purposes of the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, as different provisions are being made for those aspects through the new section 4B, which is being inserted by section 5. The existing scheme is subject to a portfolio cap of 13% under the 2012 Act, as amended, but there is no portfolio cap for the Ukraine scheme. The existing scheme has a maximum yearly credit amount that can be guaranteed of €150 million, whereas the Ukraine scheme has an overall maximum credit amount of €1.2 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> Section 5 introduces a new section 4B into the Act of 2012, which gives power to the Minister to give guarantees in accordance with the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme. The scheme will be open for guarantees to be put in place until 31 December 2024. These guarantees will not extend beyond six years in duration. The maximum amount of credit to be covered by these guarantees will not exceed €1.2 billion and the Minister’s liability in respect of those guarantees will not exceed €960 million. Subsection 4 of the newly inserted 4B includes definitions relevant to this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Section 6 amends section 12 of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act of 2016 to ensure that the maximum liability of the Minister in respect of the existing credit guarantee scheme shall remain at a level not exceeding €15.6 million, and that there will be a separate provision for a maximum liability relating to the Ukraine scheme of €960 million, included through the new section 4B(3), which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> Section 7 amends the Loan Guarantee Schemes Agreements (Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland) Act 2021, by increasing the aggregate liability limit to €180 million from a limit of €50 million in respect of contributions committed under all agreements between the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the SBCI for the time being in force. Section 8 is the final section and contains technical matters about the Short Title, commencement arrangements and citation. </p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I again thank Members for their time and for facilitating this debate. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity to discuss the Bill today, and on Committee and Report Stages later in the week.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_74">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_179">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for being here. As he said, it is important we get this Bill passed. It is critically important to our businesses, economy and people. It is about the protection of jobs, ensuring our economy and businesses have access to credit and I welcome the Minister of State's speech and contribution. It is extraordinary in that little did we think we would be in the middle of an immoral and wrong war or a cost-of-living and energy crisis as we emerged from Covid and, I suppose, a staffing issue with regard to myriad areas in industry. Accessing finance has never been more critical. I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy English, on his hands-on approach as he toured the country. I have seen him first hand engaging with, listening to and bringing back to his Department the views, concerns and ideas of SMEs. I thank him most sincerely for that. I know he was in Cork recently and those he met were very impressed by his candour, sincerity and ability to understand and pick up on the minutiae of what they were talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> It is important we do not make it difficult for industry and business. It is important we make it easy and cut back the bureaucratic red tape to make it more simple for businesses and assist and support their needs. Never before have we needed a hands-on approach to business. While I am on my feet, I will welcome a former colleague and friend, Tony Dodd, who has been a long-standing member of the Houses of the Oireachtas staff and his friends to the Gallery. It is good to see him again. Retirement suits him. It is a good ad for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> Financial costs have increased because of this needless and immoral war on Ukraine. The weaponisation by Russia of the Ukranian winter, energy and water is appalling. I urge all Members of the House to impress upon every country and friend we have among the decision-making powers that be to impress upon Russia that what it is doing is so wrong and immoral. We all know the effects on Ukraine and its people. Senator Cassells gave a wonderful speech in Poland last week and, during the Order of Business today, Senators Boyhan spoke about it being easy for us to turn a light off for 60 seconds and shine the light on the roof or ceiling of a building but it is about the impact it is having on the gnáthdhuine, that is, the man, woman, child, old person or worker. Last weekend we saw the person on the news with Tony Connolly speak about how the ordinary person is trying to manage in a war situation without any power, heat or water. Just imagine.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> Consumer confidence saw a little drop this month in our own country. Looking at the remarks of the economist, Austin Hughes, one would have to be heartened the budget measures have succeeded. The Bank of Ireland economic policy has warned of a mixed economic outlook. I received a briefing this morning from the president of the Cork branch of the Irish Hotels Federation, Joe Kennedy. The point it has been making to me with regard to Cork and hoteliers is that Cork tourism is facing stark headwinds. Hotel energy costs are now 10% to 12% of total revenue where they were 4% in 2019. A 70-bedroom hotel has an annual energy cost of €380,000. Hotels face challenges from business costs and reduced forward bookings.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> The temporary business energy support scheme is welcome but I am told by the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, the qualification criteria for hotels are restrictive. I look forward to teasing this out with the Minister for Finance with regard to the Finance Bill and maybe with the Minister of State given the loose connection to this Bill. I will give Members an example with regard to hotels. The cost of food supplies is up by 25%; beverages are up by 16%; and linen and laundry are up 30%. That is a stark rise before one adds in the issue of staffing and skills and the uncertainty around the 9% VAT rate. I know many of us, including Senator Crowe, are asking Government about the continuation of the 9% VAT rate and championing such a continuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">This is about the protection of jobs in many parts of our economy, a matter on which the Minister of State has been strong. The Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, has been addressing upskilling through apprenticeships. The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will support a wide variety of communities and sectors. The Minister of State referenced farmers, fishers and small mid-caps with fewer than 500 employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> I like the idea of flexibility from the European Commission. I hope that Europe will consider applying flexibility to many of our sectors, including SMEs, which are the heart of our communities. As we approach Christmas, I ask people to please support local wherever they are. On the Order of Business, Senator McGahon spoke about Dundalk being the pioneer in supporting small local enterprises. It is critical that we do so. We must support the people who give employment and create incomes that are spent locally. I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to continue the supports. The Government was not found wanting during Covid and we have not been found wanting in this context so far. Flexibility will be needed. I look forward to supporting the Bill and having it enacted as a matter of urgency.</p>

        <speech by="#OllieCrowe" eId="spk_75">
          <from>Senator Ollie Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T15:35:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_186">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his continued work.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> Like many Senators, I welcome this legislation. As all Senators appreciate, and as the Minister of State alluded to, our SMEs are the backbone of the economy. There are 270,000 SMEs, accounting for 66.5% of all people employed in businesses. SMEs generate 44% of the total turnover in the business economy and 37% of gross value added is attributed to them. They are the majority of businesses in every county. They are our neighbours, family members and friends who run businesses in cities, towns and villages across the country. They are farmers, local publicans, restaurant owners and so on. Our economy is reliant on SMEs. Naturally, our society is also reliant on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> Many SMEs have had a challenging period. They have endured trying to keep afloat during a global pandemic, operating during restrictions in most cases. Now, they are facing an energy crisis. Their sustainability is under threat, not through anything they have done, but due to external factors outside their control. I know this from speaking to business owners across Galway. This period is challenging for them and causing considerable concern and anxiety.</p>
          <p eId="para_189"> I concur with Senator Buttimer's remarks on energy costs. I will cite the example of a hotel in my city of Galway. It has 123 bedrooms and its energy costs for the six months of last year's winter season amounted to €124,000. The energy costs for this year's six-month winter season, which started on 1 October and will continue until March, will increase to €375,000. Long term, we need to co-ordinate a one-stop shop for hotels, restaurants, bars and the wider hospitality sector so that they can continue to operate. We also need long-term supports to help them make the necessary improvements to their energy systems. It is essential that the Government make every effort to support SMEs, as we have been doing in this context. I welcome this legislation, which will assist in that effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_190"> As Senator Buttimer and the Minister of State outlined, the Bill will make the necessary amendments to implement a specific Ukraine credit guarantee scheme. This will replicate many elements of the highly successful Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, which saw more than €700 million in lending to nearly 10,000 businesses and helped to maintain more than 80,000 jobs in the 21 months it was available. The new scheme has the same potential to support thousands of jobs. With no sectoral or regional limitations, its widespread availability should see a similar uptake as the excellent Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme, under which 72% of loans were drawn down by businesses outside the capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> The State will guarantee 80% of the loans provided under the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, with lenders retaining 20% of the risk to ensure they have skin in the game. Viable businesses will be supported. The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme will include primary producers such as farmers, fisheries and small mid-caps with under 500 employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Furthermore, I understand that progress has been made with the operator of the scheme, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, on lenders to prepare for a rapid deployment of the scheme. That is very welcome. It is essential that supports are rolled out, hopefully as quickly as possible following today's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> It is in every Member's interest to ensure every measure possible is taken to support SMEs. This initiative is one part of that and it should be welcomed and supported across the House. </p>

          <p eId="para_194">The Minister of State is very welcome. I think he will be here again later tonight, so I hope he had his Weetabix this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> I welcome the Bill on behalf of my party. The Bill will make amendments to the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 with the aim of supporting the needs of businesses during this time of rising inflation and costs caused by Russian's invasion of Ukraine. The development of this scheme is very much needed at this time as we see that the cost of doing business has already pushed many small businesses to the brink. It will not be a shock to anyone if we see very many more small businesses close their doors in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> We have heard the stories of the massive gas and electricity bills that small and medium-sized businesses are facing. They are just trying to keep their head above water. Also, there is the rising cost of supplies, deliveries and wages. Access to credit and loans will be vital to keep some of those businesses going. SMEs are the backbone of our community and local economies and the Government must continue to look at more measures to support them at this difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> We are now in the winter months. It is cold and dark and, like households, businesses are worried. In Limerick, a number of businesses have closed or announced they will close soon. Next month, we will lose Miss Marples Tea Rooms in Limerick city after 11 years. La Fromagerie Cheese Shop closed last week. Bakehouse 22, which closed last month after 72 years in business, was a particular favourite of mine and of my colleague, Deputy Maurice Quinlivan. The situation is sad. I wish all of the owners of those businesses well. I know every one of them had a very heavy heart having to make the decision to close their doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> Sinn Féin is acutely aware of the challenges that SMEs face right now, particularly the impact of rising energy costs. My party colleagues have met officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on these matters. We have proposed solutions such as the business energy support scheme and called for the creation of a new SBCI-led and State-backed credit guarantee loan scheme in our alternative budget to help energy intensive sectors, especially SMEs, micro-businesses and family businesses that are facing the brunt of these increased costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> Last April, Deputy Pearse Doherty brought amendments to financial motions to reduce the cost of home heating oil, petrol and diesel in response to the cost-of-living crisis. We have also been consistent in our efforts to see insurance premiums reduced for businesses. There is a cost-of-doing business crisis, not just a cost-of-energy crisis. The Government must stay alert and ready to respond to all aspects of these crises.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> The Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill is welcome. It is focused on providing low-cost working capital to SMEs, primary producers and small mid-caps of up to €1 million on a six-year term with no collateral requirements for loans of up to €250,000. That is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> The 80:20 guarantee rate split between the State and the lending financial institution is fine. However, I know my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, had concerns and asked that the matter be kept under review. I suggest that if there is an unwillingness on the part of financial institutions to lend moneys as a result of the guarantee rate split, the Minister of State might be in a position to revisit this aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> Sinn Féin tabled an amendment in the Dáil to look at making the moneys loaned under the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme interest free, with zero repayments for the first 12 months of the loan, and to cap the interest rate at 2.5%. The Covid-19 scheme was capped at 2.5% and we believe this is a better way to go. We also believe there would be better uptake of the scheme if the first year was interest free with zero repayments. I ask the Minister of State to look at this aspect again on Committee Stage in the Seanad. I also ask him to examine what caused the low level of uptake of the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme to see if the causes can be addressed to ensure the same barriers do not exist under this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> More than €750 million was borrowed for the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. Unfortunately, that amount only represents 35% of a €2 billion scheme. It turns out that 9,848 micro-SMEs and mid-caps received loans under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">However, according to Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures, there are 248,344 SMEs in the State. The take-up number is concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> It is important to mention that pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill was waived. Although it is not best practice to do so and I would oppose it in most cases, as a member of the enterprise, trade and employment committee, I agreed to it in this instance, along with my colleagues, because we appreciate, given the existing crisis, that it was necessary to have available supports introduced as quickly as possible. In light of that, I hope the legislation will move swiftly through the House and that the Minister of State gets these financial supports in place without delay. There are many small business owners who may not avail of the scheme because they do not want to get into too much debt. There must be more urgency in getting the temporary business energy support scheme working to help those businesses. We welcome and support the Bill but I hope the Minister of State will keep an eye on the performance reports from the SBCI and will review particular aspects of the legislation if and when it is needed. Most importantly, the scheme must be up and running as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T15:45:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_206">I thank Members for their support for the Bill. We tried to have this debate last week. I get a sense from the majority of Senators that they want to support businesses through this scheme. I recognise the support and co-operation I have had in bringing the Bill through quickly and without pre-legislative scrutiny. That was important, as I mentioned in the other House.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> The Bill seeks to assist businesses, in conjunction with other schemes, at a difficult time. The temporary business energy support scheme probably is the most important element and it will be up and running in the next couple of weeks. Once the Finance Bill goes through this House, the scheme can formally be processed and people should have payments before Christmas. Likewise, we hope some of the banks will be in a position to make loans available under the credit guarantee scheme before Christmas and, if not, very early in the new year. It probably will begin with an initial offering through the traditional lenders, after which it will be open to all lenders to bid for the quota in the new year. We saw quite a large uptake of previous schemes by lending institutes, including credit unions, to make money available, through the SBCI, to businesses. I hope that will be repeated. I agree with Senator Gavan that it is a demand-led scheme. We offer it as a support to businesses but we cannot make them avail of it. Close to 10,000 came forward to avail of the scheme during the Covid period, which was quite a healthy response. If more come forward on this occasion, we have set money set aside to cater for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I would say to businesses that it is important to have conversations about their future. When I meet business owners most days of the week through all the various forums, I tell them it is an important time to look ahead at their finances for the next couple of years and to avail of these schemes. We have had EU frameworks in place in recent years in response to the Covid crisis, Brexit and so on. Now, in response to the war in Ukraine, we have a framework that allows us to offer these schemes. They will not always be there but it is a good time for people to look at the finances of their business and to plan ahead to get through the next couple of months and also the next five or six years. This is six-year money and we cannot go beyond that with this scheme under the EU framework. The future growth loan scheme, which will be up to ten years, will give people an opportunity to invest in their business in the long term. These schemes make sense in conjunction with the other supports the Government has made available.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Sinn Féin Members have asked that the rate be set at 2.5%. That is not an option for us because it would exclude a lot of the lenders we want to bring into business lending. That rate will not work for them. Obviously, I want to ensure the money is available as cheaply as possible but setting the rate too low is not an option because it would mean the scheme does not work the way we expect it to work. We will engage with all individual lenders on their rates to make sure they are passing on a significant cut on the interest rates they would usually charge, as they must do under the framework. That will be captured and we will ensure fees are kept to a minimum as well. I believe we will be able to achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> The fee structure that must come with the guarantee means there is not the option to have a facility for non-repayment for 12 months. We cannot provide that under the scheme but we will work closely with businesses to make the terms and conditions easy for them. Microfinance Ireland is providing loans up to €25,000 for businesses and, in some cases, it provides a 12-month non-repayment option as well as lower interest rates if people work through the local enterprise offices, LEOs.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> As referenced by Senator Buttimer, we all recognise that the LEOs are doing great work throughout the country. I am delighted to say I have got them all up and running in the past year. On behalf of the Houses, I compliment the work they have been doing through a very difficult few years. They have reached out to many more business customers than they normally would in that period. We hope to be able to continue and extend the work they are doing with businesses and in reaching more sectors. We saw that this week in the announcement of a new framework to allow Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs to work with companies with more than ten employees. That is really positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">This is reflective of the work done by the local enterprise offices. I hope we can do this also. Senator Crowe made his point very clearly and it is important. These businesses are under pressure and not by their own fault. There are external factors. This is why it is only right that the Government, using taxpayers' money in a clever way, is able to support businesses as best as we possibly can. I hope we will be able to do so in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> I believe I have covered most of the questions that were raised. If I have missed anything I will certainly pick it up on Committee and Report Stages. I thank all of the Members for their support. Senator Buttimer and others raised the issue of hotels. He met the federation in Cork. We understand that certain sectors are under a lot of pressure. We will engage with them and we are working with them through the hospitality forum on which the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, are engaging with businesses directly. Many of them are also involved in the enterprise forum which at this stage probably engages weekly on trying to target the supports. We recognise coming into the new year that while these schemes are open to all businesses we will have to go sector by sector to keep an eye on and work with each sector to make sure the right supports are in place. It is important for us that the initial funding that was set aside to deal with the energy issue is dished out in the coming months to give businesses a chance. Then we can work with them on the other initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Access to labour and talent is key. The work being done by the Minister, Deputy Harris, and other Departments was rightly referenced. A whole-of-government approach is being taken to addressing the skills shortage. Having 2.5 million people at work is a good place to be but almost every business we speak to does not have enough people and needs more people. The first priority is to keep the businesses open to survive these couple of months. They will have a very positive future if we can attract more talent. Quite a high number of people have left the workforce for various reasons. We need to find more ways to attract them back. This is why it is important to have the right tax regime and the right terms and conditions, good quality pay, sick pay, auto enrolment of pensions and the living wage. We are heading towards these. These will improve the offer of a job and should help us to deal with some of the labour shortages.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> There are also the right supports when it comes to training. The education and training boards offer courses and Skillnet also offers great supports. Again this is using taxpayers' money in a clever way to support training, education, apprenticeships and higher education. We need this combination. The business community must be part of this conversation and it is. It has expressed its desire to get involved in the formulation of courses and developing new apprenticeships. This is something we want to build on. The budget set aside an increased amount of money to achieve this. I hope that if we can get through this temporary difficult time for businesses, we will have a very positive journey through the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I welcome the Minister. I have a number of amendments in this group dealing with the issue of the exclusionary invalidation of the advance healthcare directives, AHDs, of some people who have been involuntarily detained. It is such an important issue that impacts people's health, autonomy and dignity. Because time is short, I will try to address all of my remarks on this issue when dealing with this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> It is a deeply complex area of law. I want to highlight the assistance and support I have received from some of the most amazing campaigners working in this area. I want to give huge thanks to Ber Grogan and the team at Mental Health Reform, Fiona Walsh and other members of Recovery Experts by Experience, who so courageously shared their experiences with me, NUI Galway lecturer, Fiona Morrissey, whose work on the AHD is central to my advocacy on this issue, and, of course, Professor Eilionóir Flynn and everyone in the NUIG Centre for Disability Law and Policy. To everyone who has followed the passage of this legislation so closely, I thank them. I want to apologise that, I have no doubt, this Bill is not what they hoped it would be. The legislation provided an opportunity to decisively break from a paternalistic and oppressive mode of wardship and create a system that is truly empowering and human rights-compliant. It does not achieve that, which weighs heavily on me.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> AHDs enable a person who experiences mental illness to make plans while they are healthy and, if complied with, it gives them peace of mind, knowing that their wishes will be respected, even when they are at their most vulnerable and unable to fully advocate for themselves. They are essential tools used to uphold the dignity and agency of people experiencing mental health difficulties. They are a source of security and safety amid the fear and chaos that can accompany mental ill health. If they are respected and upheld, AHDs encourage people to seek the help they need because they can be assured their rights will not be violated if it is judged that they will be subject to involuntary detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> The legislation, as it stands, mandates compliance with the AHDs made by some people detained under the Mental Health Act but not others. Those admitted under section 3(1)(b) because the clinician believes they will deteriorate, or that they will substantially improve if detained, will have their wishes respected, and those detained under section 3(1)(a) who are deemed to be at risk to themselves or others will have their wishes disregarded. Two-tier approaches to human rights obligations re-inscribe inequality. Mental healthcare can involve shifts in status and in classification. Sometimes these changes happen rapidly. People can go from voluntary to involuntary treatment and their classification as section 3(1)(b) or section 3(1)(b) can be altered.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> The Government's partial solution leaves a gaping hole in the system whereby any person with mental illness and an AHD is at risk of it being disregarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">It fundamentally undercuts the dignity and peace of mind that advance healthcare directives are meant to provide. It is causing enormous concern among the campaigners directly impacted by this legislation. Unfortunately, I am yet to hear one good explanation for why this discrimination is being maintained. On Committee Stage, the Minister alluded to interdepartmental negotiations and legal advice as reasons he could not entirely remove the provisions of the legislation which discriminate against people who have been involuntarily detained. He stated that the changes had to be achieved through the reform of the Mental Health Act 2001, which is to happen at an indeterminate point in the future. I respect that this is the course of action the Minister feels he is bound to pursue but the campaigners who are working so hard on this issue deserve a mode detailed explanation. They deserve a solid timeframe for change on which they can rely. The whole saga has been a years long case of hurry up and wait for the people who have ended up in wardship or who have had their advance healthcare directives overruled. It is a delay that has had a bad impact. It is sad that people will have to wait further still. Any distinction between the decision-making rights of people with physical and mental conditions or disabilities is contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, and the principal Act is intended to provide the normative framework for legal capacity and decision-making rights in Ireland and to comply with our obligations under the UNCRPD. It is therefore crucial that the existing inequality which is contained in the Act is removed. There is no conflict between accepting this amendment and reform of the Mental Health Act. In fact, clear equality for people with psychosocial disabilities in this Act will assist reform of the Mental Health Act in a manner compatible with our obligations under the UNCRPD. This amendment would remove any equivocation and ensure that the human rights and dignity of involuntarily detained individuals is protected. It would provide clarity and comfort for individuals who need it. I hope the Minister will consider accepting this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FintanWarfield" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Senator Fintan Warfield<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_236">I feel it is important to again highlight the rushed nature of this legislation. The Minister's rationale for the rushed process was that a constitutional challenge was ongoing. A response to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Mark Ward, states, "The constitutional challenge was adjourned on the basis that wardship would be abolished in orderly fashion via an Act of the Oireachtas", and that remains the case. Legislation of this magnitude cannot be rushed to accommodate such external consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Several of my colleagues from a range of political backgrounds have now highlighted the shortcomings in this Bill, most notably the fact that, as proposed, it contains discriminatory language and is inconsistent with Ireland's obligations under the UNCRPD. The Minister has been provided with constructive, actionable solutions through numerous contributions and proposed amendments. Unfortunately, most of these amendments were not accepted, which is deeply disappointing. The proposed amendments which I and others previously submitted would have had a significant impact on the rights of disabled people, older people and people with experience of mental health services. With the appropriate amendments accepted, this Bill could address the failures of our legal and healthcare systems' treatment of individuals with disabilities. It could allow for the creation of a much stronger and more effective version of the Bill which would truly uphold the principles of human rights and autonomy. As my colleague, Senator Black, has previously stated, we need to build people up, not codify their exclusion from full participation in society. I urge the Minister in the strongest terms to consider the proposed amendments in this grouping and use this opportunity to create a lasting and positive impact for those who have so often been victimised and discriminated against.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I will also speak to amendment No. 13 specifically, regarding people who have obtained the age of 16.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">I ask the Minister, in particular, to reconsider his position with regard to this proposed amendment. The Minister has in the past stated that this Bill is designed to apply to adults and is reflective of the reality that parents and guardians have specific legal responsibilities in respect of minors. However, I would draw the Minister's attention to the range of surgical, medical and dental treatments to which 16- and 17-year-olds currently have the ability to consent. It is important to be constantly reminded of the underlying principle that consent does not require that people make the objectively correct decision. It simply requires that they have the capacity to understand the necessary information in that moment and make an informed decision. In layman's terms, those who have capacity are free to make objectively bad decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> A young person experiencing a medical need should not be disadvantaged or disregarded on the basis of their illness being mental as opposed to physical. The proposed Bill would codify a situation where a 16-year-old can refuse life-saving vaccines or blood transfusions. However, a peer, with the support of a doctor, family or other trusted advisor, who makes an advance healthcare directive would not have his or her decision respected and given effect. The alternative situation, as we have seen for many decades, is a system where doctors, families and the courts are left to try to assess what they believe is in the best interests of the individual. Such a system leads to often inconsistent and, indeed, delayed treatment that may not honour the expressly stated wishes of the individual. The Minister has previously acknowledged this lacuna in respect of young people's rights and has stated that this issue "would require a more detailed examination than can be provided for at this stage". Given the fundamental nature of the rights addressed in this Bill and the potential lifelong consequences for individuals subject to such decisions, I urge the Minister to afford this Bill the time and scrutiny necessary to undertake such examination.</p>

          <from>Senator Mary Seery Kearney<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:45:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_241">I respectfully disagree with Senator Warfield regarding the rushed nature of this debate. Every week since we began Committee Stage, we have received emails asking when this Bill will be back on the agenda and reminding us of the urgency involved. The most important sections of the 2015 Act were, regrettably, never commenced. There is nothing rushed about the legislation. However, it does contain elements with which we are all uncomfortable and that we wish could be resolved quickly. I am mindful that there is an inherent discrimination within the Bill that I know the Minister has addressed and about which we have had good discussions with him and his officials. There is a cohort of people for whom the advance healthcare directive is going to be not in effect. It is regrettable that we have a situation where people can have capacity put in their advance healthcare directives but that capacity is undermined by other factors at times when they need those wishes to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I have heard the Minister all along when he has said that this must be done in tandem with the reform of the Mental Health Act. In recent weeks at the Committee on Disability Matters, various aspects of mental health have been discussed and representatives of Mental Health Reform and others have been before the committee. On each occasion, I have raised the reform of the Mental Health Act and the fact that there is, unfortunately, discrimination within this Bill. At a meeting at one stage, the Minister undertook to write to the Department of Health and find out where it was at. I took away from our most recent interaction that the Minister is sensitive to this aspect to the Bill that cannot be resolved until such time as the primary legislation on mental health has been dealt with. </p>
          <p eId="para_243"> I was sensitive to and taken by the original telephone calls I had prior to Committee Stage with individuals who spoke about a loss of agency and how horrible it is. They told me how in the making of a complaint thereafter, there is an absolute powerlessness. At the end of the day, there is an inequality of arms when it comes to capacity, perception, recall and everything like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I can see the role of advanced healthcare directives, AHDs, in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> As we go through the amendments, we will be speaking about the tests that remain within the Bill but there is an inherent discrimination in that element and that will need to be resolved. I hope it will be resolved within the mental health Bill. I urge that we move through this legislation quickly because I am mindful that people are being made wards of court all the time. We desperately need that not to happen any more and to move to the new regime as quickly as possible. Where are we at with all that? Has the Minister heard back from the Department of Health? Does he have any insight in respect of a timeline or where we might be in that regard to help to address the residual discrimination within the Bill?</p>

          <from>Senator Erin McGreehan<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_246">Like other Senators, I am anxious to get the Bill through. As Senator Seery Kearney stated, every week, people are being made wards of court. We have to put an end to that desperate system. As has been noted, discrimination is built into the Bill as it stands. That is unfortunate, and it is upsetting for many people. People contacting my office on this matter are upset and afraid. They have an inherent mistrust in the system. They can see this discrimination. The clear lack of uniformity, with some aspects of the Bill going against the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, is further ingraining that mistrust of the system. We must be able to trust medical staff and that the system will work for the individual rather than for itself. We must build that care, trust and belief within people with whatever conditions, as well as in the context of AHDs. I am concerned that the Bill is putting fear into people. I know that is the complete opposite of what the Minister wants to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> I stress that we must have movement on the mental health Bill. We are doing half a job here. It is unfortunate that we are putting this legislation through. It is not where we want it to be. We have wanted this legislation for so long, yet it is not all it needs to be. Discrimination is built into it and we need to work together to ensure discrimination is taken out of the Bill as we move into 2023 and get the new mental health Bill passed. I would love to hear the thoughts of the Minister on how to proof the Bill. It is not proofed for the UNCRPD. If a court of law was going through the articles in that regard, the State would be on the losing side.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">It is appalling that there is discriminatory language in a Bill in 2022. Why is legislation that has discriminatory words in it being rushed through?

          <from>Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth (Deputy Roderic O'Gorman)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_249">I thank the Senators for their input. I will respond to Senators Flynn and Warfield in respect of the Bill being rushed and things like that. Senator Seery Kearney spoke about that previously. I do not want to start off in defensive mode but it is important to state that we wished to have the Bill passed in June this year. I had set out my intention to move it rapidly through both Houses at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">In the context particularly of debates in the Dáil and on Second Stage in this House, it became clear there were significant concerns in respect of a number of areas, especially in the area of AHDs. At that stage, I decided to slow this down a little. Between then and Committee Stage in this House, and now Report Stage, I have spoken with a significant number of Senators regarding their concerns in respect of different parts of the legislation. We have brought in a significant change. It does not resolve all the issues. I have been upfront in that regard and will speak more on the work happening in the Department of Health at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> As regards the suggestions that we are rushing the Bill, as Senator Seery Kearney pointed out, the 2015 Act has not kicked in, seven years after its enactment. Wardship is still in place. Following our previous debate in the House on the Bill, I met with the Mental Health Commission, as had been suggested. It made the same point as many Senators in respect of dissatisfaction about not everybody being covered by AHDs. It made that point clearly but it also made the point that we need to get rid of wardship. As regards delaying the passage of the Bill, the only option I see is to delay it until the mental health Bill is enacted. We will speak more on that process but that Bill being enacted is some time away and that is a time when more people would be put into wardships and more people would miss out on the significant benefits of the decision support service, DSS, and the tiered situation we have put in there. That is why I do not believe it is being rushed. It is now time to take a significant step forward in terms of ending wardship and getting the DSS up and running. I hope I will be able to give an indication in respect of the actions I have taken to try to reduce the number of people who are not able to avail of AHDs, but also in terms of the work being undertaken by the Department of Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> I will deal with amendments Nos. 1, 14 and 19 first. As I have stated previously in both Houses, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, and I strongly agree that parity should exist in the operation of AHDs. It is a technically complex issue from legal and public health perspectives. The legal advice I have received is that it is not feasible to advance this issue in the absence of reform of Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001. In light of the current work to comprehensively reform that Act, I cannot support the proposed amendment to delete sections 85(7) or 136. The Government has shown a commitment to addressing this issue and the amendments I tabled on Committee Stage demonstrate that. Those amendments will provide access to AHDs for additional cohorts whose treatment is currently regulated by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act 2001 and who were previously excluded from the supports under the 2015 Act. Those amendments represent a significant step towards parity and will allow an AHD to apply in the majority of circumstances in which a person's treatment is regulated by Part 4. That provides for the addition of people treated under section 3(1)(b) of the Mental Health Act. That is the change we made on Committee Stage. This is an important move forward, one that acts as a stepping stone to greater parity for all persons in accessing AHDs. I hope the extension provided will greatly benefit those who may otherwise not have had control of their treatment preferences. </p>
          <p eId="para_253"> As regards amendment No. 13, I am not in a position to accept it, unfortunately. The 2015 Act was designed and developed with adults in mind and it does not provide decision-making supports for those aged 16 or 17 years. In the main, this is appropriate as minors cannot currently independently make many of the decisions referred to in the Act, particularly in the context, for example, of the management of an estate. As previously stated in this Chamber, I am aware that 16- and 17-year-olds can consent to certain medical and dental treatments and, as Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I recognise the agency young people should have in their everyday lives. However, the legal position on what should occur if a minor and a parent or guardian disagree on treatment options is not one that is yet settled in this jurisdiction. Part 8 of the 2015 Act falls to the Minister for Health, and my Department has engaged with the Department of Health, as well the Department of Justice, which has a legal and legislative responsibility for issues relating to guardianship. </p>
          <p eId="para_254">We have discussed the wider implications of making amendments on this matter. A body of family law is in existence with regard to the status of minors, including their rights, and the rights of parents and guardians. In this regard, it is necessary to balance both the rights and interests of a minor and his or her guardians in situations. This is a big question. It does not just apply to consent for certain healthcare treatments. It must be applicable everywhere. That is the reason for the view, across Departments, that it was not appropriate for us to take a step on one issue in this matter but to address it within the wider context.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> We spoke a great deal about how the work we are doing here links in with the work of the reform of the Mental Health Act 2001. At our last meeting, I committed to writing to the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, to receive an update on that. I have an update and I propose to read the whole letter, dated 29 November, into the record because it is valuable and very much speaks to the crux of the issue we are addressing in this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The letter referred to my letter of 17 October with regard to the review of the Mental Health Acts and the reform of the same in the mental health Bill currently being drafted by the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers. The letter referred to my having rightly mentioned the close and ongoing collaboration between officials in both Departments on matters of shared interest in the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) (Amendment) Bill 2022, including the establishment and operation of the decision support service, the introduction of advanced healthcare directives and the interface between the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and the Mental Health Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> The letter goes on to state that sections 85(7) and 136 of the 2015 Act disapply the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act from applying to individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4 of the Mental Health Act, namely, those involuntarily detained under that Act subject to an admission or renewal order and individuals detained subjected to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006. It points out that, as I will be aware, officials in both Departments worked to remedy this exclusion and sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> The letter goes on to say that given the architecture of the existing Mental Health Acts, concerns were expressed over whether absolute treatment refusals by individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4 might undermine the validity of the order detaining them, where treatment is the basis of detention. It states that given those concerns, it was felt sections 85(7) and 136 of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act could only be amended to allow individuals detained on the grounds of section 3(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Mental Health Acts to access the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> The next paragraph of the letter is especially important in that it states the Department is in full agreement that this compromise is an interim measure until the issue can be addressed more comprehensively in the mental health Bill which will significantly overhaul provisions in Part 4 related to consent to treatment, to bring it into closer alignment with the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, which will seek to extend the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to all individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4 in a manner which does not undermine the validity of the orders detaining them.</p>
          <p eId="para_260"> The letter goes on to point out that, as I will be aware, the Government approved and published the general scheme of a Bill to amend the Mental Health Act in July 2021 and that the scheme contains more than 120 heads that, much like many of the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, deal with complex issues with regard to the right to liberty, good health and the right to autonomy and self-determination and the interplay between these different rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The letter states that in January 2022, drafters in the advisory council were assigned to draft a mental health Bill in line with the general scheme and that since then, officials in the Minister of State's Department have been working with their counterparts in the Office of the Attorney General to address outstanding legal issues in the general scheme, especially protection of liberty concerns for the cohort of individuals known as the compliant incapacitated. It states that recent correspondence between the Minister of State's Department and the Office of the Attorney General indicates a solution to this issue may be agreed upon shortly and that the Minister of State's officials have requested a meeting with the parliamentary drafters on the advisory council to plot out the development of the Bill in the coming months with a view to progressing the final draft Bill, as much as possible, during the spring 2023 legislative session.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The letter goes on to say that the Minister of State expects the meeting to take place before the year end and that the Minister of State has engaged with the Chief Whip to ensure this Bill will be deemed priority legislation in the spring session. It also states the Minister of State has asked her officials to continue to engage with counterparts in my Department during the development of the Bill on areas of shared interest, especially on the alignment between the Bill and the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, as well as provisions with regard to the care and treatment and children. The Minister of State has asked her officials to keep my officials abreast of progress on drafting of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> I will reference the Minister of State's statement in that we are in agreement the Bill we seek to pass today represents a compromise. It is an interim measure but the intention, through the reform of the mental health Bill, is to seek to extend the provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act to all individuals whose treatment is regulated by Part 4. I stress that the Minister of State has sought and received agreement from the Chief Whip that the mental health reform Bill will be regarded as priority legislation. It will get priority drafting with a view to having it in the spring session, that is, the session following our return after the Christmas break.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> I am sorry that was a lengthy contribution but it was worthwhile. The letter gives clear information on the priorities of the Minister of State, the Minister and the Government and the timeline we are working to achieve. We hope to pass the legislation in this session and address the remaining outstanding issues within the mental health Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">This amendment seeks to place a human rights-based and UNCRPD-compliant definition of "legal capacity" in the legislation. I was disappointed that the Minister refused to accept this amendment on Committee Stage, stating that the Government's position was that the operation of the functional model was uniquely qualified by an explicit respect for person's will and preference throughout the operation of the test. I do not know if there is a bit of a misunderstanding on this. The inclusion of a functional test is fundamentally incompatible with the universal recognition of the legal capacity of a person and the centrality of their will and preferences as required by Article 12 of the UNCRPD. The Minister received a letter from the vice chair of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Jonas Ruskus, urging him to amend this Bill to remove the functional test and clarifying that Ireland will be in violation of Article 12 of the UNCRPD if he does not do so. Ireland will have to answer to the UN committee when it meets in Geneva to consider our first state report. Why is the Minister unwilling to reform this legislation to meet our human rights obligations?</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> I was also disappointed by the objection to this amendment on Committee Stage. The Minister believed it provided for decision-making assistants to guide the decision of a relevant person. This could also be a bit of a misunderstanding as the proposed amendment imposes no such requirement. It instead obliges decision-making supports to be guided by the best interpretation of the relevant person's will or preferences. The focus is therefore always on the will and preference of the relevant person and in no way guided by the decision-making supporter. The same provision requires that supporters provide a reasonable account of how this interpretation was arrived at, confirming my point. This amendment would help to bring the Bill into line with the spirit of the UNCRPD. I hope the Minister will consider accepting it.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">This amendment seeks to replace section 3 of the 2015 Act, which sets out the functional capacity model, with a replacement text on legal capacity. I would argue that this amendment mixes two separate provisions. As the House will be aware, the 2015 Act provides for a presumption of capacity in section 8(2), which deals with the guiding principles. Section 8(7) already requires an intervener to give effect to the relevant person's will and preferences. As such, the provisions proposed by the Senator with regard to the recognition of legal capacity are already contained in the 2015 Act. Importantly, the commencement of the 2015 Act will remove wardship, thereby removing a system which explicitly removes a person's legal capacity. I recognise the importance of legal capacity, not least under the UNCRPD. It is the position of the Government that the operation of the functional model is qualified in an important and rights-based fashion in the Irish context by explicit reference to a person's will and preference throughout the operation of the functional capacity model in both the 2015 Act and the amending Bill before us today.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Section 3, which this amendment proposes to replace, has a different purpose. Its purpose is to provide a test that will apply where an intervener seeks to intrude on the decision-making autonomy of a relevant person. Such a test is necessary to protect the rights of the relevant person as a decision-making supporter should not be appointed unless absolutely necessary. Removing that test could lead to a situation in which decision supporters would take it upon themselves to take decisions on behalf of another person unnecessarily, even with good intentions. Respecting the person's autonomy is a key value underpinning the 2015 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_320"> The proposed provisions imply a test is needed. The proposed amendment provides in subsection 2(b) for the appointment of a person to support the relevant person in exercising legal capacity. Inevitably, the appointment of such a person would involve some form of process that would most likely be based on a set of criteria by which that person's situation was evaluated. Section 3 provides such a set of criteria, putting in place the limited circumstances in which a decision supporter can be appointed with authority to help another person with decisions. While I appreciate the intent of the amendment, examining section 3 in isolation is not helpful in assessing the Act's overall recognition and enabling of legal capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> The Senator spoke about the language. I have flagged these points previously but the issues are still present. On a technical level, there is language in the proposed amendment that we cannot accept. It is not appropriate that a decision-making assistant would guide the decision of a relevant person. This could be construed as leading a decision and is beyond the remit of the role, which is to assist a relevant person in their own decision-making. The requirement that the decision be guided by the decision-maker is contained within the amendment. The term "best interpretation" is also not used elsewhere in the 2015 Act. It is problematic and unnecessary, given the application of will and preference set out in the guiding principles section of the Act, section 8, and the superior legal clarity provided by the existing section. For that reason, I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">At a procedural level, this amendment has significant implications for the rights of disabled and older people. It was introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil and was not properly discussed, unfortunately, as that debate was guillotined prior to the full reading of all proposed amendments. </p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Minister's refusal to agree to this amendment on Committee Stage in the Seanad is a little concerning. He explained that his reason for introducing this provision was to clarify the intersection of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court and the 2015 Act and that it was important to note that these provisions do not create new powers for the High Court. The Minister also suggested that deletion of this provision would introduce procedural uncertainty where urgent care may be required and would not serve to limit the constitutional power of the High Court in this regard. However, he went on to correctly point out that the court possesses a constitutional role as the guardian of constitutional rights and it is not the power of this or any other House to remove that jurisdiction. It is a little difficult to understand why the Minister believes this provision is necessary and it is not possible for the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court to be removed or even altered.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> On Committee Stage, the Minister stated that part of the purpose of introducing the amendment was to signal that such applications should only be brought when the authority of High Court is very much needed to determine a matter in which a person's liberty might be in question. By seeking to qualify the role of the inherent jurisdiction in decision-making regarding the care, treatment and detention of individuals in the 2015 Act, he might be legitimising the option of seeking orders which circumvent the 2015 Act and allow for substitute decision-making entirely contrary to the stated intentions of the legislation. Removing this provision will not impact on the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. However, its retention risks embedding a twin track for healthcare decision-making which can override the principles of the 2015 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> What is important here is compliance. If the Minister is serious about compliance with the obligations of the UNCRPD, he should accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_329">I thank Senator Black for her amendment. The Senator expressed many of my views on why this is necessary. She is correct that the amendment we brought forward does not create a new power. There is an inherent jurisdiction of the High Court in making decisions but we, in our engagements with the Department of Health, felt it was necessary to signpost to the High Court in order to protect the rights of relevant persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Work is ongoing in the Department of Health on delivery of dedicated legislation on protection of liberty safeguards. There may be instances where matters regarding detention and treatment arise. By their nature, these cases will be rare but when they arise, they will be challenging. The provision introduced by me regarding inherent jurisdiction was done on foot of strong legal advice and considerable concern that without an explicit reference to the requirement for the High Court to be the only entity that would sanction a deprivation of liberty, procedural uncertainty that would exist without that clear signposting could put the rights of individuals at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The insertion regarding inherent jurisdiction clarifies that in any question regarding the sanction for a deprivation of liberty, such as where a residential arrangement might be contrary to the will and preference of the relevant person, that decision cannot be sanctioned by a decision supporter and must only be brought before the High Court, and that court's consideration is required to determine the matter in which a person's liberty might be at stake. I believe it is the correct way to ensure this is signposted. As such, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">I can understand the concerns on this point. I went over and back on this. Maybe it comes from decisions of the High Court. They tend to go on and make statements that sometimes seem irrelevant or unnecessary or involve an additional underscoring of a situation. This feels like it is underscoring the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court. It removes the necessity of interpretation when decisions need to be made urgently and someone's liberty is in question and ensures there is no need for a hearing on the interpretation of the legislative drafters. I contented myself with this section on that basis. It makes for a more expeditious hearing, if one is needed, on the basis that there was no intention of the legislative drafters to ever remove the High Court. It appears to reiterate something that we all know but it is an important point of clarity.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">Now that Ireland has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities embedding an explicit requirement for courts to interpret, they act in a manner that gives effect to the convention and strengthens the potential for the Act to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Ireland's human rights obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The Act was continually referred to by successive Ministers during its development as being an essential part of Ireland's preparation to ratify the UN convention. Inserting this amendment recognises that best practice in this field is continually evolving and reaffirms Ireland's commitment to refine and reinterpret our law in a manner consistent with our human rights obligations. Introducing this amendment signals Ireland's commitment to a progressive and evolving interpretation of the principal Act in light of emerging understanding of human rights law.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> On previous Stages, the Minister opposed this amendment on the grounds that, in his opinion, it is insufficiently clear for inclusion in primary legislation and that the UNCRPD sets general principles which must be then translated into more specific obligations. The Minister also objected to the inclusion of reference to "General Comment 1" as it is not drafted as a statutory provision. While I do not dispute any of these points, it is precisely because the UNCRPD and "General Comment 1" set out the requirements for states regarding the rights of persons with disabilities that reference should be included to them as framing the guiding principles of the principal Act, as has been repeated by Governments so many times over the years during the passage of both the 2015 Act and this amending legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The goal of this law is to meet Ireland's obligations under the UNCRPD, in particular, Article 12. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate to have the requirements of both the human rights treaty and this specific provision, and its interpretation of the UNCRPD committee, as interpretative rules for the Act's guiding principles. I, therefore, urge the Minister to reconsider his position on this point. I hope he will accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_349">The amendment proposes to create a new subsection under section 8 of the 2015 Act. Section 8 provides the guiding principles which underpin the Act, specifically with regard to making an intervention in respect of a relevant person. The amendment seeks to have the guiding principles interpreted in line with the UN convention, in particular, Article 12 and General Comment 1 of the UNCRPD.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> As I stated on Committee Stage, while I understand the intention of the amendment, it is vague in nature and lacks the necessary legal clarity for inclusion in primary legislation. Additionally, the inclusion of this provision is not necessary from a policy perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The language of the convention does not lend itself to inclusion in primary law and the text of the convention is primarily by way of statements that set standards for the signatories of the convention to meet. It does this by way of general principles that are designed to be interpreted by countries adopting national laws. General comment No. 1 is a good example of this, which itself is designed as a guide to the relevant sections of the convention. As stated previously, it would be highly unusual and legally problematic to grant such language the force of domestic law in the manner proposed. Aside from the technical difficulties with the amendment, since ratification of the convention by Ireland there is an overarching and existing obligation on the State to be compliant with the CRPD. This means that the obligation the amendment is intended to create already exists as a matter of law without the need for this proposed amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">While it is vital to ensure individuals' will, preferences and privacy are respected, it is crucial that the public is aware of how this monumental change to Ireland's capacity laws operates in practice and that researchers can document the operation of the system. This amendment allows for judicial discretion and draws on existing legislation to ensure representatives of bona fide press, researchers and legal professionals can still attend and report on cases, subject to reasonable restrictions. The Minister introduced an amendment to this section on Committee Stage here and it allows solicitors and barristers to report on cases, as well as others within a class of persons specified in regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> It is not clear, however, whether this will include members of the press and researchers. On Committee Stage in the Dáil, the Minister said he would consider an amendment of this type for researchers but not for members of the press. The history of wardship would have remained entirely secret and unknown to the public if it were not for the diligent reporting of socially minded journalists, who ensured that the realities of the system could not be entirely hidden away by closed proceedings. The same level of scrutiny of the system which will replace it should also be possible. Restricting journalists who write for the public creates the unavoidable suggestion that these proceedings are a niche professional matter, which I think is untrue. All of us may experience capacity issues in our lifetimes, so the proper operation of the system is of interest to all. </p>

          <p eId="para_379">As the Senator said, this issue was raised by Deputy Sherlock during the debate on this matter in the Dáil and I agreed to look at the issue again. We made a change to section 36 of the principal Act and it now provides for anonymised court reporting by legal professionals. Senator Seery Kearney spoke about this issue in the context of child law reporting and suggested that if there was a desire to create a decision support service reporting process, there would be clear permission to allow it to be used. The amendment also brought in a regulating power to allow the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, in consultation with the Minister for Justice, to include other classes of persons. Court research-type reporting is, therefore, provided for in section 36 and there is a power to include other classes of persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I have a concern about allowing journalists in. I think it is right that we have an <i>in camera</i> rule in the family courts. Some of the most distressing elements of an adult's life are being discussed in some of these cases and I question the appropriateness of having journalists there. Nevertheless, the possibility is open in respect of a regulation-making power and if a good case is made to subsequent Ministers for Justice and for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, then there is at least the possibility that other classes of people could be included. It is important to say that the research role, as rightly flagged in the Dáil debate, has already been provided for in the amendment I brought forward. Respectfully, we have gone as far as we need to go in terms of the amendments already brought forward. I am not, therefore, in a position to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">I come back to the excellent example given of Dr. Carol Coulter. The observations from the family courts have been instrumental. Having an application or process with the Minister as a gatekeeper in respect of who would have access, and through which appropriate people with appropriate credentials could be granted access for research and such purposes, is necessary. The way this aspect is contained in the Bill is adequate in ensuring there is access and transparency. Where additional access is needed, there is a process in respect of the Minister contained in the legislation as well. With respect, while I understand this proposed amendment, I do not think we need to approach this in such a prescriptive way. The system is there. We do not know what other classes of persons may arise. To have this possibility addressed via a loose classification within the Bill as it stands allows for discretion in the context of other situations and categories of professionals, and otherwise, to make applications to the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">Section 46 of the Bill amends section 59 of the 2015 Act to remove the option to grant powers to consent or refuse health treatment from an enduring power of attorney. This means individuals who wish to confer powers to consent to or refuse health treatment on a trusted supporter, at a time when they are no longer able to communicate their wishes, will have to complete a separate advanced healthcare directive. Even if they make an enduring power of attorney, the requirement to draft two separate instruments with different requirements, such as supporting evidence and witnesses, places an additional bureaucratic burden on the relevant person. This is especially burdensome if the relevant person wishes to authorise the same person, who holds the enduring power of attorney, as their designated healthcare representative to consent to or refuse treatment on their behalf, in accordance with their will and preference.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> It would be inconsistent with the approach in the rest of the Act to exclude healthcare treatment from enduring powers of attorney when decisions about healthcare treatment can be included in any other decision-supporting arrangement under the Act, including decision-making assistant agreements and co-decision-making agreements. It would also be inconsistent with the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the committee recommended that health and medical treatment decisions should be retained in the scope of an enduring power of attorney.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> The amendment would restore the original power that the Bill proposes to remove from individuals making an enduring power of attorney. The removal of this power is unnecessary to achieve the Minister's stated purpose of giving clarity to healthcare professionals about who has the authority to make a healthcare decision where a person lacks capacity. On Committee Stage in the Seanad, the Minister stated this was required to provide legal clarity for medical professionals and clinicians, citing a concern that if two decision supporters, such as an attorney and a designated healthcare representative, were to have equal rights in treatment decisions and were to disagree, it would be unclear as to whose view would prevail. The Minister's rationale for his amendment was to ensure all healthcare decision-making is governed by the safeguards contained in Part 8 of the principal Act. As Senator Warfield explained on Committee Stage, the principal Act already provides, in situations where one or more decision makers may have authority, the advanced healthcare directive and-or designated healthcare representative take precedence over other instruments. Certainty is already provided by the existing legislation. Deleting the Minister's amendment and retaining the option for people to appoint an attorney for healthcare decisions will ensure individuals who may use such instruments, such as older people, will not have an additional obstacle to making their will and preference known by having to make a separate advanced healthcare directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> The Minister can be assured that his concern about the need for safeguards is well addressed within the provisions of enduring power of attorney, including the right of complaint to the Decision Support Service where there is concern an attorney has acted or may act outside the scope of his or her function. The Decision Support Service may then refer the matter to the courts for a determination which may, in turn, remove the attorney from that role.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> By refusing to accept amendment No. 10 and removing the option for people to set out their healthcare decisions in an enduring power of attorney, the Minister is creating unnecessary hurdles to the vindication of the will and preferences of individuals who wish to plan for various aspects of their lives within a single instrument.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">The proposed amendment seeks to delete provisions in the Bill that remove treatment decisions from enduring powers of attorney, EPAs. While I note the purpose of the Senator's amendment, I believe the provisions her amendment seeks to delete are important in providing legal clarity. The importance of such legal clarity should not be underestimated. The removal of treatment decisions from EPAs ensures there will be no ambiguity between decisions included in EPAs and those in advanced healthcare directives, AHD. This clarity is essential to medical professionals treating relevant persons with a registered AHD, particularly in cases where urgent or even life-or-death decisions are required. The supporting statement of an advanced healthcare directive, alongside the explicitly health-focused role, makes a designated healthcare representative the appropriate decision supporter.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> In addition, Part 8 of the Act provides superior clarity and protections for relevant persons and healthcare professionals as to guidance on what should happen if an ambiguity arises in an advanced directive, such as when a decision supporter cannot be located immediately and a life-or-death decision must be made. Part 8 is the better part of the Act to address such concerns and sets out comprehensive and detailed provisions on treatment issues in a way sections relating to EPAs do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The Decision Support Service, DSS, will work to reduce any administrative burden associated with this process, and it will be permissible for the same person to act as an attorney and a designated healthcare representative. As I said on Committee Stage, the 2015 Act was reviewed in detail in the process of preparing the amended Bill. It was found there is a risk to a relevant person if two decision supporters have equal rights in treatment decisions at a moment of crisis and that the provisions of Part 8 were superior in terms of guidance and safeguard on treatment decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> The approach we are adopting is the correct approach. We should leave EPAs for issues such as property or personal welfare decisions. We should reserve advanced healthcare directives for health and treatment-based decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">I acknowledge it is complex legislation, and I acknowledge also Senator Black's review of it.

          <p eId="para_396"> This Act is an Act for everyone. We sometimes look at this and think it may only be for people who have capacity challenges. However, it will affect every part of people's lives as they get older and it could apply to people with dementia and so on, and I know that is what is being looked at in terms of potential roles when it comes to that stage in life. This is a very difficult area, but how this legislation will be managed is a question for all of us in our communities. As was said, providing clear guidance on a single decision maker at certain stages is crucial.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">The Bill retains discrimination against pregnant people who should have an AHD. The Minister committed to resolving this issue during pre-legislative scrutiny and on previous Stages in the Dáil but the amendment that has been made continues to treat someone's AHD differently once that person becomes pregnant. Pregnancy should not impact on an AHD. It should be within the decision-making powers of the directive-maker to stipulate if something is not to apply in the event of pregnancy. Women and people who can get pregnant deserve the security of knowing that their directive will not protect them less if they become pregnant and that their will and preferences will be respected in all circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> On Committee Stage in the House, the Minister explained the purpose of section 89(3)(b)(ii), namely to ensure that "where there has been an application under section 89(2) of the 2015 Act and the directive-maker is pregnant, there can be life-sustaining treatment for the mother and treatment to prevent a deleterious effect on her pregnancy". The Minister stated his belief that changing the term used in this section from "the unborn" to "her pregnancy" ensured the section would be value neutral. However, a simple change in language does not alter the discriminatory effect of this provision. Pregnancy is the only healthcare decision singled out for specific mention. I do not think there is any justification for this. The issue of the treatment to be provided, while a decision of the High Court is awaited regarding the validity or applicability of an AHD or whether a designated healthcare representative is acting in accordance with the relevant powers, can be adequately dealt with by reliance on sections 89(3)(a) and 89(3)(b)(i) of the Act. These state that until such a decision has been made by the court, nothing in an AHD should be construed as preventing medical professionals from providing life-sustaining treatment to the directive-maker or doing any act they reasonably believe to be necessary to prevent a serious deterioration in the health of the directive-maker.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> In order to avoid the provision of the differential medical treatment to pregnant people in circumstances where a question has arisen regarding an aspect of their AHD, the Minister should accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">Amendment No. 15 seeks to delete a provision relating to the ongoing care of pregnant directive-makers where the High Court is deliberating on the validity and applicability of an AHD. In general, section 89 concerns the role of the courts in clarifying, where necessary, the validity and applicability of an AHD. In the first instance, it is intended that the informal process set out in section 85(5) would be used for such purposes but referral to the High Court is available where this process cannot produce a result or where more serious issues of legal validity arise that might have implications for directives in a broader sense. It is designated to address a scenario where the will and preference of a directive-maker may not be clear in the AHD or where a legal mechanism is required to determine the validity of the AHD.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Section 89(3)(b)(ii), as amended, provides that in circumstances where there has been an application to the High Court under section 89(2) of the 2015 Act to clarify a question of applicability or validity of an AHD, pending the determination of the High Court, nothing in an AHD will prevent a person from doing any act that he or she reasonably believes necessary to prevent a serious deterioration in the health of the directive-maker or, if the directive-maker is a pregnant woman, a deleterious effect on her pregnancy. The term "pregnancy" has been changed from "unborn" in order to provide a more holistic approach to healthcare for a pregnant woman. In addition, it does not reference the language arising from the previous constitutional position, which could be interpreted in respect of a historical context that no longer exists. I stress that the provision is an interim one, designed to ensure that care can be provided pending the determination of a court. It does not provide a vehicle for a woman's will and preference to be overturned; rather, it provides a legal vehicle where an ambiguity as to will and preference, or the legal question of validity, can be resolved. The High Court will continue to have a role under section 89(2); therefore, this provision is still required, even in light of the deletion of section 85(6). As such, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Amendment No. 16, tabled by Senator Mullen, proposes to reverse the change made to section 89(3) on Report Stage in the Dáil. He is seeking to reinstate the original language of "the unborn" as opposed to the current wording of "her pregnancy". This matter was debated by the Senator on Committee Stage when the particular section of the Bill was opposed. There has been some debate, both on Committee Stage and in the intervening period, as to the effect of the change in language from "the unborn" to "her pregnancy" and whether this change is warranted. Let me be clear; the purpose of the change is to ensure that healthcare professionals can provide any treatment that may be required in respect of a pregnant directive-maker, including treatment of the foetus, where the court is deliberating on the applicability or validity of an AHD.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Section 89(2) provides for the consideration, with regard to life-sustaining treatment, by the High Court as to the validity and applicability of an AHD. During this period of deliberation by the High Court, section 89(3)(b)(ii), as amended, empowers the healthcare professional to act and ensure that there is no deleterious effect on the pregnancy. The term "her pregnancy" has been changed from "the unborn" in order to provide a more holistic approach to healthcare for a pregnant woman. Also, it does not reference the language arising from the previous constitutional position, which could be interpreted by a medical professional in terms of a previous legal context that no longer applies. This does not grant any power to alter or set aside an AHD where a clear expression of will and preference is in the creating instrument but it allows for a very necessary interim period when treatment can be provided, pending the court's clarification of any issue regarding the validity or applicability of an AHD.</p>

          <from>Senator Rónán Mullen<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_424">I welcome the Minister. I thank him for his engagement, and that of his officials, with me and other Senators, which arose out of concerns I raised on Committee Stage regarding a number of issues, including the one that is the subject of this amendment. It is fair to say that the Minister and I both clarified our thinking, to judge by the difference between the language in the Bill on Committee Stage and today. I also thank him for having his officials write to me with a summary of the discussion we had when we met.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> I will not object to certain sections that I opposed on the previous occasion, when I raised the issue about what ought to happen where an AHD is silent on what should happen if a woman is pregnant and refusing treatment. On Committee Stage, the Minister said it was about the pregnant person who is making the AHD being in the same position as any other patient. The refinement of that position, however, which came through our conversation and was also clear from his officials, is that he has made the point, and I accept its validity, that a person who is pregnant but has not made an AHD would be in a different position. As I said, our thinking has moved on regarding that.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> I am still of the view, even in the context of our abortion legislation where there is considerable protection for the unborn after 12 weeks, that there is a strong public policy argument for having and providing specifically for a presumption in favour of giving treatment in order to avoid a deleterious effect on the unborn when an AHD is silent as to whether the refusal of treatment in that regard applies to a pregnancy situation. As I said, that is, in a sense, water under the bridge. The Minister has made his point and I see a certain technical force to his argument. </p>
          <p eId="para_427"> However, in our discussions with the Minister and his officials, we also discussed the other amendment that I tabled on Committee Stage, which is the one under discussion this evening. As he rightly said, this has to do with the temporary situation where the validity and applicability of an AHD for refusing treatment is under consideration by the courts. He seeks to continue the assurance in the law that a healthcare professional may continue to give treatment to avoid a deleterious effect on the unborn child, as it is in reality, pending the outcome of the deliberation on the AHD. We are agreed on that. This is a temporary safeguard to prevent a situation where the unborn child in the womb would suffer damage in circumstances where, in fact, the AHD might not be upheld or its validity might be in some way in doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I have to correct the Minister on one point. He said that I am seeking to restore the position as it stood after the Dáil debate by restoring, as he would put it, the eighth amendment language of the unborn; I am not. My amendment does not reference the unborn; it references the unborn child. There is a significance to that. Before ever there was an eighth amendment, there was, and remains, reference to the "unborn child" in Irish legislation, as the Minister knows. I think it is section 59 of the Civil Liability Act 1961, which has to do with basically damage and the civil liability towards an unborn child who was injured <i>in utero</i> and survived that situation. The law still refers to the "unborn child". There is nothing unconstitutional or confusing about it. As far as I know, the only place where a foetus is referred to - and this is the language the Minister used in his response to me on foot of my inquiries - is clearly in the abortion legislation. There is no constitutional problem with references to the unborn child in our law. If there was, the 1961 Act would surely have been amended. </p>
          <p eId="para_429"> There is a suggestion in what the Minister said that this is to avoid some kind of confusion where doctors or other healthcare professionals might go further than what the legislation is providing for. One would have to give some kind of evidence for that interpretation, because it is clear what the section under discussion does. It provides for the temporary permissibility of giving healthcare treatment in order to avoid damage to the unborn while the validity, etc., of the AHD is being determined by the courts. That is all that it involves. It is not an ongoing safeguard for the life of the unborn or anything like it and I do not think anybody is suggesting otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> I refer to the Minister’s other argument, where he said it is somehow more holistic to get rid of a reference to the entity. I am reminded of Prince - the actor, the performer or the musician formerly known as Prince. The entity formerly called the “unborn” is now to be referred to as “her pregnancy”. Senator Seery Kearney, of course, raised an issue about that and I think Senator Black is concerned about the gender inclusivity of that. I will withhold any comment on that this evening. The idea that we must not ever refer to the unborn child again in legislation because it might somehow cast some kind of aspersion on our abortion law shows a poverty of thinking on the part of the Government and I would go so far as to say a meanness of spirit on behalf of the State. Nobody in the legislation is purporting to curtail the applicability of the abortion legislation, though many of us in the country see it as a tragic development in our law. The reality is that in the circumstances the Minister described, the unborn child, to use politically correct language that some people like to use, might have been a “much wanted child”. The idea that it is somehow more somehow more holistic to delete his or her humanity and just term him or her henceforth as “her pregnancy” is Orwellian. It seems that the Minister may think some kind of harm would flow from maintaining the reference. </p>
          <p eId="para_431"> This section of the legislation, which is being left intact, is precautionary for the sake not of the mother, but of the life that currently is in being. There are no two ways about it. That is what this is about. One is not trying to preserve a piece of tissue; one is trying to preserve a life, for the moment, until the AHD, which might have consequences for that life, is fully determined and investigated, as it were. The baby is being talked about. It would be tragic, indeed, if State and government officials just lost the capacity to refer to an unborn child in the womb lest they might be thought to be somehow subtracting from the abortion rights claimed by some and provided for in the law. That is a failure to engage in proper discernment about what individual Bills mean. </p>
          <p eId="para_432"> This legislation is not about the abortion law; it will not change it one way or the other. It is a precautionary step to avoid damaging the unborn child pending the determination of an AHD. It seems that one should not go changing language for no good reason. Using a word such as “holistic”, is, at it were, to try to cast some kind of whiff of incense over what is being proposed here. However, “holistic” means nothing in this situation. If one were to be holistic, generally, one is being inclusive. When we talk about holistic care of a person, we might be talking about social, emotional and physical care, that is, not just one dimension. I put it to the Minister that in this particular situation, being holistic would involve recognising that potentially a human life is being dealt with that may suffer damage in circumstances where the AHD, which might have consequences for that life, might not be upheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> I received a helpful note from the Minister’s officials at his request and I thank him for it. As I said, I accept the force of some of the argument in it, particularly as regards the previous issue, which I have not opposed today, and I am not opposing those sections. However, the very short note I received on this particular point rightly states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_434">The provision only concerns treatment that may be provided by a healthcare professional outside the context of an AHD in circumstances where its validity or applicability is under consideration by the High Court. In changing the language used from “unborn” to “pregnancy”, the amendment ensures that healthcare professionals can provide any treatment required in respect of a pregnant directive maker.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The Minister is suggesting that if that language change is not made, they might be prevented from doing that. Where is the evidence for that? Where is the evidence that the Minister needs to change the language to ensure healthcare professionals can do whatever? The entire section is providing that they can provide care until such time as the AHD is determined. The reason they are providing that care is to avoid potentially damaging a life. That is the reality of what the section seeks to achieve, so why can the Minister not say it? Why are we so allergic now? Anyway, he is saying this ensures healthcare professionals can provide any treatment, including with regard to foetus, while the court is deliberating on the applicability, while also ensuring that the focus is on the treatment, will and preferences of the patient. That is getting a bit more to what the Minister is trying to say and do. </p>
          <p eId="para_436"> His officials said in our meeting that somehow he feels that if he names the unborn or unborn child as an entity, he is somehow taking the focus off the mother. However, again, that is a zero-sum game and conflictual interpretation of what is going on here. The mother has not made an AHD to destroy the life of her child. We accept that a person can make an AHD refusing treatment even if that compromises the life of her child.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">We accept that. However, the idea that the focus now needs to be kept on the treatment, will and preference of the patient by removing any reference to the baby, even though the very section is about protecting the baby in a precautionary way until the court has made its ruling, is mean-spirited. I do not say that as a personal accusation. I condemn the State, the statism and the hardness of heart that underlies that particular change. I ask the Minister, even at this stage, to accept my amendment on that small point for the sake of decency.</p>

          <from>Senator Mary Seery Kearney<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_438">On Committee Stage, I heard Senator Mullen's argument, which came out of the blue for me as it was not something I had thought about before. I had sympathy for his view. He and I engaged extensively the following day about it. I thank the Minister for facilitating a meeting with all of us, including the officials who are present and two others from the Department of Health, subsequent to that. In that meeting, we heard in great detail the expected steps that would occur in the various scenarios that we put to the room. We considered what would happen in certain scenarios and went through various situations. Something lacking from the language of the amendments is the sheer extent of consideration that is behind all of this and which was exhibited on that day. Consequently, I support the Minister's position completely and utterly. I do not agree that there is anything mean-spirited at play.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> What gave me great clarity at that meeting was that the term "her pregnancy" is included to ensure that the person requiring the treatment is at the centre of everyone's decision-making and that doctors and medical professionals in that situation are also mindful of their obligations with regard to the baby that is also present and the viability of that child. There are already protocols in place to safeguard this. It has nothing to do with, and is completely siloed from, the termination of pregnancy. That is something completely different. That point was repeatedly reiterated in that meeting and in the explanation of the sheer extent of contemplation that was brought to bear on what decisions must be made in the hopefully rare situation where this legislation needs to be relied upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> In the interim, I have had representations from a former party colleague, Nora Owen, a former Minister for Justice and deputy leader of our party. She is currently a board member of Safeguarding Ireland. That organisation's representation was to absolutely support the wording the Minister has put here and regard it as a long overdue and needed set of words and formula. I thank Ms Owen for her work in that regard. I support the Minister's position.</p>

          <p eId="para_441">I accept an awful lot of what the Minister said at the meeting. I thank him for that time and thank his officials for that meeting. My only concern about all of this is that I am uncomfortable with the language and the term "her pregnancy" because in my opinion, that anonymises the baby, the wee life that is there, by not attaching a life to the pregnancy. One can be pregnant and have an unviable baby. One can have a pregnancy that does not carry through. It is unfortunate that we are moving away from acknowledging a life, particularly after the 12 weeks for which we have legislated. Thankfully, we passed a referendum to allow for that choice. However, by inserting "her pregnancy" and taking out consideration of the unborn, we are anonymising that life. I do not have adequate words, but that is reducing that life to a medical condition and not considering that life.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">As Senator Mullen said, we discussed two issues on Committee Stage. One related to a situation where an AHD is silent, an accident has taken place and there is a question about how a determination has been made. Our meeting and subsequent engagements were useful. We discussed section 85(5), which deals with an informal engagement to ascertain the will and preference of a pregnant woman and if that is not ascertainable, what steps are taken, including recourse to a decision support representative and engagement with the family. Section 89 is there to put that on a more formalised basis if the provisions under section 85(5) cannot deliver the required degree of clarity. Section 89(3) is there to ensure treatment continues while that process to ascertain is ongoing. When we have the opportunity to look through it in detail, we can see there is a significant range of protections and mechanisms in place to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I will turn to consider the change that has been introduced through the replacement of "unborn child" with "her pregnancy". My officials are very clear that the reference to "unborn child" in the original 2015 Act was based on the eighth amendment. I know Senator Mullen has a different take on that point but that is the advice I have received at all times. The reason we are making this change is to avoid signalling to a healthcare provider that a position that was required under the former constitutional position continues to be maintained. The language of pregnancy that is now being used in the section does not preclude treatment for the benefit of the foetus but it does not run the risk of the particular interpretation that the former provision had.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> I used the word "holistic", of which Senator Mullen was critical. Senator Seery Kearney explained what I meant by "holistic", in that we are trying to demonstrate by the use of the term "her pregnancy" that the pregnant woman is at the centre. She is the decision-maker and it is her will and preference that is central to all of this. It is for that reason I would argue that this is an holistic approach recognising that it is about advance healthcare decisions and in this case, the advance healthcare decision that a pregnant woman makes. I am not in a position to accept either the amendment from Senator Mullen or the amendment from Senators Black and Flynn.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">Those who campaigned for this legislation specifically argued that a comprehensive review clause was necessary to ensure that the legislation remained under review at regular intervals, given the pace of change in this area globally and advances in practice on the ground. We recommend adding a further provision to ensure that the legislation is reviewed at least once every three years. As we have seen from the review of the Mental Health Act 2001, without a legislative requirement for a regular review, <i>ad hoc</i> reviews approved by Departments take longer to complete and risk not having the recommendations for reform met in full. Therefore, the introduction of a rolling review in respect of this legislation is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> I hope the Minister will reconsider his position on this amendment. He refused it on Committee Stage, when he stated that the Bill already contained a review clause. He also suggested that this amendment would have the unintended consequence of restricting the review to only the matters stated. He felt that it was important to ensure that the review provisions were broad enough to address whatever issues arose in the context and operation of the legislation. I agree that the review should be as broad as possible. It is for this reason that my amendment is necessary. The Bill as it stands only allows for a review of its operation and effectiveness. My amendment would include the requirement to assess the interpretation and accessibility of the legislation and for the review to be done in consultation with persons with disabilities, something that the Bill does not really require. It should also be noted that the language used in the amendment is not exhaustive and that any such review would not be limited to only examining the operation, effectiveness, interpretation and accessibility of the legislation. Those would simply be the minimum requirements of any review and it would always be open to the Minister of the day to set down broader terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> As the Bill is written, stakeholders would have no right to request a review. Therefore, it is imperative that rolling reviews be carried out every three years to ensure that any necessary amendment to the legislation is identified and incorporated in it. I ask the Minister to reconsider his position and accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_464">Section 149 originally provided for a full review of the 2015 Act with the exception of Part 8, which falls under the responsibility of the Department of Health. Through Government amendments tabled in the Dáil by me, this review will now include Part 8, which has been agreed with the Department of Health. This was an important broadening of the capacity to review and reflected issues that arose during the debates as well as engagements with representative groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I understand that this amendment seeks to provide for an inclusive and robust review. However, it would have the unintended consequence of restricting a review to only the matters stated. The review provisions must be broad enough to address whatever issues may arise in the operation of the legislation. The amendment also seeks a review every three years after the initial review period. This would not be considered normal practice for legislation, which is reviewed on a periodic basis by Departments and Ministers as a matter of normal business. Subsequent revisions can be identified through normal business practices and engagement processes between stakeholders and the broader routine monitoring of legislative functions that all Ministers and Departments undertake. Therefore, I am not able to accept this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">This amendment extends the cap on Circuit Court judges to 40, an increase of three. I am aware that the commencement of the 2015 Act will impact the Circuit Court, particularly in terms of the appointment of decision-making representatives under Part 5. All decision-making representative applications will go to the Circuit Court once the Act is commenced. When combined with the changes made to the nursing homes support scheme, we must acknowledge the increased caseload that will be generated for the Circuit Court. Without a period of operation of the 2015 Act to examine, it is not possible to be exact as to the number of applications expected to come before the Circuit Court, but it is estimated by the Decision Support Service that there will be approximately 1,200 court applications each year under Part 5 of the 2015 Act. In addition, the Circuit Court will now deal with nursing homes support scheme applications, which will be formally carried out by county registrars. This follows the introduction of Government amendments on Committee Stage, having regard to the superior protections offered in the 2015 Act relating to the relevant person's will and preference.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The inclusion of the proposed amendment to allow for the immediate recruitment of three Circuit Court judges will ensure that, in advance of broader considerations around judicial resourcing, the immediate caseload generated by the commencement of the 2015 Act will be more manageable. I thank my colleagues, the Ministers for Justice and Public Expenditure and Reform, for supporting this important measure, which ensures that the Circuit Court will be ready to process Part 5 applications upon commencement.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">Amendments No. 23 and 24 ensure that there is clarity regarding the appointment of care representatives under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, particularly those appointed after the enactment and commencement of this Bill. In that regard, this group of amendments chiefly improves continuity and transitional provision. Following commencement of the amended 2015 Act, care representative applications may no longer be made to the court under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009. However, care representative transitional arrangements introduced on Committee Stage allow for applications made prior to commencement to be processed to completion. A small number of care representatives may still be appointed following commencement where an existing application was in process prior to commencement.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">A care representative appointed before commencement may be replaced by certain decision supporters under arrangements provided for in the Bill. The amendments seek to clarify that care representatives appointed after commencement may also be replaced under the same arrangement. This is to ensure there is no ambiguity with regard to care representatives whose applications were completed following commencement and a clear delineation of responsibilities with regard to a relevant person's affairs. Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are minor technical amendments to clarify language and grammar in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">I thank the Minister for considering the amendment we brought on Committee Stage with regard to the proportion of positions on the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission's, IHREC, disability advisory board reserved for people with disabilities. The amendment seeks to use the UNCRPD definition of "disability" for the criteria of membership of IHREC's disability advisory committee rather than the more antiquated definition contained in the Disability Act 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> The Minister refused to accept this amendment on Committee Stage and stated there was a need for consistency across legislation and that the definition contained in the Disability Act 2005 is well known and well used. However, it is important to note that the 2005 Act was enacted before the drafting and adoption of the UNCRPD. The definition of "disability" contained in the 2005 Act takes a more restrictive and medicalised approach to disability than the UNCRPD, which defines persons with disabilities as including "those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others". Ireland has ratified the UNCRPD and, therefore, accepted this definition.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> It is also important to note that the Disability Act predates the UNCRPD and does not reflect current understandings of the human rights model of disability. In addition, in its recruitment campaign for the disability advisory committee earlier this year, IHREC aligned its definition of "disability" with that contained in the UNCRPD, rather than the Disability Act. Given IHREC has adopted the UNCRPD definition of "disability" in its work, will the Minister accept there is no reason to refuse this amendment to give life to the UNCRPD in our domestic legislation? We should not discard useful elements of the convention to make shortcuts. This is important legislation and it is worth doing it right.</p>

        <speech by="#RodericOGorman" eId="spk_176" as="#Minister_for_Children,_Equality,_Disability,_Integration_and_Youth">
          <from>Deputy Roderic O'Gorman<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T18:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_485">I will speak to each of the amendments in the grouping. While I understand the intent behind amendment No. 27, the current wording is problematic as it is not feasible or practical to specify in law that IHREC must extensively engage with all persons with a disability. This could lead to a situation in which IHREC undertook a detailed consultation process and, yet, becomes subject to a legal challenge from one person omitted from such a consultation. It would inevitably make a consultation process unworkable. It is important to remember IHREC already has a disability advisory committee composed of people with lived experience of disability and has discretion and a strong record with regard to engagement with all necessary persons and organisations in the conduct of its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> With regard to amendment No. 28 and Government amendment No. 29, there was discussion on Committee Stage and in the Dáil with regard to the make up of the committee. I agreed with Senators Black and Warfield to look at this. Thus, I am bringing forward amendment No. 29 to increase the representation of disabled persons on the advisory committee to support IHREC in its role of monitoring and promoting the implementation of the UNCRPD. Representation by disabled persons on the advisory committee was originally required to be at least half and this amendment will increase that representation to two thirds. A number of Deputies proposed this amendments and, indeed, Senator Black has a similar amendment that is slightly differently worded. With respect, I will not accept Senator Black's amendment. We will go with our wording but we thank Senator Black and other Deputies and Senators for their engagement on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> While I acknowledge the intention of amendment No. 30, I am not in a position to accept it. The definition of "disability" in the Disability Act 2005 is widely used, carries legal weight within the State and is cross-referenced in a number of key areas. It is important the legal definitions within the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014 are consistent with other definitions contained within primary law. As mentioned on Committee Stage, there are important provisions on disability contained within both the	 Equal Status Act and the Employment Equality Acts and any definitions need to be aligned with them. What is assigned to disability within the 2005 Acts is well-established, widely known and widely used. In addition, the definition in the convention is not legally or technically tight or precise enough to function as a legal definition on the Statute Book or the purpose of the text in domestic law. For that reason, I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</p>

There has been extensive engagement and him and his officials have been exceptional throughout. It is very important we move as quickly as possible, that everyone is resourced to do so and the day of wards of court be over as quickly as possible. It is incumbent on me to mention there is a small group of wards for which justice remains outstanding. We need a solution to that and I may engage with the Minister at a later point on it because there is certainly a terrible injustice there for some. With the passing of the Bill into law and its signature, we should hasten the moment when we ratify the optional protocol on the UNCRPD.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this important legislation. I have been fighting against things I do not necessarily agree with in it but, overall, what we are doing here is very important. We see people in our constituencies go into the ward of court system far too often.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">That is absolutely wrong and I am proud to be part of changing that. We have to work hard now to get the mental health Bill through, to make sure we look after people. We must look at the discriminations we have put into law, get rid of them and move forward as soon as possible. I thank the Minister's officials. All through the process there has been huge engagement with many stakeholders and the Decision Support Service. As we move into 2023 with the enactment and commencement of this Act, the Department must make sure people are supported to come out of the ward of court system with proper housing and the proper supports to live independently. They must be allowed to be themselves where they are not allowed to do that now. We also need to make sure we have a properly resourced Decision Support Service in order to work through those applications for review by wards of court as soon as possible and as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> I thank all my colleagues for their engagement, as well as the people who have been working on this Bill and have put so many hours into it for no pay.

          <p eId="para_506">I thank the Senators for their kind comments. It is an important day. We are today taking the second-last step towards consigning wardship to being a historical point rather than a lived reality. It is a Victorian institution but it remains a lived reality for thousands of people in our country today. That is no longer an appropriate mechanism to deal with the many sensitive, personal, technical and legal requirements that stem from a person whose capacity is diminished, and has not been for a long time. It does not recognise the spectrum across which a person's capacity can be diminished. A previous Dáil took the steps necessary to address this but those provisions have not been in operation. We will have to bring this legislation through one final session in the Dáil and I look forward to doing that before the Christmas recess. I am very grateful to Senators for their engagement. This legislation is stronger for the process it has gone through, notwithstanding the legitimate concerns that have been raised. It was important that I had the opportunity today to set out the work that is going on across government, particularly in the Department of Health, on the reform of the Mental Health Act and our view of what the common goal is. That goal is to have a single treatment of everybody under section 4 of the revised Mental Health Act in terms of their ability to access advanced healthcare directives. I thank Senators, Deputies and those in the advocacy groups. I look forward to getting this passed quickly through the Dáil and having it enacted and up and running in 2023.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I am pleased to be here this evening to discuss the Finance Bill 2022. As Senators are aware, the annual Finance Bill provides a legislative basis for the provisions introduced in the budget as well as some further changes to the tax code. I understand that Senators have been provided with an updated summary of the Bill as passed by the Dáil so I do not consider that I need go through the Bill on a section by section basis. Instead I propose to look at the broad themes in the Bill and how it will provide the legislative basis for budget decisions already taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Budget 2023 is a cost-of-living budget, agreed by the Government to provide much needed support to households and businesses faced with increasing costs, particularly energy costs brought on by the Russian aggression in Ukraine. The budget must be considered in the round. It includes a combination of supports and tax reductions and only some of these are provided for in the Finance Bill. A total of approximately €4 billion has been provided across the economy in the form of temporary supports in the budget and this reflects the Government's determination to do as much as it can to alleviate the suffering caused by the effects of this invasion of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> In relation to households, the Government believes that hard-working taxpayers enter the higher rate of income tax at too low an income level. Accordingly, for the second year in a row the budget increases the entry point to the higher rate of income tax for all income earners. For 2023 and subsequent years of assessment the standard rate cut-off point will be increased by €3,200, which represents an 8.7% increase. There will also be proportionate increases in the bands applying to married couples and civil partners as well as a number of other increases in tax credits. These increases in the tax credits will provide a real benefit to all individuals who pay income tax by reducing their overall income tax liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> Some 2.1 million taxpayers, which equates to approximately 64% of all taxpayers, will benefit from the income tax changes introduced in this year's budget. Everyone who pays income tax will benefit from these changes to some extent, depending on their earnings and personal circumstances. The balance of 36% are exempt from income tax or their tax liability is fully covered by their tax credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> These changes contribute to the Government's overall income tax strategy to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners. Over the two most recent budgets, on average the standard rate cut-off point has been increased by just over 13% and the main tax credits have been increased by just under 8%. These tax changes have been carefully tailored to ensure that workers do not find themselves in a position where they pay more income tax solely because of wage growth inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Bill also provides for the new income tax credit for rental payments which will benefit renters, as well as parents paying rent for children attending college.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The Bill provides for changes to the small benefits exemption. It increases the total value of qualifying benefits or vouchers an employer can give in a year to €1,000 tax-free and extends the combined number of benefits from one to two.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> The extension of the mineral oil tax reductions to 1 March 2023, rather than 12 October 2022 as originally intended, will also assist households, as will the reduction in the NORA levy to offset carbon tax increases. The 9% reduced rate of VAT which applies to the supply of electricity and gas has been extended to 28 February 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The Government is committed to addressing challenges around housing supply, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the country. The introduction of the vacant homes tax and changes to the residential zoned land tax aim to increase the supply of homes for rent and purchase. Further provisions of the Bill extend and enhance existing schemes. For example, changes to the pre-letting expenses regime should assist landlords preparing properties for rent.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The help-to-buy scheme will be extended for a further two years. This extension, which is in line with a recommendation of the recent independent review of the scheme, takes account of the need for certainty in the market pending an increase in new housing supply, as envisaged in the Government's Housing for All strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The Bill provides for the extension of the living city initiative until 31 December 2027, with some enhancements to the relief for new owner-occupiers claiming the relief in future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> The Bill also provides for a new tax incentive for small-scale landlords who undertake retrofitting works while the tenant remains <i>in situ</i>. The aim of this incentive is to attract and retain small-scale landlords in the private rental sector. This is a tax deduction against rental income for certain retrofitting expenses incurred by landlords on rented residential properties. The expenses that qualify for deduction are those in respect of which the landlord has received a home energy grant from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> As usual in finance Bills, a number of technical changes are being put in place to make changes to the legislation to ensure it functions as intended, to give sufficient powers to the Revenue Commissioners to ensure they can enforce tax legislation and to correct technical errors arising from previous Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> As well as supporting households, the budget and this Bill, which provides a legislative basis for it, make provision for supports for businesses. For example, the Bill provides for the application of a zero rate of VAT to a number of items including certain health products, period products and newspapers. It also extends the special assignee relief programme for a further three years to 31 December 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> A number of changes have also been made to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, including extending the sunset clause for KEEP from the end of 2023 to the end of 2025, which is effectively a further three years. These changes are aimed at increasing the effectiveness of the scheme in helping the SME sector to retain employees and allowing SMEs to compete with larger companies for workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Finally, I draw Senators attention to the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which was announced on budget day and opened for registrations over the weekend. I can confirm that state aid approval of the scheme was received last week from the European Commission. Guidelines on the scheme have been published on the Revenue website. The scheme follows the other successful schemes operated by Revenue to support businesses through the Covid crisis, which included the wage subsidy schemes, the Covid restrictions support scheme and the tax debt warehousing scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> To conclude, the Bill provides a legislative basis for the budget announcements in relation to taxation and makes a number of other necessary changes to tax legislation. I look forward to constructive debate on its provisions and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Senator Maria Byrne<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_524">I welcome the Minister of State here this evening to discuss the all-important issue of the Finance Bill and the budget for 2023. The aim of the budget is to put more money back in people's pockets with measures, as the Minister of State outlined, such as cutting income tax, increasing pension payments and increasing welfare payments for families, people with disabilities and carers. I welcome those measures because many people are marginalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Some people do not become ill through their own fault and end up on invalidity or disability. They would love to be able to get up and go out to work. It is important that we look after people who genuinely fall on hard times. I pay tribute to the carers who look after family members or friends and help to keep them at home in their own environment. Certainly, that helps in terms of longevity. The population is living longer and it is down to the work of carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> The Bill is also aimed at families. We have heard about the squeezed middle for many years. For young families, there is the cost of services such as childcare. The budget is a start towards bringing down such costs. It is also about giving payments to families. The reduction in college fees will help many older students as they are going to colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> There is something I would like the Minister of State to look at. While I am aware that there is a reduction in student fees, if one has two or three children, it is still the same reduction. I refer to those who have three people in college at the one time. I met a family recently and they have three children in college. They receive nothing extra for having three. It is quite expensive to have three. They are all in different colleges, which, I suppose, does not help. Some of them are travelling to where they were because of what they are studying. It is something that the Minister of State might be able to look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> One of the important measures is the help for businesses. Businesses are going through such turbulent times. We have got to secure jobs but we have also got to make sure that businesses stay open. Certainly, we have had Covid. We have the war. I welcome the fact that there is money in the closet or in the safe if there is to be another unprecedented situation. The scheme has been operated through the Revenue and has been very successful but we need to ensure that if things go on longer, it will be reviewed in February. I would like a commitment from the Minister of State in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> On the energy support grants, I welcome correspondence from Mr. Jennings of the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, which represents convenience stores and smaller retailers. Certainly, they are concerned about the costs. I note that a number of their retailers were on the national media recently. Their costs have gone completely through the roof. One store keeper alone received a bill of up to €20,000. It is phenomenal. They are looking at the unit price. Currently, pay is the crux of the problem. They can show that their consumption is responsible and efficient but the multiplier of 57% per unit leads to bills that are 350% higher than 12 months previously. That is hitting many businesses, especially businesses where they have a lot of vans and cooling equipment. There are many businesses in that situation. They understand that the wholesale prices on the international market are declining but these lower prices cannot be availed of and passed on due to a mixture of advance spot contracts and currency calculations. Would the Government be in a position to suggest that it will not allow the energy companies to enjoy super profits from the crisis? The message we need to send out, loud and clear, is that we should demand they immediately reduce the unit prices they currently charge by that level.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> On domestic bills, I had a phone call from a resident in Limerick yesterday. Two months ago, their bill was €257. They received a bill yesterday. They used fewer units than they had in the previous two months and it is €599. That is an extraordinary increase. </p>
          <p eId="para_531">The extension of the Living City Initiative is welcome. I live just at the Georgian Limerick area of the city and this scheme is incentivising people to live in the city centre. We still, however, have many buildings derelict. I understand that the Croí Cónaithe scheme and dereliction tax measures are coming in. These are all going to help to incentivise people to live in our city centres. This is most important. Many city centres are suffering the same issues, in that there is not enough footfall and not enough people living in them. I certainly welcome this initiative as a start and it will help landlords. I refer as well to the retrofitting scheme and the provision of a tax relief in respect of carrying out works of this kind.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> Another issue I would like to raise with the Minister of State, and it is under section 47, concerns the excise duty on tobacco. It is currently illegal for a retailer to sell above the fixed price, yet four different cigarette types are sold at a lower price because they are on special offer. This does not seem to be illegal while the cigarette packets are kept under the counter. It should not be illegal for a retailer to add on 10 cent or 20 cent. It should be up to retailers to charge whatever they want, because if there is a vending machine on the premises the cost is more expensive than the recommended prices. I would like the Minister of State to examine this aspect. Many retailers are curtailed in what they can charge. We are trying to get people to quit smoking, so this may be a win-win situation for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> Overall, though, I welcome this year's budget. It is geared towards families, and young families, and people who may have fallen on hard times. We are also protecting jobs and working towards doing this is to be most welcomed. I would like to get a commitment that the temporary business support scheme, TBESS, if it were to continue in operation for longer in these unprecedented times, will be reviewed in March 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> Turning to the 0% rate on newspapers and magazines, many newspapers have welcomed this development. We also have, though, news magazines and publications like <i>The Economist </i>and<i> The Financial Times </i>used by businesses. I ask the Minister of State to consider a 0% rate of VAT on these as well because this would be most important.</p>

          <from>Senator Michael McDowell<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_536">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Tosóidh mé leis an vacant property tax. This is a joke and it is a sick joke as well. The Government is putting this forward as a measure that is supposed to increase the number of properties available for rent, I presume, or else for sale in any given year. Let us, though, be clear about what we are dealing with now. We are dealing with a deeply ideologically confused Government. I am not referring to the Minister of State in this respect. I think he is clear minded on the subject. Some of his colleagues, however, need to take a look in the mirror.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> We have changed the law in the last two years to provide that people letting houses for more than six months face the situation where they cannot, under any circumstances, get back those homes from the tenants, except for four stated reasons. Once people are there, they are there forever, effectively, unless landlords require vacant possession for one of four reasons. One of these is the desire to sell the house with vacant possession. The result has been that a large proportion of the houses that are now for sale - it is roughly 50% - are now being sold by landlords. The Government has now said it is worried about the increase in rents. If the size of the stock of rentable properties is diminished in the way it is being done now, the inevitable consequences are that we will have rising rents. There is no way out of this. If we cut the number of houses available for rent, and many people cannot afford to buy houses for one reason or another, then rents will increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> There was no need to do this. Worse still, the Sinn Féin Party is proposing that it would not even be possible for people to get back their properties for the purposes of selling them with vacant possession. This means it would only be possible to recover possession of one's property if it was intended to redevelop it or spend a huge amount of money refurbishing it, in which case, under the present law, there is a requirement to offer it back to the original tenant. This also means that we are in the situation now which means that tenants, under the laws brought in by this Government I am sad to say, can bring in fellow tenants and landlords are not entitled to object to this process unless it is possible for them to show reasonable cause as to why those fellow tenants should not be regarded as tenants. The original tenants then depart the scene. What kind of results do we think this creates for most landlords? They are effectively being dispossessed of their properties and being told in rent pressure zones, RPZs, that they must continue to let the properties at way below their market value in circumstances where the alternative is to sell. The inevitable consequences is that these properties will be sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Through the Minister of State, then, I wish to tell the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to get his act together. If he wants private landlords to make properties available for letting, then he should do something to help them. The steps in this Bill do not do anything for landlords looking five or ten years ahead and wondering whether they will have a valuable asset at the end of the time. I wish to lay it down on the line that this is an opportunity missed. The remedial measures in the form of the vacant property tax will do nothing. I looked at the Bill, and for a house to be deemed vacant it must have been unused as a dwelling, by whomever, it does not matter if it is the owner or not who uses it as a dwelling, for less than 30 days in a year. This is so easily avoided. An owner's child could be asked to dwell in a house for a few weeks and the property owner then escapes this measure. The penalty provided here is that instead of local property tax the owner is obliged to pay four times the amount of the local property tax charge. This is the great incentive to get people to let their properties on the open market.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Landlords are not stupid. They are intelligent people. They have an asset. In many cases, it is probably people's only major asset and their retirement fund. These people are now seeing their assets being slowly expropriated by this Government because of deep ideological confusion. Additionally, if Sinn Féin gets anywhere near the levers of power, then these people will be completely expropriated. If we look at the figures, they are shocking. Some 5,600 landlords have left the market this year. Half the houses on the market are accounted for by landlords selling off their property. The response of this Government has been to say we will have a vacant property tax. I can imagine it might apply to some multinational American company holding on to a block of flats that was empty or something like that and in that case it might persuade the organisation to get off its backside and let its property. I can imagine that it could, possibly, have that effect, although I do have a doubt about this aspect as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> In the real world, however, in which most of us live, this measure will have no effect at all. It will be easily avoided and it is just there as a piece of propaganda being thrown out to allow the Government to say it has introduced a vacant property tax. I would love to see what the yields of this self-assessed tax will be in two years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Nobody in their right mind, if they had a vacant property, would allow it to be totally vacant for the prescribed period. It is so easy to avoid the tax. One does not even have to be the occupier. A friend or a friend's child could be asked to live in the property for a few weeks, thereby avoiding the tax completely. This is propaganda and a sticking plaster solution to a real problem. I am sorry if I am concentrating on one aspect of the Bill, as there are good aspects to it and important things are being done, which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> Our function in respect of finance Bills is pretty minimal in the Seanad. I am laying it on the line. The vacant property tax is a sick joke and is a stunt by a government that is deeply confused about the residential property market and the shortage of rentable accommodation, in particular. I ask, through the Chair, that a message be relayed to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien: get your act together and act sensibly and in the real world. This is fantasy politics. </p>

        <speech by="#PatCasey" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Senator Pat Casey<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T20:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_544">I welcome the Minister to the House. Today’s Bill is further evidence that the number one priority of the Government is to protect all the people facing an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis caused by the continuing plague of populist politics, in particular the illegal invasion of Ukraine by the Putin regime. Older people trying to heat their homes, families trying to feed their children and make ends meet and businesses trying to keep their doors open and retain jobs do not need fantasy policies that have wrecked other economies, such as the UK's. These communities need targeted funding and tax measures are needed to ensure all homes remain warm, families can cherish their children and Irish businesses can face what will be a difficult winter given the rising costs of energy, food and supply chain goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> We are seeing how the cost-of-living supports are helping to ease the pressure on families, with more than 77,500 families in County Wicklow alone benefiting from them, including the first of three €200 energy credits. We are talking about child welfare benefits, living alone benefits and the fuel allowance, double payments in autumn and another double payment coming shortly. Senator Maria Byrne identified several other measures that have targeted the most vulnerable in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> Fianna Fáil welcomes and supports the Bill, which implements the taxation changes announced on budget day and introduces some necessary administrative and technical changes to the tax code. The Bill sets out legislative provisions to introduce the tax measures announced in budget 2023. This is a cost-of-living budget that underlines the Government's commitment to assist individual families and businesses in dealing with the challenges faced by rising prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> The Bill introduces a range of targeted tax changes and includes specific measures to support families and business and to address climate change. A specific policy announced in the budget was the TBESS. The Bill provides details of the scheme, which will be available to trading and professional businesses experiencing significant increases in energy costs. As the Minister mentioned, Revenue published guidance on the scheme and opened it for registration recently. Being in business, I understand the impact the cost of energy is having on the viability of businesses. As Senator Maria Byrne said, this is probably the biggest challenge faced by businesses today. While retail is a high-energy consuming sector, hospitality is equally a high-energy consuming sector and our industry will struggle over the winter period. There is a need to look at the cap under the energy support scheme. Some larger businesses will reach the cap rather quickly, and whether they can move to the other scheme needs to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> On income tax, the Bill gives effect to budget measures to increase the standard rate band by €3,200 and personal tax credits by €75, including personal credit, employee tax credit and earned income credit. Furthermore, the home carer tax credit will increase by €100.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Landlords were mentioned earlier, so I will mention the rent tax credit. Section 12 introduces a €500 tax credit for renters, for which tax-paying tenants in particular properties are eligible in their own right.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> Senator Maria Byrne also mentioned the living city initiative, which is critical, and its extension for a further five years to 2027 must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I refer to pre-letting expenses for landlords. Section 97 provides for the limited deduction against rental income for pre-letting expenses incurred in residential premises that have been vacant for more than 12 months. This will double the allocated expenditure limited for deductible pre-letting expenses for landlords on vacant properties from €5,000 to €10,000, and it will half the period for which the property must be vacant prior to letting.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> On the subject of landlords, I refer to Senator McDowell's contribution. I honestly believe we have got the balance wrong. Landlords are a critical and integral part of the housing market and are part of the solution to the housing crisis. The vilification of landlords over recent years is wrong. Many of us had hoped the budget would bring something positive from a landlord's point of view, but it did not deliver on that. We cannot blame landlords for exiting the market when we see what they are facing. As we heard, 5,600 have left the market this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> I am concerned about where some of these homes are going. Many of them are being placed on short-term letting platforms, about which I have had a major concern since I first sat in the Lower House in 2016. I was the first person to raise the issue of short-term lettings and their impact on the housing crisis. Fáilte Ireland published a report in the first quarter of 2022, and it identified 14,000 homes on short-term letting platforms. Believe me, that is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the number of homes on short-term letting platforms. I raised this issue with the then Minister of State, Eoghan Murphy, who said it was the responsibility of the then Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport because it was a tourism product, but he got no traction with the then Minister, Shane Ross. It was disappointing to read newspaper reports that the Minister for Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media has delayed legislation on short-term letting platforms by another five months. This is emergency legislation that is needed to get people back into the rental market. I agree we got the balance is wrong and that is why landlords are exiting the market. I will, therefore, not go on to praise the vacant home tax after making such a statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> There has been an extension to the VAT rate on electricity and changes to VAT on newspapers. A nice measure in the budget was the zero-VAT rate on automated external defibrillators. Many of us met with community groups across the country that are trying to raise the funds for these defibrillators on their own. That was a nice measure included in the budget. While on the subject of VAT, I cannot pass up the opportunity to mention my sector, hospitality. The VAT rate was not extended in the hospitality industry in respect of accommodation and food. I have raised the matter of decoupling these different services on several occasions. They are completely different products and they should be looked at differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> From a Wicklow point of view, I welcome the extension of the section 481 film tax credit and the measures relating to the knowledge development box.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> As for agri-tax relief, several key measures have been extended by three years to 2025, such as the young trained farmer stamp duty relief, the farm consolidation stamp duty relief and the farm restructuring relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Facts matter. Policies and choices facing the Government must be based on facts. The Irish people deserve to know the facts. Our economic management through Covid, and now in the post-Covid world, is one of the greatest success stories in the world. Respected UN data prove time and again the massive success of the economy and the political management of our redistribution under progressive budgetary policies. A successful economy creates the tax yield that must be spent wisely and that supports society to ensure the values of our Republic are given real and practical purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, have consistently been practical politicians who avoid the showboating and negative populism of others in order to concentrate on doing the job that the Irish people wanted and elected them to do.</p>

          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_559">I will start where the last speaker left off. Facts are important as well, so I will start with some facts. Those facts, the latest homelessness figures, were announced last Friday and are the worst homelessness figures in the history of the State. Some 11,397 people are homeless, including 3,480 children. They are the highest figures ever in the history of the State. I checked the figures earlier. In 2016, when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael first came together to support each other, the homeless figures were very bad at 5,000. In the seven years since, they have more than doubled them and they keep getting worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> Average rents are up 14% in a year to €1,688 per month. House prices and rents have reached historic highs and are still rising. Some students, and Members will all know this, have had to give up college courses because they cannot find accommodation. We have children sleeping not only in hostels, but in cars and tents. Of course, we have the spectre of emigration back. </p>
          <p eId="para_561"> I was chatting to colleagues from University Hospital Limerick this evening and they told me directly, first-hand how nurses are voting with their feet now. They are leaving University Hospital Limerick - some to take jobs in factories. Senior nurses are leaving to take jobs in factories. Others are leaving the country because they simply cannot afford to live due to the price of accommodation. We have a maternity ward in Limerick that has been closed since the summer because they cannot staff it with the people they need. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has called on the Government to provide accommodation supports to enable nurses to stay in their jobs and be recruited. That is an issue that was not responded to in this budget. </p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I want to quote Pat Dennigan from Focus Ireland. After those horrendous figures on Friday, he said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_563">In the face of these shameful figures, it is important to remind ourselves that homelessness is not inevitable. It is not a natural phenomenon, it is the result of bad policies and can be ended, over time, with better policies delivered with urgency. ... the failure of successive governments has led to a crisis where nearly 3,500 children will spend Christmas in emergency accommodation. </p>
          <p eId="para_564">That is the view of the head of Focus Ireland, who is someone I hope the Minister of State would respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> I was at the housing protest in Dublin along with thousands of other people on Saturday. I was very struck by what Phil Ni Sheaghda of the INMO said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_566">We know that rents in this city and in other parts of our country have now gone beyond the salaries of many reasonably [priced] workers ... nurses, midwives, teachers, guards and all other professionals that are very necessary to keep our society going, who now are paying over 50% of their wages [in] rent. That’s simply not affordable [and] they will not stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">That is what the head of the nurses’ organisation in this country said. The depth of this crisis is absolutely horrendous. To be absolutely clear, I am dealing with facts here. The Government failed horrendously on housing and, unbelievably, it gets worse month after month. </p>
          <p eId="para_568"> While I will not agree with most of what Senator McDowell said, he is right, as is Senator Casey, about the vacant homes tax. It is absolutely hopeless. Indeed, colleagues from Fine Gael have said to me off the record they can see it will not do anything to change the situation. There was an opportunity to do something in relation to the vacant homes, but the Minister of State did not do it. It is another failed opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> I want to talk about the cost of living. I do not know whether the Minister of State listened to “Morning Ireland” this morning and heard the report on Mid West Simon in Limerick, where the food banks are now facing unprecedented demand. Some 7,000 people are now dependent on food banks, including 2,000 children. That is not Sinn Féin propaganda; those are the facts as presented by RTÉ this morning. They interviewed a worker from Mid West Simon who explained how one woman, with tears in her eyes, approached the door of Mid West Simon to ask whether she could get a bag of porridge. That worker then asked whether we have really come to this in this day in age, that people are so desperate for even basic necessities. I refer to the 7,000 people across Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare, including 2,000 children. It is not a natural phenomenon; it is the result of failed policies. Let us be very clear on that. It is very clear that this budget does not deliver enough in relation to the cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Equally, I want to recognise the fact that in terms of the challenges being faced by small and medium enterprises, again, this budget does not deliver. SMEs are the backbone of our community and local economies. The Government must continue to look at more measures to support them at this difficult time. In Limerick, where I live, a number of businesses have already closed or announced they will close soon. Next month, we will be losing Miss Marples Tea Room after 11 years, La Fromagerie cheese shop closed last week and Bakehouse 22 closed last month after 27 years in business. It is sad and I wish all of the owners of those businesses well. I know that every one of them had a very heavy heart having to make that decision to close their doors. We are acutely aware of the challenges that SMEs are facing right now, particularly the impact of rising energy costs. We proposed solutions, such as the business energy support scheme, and in our alternative budget call for the creation of a new credit guarantee scheme led by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and backed by the State to help energy-intensive sectors, especially SMEs, microbusinesses and family businesses that are facing the brunt of these increased costs. If the Minister of State does not take further action on that particular issue, we will see a horrendous level of closures in the new year. Again, while the Government has taken some measures, it has not done enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> I want to take the Minister of State up on that tax issue briefly. He said in his speech that his focus is on low and medium taxpayers. However, here is the thing. In section 9, the changes made to income tax will mean that someone with an income with €35,000 will benefit by €191 from changes to income tax and the USC, while someone with an income of €100,000 will benefit by €831. How on earth does that benefit low and medium taxpayers? It clearly benefits the well-off much more than that. We proposed a series of tax cuts that focused on low-income and middle-income workers, in reality, but again the Government rejected that. </p>
          <p eId="para_572"> While we are on the topic of tax, once again – the Minister of State might address it this time, because in the past he has ignored the issue – I refer to the special assignee relief programme, which is absolutely scandalous. This is a tax break to reward millionaire bosses across the State. It allows them to write off up to two thirds of their income tax because they happen to be in positions of power in multinational companies. It costs €42 million. At a time when that woman is reaching and begging for a bag of porridge and people are facing unprecedented poverty, how in God’s name can the Minister of State justify this outrageous subsidy to the richest millionaires in this State? It is absolutely outrageous. I will tell you what it shows. We were talking about class politics in this Chamber. I will note that there is not one whit of difference between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They are as one at this point in time, and that speaks volumes.</p>

          <p eId="para_573">I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, which is a continuation of the supports that we provided during Covid. In the round, this budget has been accepted positively by the public. We are showing that we are as committed to helping families, businesses and people through this crisis like we did the last. In addition, it shows that we are responding to poverty and the needs of families and businesses under pressure. I am reminded of the Tesco jingle “every little helps”, because the power of the statement was that one when adds up all of the savings that people get, it means a sizable chunk coming off the bills coming into people’s home and more supports to deal with them across child care, transport and college fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Of course, there is also investment in the Garda and in education. We are seeing all that through income tax measures and positive initiatives such as rental tax credits.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> I will focus on the TBESS because the feedback I am getting from businesses is that we are in tune with how much pressure they are under. The fact that businesses experiencing a 50% increase in their energy bills can claim 40% relief, up to a maximum of €10,000, is a great help. I ask that we show some stability. This scheme should be extended beyond February because of the energy crisis and the insecurity around that.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I will also mention the hot meals scheme, which I know is not exactly the Minister of State's area. That scheme has been expanded to include childcare providers. I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Department that it should also be expanded to special schools. We have 140 special schools in the country. They should also have access to that scheme. </p>

          <p eId="para_578">I thank the Chair. I welcome the publication of the Bill and its passage through the Houses. It is a significant statement of intent by the Government. I welcome the boost it will give to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_579"> It is significant legislation. It is nearly 250 pages long and, with legislation of this nature, there are always anomalies within it that the Minister of State might look at. I will reference two of them. One is the issue of the VAT rate pertaining to publications. It is a significant development that a 0% VAT rate on publications will be introduced from 1 January. The Minister of State might clarify why magazines and periodicals are not included in that. The marketplace is becoming unfair when we compare a magazine in west Cork, for example, Bandon's <i>The Opinion</i>, which comes out every month and does the exact same as other publications, with a weekly newspaper such as the <i>Southern Star</i>. One has a 0% VAT rate and one does not. The Minister of State might clarify how that is workable, even on competition lines. It is a serious issue. We have done a good job in bringing the VAT rate down to 0% but we can do more on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_580"> The Bill is a significant document so there will always be anomalies. There is another anomaly regarding excise, in particular, on cider. An excise relief has been brought forward for specially branded cider. However, other fermented products, for example, Kinsale Mead, which produces a unique product, does not qualify for that excise relief because it does not produce a cider-based product. The Minister of State might look at this other anomaly in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> There are a few anomalies in the legislation that are important for the Minister of State to consider. I ask him to revert to me, if he can.</p>

          <p eId="para_586"> This is a cost-of-living Bill because this Government, and all parties in it, realise the challenges that face people, families, communities and businesses. At each and every step, the Department of Social Protection and its Minister, Deputy Humphreys, have delivered packages that target every member of the community. We look at people aged over 70 and the challenges around fuel allowance and the lump sums for carers. We are looking at what is being delivered through the Department of Education, when it comes to delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, funding for our schools. One in four schools now get DEIS funding through the Department. The school meals programme, again, under the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is delivering meals for children in schools throughout Ireland. This party is looking after people who are in need and the Government has put a budget in place to do exactly that.</p>
          <p eId="para_587"> I am proud that this budget will meet the needs of families in Ireland today through the electricity credit, the rental credit and the energy support scheme that will benefit businesses. Those businesses will have registered for that scheme by this coming Saturday. They are putting in their claims this week and it is to be hoped, and we aim and target, that they will get their payments by the end of December. The Government is yet again acting in the face of a crisis. The Government has brought forward these policies.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">This is a cost-of-living budget. We have to consider within it that it is also a reaction to all that is going on in Ukraine, including the deliberate use of economics as a weapon of warfare and a weapon of murderous intent.</p>
          <p eId="para_595"> Among the tangible differences for families as a consequence of this budget, for example, in my constituency of Dublin South-Central, a working single parent earning €21,000 will have €3,413 more in his or her pocket in 2023. How will that person have that? His or her wage will have been increased by a minimum of €1,600 as a consequence of the changes to the tax credits, which will be up by €150, the USC band that will be increased by €41, and the electricity credit that we will have had throughout the winter will assist that person's family and home. If that family are renting, their rental tax credit will be €1,000 and if they are relying on public transport, there will be supports in the order of 20%. They will have free GP care. There is significant support for that single person who is working and renting.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> For a family with two people working who are a married couple, with one child in secondary school and maybe another in college, the amount in their pockets will increase by €4,246 in 2023. Their tax bands and credits will increase by nearly €1,000, their USC band will increase, and their student contribution support for 2022 has gone up by €1,000 and will go up by €1,500 in 2023. They will have an extra month's child benefit, their electricity credit, and their public transport assistance which, for a student, is not 20% but 50%. Their medicine costs are maxed at €80 per month. Cuts in excise and ensuring we only have a 9% VAT rate on our utility bills is a significant contribution to that family as they face into 2023. If 2023 holds even worse news than 2022 regarding the challenges arising out of Ukraine, the aftermath of the Covid pandemic and challenges in the supply chain, there is money in the bank-----</p>

          <p eId="para_602">The Minister of State is welcome. I said previously that everything we did in this budget, we did because it needed to be done and we were in a position to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">We were in a such a position because of the way the finances were thanks to the stewardship of the economy, the strong rebounding from Covid and the supports put in place when we were in a position to do so. There was the impact of ensuring the link between employees and employers was maintained, ensuring employers were able to keep going through Covid and maintaining the level of near full employment we have, as well as the strong showing of our corporations. All of that is important to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> We are a long way from the budgets when this Government first came to power and what we had to deal with. The finance Bills on those occasions were not as pleasant as this one, other recent finance Bills and, I hope, those finance Bills to come. There are a number of very positive initiatives. One such initiative is the changes to the personal tax bands to ensure we keep pace with wage growth. If we stood still and did not change the thresholds and bands, everybody would eventually end up paying the higher rate of tax, and that makes no sense. It is important and welcome to increase the threshold for the higher rate to €40,000. It will benefit so many people, especially those in the squeezed middle. There was a debate on proposals to introduce a 30% rate and the Minister referenced them in his budget speech. There is probably work being done in the Department on the possibility of that for next year. Perhaps the Minister of State will give us an update on that as well. It is an issue that has gained some popularity because it is deemed to be the right thing to do to ensure people have more of their take-home pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> On some of the other changes, the extension of the help-to-buy scheme has been very much welcomed. It has been so important in allowing people get onto the property ladder. I welcome also some of the other initiatives that have taken place over the last number of months, including the Croí Cónaithe towns scheme and its extension to rural areas, which is hugely important.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> The changes to the income tax bands will increase people's take-home pay, as will the changes to the USC. It is important that when the minimum wage increases, we keep pace with the thresholds for USC. It ensures the 2% rate of USC is the highest rate a person on the minimum wage must pay. This is the ninth increase in the minimum wage since Fine Gael came into government and that is to be acknowledged as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The €500 rental tax credit, which will go to 400,000 people in 2022 and 2023, is another important initiative, as is the extension of the rebate on petrol and diesel. The latter is something people may not see because it is taken off the price they pay but it is hugely important. They would see it if it had not been reduced but it is obviously a cost and must be acknowledged as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> The doubling of the expenditure limit for deductible pre-letting expenses for landlords of vacant properties is also of benefit because, unfortunately, we have seen landlords exiting the market. Incentives are needed to ensure we maintain the majority of landlords currently letting. Most of them are accidental landlords with one or two properties. They are the foundation stone of the rental sector and supports are needed to ensure there is not a wholesale exodus of landlords from the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I welcome also the extension of the living city initiative until 31 December 2027. It is a popular and positive initiative. I again thank the Minister of State for attending the House.</p>

I fully subscribe to the fact that the Government has put forward the highest spend on housing in a budget in the history of the State. I think 150,000 houses were built last year. I will come back to that figure in a minute, but there is a challenge. The reality is that we must ensure people are supported. If we want to have a comparative analysis of the budget proposals of the Government and the main Opposition party, we need only look across the way. Senator Gavan said there is nothing between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, but there is nothing between Sinn Féin and Liz Truss and the Tories in the UK. Nothing. The proposals are the same there and here.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I know the Senator would say that because, in fairness, that is what he is going to say. It is the single transferable speech that he and his colleagues are given. This Finance Bill is about putting money back into people's pockets with a fairer income tax package for everybody. That is the fundamental point.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> On Committee Stage, we will look at different sections of the Bill. I wish to raise a few points on the hospitality sector in the time available to me. Today the Cork branch of the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, together with the federation itself, presented to many of us a document on supporting tourism jobs and the uncertainty in the future of the hotels sector. I am not a member of the IHF, nor do I fly a flag for it, but it is a hard-pressed industry that is important to the fabric of the city I come from. It is important in creating and providing employment and in helping the economic outlook of the city. We must look at this in the context not just of the 9% VAT rate but of the escalating business costs for the hospitality sector. During our debate on the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill earlier, I made the point about costs going up with respect to energy, food suppliers, beverages, laundry and insurance. We are facing into an economic headwind. Our domestic tourism product is facing challenging forward-looking booking numbers. I say that in the context of the review of national aviation policy that is being undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> I welcome the opportunity to debate this important Bill and I hope that, in time, we will be able to examine its various sections. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#EugeneMurphy" eId="spk_235" as="#Acting_Chairperson">
          <from>Senator Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_632">I will only speak for two and a half minutes because, at this point in such debates, there tends to be a great deal of repetition.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> I support and commend the budget. In excess of 2 million people, or 64% of all taxpayers, will benefit from the income tax changes. Many welfare supports and extra payments have also been given to people. We all know what they are. This is year 3 of the most extraordinary situation that any Government has had to face. We had two years of Covid, during which most would agree the Government did an excellent job in ensuring there was money in people's pockets, our economy remained steady and people in employment were protected. We then moved into the war in Ukraine. No matter what anyone says, that war is having a terrible effect on Europe, including our economies. Despite the challenges we face, the experts say that the economy is sound and, albeit with a note of caution, will more than likely not go into recession. I hope that we will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> Most people I meet acknowledge that this budget has been good and has looked after those who need to be looked after. Perhaps we could sometimes do more for low-to-middle-income earners. Energy costs are one matter, but the cost of having to travel long distances to work is serious. I know many people in the west who still have to come to Dublin daily. Paying for diesel and petrol remains an extraordinary cost for them and does not leave them with much income at the end of the week if they are not receiving expenses from their employers. I am mainly referring to private sector workers, but this also affects public sector workers. If they are travelling long distances to work in their own vehicles, it costs them a great deal of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> I do not disagree with everything Senator Gavan said, but none of us is happy with the housing situation. The Minister is doing a lot, but no one has an overnight solution to the housing crisis. I watched a documentary on Sky News the other night in which I saw the appalling circumstances that many people in Britain were experiencing. Thousands upon thousands of them are losing their homes with nowhere to go. I do not like comparing us to anyone else because everyone in this Chamber would say that we should be doing better than everyone else, and I do not disagree totally with Senator McDowell about landlords, the vacant property tax and so on – there was a certain amount of truth in what he said – but I am satisfied that the Government will do everything in its power to sort this matter out. None of us wants to see homeless children and people out of their houses, particularly at this time of year. It is my wish and that of everyone else that we act as quickly as possible, but no matter who comes into power, they will not be able to solve this matter overnight.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I believe it was Senator Casey who referred to the 9% VAT rate for the hospitality sector. I hope that the Government will retain it. The sector is facing major challenges, and we need to acknowledge that, particularly through the VAT rate. I remind the House of what our hotels and restaurants do for our student population. Thousands upon thousands of students rely for their college money on hotels and restaurants in the main. This is an important point to take into account, as hotels and restaurants provide a great deal of employment in this regard. I saw that in my own family when my children were going to college. One is still going to college.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Given the times we are in, this is a good budget. I acknowledge that there are problems and that not everyone will be satisfied, but the Government has done a good job in general.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanFleming" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Sean Fleming)<recordedTime time="2022-11-29T20:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_638">I thank the large number of Senators who contributed on this debate. I will touch on as many of their points as I can in the short time available to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Senator Maria Byrne and a number of others mentioned general cost-of-living measures that were not specifically budgetary or Finance Bill matters but were part of the package announced on budget day and, therefore, it was reasonable that they were mentioned in this debate. They might be connected to social protection legislation, but they were part of the overall budget package.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Questions were raised about how long this package would last. The Government has made it clear that this budget will take us to the spring, at which point we will need to see what the situation is. There is no commitment to introduce new measures. Rather, there is a commitment to review the situation in the spring and see what needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> We in Ireland are fortunate and every cent of the €11 billion in budgetary measures is being paid out of current resources. Not a single euro of it has been borrowed. We will still see a surplus. According to figures from last month and this month, the surplus for this year so far is €7 billion. Much of that is being held aside for a rainy day fund should the need arise in future. It is important that we are in a position to do so without needing a recourse to borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> The issue of energy companies' super profits is being addressed. We want to work on it at European level. The ESB is a fully State-owned company that can pay a dividend to the Government. When the need arises, the Government can request and receive an additional dividend from it without having to go through a legislative process.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> Senator Maria Byrne mentioned the living city initiative, which must be close to her heart in Limerick city. The former Minister, Mr. Michael Noonan, introduced the scheme on a pilot basis in Limerick. I am pleased to hear that it is still going and that more work remains to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> I was asked whether shops could increase the price of tobacco as a disincentive to smoking. I am informed that, under the tobacco products tax directive, importers and manufacturers of cigarettes are free to determine their maximum retail selling price. It is up to the manufacturers and importers to set the price, not the retailer. As such, a retailer has no extra flexibility in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> The vacant home tax was mentioned. I listened carefully to what was said. This is a new tax and the Government has to consider every possible option for dealing with the situation. We must see how the tax operates. The Revenue Commissioners will be able to give a clear position on the matter within a reasonable time. If changes are necessary because the tax is not proving effective, they can be considered. This tax is just one element of an overall package dealing with this situation. If it is looked at in isolation, all the points that have been raised are valid, but it needs to be looked at in conjunction with the other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> Many Members share the concerns raised about landlords selling their properties and the balance that is required between their rights and the rights of tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> Agri-relief was mentioned. The extension of the five agri-tax reliefs referred to by Senator Casey will be for six months and take them up to the end of June 2023, as the position has not been fully clarified with the European Commission. When the situation has been resolved, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has announced that the intention is to provide for the extensions listed by the Senator. Some discussions have to happen at EU level, which is a regular feature of finance legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> The TBESS was raised by a number of Senators. It is to run until the end of February, but there is provision in the legislation that gives the Minister the flexibility to extend it by ministerial order to the end of April. Through ministerial order, there is also the flexibility to amend the legislation's cap of €10,000 to €30,000. As such, there is flexibility by way of secondary legislation to address some of the points raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> The issue of short-term letting platforms and Fáilte Ireland's role in that regard was mentioned. In the short time I have been a Minister of State, I have seen that the only way to get things done at Government level is usually to take a whole-of-government approach. A job does not get done if Departments do their own thing and say that something is a matter for another Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The job does not get done that way. It is only if the Cabinet sets up a subgroup, chaired by a senior Government figure, the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, and brings together the three or four relevant Ministers that three or four Departments work cohesively. For that to happen, somebody at a senior level is required to chair a particular group. I take the point but my suggestion is it can work only if the relevant Ministers are sitting around one table about that one particular issue. I appreciate the comments that were made in respect of the zero VAT rate for defibrillators.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> The special assignee relief programme was mentioned and the most important thing relevant to this Finance Bill is that we are introducing restrictions. There was no mention of that whatsoever. We all know we are competing to get senior people to come to Ireland to manage multinational companies. The more senior people from those multinational organisations living and based in Ireland, and committed to staying, the better chance we have of holding onto those jobs if there is a global downturn. It is important for very senior people to be here and not in other countries with lower level staff here. It is important to have those senior people here and that is a priority. It is in the long-term interests of the 250,000 people who are employed in those sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> This legislation increases the threshold for eligibility for the scheme from €75,000 to €100,000. That is a 33% increase in the threshold. I want to put that on the record because it was not mentioned during the discussion of that particular issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> I will take on board all the points that have been made and bring them back to the Minister. The issue of VAT on periodicals was raised. EU VAT legislation deals specifically with newspapers. I have taken careful note of the other points that have been raised. When we come back for further discussion at the next Stage, we will be able to respond further.</p>
