            <p eId="para_12">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. A new primary care centre is being built on the grounds of the old orthopaedic hospital in Cork. I recently visited the site and construction is probably 98% complete. My understanding is that ten GPs practising in the area will move to the centre. I seek clarification on the timeline regarding the opening of the facility. When will it be up and running? When will the GPs move in? What other services will be provided in the centre? A minor injuries unit adjoins the centre and that caters for a large number of people with minor injuries to their hands, ankles and so on who then do not have to attend emergency departments. The primary care centre will be a great addition. Will physiotherapy and X-ray and other scanning services be provided in the centre?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_13">I thank the Senator for raising this issue, and I am happy to advise him that the new primary care centre in Gurranabraher, which is located on the grounds of St. Mary's health campus, was handed over to the HSE during Easter weekend this year. The HSE is currently preparing the facility to receive patients and is overseeing the fit-out of the equipment and systems such as information and communication technologies necessary to support the delivery of clinical services. I am sure the Senator will appreciate that this is a sizeable task given that this landmark centre is one of the largest in the country at more than 6,200 sq. m. That equates to approximately two thirds the size of Cork University Maternity Hospital and, therefore, it is inevitable that the equipping of such a significant building will take some time. Once the fit-out is complete, the Cork Kerry Community Healthcare Organisation will arrange for services to relocate on a phased basis. I understand that the expectation is that this will occur towards the end of the summer.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> The centre will allow for the transfer of HSE services and staff spread across different locations into one state-of-the-art building that is designed to meet the needs of a modern health service. The centre will provide accommodation for four GP practices and five primary care teams to work together to meet the health needs of up to 40,000 people in the locality. It will be home to services such as public health and community nursing, home support, speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, including paediatric therapies. Other services will include ophthalmology, a warfarin clinic, an antenatal clinic and dietician serves. One particularly noteworthy aspect of this project is that it will provide accommodation for University College Cork, UCC, dental school to deliver planned undergraduate clinical training and dental services. This is an interesting development as it represents the first time that UCC will have a presence on the northside of Cork city.</p>
            <p eId="para_15"> This centre will, when fully operational, significantly enhance and expand healthcare provision for local residents, and it serves as an excellent example of the Government’s ongoing commitment to developing primary care services. There are 114 primary care centres in operation throughout the country and the Government has set aside resources for the further development of such centres and other community-based facilities under the national development plan. The case for the development of a more integrated, proactive and community-based care model is broadly accepted and forms a key part of the Slåintecare reform process. Primary care centres can facilitate such a model by offering a range of multi-disciplinary services that can provide "better care, closer to home" and, therefore, play a role in reducing the demand for hospital care.</p>
            <p eId="para_16"> The opening of the new centre in Gurranabraher will make the theory of primary care a reality for local people who will benefit from being able to access the vast majority of the healthcare services they need in one building in their community.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">I thank the Minister for State for his very detailed reply. I know it will take place on a phased basis but I wonder when the GP practices are expected to start functioning from there? When will they be able to move in? Is there a planned timescale for each section to do so? Will everything be in place by the end of the year? As the Minister of State outlined, it is a huge centre that has been built within the timescale set out in the contract but what I am concerned about is when it will be occupied. I am concerned about ensuring that it will be occupied in a timely manner.</p>

I do not have the detail of who will come first, be it the GPs or the therapists, but I can ask the HSE to come back to the Senator with further detail if it has any regarding what is due to happen. Occupation will commence towards the end of summer.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">I thank the Minister of State for attending. I am raising the issue of access to St. Michael's House in Dublin 9 for day service users. These people are having difficulty accessing transport. The Department is well aware of this issue. In a presentation made to me last week, however, I was told that it had 788 adult service users who are transported to day services every day, of whom 200 are supported by St. Michael's House drivers and escorts, 120 are transported by Vantastic, 96 are transported by residential house staff and bus, 41 are transported by day service staff and bus, 35 are transported by contract taxis, 38 are transported by family members - with 18 such arrangements being unsustainable - and 258 are transported by public transport, some with support. A total of 435 of these individuals live with residential supports from St. Michael's House. The Minister of State will appreciate that these are very vulnerable users of the service for whom transport is essential. If they do not have transport, the service will not be accessible to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> I will outline some of their concerns and some of the deficiencies relating to the service. A total of eight service users who live at home cannot access the service because they have no transport. This is a serious situation for these eight individuals. A total of 38 individuals are being transported by family members and, as already stated, 18 of these arrangements are not sustainable. An issue of equity arises here. St. Michael's House also supports an ageing group of people with increasingly complex needs. The average age of primary care givers there is also increasing. Twenty individuals supported in St. Michael's House residential services are on a waiting list for transport, which impacts on residential service staff. A total of 325.5 staff hours could be released from the roster if an effective transport service was delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> The issue of transport to and from St. Michael's House to allow individuals to access its services has been ongoing for quite a number of years. There is no cheap solution and providing transport is expensive. What is even more expensive, however, is the compounded vulnerability, isolation, loneliness and sense of despair experienced by the families who need these services for their loved ones. The sense of isolation because of a lack of transport is quite acute. While I know the Minister of State and his Department will be looking at both the cost and the bottom line, I contend that the cost of not taking action will be quite profound.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> I want to be constructive. I know there are no easy solutions that the Minister of State can offer today but I would ask that he and other Ministers, who I know have been in contact with and have met representatives from St. Michael's House, can try to find an equitable and sustainable solution. A number of people clearly need this service and cannot access it because of the lack of transport to which I refer. The families of the eight individuals I mentioned will be impacted upon as well because of the range of challenges their loved ones face. I plead with the Minister of State to look at the situation and provide transport for these individuals. They are very vulnerable and need the service and to be able to access it. Without transport, they will continue to be isolated. We are in a much better financial position than previously and we have the resources to do things we were unable to do in the past. I ask the Minister of State and the Department to prioritise this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I thank the Senator for raising the issue of transport for people with disabilities attending HSE-funded day services, particularly St. Michael’s House. I welcome the opportunity to outline the current position in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> The HSE funds St. Michael's House to provide healthcare services on its behalf to those with intellectual disabilities. St. Michael's House provides a range of community-based day, respite, residential and early services for people with intellectual disabilities. The services provided by the organisation cover all ages from young children to older persons. Clinical support services include psychiatry, medical, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, social work, psychology and nutrition services. Services are located both on the north side and south side of Dublin and in 2007, the service extended to provide residential care for children in Navan, County Meath. St. Michael's House provides these services on behalf of the HSE to clients based on individual assessed clinical need and healthcare is provided in the most appropriate setting to meet the client’s individual needs. The HSE is providing €87.8 million in funding to St. Michael's House in 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> In general, the provision of transport services is not part of core services within disability services. As a general rule, public transport should be used in all circumstances where it is an option. This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming, with a clear focus on ensuring that persons with disabilities have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible. It must be noted that in general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the free travel pass so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. The HSE intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the authority's services could assist people with disabilities. The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities. St. Michael's House is aware of the transport issues affecting a number of its service users. However, funding is not provided for the transportation of young people to and from day services. When all other options are exhausted and a person cannot avail of a day service because he or she does not have transport to attend, the service provider is advised to use some of the service money to cover the transport costs. This usually results in the provision of a reduced quantum of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> In regard to developments to meet the day service needs of school leavers each year, all new service locations under development are located as close as possible to where people reside in order to reduce the travel time for each person and enable him or her to be more connected with his or her local community. I trust that this clarifies the position.</p>

            <p eId="para_27">With the greatest respect, it does not really do much, particularly for the eight service users who are at home and cannot access the service because they have no transport or the 18 individuals who are transported by family members, something which St. Michael's House has indicated is not sustainable. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the answer he has provided, particularly in the context of these service users, who are isolated and who cannot use the service. I understand the constraints the Minister of State is under when he comes to the House with a script but we have a service for vulnerable people, a number of whom are at home and cannot access it because of lack of transport. The Minister of State's answer does not really give me, St. Michael's House or the families of these eight people and the 18 individuals whose current transport arrangements are made by family members and are unsustainable any comfort. Can the Department not meet representatives from St. Michael's House and find sustainable transport solutions for those 26 individuals?</p>

            <p eId="para_28">I accept the Senator's frustration and the fact that there is nothing concrete in my reply to give him or the people in St. Michael's House any solace. With regard to the specific request made by the Senator, which was for funding for transport for people availing of day services, this is an issue not just for St. Michael's House but for a number of different centres where transport is an issue and is not funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">When it goes back to the service provider to fund it, we can reduce the overall quantum of services available, which proves to be a difficulty. It is an issue we will have to address in the collective. I will convey the Senator's request to my officials and the HSE to re-examine the case of St. Michael's House. However, it is a wider issue and we will have to examine it nationwide.</p>

            <p eId="para_31">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I would like him to make a statement on the 6,000 children currently waiting for professional psychological services. He will be aware from his engagement with my colleague, Senator Freeman, of the demands on child and adult mental health services, CAMHS. I pay tribute to RTÉ for the recent "RTÉ Investigates" programme that was broadcast on this issue. It is a harrowing story. I met a woman in Dún Laoghaire by appointment last week who introduced me to her three children. She is having social housing difficulties. When she presented to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to discuss her housing application, she was told that she needed a professional psychologist's report. Most local authorities do not take GP letters into consideration. They require a letter from someone in the psychology field. While that costs money, more important, people have to wait. Politicians put their own hands in their pocket to pay for these reports because they are decent people and they want to assist their constituents to access professional psychological services in order that they can initially bring a report to the housing authority when they need help.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The "RTÉ Investigates" programme outlined many stories of families becoming desperate as they sought intervention, including assessments, for their loved ones. I have spoken to teachers who experience great difficulties with children. They have to call parents to come to the school to collect them. These parents need support. I constantly read about cases of juveniles involved in serious crime, including attempted murder, who did not get the resources and support they needed for many years. I do not doubt the Minister of State's commitment but if there is not early intervention for vulnerable children, what does the future hold for them and their families and our society?</p>
            <p eId="para_33"> I like to think that there will be a time every child will have a health and psychological assessment at least twice during the junior cycle. That happens in Canada and parts of the US. Children are assessed, not for benchmarking purposes, but to identify weaknesses, needs and supports and to put them in place. Will the Minister of State outline what is the plan going forward? It will be slow but something needs to be done. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation conference begins in Cork this afternoon. I spoke to an official earlier who mentioned patient trolley counts and said they should be published more regularly. The organisation is suggesting the number of children awaiting psychological services should be published on a monthly basis to hit the Government hard with facts about what is happening and that a formal count system should be put in place for social workers and children in care for whom a care plan is meant to be in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_34"> Clearly, the priority should be vulnerable children. The fact that 6,000 are waiting for services means we are at crisis point and something needs to be done about it. What is the Government's plan to address this significant issue?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Deputy Jim Daly<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_35">I thank the Senator for raising the issue of counselling for children in primary care. Psychology services in primary care settings can play a key role in promoting good mental health. There are high rates of mental health problems among young people, and the research shows adolescence and early adulthood is the peak time for the onset of such issues. One in five young people have been found to have a diagnosable mental disorder at any one time. Given the scale of this challenge, it is essential that adolescents and young people with mild to moderate mental health needs should be able to access services in their local communities in a timely manner. Those with more severe mental health difficulties will require referral to secondary care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_36"> To address the current waiting lists for psychology services in primary care settings, additional Government funding of €5 million has been made available for the recruitment of 20 staff grade psychologists and 114 assistant psychologists. I understand that the vast majority of these posts were filled during the first quarter of this year, and there should be progress in more young patients being seen, and being seen more quickly.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> It is also important to acknowledge the progress that has been made, and there has been a reduction in the numbers of children waiting for access to counselling services in primary care since July 2017, although I agree that much more needs to be done. As well as additional investment, the HSE is also examining the scope for improved ways of working through a service improvement initiative for counselling in primary care. These new ways of working include: standardised psychology protocols; a single point of contact for all non-crisis and non-complex emotional and behavioural referrals; and assistance for service users in stepping "up to" and "down from" more specialist health services. Other options to tackle waiting lists are also being pursued, including a computerised cognitive behavioural therapy programme. This programme utilises new technologies, delivering supports through weekly sessions based around a computer, with a healthcare professional as support.</p>
            <p eId="para_38"> Such developments build upon the investment in mental health services over recent years. I am sure the Senator and others Members will join me in welcoming the fact that funding made available for suicide prevention has more than tripled from €3.7 million in 2010 to €12 million this year, while the overall mental health budget has increased by €200 million since 2012 to more than €900 million today.</p>
            <p eId="para_39"> The Government acknowledges that waiting lists for counselling services for children in primary care are too high. That is why additional funding has been provided for psychology and assistant psychology posts, and the number of children waiting for services should now reduce further as these posts start to make an impact on access times for services. This investment and the service improvements I have outlined will facilitate further advancements within primary care and help improve and enhance the lives of young people who suffer mental illness and that of their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_40"> I particularly welcome the Senator's approach. The focus has always been on the upper end of services, which is CAMHS. We can keep chasing the queues for these services and focus all our attention, resources and reactive remedies on them or we can examine what is causing this to happen and provide solutions. We can treat the symptoms or treat the cause. I very much believe in treating the cause and that is what the Senator is suggesting. We need to intercept these issues at an earlier stage and we need to be more proactive in our screening, which the Senator is seeking. We need to pick up the issues at a lower level of intervention in order that when people are treated, their care is not escalated to CAMHS. Much of the debate in the media and political circles is about treating people at that level. Some people need to be treated by consultant psychiatrists but many young people who seek access to mental health services do not need to see a consultant. It is only in recent weeks that we have completed the recruitment of 20 staff grade psychologists and 114 assistant psychologists into the system at primary care level specifically to treat teenagers and other young people and to pick up their issues at a lower level of intervention, as advised by the Senator, thus preventing them from being escalated to CAMHS and a consultant psychiatrist. We are making significant progress. Additional Jigsaw sites have been announced and we are trying to beef up the supports that it and many other service providers are offering, which is very significant and helpful in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I am mindful, given all the ongoing health-related controversies, that the Government will be judged on three issues - health, housing and education. Anyone who is on the ground will be aware of this. I met a woman the other day who said the political universe is meant to revolve around Leinster House. She asked what we were all doing in here and why it is always the HSE or some other body that is held responsible for issues. I replied that she had a point. We are the policymakers.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> This issue revolves around early intervention and picking up on vulnerable children in school. Teachers in Montessori and primary schools can identify vulnerable children and behavioural issues that will lead to further problems for 90% of the children. The Minister of State is fully committed in this regard. I downloaded two speeches the Taoiseach made while doing some research for this debate. He said he was extremely disappointed but he leads the Government and the Minister of State is one of his appointees.</p>
            <p eId="para_43"> This is an important issue and targets should be set. Perhaps when I raise this again in three or four months, targets will be set in respect of how the Government is delivering on professional psychological services. This important, critical issue relates to the future health and well-being of our people and our country.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">We need to keep an eye on the issue and see progress made. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and I thank him for his comprehensive response.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">We can talk all day about figures and statistics, but much of that can hide the realities of real people who are struggling, looking for these services. The mental health budget has increased by €200 million up to €930 million in the past five years. I do not know of any other country that has increased its mental health budget by such a percentage over that time. That is not enough. It is easy for me is to secure additional funding and throw money at it. How we do what we do is much more important to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> I am really focused on championing what the Senator has mentioned, which is redoubling our efforts down to the base of the pyramid to be more proactive and intuitive there. I want to roll out the STEPS-A programme in schools. That is a programme coming in from America related to the DBT programme which gives young people the ability to recognise feelings, articulate those feelings and deal with those feelings at a much younger age before they escalate to an acute stage. Too much of our approach to date has been reactive where we have been chasing the extremities and the acute side of mental illness. We need more action focused on the lower levels. I genuinely welcome the Senator's approach and the opportunity to outline some of the steps the Government is taking on that front.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">I tabled this Commencement matter because I am asking for more investment in job creation in north and east Mayo. I want to ensure the State agencies responsible for job creation and investment, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and to a lesser extent the local enterprise office, are doing their job in this particular area. My focus is on this area as opposed to Mayo as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_48"> The last census showed a decline in population in the area. We have an older population and younger people have left, mainly to get work. In many cases they are highly educated young people. However, after getting third level qualifications they cannot find appropriate jobs in north and east Mayo. The region is highly dependent on the agrifood and tourism sectors. As we all know, these sectors will be particularly adversely impacted by Brexit. I ask the Minister of State to set out the plans to ramp up investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> In November 2015 the Action Plan for Jobs west was launched with targets, some of which went up to 2019. It placed obligations on IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices to deliver. I ask the Minister of State to outline, based on his scorecard, how they have been delivering for north and east Mayo. How many visits have IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland organised for this area? What have they been doing? What are their successes? What is in the pipeline? What is planned?</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> The region has much to offer. We have a tradition of med-tech companies. Hollister must have been there for 40 years and it employs nearly 830 people. Coca-Cola and Baxter are located in the region. I have listed out some of the selling points that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland should highlight to potential investors. A high-speed transatlantic fibre optic cable makes landfall at the Asahi site at Killala with planning permission for a data centre beside it. There is also planning permission for a renewable energy electricity plant beside it.</p>
            <p eId="para_51"> Up the road in Ballina, for about 15 years IDA Ireland has had a designated technology park with services to it, but has done nothing with it. Around Ballina there is a metropolitan area network. High-speed fibre optic cable services the town, which is very well serviced overall. There are metropolitan area networks around Ireland West Airport in Knock, Kiltimagh and Claremorris. What do we have to show for this? How does the Minister of State envisage the area selling itself as a hub? What is its selling point? As technology is up and coming, it would be an area where we should be able to sell ourselves. How is that being done?</p>
            <p eId="para_52"> The issues relating to planning permission for a data centre in Athenry have been well rehearsed. The Asahi plant has planning permission, but there is no data centre. A renewable energy plant could potentially be built beside it and the fibre optic cable is in place. The area has so much going for it but nothing seems to be happening. It is high time to challenge the State agencies so that we can see delivery for this area. The champions of industry and business and the people on the ground themselves have an appetite to get stuck in and see delivery under the Action Plan for Jobs.</p>

            <p eId="para_53">I thank Senator Mulherin for raising the issue, which I have addressed in respect of other areas of the country where Deputies and Senators have similar concerns to those of the Senator. The regional action plan for jobs initiative has been a central pillar of the Government’s ability to create 200,000 new jobs by 2020, with 135,000 of these jobs to be located outside of Dublin. There is an overall goal to have a further 10% to 15% at work in each region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate of each region is within 1 percentage point of the State average. Yesterday we got the very good news from the Central Statistics Office that for the first time in ten years the unemployment rate came down to 5.9%. That is a very important indicator of what is happening regarding job creation around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_54"> The west regional action plan, covering Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, was launched in November 2015. It aims to increase employment in the region by 10% to 15% over the period to 2020, resulting in the delivery of 25,000 jobs. Implementation of the plan is overseen and monitored by a regional implementation committee made up of representatives from the public and private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_55"> At the end of 2017 the west had an unemployment rate of 5.9%. It is important to point out that the number of people in employment in the west region increased by 15,500 between the first quarter of 2015, the baseline year, and the second quarter of 2017, representing good progress towards the target of 25,000 by 2020. Over the year to the second quarter of 2017, an additional 3,800 took up employment in the west region.</p>
            <p eId="para_56"> I am pleased to say that the overall employment trends in foreign direct investment for County Mayo are positive. In County Mayo there are 16 IDA Ireland-supported companies employing 4,462 in total. In the past two years there have been two notable successes. Coca-Cola announced an investment of €26 million in its Ballina operations and Fort Wayne Metals announced a €10 million expansion of its production operations in Castlebar.</p>
            <p eId="para_57"> County Mayo has experienced a 26% increase in FDI employment from 2012 to 2017. Job numbers in IDA Ireland client companies there have grown from 3,537 in 2012 to 4,462 at the end of last year. IDA Ireland’s client base in the county has performed well, retaining a healthy presence in the west region despite a challenging global economic operating environment over recent years. Over the past year alone, the number of IDA Ireland-supported jobs in Mayo increased by 5%, and the agency continues to work hard to create further employment opportunities in the county and to increase the number of multinational companies located there.</p>
            <p eId="para_58"> The Senator needs to understand that IDA Ireland is competing against many other countries, particularly the UK. That is why IDA Ireland needs to think regionally rather than focusing on certain towns. It is competing against cities such as Manchester and Birmingham with populations of about 3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">There is fierce competition in the context of jobs. While IDA Ireland can indicate where it would like the relevant company to locate, and the Senator talked about her area in this regard, ultimately, it is a matter for that company to decide where to locate.</p>
            <p eId="para_60"> In 2017, the number of Enterprise Ireland jobs increased by 7% in the west. Indigenous jobs are very important. On 16 April this year the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I met the chairs of the regional action plan for jobs committees, including representatives from the west region, and other regional stakeholders to start a process to refresh and refocus all regional plans to ensure their relevance and impact out to 2020. It was a very important gathering in Farmleigh, where we met all the relevant stakeholders, including those from the north west, to outline the importance of what was needed in their regions. We can take that on board when preparing the regional action plan for jobs. On the same date, a further €30 million was announced in funding under the second call of the regional enterprise development fund, REDF, which is aimed at driving enterprise development and job creation in each region. Under the first call, the REDF has already supported 21 collaborative and innovative initiatives that can have a significant impact on enterprise development in the regions and nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_61"> We must acknowledge the good work done by the local enterprise offices, LEOs. The LEO in Mayo works closely with businesses and organisations, such as Moy Valley Resources in Ballina, Ballina Chamber of Commerce and Destination North Mayo, to promote economic development and enterprise creation. Specific targeting of LEO supports is achieved through the use of the LEO outreach clinics which regularly occur. A significant number of training programmes and business advice clinics have taken place in Ballina over the past three years. Some 21 projects in food manufacturing and processing, other manufacturing, medical devices manufacture, engineering, business services, craft and furniture and light consumer goods manufacture have been supported in north and east Mayo, totalling €351,858 over the same period. Export assistance totalling €21,537 was also provided over the period in question. Since July of last year, the Leader local action group in Mayo has approved 50 projects for Leader funding of almost €1.8 million. Over half of these projects are aimed at rural economic development, enterprise development and job creation, which is one of the three programme themes under which Leader funding is provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_62"> I know Senator Mulherin works extremely hard for her constituents in Mayo, particularly in the north of the county from where she hails. I assure her my Department will work together with the agencies - Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the LEOs - to ensure delivery of the employment targets for the county under the regional action plan for jobs up to 2020. We are working hard to ensure this happens, which is why we have had a lot of consultation with the various agencies and local stakeholders. I thank the Senator for raising this issue, which I have dealt with on many occasions in both Dáil and Seanad.</p>

            <p eId="para_63">I thank the Minister of State. I acknowledge the remarkable work that has been done by him and his predecessors in the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation in reversing our fortunes and bringing us almost to a point of full employment nationally. However, even Project Ireland 2040 acknowledges regional imbalance. The west is playing catch-up. While I am talking about the north and the east of the county, Mayo is the third largest county, so we are talking about a vast area. I understand that FDI companies decide where they want to establish operations. I also understand the challenges and intricacies involved. However, I am asking what efforts have been made to encourage new FDI into Mayo. I acknowledge that there has been growth among the existing FDI companies. Those companies have been very successful and are very much part of the community and invest in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_64"> I set out a list for the Minister of State of what should be selling points for us, namely, the transatlantic fibre-optic cable, high-speed, state-of-the-art technology, planning permission for a data centre, a renewable power station and a technology park. Can he tell me why IDA Ireland is doing nothing with the technology park in Ballina? It has been there since I was on the town council and the council did everything to facilitate the acquisition and servicing of the site and planning permission, but nothing has been done with it. I am acutely aware of what is happening in the area. I do not expect FDI in every town and village as that would be unreasonable. I am asking that, nationally, we position ourselves as an open economy to attract FDI. We want and need more in this area. We have a substantial population and the figures show we are losing young people, notwithstanding jobs growth. The reason there has been a reduction in the unemployment figures is that people have emigrated or migrated to the big urban centres, putting pressure on housing, education and so on, resources which we have an abundance of in our area.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> While the Minister may not be able to answer me today, I did flag these issues. I ask that he would perhaps get some answers about the technology park and about these different pieces of infrastructure, which would allow us to position ourselves as a technology hub. However, there does not seem to be an appetite to do that. Perhaps there is some work going on behind the scenes of which I am not aware. If so, the general public, the taxpayer and I would like to know about it.</p>

            <p eId="para_66">I will follow up on that. As I said, I understand the Senator's passion for her area. We do not want to go back to the dark days of the past, when people had to emigrate from Mayo. When I go to the US on trade missions, the number of Mayo people, or the descendants of those who emigrated during the Famine and at other times, whom I meet is significant and perhaps more than from other counties. However, it is not all about FDI. The statistics relating to FDI show, as the Senator acknowledged, that it is important we nurture some of the existing companies as they grow and expand. Sometimes one can overlook the significance of those companies that are in Mayo. It is important we nurture them and ensure they continue to grow in the region. In fact, some 70% of new jobs in multinational companies are in existing companies that are already in the country, which is an important factor to take into account. Small to medium-sized industries employ 60% to 70% of the workforce, which is significant. That is why the LEOs and Enterprise Ireland have an important role to play.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> The Senator referred to the site in Ballina and I will follow up on that for her. There are other counties which have sites that are earmarked for technological companies and they have the services provided and planning permission. I was recently in Ballinasloe, which is not too far from Mayo, and it also has a significant park. Obviously, the focus for IDA Ireland is to ensure it can maximise the investment around the country, particularly in those parks. As I said in my introduction, in the end companies go where they want their workforce to be located. They like to establish operations near universities and colleges, public transport, good road networks and so on. To be fair, the road network in Mayo is quite good, although I can see where the Senator is coming from in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_68"> The Senator mentioned the Galway-Mayo telecoms duct which runs 132 km between Ballymoneen in Galway to Bellanaboy in Mayo, adjacent to the gas pipeline. It is an important project, particularly in the area of broadband infrastructure for the west. The infrastructure currently provides a critical link between data centres and several multinational companies in Ireland, and the transatlantic fibre-optic cable at Killala is providing diversity and resilience to international connectivity, which is extremely important. We are looking at a situation where the future of work is changing and there is a huge emphasis on people working from home and having good connectivity and good broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_69"> I will convey the Senator's concerns regarding the figures she mentioned. It is not always possible to get FDI into smaller areas, as she acknowledges, and that is something we are very conscious of. This is why we put a particular emphasis on the LEOs to ensure we can encourage start-ups, innovation and creativity. Often, those two, three, four, five or six jobs grow and grow, which is why we are encouraging this type of activity and giving the necessary funding and grant-aid to those companies. I will take on board the Senator's concerns. Balanced regional development is very much part of the Project Ireland 2040 plan, as well as ensuring the regions grow as much as the larger urban areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_70">If the Senator looks at last year's statistics in respect of Enterprise Ireland, she will see that 65% of the 10,000 jobs it created were outside the greater Dublin area. The Senator also mentioned IDA Ireland and 45% of those jobs were created outside the greater Dublin area. The focus and emphasis are there to ensure that the regions are heard. When good public representatives like the Senator are raising these issues in the Upper House, it is a good sign that things will happen in the future. The Senator can be sure they are very much in my mind and that of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">Yesterday afternoon I raised the cervical cancer issue in this House and yesterday evening, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, informed the Dáil that there were over 1,500 more women with cervical cancer whose cases had not to date been audited. This means there are 1,500 women with cervical cancer who may or may not have had a false negative smear test result through the CervicalCheck programme before their diagnosis of cervical cancer. It means that these women may or may not have benefited from a different and-or earlier treatment of their condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> As of today, we do not know if this audit has commenced or been completed, nor do we know why the Minister did not send in the serious incident management team to investigate the matter when he initially discovered that there was a huge issue on 16 April via the memorandum he received. Evidently, the Government has had no idea at all what is going on in the Department of Health and is sleepwalking around this crisis with nobody in control and no-one with any knowledge of what is going on. The literal drip-feeding of the information to us via the Minister for Health in the Dáil and via the Department of Health is shameful and it is a deplorable way to treat Irish women.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> I commend Vicky Phelan's bravery and composure in pursuing this matter and the bravery of her family. Like her, I find the fact that nobody in the HSE was aware of this matter before 16 April incredible. The further discovery of 1,500 women yet to be audited is mind-blowing and deeply upsetting. Was it the case that this information should have been obvious, given the statistics available on the cancer registry? Last night on "Prime Time", Vicky Phelan said that she was disappointed and disheartened by the revelation but that she was not surprised. She added that there was no-one leading this and the news is changing on a daily basis. No-one can disagree with her comments. This is the same "Prime Time" programme on which Ministers were invited to appear but refused to do so. They were nowhere to be seen yesterday.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">Nobody, including Vicky Phelan, is discouraging women from getting a smear test using the current system. What we as politicians are advocating is accountability, transparency and reliability from this service. Helplines and general practitioner offices around the country are inundated with calls today and have been for the past week since this scandal emerged.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">To date, GPs and practice nurses, the primary service providers, have been given little or no guidance from the HSE on, first, how to handle the volume of calls and, second, how to advise and treat patients who have treatment options or concerns. Adequate resources must be made available. I join in the calls for an inquiry to be commenced without delay with the ability to compel witnesses within any of the agencies involved to give evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> On a further note, in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> we read of a potential conflict of interest involving the HSE director general, Tony O'Brien, after it has emerged he will take up a position within a US pharmaceutical company that specialises in female contraception. I refer in particular to the fact that he potentially breached his fiduciary duty to the HSE by becoming a board member of the company this January while still in the employ of the HSE, and with the Minister's knowledge and consent. Surely, this is a bad deal for taxpayers. The Minister has so many more questions to answer and I look forward to hearing him answer them in this House.</p>

        <speech by="#VictorBoyhan" eId="spk_25">

          <p eId="para_81">I also wish to raise the CervicalCheck controversy. It is important we do not lose sight of the importance of cervical cancer screening and its benefits when it all goes well. It is important to stress that cervical cancer screening can find abnormal cells in the cervix before they become cancerous. If cervical cancer is caught at the earliest stage, the chance of survival is more than 85%, according to the experts in this field. Cervical cancer usually has no symptoms, so it is really important that cases are picked up in a screening process. This point cannot be lost in all the debate going on here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Looking at "Prime Time" again last night, I found it quite shocking to see the number of women, and families for that matter, who are in the dark. That is the best phrase to describe this: people in the dark who have no knowledge of their current medical status. Regarding the withholding of medical information, it is very important that patients have complete access to their medical records and test results. What we have heard so far about the CervicalCheck programme is nothing short of an outrage and constitutes a serious breach of trust between patients, their doctors and the HSE. It has led to widespread fear and anger. I noted the Taoiseach's comments in the Dáil yesterday when he spoke about being angry. He is rightly angry, but the nation is angry too because there has been a breakdown in trust in the health services. There are women today, as we speak, who are unaware of their medical records, which is an absolute outrage. We must demand accountability for what has happened. Heads must roll. I do not like using that expression, but it is true and it must happen. Someone must bear responsibility for the consequences and the outcome of anything we decide in these Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I think the Minister is coming to this decision so I do not want to pre-empt what he may say later in the Dáil, or here tomorrow, but I am calling for the establishment of a fully independent commission to investigate this case. Nothing less will do. I understand that the Minister has written to HIQA to undertake a statutory investigation into this controversy. It is worth noting that HIQA, after it considers his request, will have to come back to the Minister and explain how best it can take this case on. However, it has been confirmed to me that HIQA has limited powers to demand documents and no power to direct the attendance of witnesses to come before it or, for that matter, to demand or receive sworn evidence. Surely all of this is a handicap to a full, open, transparent and forceful inquiry. Therefore, the Minister should not proceed along these lines. He has a valid reason to change his mind, given the further revelations last night.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> It is the task of the Government and the Government alone to establish all the facts surrounding this case, to restore confidence in cancer screening and to ensure such controversies never happen again. I thank the Leader for engaging with the Minister who, I understand, may come before the House tomorrow. If that is the case, that is great, and I look forward to further debate with the Minister tomorrow.</p>

          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_85">I thank the Leader for responding to my request to bring the Minister before the House tomorrow, and we look forward to a full debate with him. Normally, when a Minister comes before the House, we say we will confine our comments to when he or she is here. However, we see this absolute scandal unfolding all the time, and I have no doubt but that by the time the Minister comes in tomorrow afternoon, there will be new questions following his appearance in the Dáil today, the HSE's appearance before the health committee and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> As the cervical cancer smear test scandal escalates, it is now clear this has been a monumental, systemic cover-up. I called it a cover-up yesterday. The Minister called it a miscommunication or an error in communication. What an insult to women all over this country. We now know that at least 17 women have died and hundreds more are fighting serious battles for their health and their lives. The truth is that we do not know the full scale of this yet. We have been given misinformation after misinformation. We need to know the full scale of this. This is why Sinn Féin is calling for the immediate publication of all information surrounding the audit, the serious incident management team and the communications pathways. They must be published immediately. If we are to be transparent about this, this information must come into the public domain. I therefore call on the Minister to instruct that that information be published in the coming hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> As the numbers affected continue to rise, Tony O'Brien has serious questions to answer. Yesterday, I said his position was untenable; today, it is even more untenable. He is the one with whom the buck stops. He is the one who has a duty to report to the Minister. It will be very interesting to see the correspondence between Mr. O'Brien and the Minister, including the routine communications. Surely to God, people expect the Minister to be alerted to cases such as this. A commission of inquiry must be set up. It must be multifaceted, include the women and the families of the deceased women and have reference to the absolutely disastrous decision that was made in 2008. I want to know exactly how much was saved in this regard. Was it 30 cent in €1, 40 cent in €1, or 50 cent in €1? That decision was made under a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.</p>

          <from>Senator Kevin Humphreys<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T11:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_88">I thank the Leader for responding so quickly to the many requests from various Members of the House for the Minister to come before the House. As I understand it, he will attend tomorrow, and I thank the Leader for his speedy action on this. There will be a time for accountability. As for language such as "heads will roll", all that must be dealt with, but in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> What really needs to be dealt with tomorrow - and I hope the Leader will communicate this to the Minister - is the tens of thousands of women between 25 and 60 years of age who do not know where they stand. There has been information in the media to the effect that each woman between the ages of 25 and 60 will be written to. What will the content of that letter be? I note the IMO has written to the HSE seeking guidance on what it should tell women of that age group when they are contacted. Has a circular gone out to GPs in this regard? Will every woman between the ages of 25 and 60 be offered another smear test? If so, has the infrastructure been put in place to ensure that this is done in a timely manner? These are questions I was asked last night in Dublin Bay South when I was out talking to people. They want to see action to restore their confidence in the smear test. They also want to know whether they need to have another test now.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I wish to raise one other matter with the Leader. I have been a trade unionist all my life. I have supported the trade union movement and I believe in collective bargaining. I wish to send a loud and clear message to TV3 to recognise the trade union movement that was protesting outside its studio.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">They only want collective bargaining yet the board of TV3 is refusing to recognise the rights of the cameramen, those working in lighting, and the editing crew to union representation. It is totally and utterly wrong for a major television company to deny trade union members professional assistance in negotiating their wages and conditions.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">I was quite disappointed with Senator Ardagh's contribution because, to be fair to the other members of her party, they have been fair in terms of getting to the truth and finding out what happened. This is a significant and very serious political issue but it is certainly not a political football. I appeal to people not to use it as a political football. I received a telephone call this morning on which I suggest Senator Ardagh and others reflect. It was from a person who was in this House in 2007 and 2008, namely, former Senator Fidelma Healy Eames. She informed me this morning that she raised concerns about the outsourcing of this particular contract to an American firm on the Order of Business in this House in November 2007, in April 2008 and again in September 2008. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government of the time ignored the concerns that Senator Healy Eames put on the record of the House, concerns which had come from people working in the screening programme in Galway, including, I believe, a Professor Corkery. It was flagged at the time that the outsourcing of this service could be an issue and that there were concerns, including concerns from people in the medical world. Those concerns, however, were not taken on board by former Deputy Mary Harney and the Fianna Fáil-led Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Sadly, I also have to agree with the sentiments of Senator Boyhan in respect of Mr. O'Brien of the HSE. I try to be fair in all of my deliberations and I listened very carefully to what Mr. Tony O'Brien said on "Today with Sean O'Rourke" as I travelled to Dublin yesterday morning. I simply do not believe him. I absolutely believe in the Minister for Health and the manner in which he is trying to handle what is a national scandal. It is probably the biggest health scandal we have seen since I came into this House. However, I just do not believe Mr. O'Brien and, for the sake of all the women who have been affected, Mr. O'Brien should consider his position.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">-----that I did not get an opportunity to congratulate Senator Ian Marshall yesterday. I am impressed by his vision to drive future growth by building relationships and sales between the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the EU and the rest of the world. That is one of his objectives. My grandparents, Elizabeth McCann and John McVeigh, came from Lurgan in County Armagh. Senator Marshall is also resident in Armagh. I think that is wonderful. I commiserate with the other candidates who sought election. I also welcome Senator Anthony Lawlor back to these Houses. He has been out for two years. He was a Member of the Dáil and a very effective representative for Kildare. It was difficult for him to lose his seat in 2016 but it was a great day for himself and his family when he returned to the Houses and came to Seanad Éireann. As one who knows, I note one cannot savour victory unless one suffers defeat. He has suffered that period. Both Senators will make a very big contribution to this House, as would have all the other candidates who went forward in that by-election. We wish the ones who were successful well, particularly Senator Marshall. He has worked with the Ulster Farmers Union and I have heard about his work in the European Union. He was certainly opposed to Brexit. He is a very good voice for Northern Ireland in this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">Tá mise ag iarraidh labhairt faoin mórphictiúr más féidir liom. I want to address the big picture. I am not here to blame one person or other. I suggest that we look at solutions. That is the background I have come from. One starts to see a pattern across various Government agencies of pretty fundamental cock-ups. There are people very close to all our hearts whose families - brothers, sisters, wives, daughters or whatever - have questions in respect of smear tests, where we are going, what we are going to do and what the situation for them is. It is part of an epidemic. I suggest that the Leader speak to the Minister for Finance and ask him to consider bringing forward a restructured version of the Bill that I brought to the House a year and a half ago. This is partly coming from me wearing my business hat. How can a Minister be expected to understand and see everything that is happening in her or his Department? There are 110,000 employees under the aegis of the Department of Health. I believe the Minister is actually doing the very best he could be doing given the circumstances. I am also encouraged by what was said in the Dáil yesterday, which was challenging but broadly understanding of the Minister's position.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> What I suggest is the following. We should have some form of a national oversight and audit commission so that every three to five years every State and semi-State agency would be audited in respect of its fitness for purpose, whether it is doing its job properly and its effectiveness. That auditor's report would be made available to the Minister and to both Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>

          <p eId="para_124">I thank Senator Norris. We have a situation in which the Comptroller and Auditor General checks only the finances. He checks whether all income and expenditure has been properly accounted for but we have nobody checking whether agencies are fit for purpose and holding them accountable. There is no way any Minister from any party would be able to say hand on heart that he or she was happy that everything was being done properly. Even in a small business one cannot do that. One is dependent on staff. We need some sort of an oversight commission. Finally, in 2010 the Government introduced a National Oversight and Audit Commission to oversee local government. That started bringing best practice into local government. Between 2010 and 2016, we have saved €511 million while also increasing efficiency. We have to step up to the mark. If we do what we always did - God forbid - we are going to get what we always got.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">I believe this will be a game changer in our trade in tourism and exports to and from China. I was on a trip to China by Members of the Oireachtas and the Ceann Comhairle last week and it was eye opening to see its modern economy. There are huge opportunities for farmers, in particular, and agricultural exports. I say that because I saw a T-bone steak for sale in a shop in Hong Kong for €23. Australian milk costs up to €6 per litre. This offers huge opportunities in view of the direct links between Hong Kong and Dublin and Beijing and Dublin. It is just a 12-hour flight. I thank all the diplomats who are selling Ireland not just in China, but across the world. They are doing our country a huge service, and we should be very proud of their expertise and vocation for promoting and selling Ireland around the world. This is good news and it should be welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">First, I wish to pay tribute to Vicky Phelan. She is a most extraordinary woman. I was tremendously impressed by the courage and grace she displayed in facing ultimate realities. It is a very difficult problem. I have listened to various eminent consultants talking on radio and television and giving different points of view. One must accept that these types of tests are by no means perfect as there are large numbers of false positives and false negatives. They are just an indicator. We must also bear in mind that as a result of this programme, deficient as it is, there has been a very significant improvement in the health of women in this country. That is something positive to bear in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> With regard to disclosure, we are witnessing a cultural change in the medical system. In my day, one was told nothing by the doctor. A person was not assumed to have any rights to knowledge. It was similar to the James Robertson Justice figure we used to see in "Doctor in the House" and, with regard to the idea that patients expected to get cured, the attitude was that they were bloody lucky to get out of the hospital alive. That was the general attitude. We are seeing a shift in this and patients are now demanding information and disclosure. I believe they should be insistent on it. However, watching the different consultants offering different impressions and viewpoints and seeing these eminent people disagreeing make it difficult for the average person to know. For that reason I believe it is premature to be looking for people's heads to roll. When doctors differ, patients die.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The idea of outsourcing concerned me in the beginning, but I have since discovered that the reason for the outsourcing in the first place was that there was no capacity in this country in 2008. One cannot demand domestic processing when there is no infrastructure, capacity or medical personnel to do it. We just did not have it.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Yes. We did not get the opportunity yesterday to mark International Workers' Day, which was quite understandable given the shocking health scandal that we continue to discuss today. It is important to recognise International Workers' Day. It was recognised in fine fashion by the President yesterday when he unveiled the Starry Plough in the presidential garden to commemorate the Lock-out of 1913. It was commemorated by my union, SIPTU, with a day of solidarity and entertainment for the homeless of Dublin yesterday, another fine gesture by the largest union in the country. As has been mentioned, it was acknowledged by TV3 employees who went out on a four hour protest. It is deeply shocking that an organisation such as TV3 refuses to acknowledge the right to join trade unions. It is not alone. Newstalk refuses to acknowledge its members' right to join trade unions. The hotel industry in general refuses the right of its workers to join trade unions. The private nursing homes, for which there are cheerleaders in this Chamber, refuse to acknowledge the right of people to collective bargaining, as do the private home care providers. It is about time this Chamber had a debate on the role of trade unions in society-----</p>

          <p eId="para_141">I wish to raise two issues. What the women of Ireland need now is leadership from these Houses. I know that politics has a bad name, but politics can do much good in the coming days. I am delighted that Senator Norris mentioned the name of the woman at the heart of this scandal, Vicky Phelan. People have asked for this not to be made a political football and then have immediately engaged in political football. I do not believe that the people of Ireland need to see one side of the House point a finger at the other side of the House. We should point the finger, collectively, at ourselves and ask what we can do better for the women of Ireland. I doubt that anybody would disagree that if this was a service exclusively for men, this would never happen. We continuously fail women in this country and that must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_142"> I also wish to raise the issue of sport. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to the House to discuss sport in general and the capacity of children to play sport in the context of the accessibility of local playing fields. I am a member of Scoil Uí Chonaill GAA club. It was a delight for us to see a member of the club, Hannah Leahy, who is vice-captain of the Dublin ladies minor team, be named the player of the game on Sunday when the team won the Leinster championship. We are very proud of her, as are her family. While many of us in the House enjoy GAA and sport, we see what is happening to many of the playing pitches across this city and further afield with regard to rezoning and commercial development, including what is happening in the Na Fianna club in Glasnevin. I would appreciate the opportunity to have a discussion with the Minister with responsibility for sport about the availability and accessibility of playing pitches and how we can facilitate clubs and young children to enjoy sporting endeavour into the future. With the building or construction boom back there is more pressure on lands in institutional use in colleges and schools across the State and, due to major infrastructure plans, clubs such as Na Fianna are under increasing scrutiny and pressure. That debate would be timely and I would appreciate if the Leader could facilitate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">Could the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality to the House for a discussion on community-based CCTV schemes? I welcome the fact that €1 million has been allocated to communities throughout the country for the installation of CCTV. Unfortunately, information received shows that there have been only four successful applications to date. This clearly shows that we have a problem with the scheme in that it appears to be too onerous for communities to take up. This is an awful pity because at a time when Garda numbers are low and we are trying to assist the gardaí in doing their job, the role of CCTV could be vital in assisting the gardaí. The communities and the gardaí want it.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> The fact that only four applications have been approved illustrates that we have a problem with the scheme. I would like the Minister to come to the House for a debate on it so we can review the criteria for the scheme to simplify the process so that communities will be more forthcoming when it comes to applying. We are all aware of assaults, break-ins and loitering. The role that CCTV can play in our towns in helping to address these issues cannot be overstated. This is a serious issue. We all have a responsibility to bring in whatever measures are possible to assist gardaí to do their jobs. Could the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House so that we can have a debate about this scheme?</p>

          <p eId="para_148">I second Senator Gallagher's amendment, which is that No. 17 be taken before No. 1. We should not make a political football of the cervical cancer screening fiasco. There are very serious consequences for people involved. I offer my deepest concerns and sympathy to all the people involved who have serious issues relating to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_149"> The lack of attention by the HSE led us to this problem. Again, there is a bigger problem here and it is something we might need to look at. There has been a call over the years to take power and responsibility from politicians. This is one of the problems that has led us to this terrible scenario with cervical cancer screening. Nobody is responsible. A politician has to stand for election every number of years. If the people do not like the politician or the politician is not raising the concerns people have, be they with the health boards, complications with councils, planning or development plans, people can choose not to re-elect that politician.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> There has been a serious disconnect. There was a great drive to put in faceless people who would make impartial decisions but we have seen where many of these impartial decisions have led us. Instead of worrying about more minor things and squabbling about different things here, the most important thing we should be doing here as politicians is making people responsible. Politicians are responsible because they stand for election. They must be elected, be it to the Seanad, the Dáil or the local council. When people are elected to these fora, they must stand before the people again, be it in four or five years' time or whenever that comes around. If they are not doing their work and if ordinary people have a concern like a problem with their health board or council or with legislation and their elected representative is not cutting the mustard, they will get rid of them. It is something we must look at seriously. The day of faceless people and faceless positions answering to nobody has to end. This is a watershed moment in Irish politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">A person can buy unsmoked back rashers with the Irish shamrock on the label in the Iceland chain of supermarkets. The brand is called Glendarra and the phrase "Master Butchers of Ireland" is on the label. If someone was to look at the back of the label, they would see that the rashers are of Spanish origin. This misleads consumers. I acknowledge that if a Spanish company feels the need to put the Irish logo on the label, it is probably positive from an Irish point of view because it must say something about our quality in comparison to their quality. While I am not having a go at any other country's product, when more research was done on this and the label on the back was looked at in more detail, it emerged that these rashers originated in Germany, Denmark and Spain but were on Irish shelves with a label containing the phrase "Master Butchers of Ireland" stating that they were produced in Ireland when they had just been packaged in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> This is something we really need to look into. It is false advertising. When I did a bit of research on it, I found that by virtue of the fact that they are packaged in Ireland, there is a loophole in the EU regulation and no law is being broken. That aside, it must be pursued. We cannot have the housewives and housemen of Ireland purchasing and eating what they think is Irish-produced produce when it has been produced many miles away, been transported here and basically just packed on our shores.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I thank the 15 Members for their contributions to the Order of Business. Quite understandably, ten Members raised the issue of the cervical cancer scandal. Senators Ardagh, Boyhan, Conway-Walsh, Humphreys, Conway, Leyden, Ó Céidigh, Norris, Ó Ríordáin and Davitt spoke about it. I agree that it is time leadership was shown and required by those who, as Senator Davitt rightly said, are responsible and should be held to account. I also agree that it is not tenable that we see an organisation charged with the management of the health service interfering, obfuscating and withholding information from women who are patients in a vulnerable position and a vulnerable state, their families and medical professionals. It is unacceptable. I apologise to Vicky Phelan and all the women affected. All of us in political life and Irish society want to see answers. I commend Senator Ó Céidigh for putting forward a solution because it must be about solutions. I will not get into the political argument engaged in by Senator Ardagh. This is about ensuring that we save lives, that the women get results and that we all get information. It is unacceptable that as a Minister walks into the Dáil to give a speech, he is handed information. The bottom line, and I have said it in this House previously, is that we are accountable at the ballot box, irrespective of ideology. There are officials who are not accountable and they must be held to account in the fullness of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Cervical cancer screening saves lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">It is important that we send that message out today. This is a woman's health issue and when we speak about it, the women of Ireland should be at the fundamental core of what we say and do. The withholding of information is outrageous. As Senator Norris rightly said, there is a serious breach of trust. We are all angry and sorry but we want to see accountability and people must be held to account. That is the bottom line. The Minister will be in the House tomorrow afternoon. I thank Members for their co-operation in that regard. In my position as Leader of the House and in a personal capacity, my view is that if HIQA cannot provide the mechanism by which to deliver the investigation then, as the Minister alluded to last night, we should have a full, independent investigation whereby we can get answers. Let us be quite clear, the cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test. Cervical cancer rates have decreased from 14 per 100,000 between 2009 and 2011 to ten per 100,000 currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> It is important that as Members of the House we offer our sympathies and stand in solidarity with Ms Phelan and her family and all the women affected. As Senator Conway-Walsh said, how many more women are worried, vulnerable and unsure in their homes today? They are our wives, sisters, nieces, grand-daughters, friends and work colleagues. That is the fundamental point. I would be happy to have the Minister come to the House tomorrow in regard to that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> I am happy to accept Senator Humphreys's amendment to the Order of Business. I join with him and Senator Gavan in welcoming May Day yesterday. I agree that there should be collective bargaining and a right for the workers in TV3 and Newstalk to be part of a union. It is fundamental in anything we do that we allow workers to be represented and to have a voice at the table. Given that we did not do it on May Day, I welcome the fact that the unemployment rate has fallen below 6%. I know Senator Gavan will join with me in welcoming the fact that the unemployment rate for the month of April is at 5.9%, which means that for the first time since 2008 we are now seeing more people back at work and that the unemployment rate has fallen to below 6%. Is that not a great way to celebrate May Day - with more people at work, more people earning a living and being productive, feeling happy and being in a job?</p>

          <p eId="para_163">Senator Ó Céidigh has a Bill before the House and it can be debated during his group's Private Members' time. It is important to provide solutions. That is what Members of the Upper House should do, namely, be proactive in offering solutions. I commend Senator Ó Céidigh on doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Senator Feighan raised the direct flights from Hong Kong to Dublin and Beijing to Dublin and the importance of connectivity. We are now at the heart of Europe and it is important that we expand and broaden our markets. What Senator Feighan said is right. I am happy to have the Minister come to the House in regard to the matter he raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> I am happy to accept Senator Gavan's amendment to the Order of Business. I think he referred to No. 15. I reiterate the point made by him and Senator Humphreys that workers should be able to be part of a trade union for collective bargaining. They should be treated fairly and properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> Senator Ó Ríordáin raised playing pitches and sport. I am happy to have the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Griffin, come to the House. I commend Senator Ó Ríordáin and the Scoil Uí Chonaill GAA club on the great work it does in the promotion of Gaelic games and getting young people involved in sport. The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs is looking at childhood obesity today. I commend Hannah Leahy on her role with the Dublin minor team. Senator Ó Ríordáin is correct in that there is an issue we need to address as a society on the allocation of playing pitches, pocket parks and green spaces in the capital city and other urban areas. I would be happy to have that debate in the coming weeks. I have requested the Minister of State with responsibility for sport, Deputy Griffin, to come to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_167"> Senator Gallagher raised the issue of CCTV. I am also happy to accept his amendment to the Order of Business. As the Senator is aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, has set aside €3 million for grants for community CCTV schemes. There are 45 schemes across the country. Senator Conway tabled a Commencement matter on the issue last week. The Minister came to the House to answer questions on it. It is important to put on record that between 2005 and 2013, 45 community-based CCTV schemes were put into operation. That involves 367 cameras to which the Garda has access. As the Minister said in his reply to Senator Conway last week, the Garda safety camera service commenced in May 2017 and it provides an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying, not merely of matters relating to crime but also of vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones. The Minister is committed to the scheme. There is an opportunity for community groups to be involved in hosting such cameras. I am happy to have the Minister come back to the House again to speak on the issue but he was here on 26 April to respond to Senator Conway.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> Senator Paul Daly raised the very important issue of the labelling of Irish food products, in this case rashers of bacon. He raised a very interesting point that needs to be addressed in that even though the product is packaged in Ireland, the meat is not Irish. As he said, it is very important that such a loophole is closed in terms of traceability because it is about ensuring that the consumer is able to purchase and consume Irish goods, in this case meat.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> I am happy to accept the amendments to the Order of Business. I thank the House for its co-operation with the Minister for Health, who will be in the House tomorrow afternoon.</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I acknowledge those who are watching from elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> I am pleased to be able to introduce this Bill in the Seanad. The practice of conversion therapy has been condemned and discredited worldwide by institutions such as the UN Committee against Torture, the European Parliament and the Irish Council for Psychotherapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_201"> Yesterday, See Change began rolling out its May green ribbon campaign to encourage people to end mental health stigma. It is people's responsibility to maintain and nurture our own mental health and to do everything we can as ordinary human beings to assist our family members, friends, workmates and comrades in coping with whatever mental health challenges present in their lives. We must not fail to take action on the vacancy levels in our mental health services or the budget for such services being raided time and again. The human cost of this to families and communities is devastating.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> The "LGBT Ireland" report was launched by former President McAleese in March 2016. One element of it studied more than 1,000 LGBTI young people between the ages of 14 and 25 years. Compared with a study conducted by UCD and Headstrong of youth mental health, LGBTI young people experience twice the level of self-harm, three times the level of attempted suicide and four times the level of severe stress, anxiety and depression.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> From my experience, the primary mental health issues faced by my community can be adequately explained by the stigma faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex people. We live in a society where many same-sex couples will not hold hands on the street, "gay" is still a term of abuse on the playground and mental distress is much higher among LGBTQI people.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Addressing the legacy of criminalisation and its impact on our culture is important. Homosexuality was included in the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i> until 1973. When we reflect on LGBT experiences in mental health services, Professor Edward McCann and Ms Danika Sharek from the school of nursing and midwifery in Trinity College Dublin and UCD were published in the <i>International Journal of Mental Health Nursing</i> in 2014. Their survey noted negative experiences of mental health services, with 66% of people claiming an assumption that they were heterosexual, 29% claiming a negative reaction when they disclosed their LGBTI identities, 21% citing comments that their LGBTI identities were just a phase, and 13% claiming they were given advice that their orientation could be changed to a heterosexual one. The survey shows that the lingering damage of what was a long-standing policy still reverberates through the system at times.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> A thread runs through many of the stories of people who have endured so-called conversion therapy. It is one whereby the individual who has come out to his or her family, having given that moment years of consideration, agrees to see someone on the request of a family member. I can only presume that the individual's willingness is grounded in a love for his or her mother, father, brother or sister and a deep desire for that person's acceptance. Our coming out stories often feature accusations of selfishness, with people asking how someone's coming out will affect them. Such a response can sometimes be just selfish worry, but it can also be as serious as blatant bigotry.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> This Bill will help to affirm the identities of those who are struggling with their sexuality and deter others who seek to make interventions based on their fears or prejudices. It will prohibit conversion therapy as a deceptive and harmful act or practice against a person's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. We define "conversion therapy" as meaning any practice or treatment by a person who seeks to change, suppress or eliminate sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. This definition does not include any practice or treatment that provides assistance to an individual undergoing a gender transition, provides acceptance, support and understanding to a person or facilitates that person's coping, social supports and identity exploration and development, including sexual orientation-neutral interventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> If enacted, the Bill would make it unlawful for any person to perform, offer to perform or advertise conversion therapy or to remove someone from the State for the purpose of conversion therapy. It also creates further offences that can only be committed by a professional, including referring a person to any other person to perform conversion therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> I share people's concerns about the acceleration of turmoil and hate in our fractured world. Sinn Féin is motivated to ensure that Ireland responds to that fractured world, a response that is aggressively focused on building a model, progressive, rights-based republic as a beacon of hope for people everywhere. For such short legislation, the Bill has a significant international dimension. If enacted untouched, this ban would be the most comprehensive prohibition of conversion therapy in the world. A number of months ago, the European Parliament passed a motion that stated: "[The European Parliament welcomes] initiatives prohibiting LGBTI conversion therapies and banning the pathologisation of trans identities and urges all Member States to adopt similar measures that respect and uphold the right to gender identity and gender expression". In banning this farcical practice, we would join Brazil, Malta, Ecuador, ten US states and two Canadian provinces.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Incidentally, a Brazilian judge approved gay conversion therapy last September, thus overturning a 1999 decision forbidding treatments that claimed to "cure" gay people. According to 2017 data from the Department of Justice and Equality, more Brazilians than any other nationality outside the European Union come to study in Ireland. Their influence has been felt and welcomed among our LGBT community. Speaking from the streets of São Paulo at a protest march towards the end of last year, Mr. Carlos Daniel, an activist and organiser, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_210">We have to help people understand that this decision wasn't something small. These types of thoughts are what get us killed here in Brazil every day. We are dehumanised and treated like objects. We have to show everyone that we exist and that the future is ours.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">These are the realities that often bring people to our home on this island. We must ensure that anyone who comes to Ireland is respected and that his or her contribution to the diversity of our home is valued. This is why it broke my heart to hear a Brazilian who was the same age as me speaking in a Facebook video recorded at a Pentecostal church in Dublin city about the process through which he had rejected homosexuality only to be applauded and encouraged by the congregation as he was brought through his story by the pastor on the altar.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> So-called conversion therapy is happening in Ireland, although the Irish Council for Psychotherapy has stated that efforts to change, manipulate or reverse sexual orientation and-or gender identity through psychological therapies are unethical under its guidelines. Investigative journalism by <i>Hot Press</i> and <i>Gay Community News</i> and comments by former President McAleese on RTÉ Radio 1 in March all shed a light on this harmful and deceptive practice. Organisations such as Courage International that promote the use of conversion therapies are in the State and have been advertised through parish newsletters. They aim to suppress a person's sexual orientation. One of their goals is to live chaste lives in accordance with the Roman Catholic Church's teachings on homosexuality. North of the Border, Core Issues Trust is a registered company that helps to reduce same-sex attraction.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> The Bill will make it a criminal offence to remove someone from the State for the purpose of conversion therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">It is essential that we recognise the importance of faith in this conversation and that some religious people experience psychological distress because they see their sexual orientation and faith as being irreconcilable. I know many people who are both religious and LGBT. Positive exploration can address both the reality of sexual orientation and the possibilities of a spiritually and religiously meaningful life. They can be reconciled. I have no doubt there are huge numbers of religious people who would find the concept of conversion therapy as abhorrent as I do. </p>
          <p eId="para_215"> This is about legislating for the common good, which is the reason we are here. The intention of this Bill is to ensure that people who are distressed about their sexual orientation or identity are only offered interventions that accept and support that person for who he or she is, and I am asking for the support of the House for this legislation today. </p>

          <p eId="para_216">I formally second this Bill, and I welcome the good folk who have come into the Chamber to listen to this debate today. I commend my colleague, Senator Warfield, who has done so much good work in the short time he has been here in support of issues of true equality. It is very fitting that a republican party deals with this issue today. It is also fitting and right that it will have cross-party support. Days like today show that the Seanad really does have value, because it can be seen that contributions made here can help to win that broad support and make a real difference to people's lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I was absolutely shocked to find out that so-called conversion therapy exists and is happening in our country and in our capital city. It sounds like a bad joke, something that one might expect to see at the end of an episode of "Father Ted". Of course, it is far more serious than that. This involves the manipulation of people's lives. I want to read out an email I received from someone concerning this Bill because I believe it speaks to a fundamental truth that all of us should recognise. I will not read out the name of the writer. He says:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_218">Sexuality is not a choice. People are what they are, and that should be respected. It's heartbreaking that parents are forcing their children to repress themselves. LGBT+ youth in Ireland have a higher rate of suicide than their peers. A huge part of that is feeling like they can't be themselves. Banning conversion therapy could really help a lot of vulnerable [young people].</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I believe that captures the essence of this Bill and why it is so important. Hopefully it will have a swift passage through this House, and indeed the Lower House as well. It beggars belief that anyone, in the name of religion, could espouse this kind of sick and twisted practice. It is absolutely stunning that in the 21st century people are putting forward this type of bigoted nonsense, but they are. I was absolutely shocked to hear that this is happening in our country. It is completely unacceptable. Let us do something concrete and take a small but significant step towards a republic we can all believe in and to which we can all have allegiance. Let us support this fine Bill today. </p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Catherine Byrne)<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_220">I know that other Senators will come in, but I acknowledge and make clear to Senators Warfield and Gavan, who are presenting this Bill, as well as the other Senators involved in the introduction of the Bill, that it is widely supported in this House and that many Senators feel very strongly about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> The Bill’s objective is to prohibit conversion therapy, an extremely worrying practice. Senators have spoken powerfully, and I know that other Senators will speak about it as well. I wish to make clear at the outset that the Minister and I fully appreciate the reasons this Bill was brought forward. The Government will not oppose this Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I believe that conversion therapy is at odds with both our domestic equality legislation and our international human rights obligations. These are important to our country. In terms of commitment to equality, Senators will also know that the programme for partnership Government gives a commitment to develop a LGBTI+ national youth strategy. This is a key commitment for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and makes a contribution towards the Government’s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland. The strategy will be the first of its kind in the world. The Minister for Justice and Equality is also at the early stages of developing a national LGBTI+ strategy. </p>
          <p eId="para_223"> Turning to the details of the Bill, it is fair to say that while this is a short Bill it has significant implications. It is important therefore that this Bill to ban conversion therapy is carefully examined to ensure that it meets its objectives. Section 1 is the interpretation section which sets out the key terms in the Bill. It defines conversion therapy as meaning "any practice or treatment by any person that seeks to change, suppress and-or eliminate a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and-or gender expression", and "does not include any practice or treatment which does not seek to change a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity and-or gender expression", or which "provides assistance to an individual undergoing gender transition" or "provides acceptance, support and understanding of a person, or a facilitation of a person’s coping, social support and identity exploration and development, including sexual orientation-neutral interventions". Related terms such as sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression are in turn defined.</p>
          <p eId="para_224"> Sections 2 and 3 are very important provisions on offences and penalties, and it is useful to outline them here. The Bill says, it will be an offence for any person to "perform or offer to perform conversion therapy on a person", to "advertise conversion therapy" or "remove a person from the State for the purposes of conversion therapy". It will be an offence for a professional to perform conversion therapy on a person, irrespective of whether monetary compensation is received in exchange or to refer a person to other professionals or to any other person or both to perform conversion therapy. In addition, a person is guilty of an offence if the person removes a person from the State where one of the purposes for the removal is to have conversion therapy performed upon that person or if the person does or attempts to perform conversion therapy on another person in a place other than the State but only if it is done or attempted to be done on board an Irish ship, on an aircraft registered in the State or by a person who is a citizen of Ireland or is ordinarily resident in the State and would constitute an offence in the place in which it is done. In regard to professionals as defined in the Bill, the Bill also provides that if a professional is found guilty of an offence under section 2 of the Bill, a court shall direct that the body regulating that profession, or any other regulatory body as deemed necessary, are notified of the conviction. </p>
          <p eId="para_225"> The Government fully sees the intentions of this Bill but is concerned, based on legal advice, that the Bill is not clear enough in its language. Any issue with clarity will lead to difficulties. The definition of conversion therapy is itself open to an extremely broad interpretation. As I mentioned, there is reference to any practice or treatment by any person that seeks to change or to suppress a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. A difficulty, for example, is that it is not clear what practice or treatment is covered here. I note as well that the definition of "professional" covers an extremely broad spectrum. It refers to a person who is in possession of an official qualification or a warrant to practice or both as a care worker, counsellor, educator, family therapist, medical practitioner, pathologist, psychologist, psychotherapist, psychiatrist, social worker or youth worker.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">It would be useful to hear more about the thinking on this. I know the Senators will agree it is of vital importance that, where a criminal offence is created, especially with imprisonment on conviction, the actions which amount to an offence are clear and unambiguous. We would have to be clear on the wording in the Bill so there is certainty on what amounts to an offence under this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> It important, therefore, that if we are to achieve the objective of the Bill, we must work together to look at what changes may be needed. Another point is that it is very apparent that dealing with legislation on conversion therapy will need appropriate input across Government as part of the examination of the Bill. We also need to get an evidence base to establish the prevalence of conversion therapy in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_228"> I again express my thanks to Senator Warfield for introducing this Bill and to the other Senators. I very much welcome the debate and, on a personal basis, I look forward to working with the Senator further on the Bill during its journey through the Houses. I believe in this Bill. While a number of issues have been raised at the legal end, I believe the Bill should be enacted as soon as possible. It is very important that people should not be coerced or in any way made feel they are not a whole person due to their identity or sexual orientation, and that they have the right to choose their sexuality now and into the future. I again thank Senators Warfield and Gavan.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineArdagh" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Senator Catherine Ardagh<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_229">I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House. I also thank Senator Warfield for drafting the Bill and putting it forward. I commend the Senator and look up to him as he has been a great advocate for LGBTQ rights, which is something that should be acknowledged. I want to put on the record, on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, that we are grateful for his leadership on this matter. I welcome those in the Visitors Gallery who are here to support the Bill and thank them for taking time out of their day to come to listen to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> The Bill seeks to prohibit conversation therapy which seeks to change, suppress and-or eliminate a person's sexual orientation, gender identity and-or gender expression. The Bill also criminalises attempts to take people abroad to access conversion therapies. Fianna Fáil is proud to support this Bill, which is co-sponsored by myself and other Members of this House, including other members of my own party.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> Homosexuality was only decriminalised in Ireland as recently as the 1990s. With that in mind, the progression of LGBTQ rights has not been insignificant. Ireland made history in 2015 as the first country to legalise gay marriage by popular ballot and this was followed quickly by the Gender Recognition Act, which was enacted in September 2015. Despite these gains in LGBTQ rights, it is astonishing that people can still be forced to undergo archaic and invasive therapy based on the notion that homosexuality is an "illness” that can be "cured” through psychiatric treatments. From speaking to my colleagues, I know this practice is being carried out close to home, in my own constituency, which leaves me dumbfounded as I cannot believe it is happening. On that basis alone, I would be delighted if this Bill was speedily enacted. By not criminalising these practices, Ireland is failing people within the LGBTQ community and leaving them vulnerable to psychological torment. Conversion therapies have been shown to have a negative impact on people's mental health as they can lead to lower self-esteem, depression and suicidal ideation. It is hoped the Bill will send out a powerful message that practices masquerading as "therapy” will not be tolerated in this society. To date, only Brazil, Ecuador and Malta have nationwide bans on the practice, and we will be joining these countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_232"> Turning to the main provisions of the Bill, it prohibits any person from performing or offering to perform conversion therapy or from advertising conversion therapy, and this is punishable by a fine of €1,000 to €5,000 and-or imprisonment of up to six months. The Bill also prohibits any person from removing a person from the State for the purposes of conversion therapy, which is punishable by a fine of €2,000 to €10,000 and-or imprisonment of up to 12 months. It prohibits a professional from performing or offering to perform conversion therapy, irrespective of whether monetary compensation is received or not, or from referring a person to other professionals to perform conversion therapy, and this is punishable by a fine of €2,000 to €10,000 and-or imprisonment of up to 12 months. If the Bill is passed, it will come into effect one month from the date of its passage.</p>
          <p eId="para_233"> Senator Warfield has highlighted what is involved in conversion therapy. In the past, some mental health professionals resorted to extreme measures, such as institutionalisation, castration and electroconvulsive shock therapy, to try to stop people from being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Nowadays, the techniques most commonly used include a variety of behavioural, cognitive, psychoanalytic and other practices that try to change or reduce same-sex attraction or alter a person's gender identity. While some of these contemporary versions of conversion therapy seem less shocking than therapies used in the past, they are equally devoid of scientific validity and pose serious dangers to patients, especially to minors, who are often forced to undergo them by their parents or legal guardians, and who are at especially high risk of being harmed.</p>
          <p eId="para_234"> Mainstream mental health professionals all say conversion therapy should be outlawed. All of the world's leading professional medical and mental health associations have rejected conversion therapy as unnecessary, ineffective and dangerous. The American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric treatment such as reparative or conversion therapy, which is based upon the assumption that homosexuality <i>per se</i> is a mental disorder or based upon the <i>a priori </i>assumption that a patient should change his or her sexual orientation.</p>
          <p eId="para_235"> I again thank the Minister of State and ask her to support the Bill in its entirety. I thank Senator Warfield and the members of Sinn Féin. On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, we are delighted to support the Bill and we look forward to its speedy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">I thank Senator Fintan Warfield and his colleagues for working so hard on this Bill, which is now on Second Stage. I acknowledge it has cross-party and non-party support in the House, which is very encouraging and positive. It is an indication of how we in Seanad Éireann can and do work together. I also acknowledge the comprehensive response the Minister of State has given to the House. I want to take up one point with her, which I will address shortly as it was covered in her response.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> When I was first approached by Senator Warfield about this, I said there was no question about it whatsoever. The more I talked it through with him, it became clear the real issue here is about authenticity - the right that every person has to be themselves and to express himself or herself. No one has the right to curtail someone's ability to be authentic. No one can be fully happy and fulfilled if they are not authentic. The pressures in society that are put on people to conform in a certain way have led to serious issues, one of which was just referred to by Senator Ardagh in regard to mental health issues. How many people are no longer with us - brothers, sisters, friends, partners, loved ones - who took what some would say was the easy option while others would say it was the harder option, that is, to end their lives? They did not feel accepted, they did not feel they belonged and they had to fulfil the expectations of pathetic people who never meant anything to them at any stage in life. For those who were ridiculed from early childhood to advanced years, they felt they needed to conform because, in conforming, they are accepted; in conforming, they think they are loved and respected by peers who do not, quite frankly, give a damn about them anyway. Sadly, so many of us learned that lesson, perhaps too late in our lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> I acknowledge the importance of this Bill. Hopefully, for a new generation coming by, people can be free to be themselves, to express themselves, to love who they want to, to associate with who they want to, to be free and, above all else, to be authentic.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> I had thought of writing a few words today but, just before I came to the House, an email came across my desk. I want to read it to the House because I think it says it all. I will not mention the person's name. The person did not ask me not to mention their name, but I want to respect the person and I am conscious there are sensitivities around anyone who puts pen to paper. Suffice to say, it is from a lady in Sallins.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> The email reads: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_241">I’m from Sallins, County Kildare. I’m writing to you today as an individual who has struggled with her sexual identity her entire life. At age 16, I finally came to terms with my sexuality. I told my family who I really was and thankfully, they accepted and supported me. From speaking with my LGBTQ+ peers, I know that other people are not as lucky. Being LGBTQ+, there is a stigma. A stigma that we aren’t "normal". A stigma that we are mentally ill. A stigma that we can change who we are. We cannot change (and we don’t want to change). Conversion therapy does not work and only serves to damage LGBTQ+ people. The lack of a ban on conversion therapy here in Ireland only feeds into the negative stigma surrounding us. Senator, I urge you to support Fintan Warfield’s bill to ban conversion therapy today. Enough is enough. </p>
          <p eId="para_242">I think that says it all. No other words are necessary to describe that. It crystalises the challenges and issues which people face and what we can do about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_243"> I note the Minister of State said that she is supportive, as is the Government, but she stated "The Government fully sees the intentions of this Bill but is concerned, based on legal advice, that the Bill is not clear enough in its language." I respect that and her commitment here today to work with everyone to get this Bill through both Houses and enacted. I ask her to use her good office and her contacts in Government to, together with the Attorney General, work in partnership with the Bill's proposers in order to iron out the difficulties in the words and the language, and keep the pressure on. This is about a legacy and an issue. It is an important one for the Minister of State, who is committed to diversity and respect to keep up the momentum and get this legislation through the Houses. </p>

          <p eId="para_244">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank Senators Warfield and Gavan for proposing and seconding this Bill and for taking the time and effort to draft this Bill. As someone who has brought in Private Members' Bills, I know that much time and effort goes into its drafting and ensuring that it is a Bill that can proceed through the House, and I thank them for their efforts in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_245"> We have changed quite a lot as a country in recent years. As Senator Ardagh noted of the marriage equality referendum, we were the first country in the world to vote to bring about the change in marriage equality. There was also further legislation in this area of giving equal rights to people. During the marriage equality referendum, there was a view that in rural areas people would be very conservative and would not want change but if one looks at the results, it is clear that right across the country, people wanted that change. Similarly, it is important that we bring about legal change in this area. It is important that there is proper effective legislation to prohibit conversion therapies and that it can be implemented. </p>
          <p eId="para_246"> This is not a criticism of the Bill, but an effort to be constructive. I wonder about someone who is under 18 years, particularly where a parent decides to take a person under 18 years out of the country for conversion therapy. Does the Bill cater for that? Can we deal with it in the Bill? It is not clear if that is the case as it is currently drafted. The Minister of State might comment on this. Where the parent has certain rights, is the Bill sufficient to preventing a parent from taking someone aged under 18 years out of the country to go through therapy? We need to look at this issue. It arose in relation to legislation on female genital mutilation, FGM, where children being taken out of the country is a significant issue. In that case the question of proofs arises in trying to introduce proper regulation and to ensure there is a penalty. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that it does not happen, and we must ensure that there is adequate cover in the legislation to deal with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> Overall, the Bill is a welcome development. The Minister of State has clearly set out the Government's position and the legal issues which require clarification. At present, I have one Private Members' Bill before the Houses. Speaking with officials in the Department of Justice and Equality recently, I was told they had 67 amendments to the Bill. The Senators who brought forward this legislation should not take it as a criticism if the Department comes back with amendments. The idea is to ensure that the legislation can be put in place, that the law is implementable, enforceable and that it is strictly adhered to in this issue. It is important legislation. People should have the freedom to express their sexuality in a proper manner, without restriction, and there should be no process which could interfere with that and the draft Bill before us tries to do that. </p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I thank the Senators. This Bill has my full support and I would have no difficulty in giving my help or assistance to the Senators who are bringing this legislation forward. </p>

          <p eId="para_249">I will share time with Senator Higgins.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> I thank the Minister of State and Senator Warfield, especially, for putting this important Bill before the House, which I was delighted to co-sign. I welcome all the visitors to the Gallery today.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> This is a subject on which I feel deeply. It is close to home and close to my heart. When my son wanted to let his aunts and uncles, of whom there are a great many, know that he was gay, I offered him help in spreading the word. When I spoke to my brother, he asked me how my son knew he was gay. In reply, I asked him how he knew he was heterosexual, which he acknowledged was a fair point and we moved on. LGBTI people know, especially when they are ready to share with others. As such, the very concept of conversion therapy is at best ill-conceived and at worst a "a deceptive and harmful act or practice against a person's sexual orientation, gender identity ... or gender expression", in the words of Senator Warfield's Bill. Conversion therapy is insulting to LGBTI people, it is harmful and dangerous. That is why we must support this Bill and ban the practice. Let us remember that so-called “conversion therapy” sometimes known as “reparative therapy” is a range of dangerous and discredited practices that falsely claim to change a person’s sexual orientation, gender identity or expression. Such practices have been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organisation for decades, but due to continuing discrimination and societal bias against LGBTI people, some practitioners continue to conduct conversion therapy. Minors are especially vulnerable and conversion therapy can lead to depression, anxiety, drug use, homelessness and suicide. Conversion therapy - it pains me to use the distortion of the word when I know what real therapy is - has been deemed unethical by the much respected Irish Council for Psychotherapy and others.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">It is so harmful and really dangerous given the fragility of some LGBTI young people and according to information provided recently by BeLonG To to the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, of which I am a member. Included in that committee's interim report, which was published last week and which I commend, is a statement by BeLonG To that the level of self-harm is three times greater among LGBTI young people than among the general population. The rate of attempted suicide is three times greater among them and they are four times more likely to experience severe or extremely severe stress, anxiety and depression. Of LGBTI young people aged between 14 and 18, 56% have self-harmed and 70% have had suicidal thoughts. A strong link was found between a young person having experienced LGBTI-based bullying and serious mental health difficulties. People may need support and therapy. I refer to proper, supportive, non-judgmental, empowering therapy, not the kind that Senator Warfield's Bill rightly seeks to prohibit, which is practised by charlatans with often-questionable religious beliefs that would seek to pathologise LGBTI people because of their sexuality, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.</p>
          <p eId="para_253"> I fully support the measures to prohibit this kind of so-called therapy in Ireland, as proposed by the Bill. I also call for the supports that enable LGBTI young people to flourish, live well, and live good and happy lives in Ireland today. I commend the Bill to the Minister of State and congratulate Senator Warfield.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I am delighted to be one of the many co-signatories of this Bill. It is an extremely important one and I really commend Senator Warfield on introducing it. When I was a young person in Galway I had an older friend, in his 20s, who had gone through electroconvulsive therapy because he was gay. He had depression and it was framed around this. It was not framed as a conversion therapy but it effectively was. It was to try to imbue in him deep-seated trauma and guilt over his sexual orientation. It had significant repercussions for him in the years that followed. We found a community of support for him at a later point. That was my first time encountering a practice of this kind. It was not always framed exactly as conversion therapy but it was effectively operating in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_255"> Senator Catherine Ardagh mentioned very disruptive medical forms of intervention, such as electroconvulsive therapy and forced hormonal injections. These are not the only interventions. Equally insidious are those forms that disguise themselves as therapeutic, as counselling and sometimes as family therapy. We have seen an increasing amount of evidence and heard stories, in <i>Hot Press</i> and elsewhere, about where such therapies are practised in Ireland. They might not always be framed solely as conversion therapy, and that is why this Bill will drill down to identify the many ways in which they might be framed. It is something that is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_256"> The Minister of State stated we need to gather evidence to establish the prevalence of conversion therapy in Ireland. That would be very useful but we need to be absolutely clear that this does not need to be a precondition of our moving forward with legislation. We have in Europe the precautionary principle and we know there is a move in many places across Europe where we have seen an increase in the prevalence of conversion therapy. Therefore, it is very important that Ireland be ahead of the curve and put in place proper, preventive measures now rather than waiting to see whether a phenomenon arises and then responding to it. I caution that gathering evidence should not in any way delay the passage of this legislation. It should be speedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_257"> Another concern expressed by the Minister of State was on the definition of "professional". I recognise absolutely that there will need to be amendments. I am sure Senator Fintan Warfield will engage with the Government on the definition of "conversion therapy". I note, in regard to the definition of "professional", that there are those with qualifications but also those who present as professional. In this regard, we need to look to some of the areas of religious practice where a therapy may be presented by somebody who might not have a qualification at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> I have a lovely quotation on which I will end because of the time constraint. We are celebrating the centenary of suffrage. I always love to quote Eva Gore-Booth, who, of course, had a partnership with Esther Roper. She has a wonderful gravestone in Hamstead that states: "Life that is love is God." It is about the fact that the proof of love is the acceptance and support we offer each other. There is a challenge in this regard and a role for love and inclusion among us, as legislators. It is important that we send a signal of love and inclusion in an active way. That is what this Bill is doing. I applaud it and encourage us to pass it through the House speedily. Perhaps the Government might allow time to ensure its speedy passage.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend Senator Warfield on this very important Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> I wish to make two points right at the head. The first concerns the definition of "professional". I was horrified to hear of the Brazilian church where an attempt was made to convert a young Brazilian person. They are wonderful people. They are also so physically beautiful. They are a great adornment to the gay community in this country. I was really horrified by what happened. Despite the fairly lengthy and exhaustive list of people who are described as "professional", I wonder whether the person in charge of the church in question would be caught by it. I am not sure it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_262"> The Minister of State said we need an evidence base to establish the prevalence of conversion therapy. That would be very interesting. It will be a very useful guide but one case is too many. We already have evidence of at least one and perhaps quite a few others. I have a very large volume of email correspondence from people all over Ireland. This is not a Dublin problem. It affects every county of our Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_263"> I remember when the therapy was called "aversion therapy". I remember very severe things being done. There were utterly disgusting. They used to put a volumetric analyser on a man's penis and show him pictures of men engaging in sexual activity. If there was any volumetric change indicating an erection, he got a hell of an electric shock. There were other practices in which one was given emetics. There was one success; one man died. He certainly stopped being gay; there is no doubt about that but he was a death. If one wants to go to that extreme, that it what occurs.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Aversion therapies or conversion therapies were practised in America. There were two poster boys – wonderful, masculine, handsome men – and everything was going swimmingly until, of course, they eloped together. That was the end of that one. I grew up during a period of these kinds of practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_265"> A lot of this stuff is religious now. As a religious, churchgoing, practising Christian, I find it utterly disgusting. When I was a teenager, Archbishop Fisher was the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was a dreary oul' fool and a horrible snob but it did not cost me a thought to think that. I thought the man was just so ignorant, stupid and wrong. In the New Testament, Jesus Christ never once mentions homosexuality, good, bad or indifferent. That is how important it was to Jesus so I do not know where the Jesus freaks are coming from.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> I remember dealing with somebody in the Hirschfeld Centre and before that in 46 Parnell Square who had been through the therapy. He came from a wealthy farming family in Kilkenny. They referred him and he was given aversion therapy. It totally scrambled his mind. He was a real walking casualty but he was so brave and wonderful in the way he fought against this. It very deeply affected the rest of his life so he was really a casualty. This is brainwashing. It has been condemned by all reputable psychotherapy bodies. It has absolutely no credibility whatever. On the religious side, the intention is to inflict feelings of shamefulness and sinfulness in the people. How crippling this is for vulnerable young people. How crushing the effect on young people to be given the impression that they are sinful, shameful and disgusting.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Conversion therapy is the male equivalent of female genital mutilation.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">It is precisely the same kind of thing. It is a savage attack on somebody, whether a man or a woman. I would like to end by putting a human face before people today and put on the record three emails which I received, chosen from among many. This is from a man who wrote to me. He says: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_269">I have personal interest in seeing this bill become law as I have direct experience of reparative or conversion therapy both as a young teenager and in to my early 20’s. Whilst I am grateful that my own experience has not had a lasting impact on my own emotional wellbeing, having worked through this incredible therapy, I have a number of friends for whom this has had a lasting impact. As a teenager I was subject to a form of 'therapeutic' intervention which sought to change my sexual orientation and included spiritual intervention using exorcism. This was deeply distressing and disturbing to me as a young person and I should never have been subjected to this form of religious or therapeutic abuse. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_270">As a young adult I attended group therapy and ‘specialised’ courses entirely focused on changing my sexual orientation. As a young Christian I felt that there was no alternative and that my faith and my sexual orientation could not be reconciled, fortunately I learned that this was in fact not the case for the future. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_271">Conversion therapy is underpinned by assumptions that sexual orientation or a trans identity are wrong and immoral. Banning such therapy gives a clear message that in Ireland these approaches are wrong and dangerous to the wellbeing of individuals who are LGBT.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">The next email is even more stark. It is from a young woman from Galway. She says:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_273">I, myself, am a lesbian. I have never been so proud of this country as when gay marriage was passed by referendum - I grew up in the countryside and believed it was an immutable fact that people did not care about me, would not care if I died, did not like me, or people like me. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_274">The referendum passing was part of the reason I came out. My aunt got married to a lovely woman, and was happier than I’d ever seen her. [...] </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_275">From the age of sixteen, I had a friend from America who I knew as Ace, who was the same age. Ace would tell people I was his girlfriend to keep his gay identity a secret, and at times I would do the same. Ace let slip to his mother that he was gay, and shortly after was sent to conversion therapy. When I was nineteen, I learned from social media that Ace committed suicide. I cannot describe in words the sickly emptiness it left in my life, although Ace and I had not spoken in almost a year. [...] </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_276">Had I not been so lucky, I could have been in his position. It is a real possibility that had my luck been different, I could have been butchered by a gruelling, hate-based faux-psychological process designed to murder a human being by mutilation of the soul, inch by inch by inch.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I will briefly make reference to a final letter.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_278">I am a very proud lesbian woman. When I came out to my parents I was forced into religious rituals of ‘getting rid of the gay’ in me. Safe to say that I am still very much gay but still petrified to ever come out to anyone in my family or ever be myself around them. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_279">My experience has changed my life in many ways and I don’t want any child to grow up and face the cruel, inhumane, illogical and scary process of conversion therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I commend Senator Warfield and all the rest of us who signed this important Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_118">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_281">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to the House and I thank her for taking the Bill. I understand the great humanity and compassion she brings to her job in respect of this particular issue. It is always hard to follow the father of the House but, in the time allocated to me, I will start at the end of Senator Norris's speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_282"> Despite the progress we have made as a society and as a country, there is an unknown within elements of society. Within that darkness those people feel the emotions of being afraid. There are people who are petrified. The issues of repression, cruelty and inhumanity still resonate with many people, including some who are meant to be people's pastors, family or support.</p>
          <p eId="para_283"> Like Senator Norris, I commend Senator Warfield on this Bill. I was happy to sign it. I speak not just as a Member of the House and as a member of the LGBT community, but as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, Parliamentary Assembly. Other Members of the House who travel and are involved in European committees will understand that there is a huge journey to take in parts of the world and that we in this country must continue to lead. Today is another example of taking that lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> To those who are listening and who support the retention of conversion therapy or any elements of repression, I again say that sexuality is not a choice. In Senator Higgins's contribution she spoke about love and inclusion. The God that I and the faith-based community of which I am a member pray to is a God of inclusiveness. I was made in his image and likeness. That is what we must bring from today. It is about ensuring that people are free to be who they are and that they are respected and treated with dignity both by the State and by us as citizens of a republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> There are parents and people in certain churches in certain communities who feel that we can repress, convert and change. We all know quite well that that practice and mindset is wrong and erroneous. We should look at the rates of self-harm and suicide among the LGBT community. We should look at the mental health issues. Today's legislation is as important as any we have had in the past. It is about ensuring that those who feel vulnerable and isolated know they are not alone. Members of this House and Members in Government are with them. Notwithstanding the points the Minister of State made in her speech about issues in the Bill which need to be clarified, tidied up and cleared up - and we can do that - there is cross-party support for this legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_286"> Unfortunately, I happened to listen to some of the coverage on some of the US networks about different issues around sexuality in the United States over recent weeks. This is an abusive therapy. As Senators Norris and Warfield have said, it is condemned by all mental health organisations, by all of us involved in civic life and, as Senator Norris has rightly said, by the professionals in particular. If we can do one thing in this debate apart from expediting the passage of this Bill, it is to send a message that Seanad Éireann stands with and supports the LGBTQ+ community in its entirety, in a cross-party, collective and universal way.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> This time last year I had the pleasure of being in the United States as part of a State Department-Boston College programme in which ten members of the Irish LGBT community travelled across parts of the United States. The one thing that struck me, very forcefully, was the way in which, in some cases, the trans community was misunderstood, not respected and not supported by community and family. I know we have a housing crisis in Ireland but, taking my mind back to that trip to North Carolina and Boston, I was struck by the number of trans people who were forced to couch-surf and to sleep in cars, and who had been thrown out of their homes by their parents because of ignorance, a lack of understanding and a lack of respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> To fast-forward to today, this Bill is important. It is about the lives of people. It is about offering them a lifestyle where they can be free to be who they are. In a modern society, we should not have to have a debate to pass this Bill. We should not have this conversation, but we do have to. As long as there are people in this House like Senator Warfield and all Members who support this Bill, we will continue to be a progressive society.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I commend the Bill to the House and I thank the Minister of State for her contribution. I hope, as a consequence of the debate, we can learn to love and be inclusive, as Senator Higgins said. The proof of that is how we, as a society, behave.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoseConwayWalsh" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_290">It is important to contribute to the debate on this subject. I commend Senator Warfield. Within Sinn Féin, we have always promoted LGBT rights and equality. We would not have the depth of information and knowledge regarding what needs to be done, such as the banning of this therapy, if it was not for the Senator. As a mother of two sons, I owe him a debt of gratitude for that. I hope the Bill passes speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_291"> I very much welcome the Minister of State's comments, her positivity and her recognition of what needs to be done. I also commend other parties, including Senator Ardagh's, and the other Senators who co-signed the Bill. It was one of the easiest Bills to gather signatures for in my party once it was explained in the way Senator Warfield explained it. I was astonished to learn that this practice is legal in the State. My sons are 16 and 14 and it is legal to change part of their identity using the most horrific and inhumane methods, which is beyond belief. This is not conversion therapy, it is conversion torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> I thank all those who wrote to us in respect of this issue. I read every email I received. Some of them contained heartbreaking stories. One line resonated with me, in particular - "Is it better to have a dead straight child than a living LGBT child?" Like many others, I lost a friend because of her sexuality and I am angered that that is still happening. As a Catholic, I was particularly angered during the marriage equality referendum campaign that my church was used to dissuade people from giving others the right to be who they want to be and to love whom they want. Many of the same people are happy to go to houses and peer into the coffins of young people who have lost their lives because they felt there was no place for them in their communities. I come from a remote rural area and I know it can be incredibly difficult for young people who are not heterosexual because of the gossip and nonsense spread in the closed communities in such areas. People of all ages living in rural communities who are gay or lesbian should be brave and come forward. There are many people like me and they would be surprised where they would find the love and support they need, even in remote rural areas. They should come forward and be who they are. We ran an anti-bullying campaign some years ago in an attempt to generate a community response to bullying, part of which related to homophobic bullying. The campaign's slogan was, "Free to be me". We all need to be free to be who we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> Ending the archaic, barbaric practice which was described in some of the emails we received and which is dangerous and damaging to people's mental health and well-being would be a good piece of work. It is probably one of the most significant pieces of work in which this Seanad will engage. I welcome the legislation and I thank all those involved in producing it. I also thank all those in the Gallery who came along to support the passage of the Bill. Above all, I thank Senator Warfield for his contribution on this issue.</p>

        <speech by="#GraceOSullivan" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_294">I commend our youngest Member, Senator Warfield, the Sinn Féin spokesperson on LGBTQI rights. He is the perfect person to bring this Bill through the House because he represents the younger people of Ireland. I hope that this legislation will lead to an opening up of our communities to become inclusive, to recognise the reality of the society we live in and, as the Leader said, to recognise progress. The Bill aims to prohibit conversion therapies as misleading and damaging practices against a person's sexual orientation, gender identity and-or gender expression. This practice has been condemned by institutes such as the United Nations Committee Against Torture, the European Parliament and the Irish Council for Psychotherapy. This is an emotional debate and Senator Conway-Walsh expressed that in the context of her own suffering. Other speakers have pointed out that this is a highly emotive issue and it is timely that it is being discussed. It is a disgrace that these practices are still happening. Our message should be that we value the contribution of all the people on this island to diversity and that diversity and expression need to be cherished and protected. Two weeks ago, the European Parliament passed a motion commending members states that have prohibited these harmful practices and called on those that have not to do likewise.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Senator Warfield is showing leadership on this issue on behalf of his party and all the Members who have co-signed the Bill and he has received cross-party support as a result. I hope the Bill passes speedily through the Houses. My party fully supports and endorses the legislation and we will work with the Senator, the Civil Engagement group and all other parties to ensure the end of conversion therapies in Ireland.</p>

          <from>Senator Ivana Bacik<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_296">I welcome the Minister of State and I commend Senator Warfield on initiating this important Bill. On behalf of Labour Party Senators, I am delighted to co-sponsor it with him. I welcome those in the Gallery who will hopefully observe the passage of the Bill through Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> The Minister of State commented on the internal system and I am glad the Government will not oppose the legislation. I recognise that she has raised issues about the vagueness of wording in respect of the criminal offence. Senator Warfield and I have had long chats about the wording and the need to be precise and specific in language when creating criminal offences while being particularly mindful of the provisions of Article 38.1 of the Constitution and the extensive case law that exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">All of us would be delighted to work with the Government and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on strengthening the Bill and ensuring that the provisions relating to the criminal offence can be tightened in that regard. There would be no difficulty with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> All of us are happy to support the Bill in principle, and immense cross-party support has been offered for it already. There is huge goodwill towards it. Senator Norris referred to the Private Members' Bill on female genital mutilation which was initiated in this House by me and passed some years ago. It is a useful parallel to make. There was unanimous support for that Bill, as there is for this one. The Minister for Health accepted the Bill and we steered it through the House, with Government amendments. Similarly, it created extra-territorial effect for various criminal offences. It has been an important Bill not just in terms of the practical impact, and there have been Garda investigations under it where the dreadful practice of FGM has come to light in Ireland, but also in that it has provided an important tool for advocacy to the many women's and other groups campaigning to end the practice of female genital mutilation. I see this Bill in the same light. It also sends an important symbolic message as to the type of society we wish to live in, quite apart from the practical impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> In terms of what amendments might be made, we might consider changing the Title. I listened to my colleagues' contributions and they are quite right to point to the fact that the use of the term "therapy" in the Bill is misleading. Of course, the sort of practice we seek to prohibit in the Bill is not therapy in any sense. As Senator Norris powerfully said, it is more a brainwashing or manipulation technique. Senator Conway-Walsh spoke of it as conversion torture rather than conversion therapy. We may well have to consider the Bill's Title on future Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> I am grateful to the many people who emailed. Other Senators have referred to the many emails we have received in support of the Bill. I also wish to thank, in particular, Aengus Carroll for giving me a briefing on the Bill and for his great work with the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, ILGA. I commend to colleagues the report produced by the ILGA in 2017 on state-sponsored homophobia. It provides a very useful comparative framework to examine legislative models around the world. When we examine the provisions in the Bill in more detail on Committee and Report Stages we might have regard to that report. To make a few general points in the comparative context, if this Bill were passed, subject to the amendments we have discussed, Ireland would have the most comprehensive legislation in the world in terms of prohibiting the practice of so-called conversion therapy or brainwashing techniques.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> We already led the world on LGBTI rights when, in 2015, this was the first country to pass a law on marriage equality by popular vote by way of referendum. We are all very proud of leading on that. As Senator Buttimer so eloquently said, we should be seen to take a lead again on this issue. Indeed, we also took a lead in the gender recognition legislation. We learned from best practice in other countries when we debated that Bill, and many amendments were made in the Seanad and the Dáil to strengthen the legislation. We can learn from other jurisdictions. We might consider Malta which already has fairly extensive legislation. The Title of its legislation is the Affirmation of Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Gender Expression Act. It is perhaps a more positive name when we come to considering the Title of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> I am also grateful to Aengus Carroll for pointing me to recent news from California, where this type of so-called therapy or brainwashing is being prohibited as part of a legal framework dealing with fraud. It is an interesting model because at the core of this issue is a misrepresentation of what is being offered. The Civil Code of California is to be amended to read that anybody who engages in advertising offering to engage in, or engaging in, sexual orientation change efforts with an individual is seen as taking part in this type of fraudulent activity. There are useful models we can examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I look forward to Ireland, through the adoption of this legislation, becoming a world leader in prohibiting this reprehensible practice of so-called conversion therapy. I look forward to working with Senator Warfield, whom I commend again, and other colleagues on a cross-party basis as well as the Minister and her officials on strengthening and improving the Bill and moving it forward swiftly through both Houses so it can become law before too long.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I attended a conference on Saturday called HeadSpace2018 at Trinity College. It was about how people should use creativity as they grow older, and how creativity can hold onto elders in a way they should be held onto and how their quality of life as they get older can depend more on creativity than on finance and security. In the middle of it - there is a reason I am telling this story - a choir came on stage. Its members were from the inner city and many of them were intellectually disabled and many had adult Down's syndrome. They sang with much gusto, brilliance, rhythm and joy. As I sat there I recalled the words of Tom Murphy, who said that it is when people sing that one knows who they really are. That is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> Senator Boyhan spoke, in a different context, about knowing who we really are. Sometimes it is hard to express who we really are on a daily basis, and for people to listen to who we really are, be it intellectually, emotionally, politically, socially or in any way. For me, therefore, the idea of conversion therapy is anathema to everything that everybody's individual heartbeat stands for. In fact, I will return to the arts again to speak about immersion. If one were to be immersed in something like the arts, they contain a better conduit or channel for who one really is when things get stuck because we do not have the legislation to free people. That is what this legislation is about, freeing people to be who they really are and how their hearts beat. That is the fundamental and profound right of all citizens. I am seeking to make the connection between who people were and how the arts gave them that conduit and how Senator Warfield's Bill is trying to free that up once again.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> I do not like the word "conversion". Even though I am in my 60s, I know I look 38.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">When I was in school there was conversion around the way we thought. Shame and sin took precedence over affection and loving. It was all about shame and guilt. Our idea of the Christ or God was to do with pain, purgatory and limbo. Our history was confined to how we were affected as opposed to what we emanated. I do not like the term because it was not until I got to university that I got a sense of freedom and a thought process - again it was only through the arts - that allowed one to find out who one was.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I commend Senator Warfield. I am a member of the arts committee with the Senator and he stands up for the arts extremely well. He stands up for his people or tribe, as I do for mine in north Mayo. While he stands up for his tribe, people and his age, he also stands up for the future and for the past extremely well. I commend and support him on the Bill. The Minister of State has made some interesting points about language, as have Senators Bacik and Colm Burke. If anything, they just want to help Senator Warfield give this Bill a safe passage. We will help as well. Senator Colm Burke made the point about somebody who is under 18 years of age. How do we deal with that? How do we contain everybody and how do we give this Bill the safest passage? We will do that in whatever way we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I read every one of the emails and I responded to as many as I could, but one of the most interesting things I noticed was the humility with which people wrote.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">That is very interesting because a lot of the emails that come in say "I want", "I need", "I am entitled" or "I have a right". They did not write at that level but with humility, saying this is their life, this is what has happened and this is how they need to move forward, and asking if I could help. I commend the Bill and am delighted to speak on it and to support it. It is an outstanding way forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_313">I thank all the Senators who supported the debate. I should acknowledge that this is Government time, which is a reflection of the cross-party support for the Bill. Some 20 Senators are co-signatories, including Senators from Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party, the Green Party and Independents. I should say that Senators John Dolan and Billy Lawless wished to co-sign the legislation but, due to unforeseen circumstances, it was not possible. I note their support for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> I thank Senator Ivana Bacik for her advice and support in the drafting of the legislation. I am hopeful that this debate will ensure the safe passage of the Bill through the Houses. I thank the Government for outlining that it will not oppose the Bill and accept entirely that there may be wording issues and that changes may be required. Sometimes when one sits on a piece of work for six or seven months, one just wants to let it go and allow the ten Stages within the Oireachtas to iron out the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> The legislative opinions were becoming almost contradictory or overwhelming. None of the 20 signatories who co-signed the legislation has waived his or her rights to amend the Bill on further Stages. The Bill represents the first attempt by these Houses and, by extension, the State to navigate our way through certain language such as "sexual orientation", "gender identity" and "gender expression". From my understanding, none of this language, even within gender recognition legislation, has been defined in legislation. We must all partake in that process of navigation and I am absolutely open to discussion with the Department on the direction of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I concur with Senator Norris, who cited the Minister of State's assertion that we need to get an evidence base to establish the prevalence of conversion therapy. I mentioned in the Irish context that my heart was broken when, on Facebook, I heard a Brazilian the same age as me, who was recorded at Pentecostal church in this city, speaking about the process through which he rejected homosexuality. He was applauded and encouraged by the congregation and by the pastor at the altar. That Pentecostal church is about 500 m from my home and the Minister of State's constituency office. There is evidence that it is happening under our noses as well as elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> We also have to reflect on the experiences of LGBT people in our State mental health services. In my opening speech today, I cited a survey in the <i>International Journal of Mental Health Nursing</i>, whose respondents experienced the following: "An assumption that I was heterosexual" - 66% of respondents; "a negative reaction when I disclosed my LGBT identity" - 29%; "comments that my identity was just a phase" - 21%; and "advice that my orientation could be changed to a heterosexual one" - 13%. There is lingering damage from what was long-standing policy that still reverberates through the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> I thank Senator Colm Burke for his support. He wonders if the Bill is sufficient to ensure that a parent cannot remove someone from the State. Senator Bacik mentioned female genital mutilation, FGM, as did Senator Colm Burke. We took that piece from the FGM legislation. Whether it needs to be slightly amended remains to be seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> I thank Senator Higgins for her very beautiful words on the need for legislators to bring love to the conversation. I thank Senator Norris for reading those emails. It is really important that we allow the voices of people to be heard. The second email he read was about Ace, who eventually took his own life. We have to consider the international dimension. As a member of the LGBT community, wherever I go I will research what it is like to be LGBT in that country. Most of the issues we debate here on LGBT rights get coverage in the international press. We can set the example. Others cannot celebrate Pride, let alone speak in their parliament. They will look to Ireland for international best practice. We can provide that best practice. </p>
          <p eId="para_320"> I thank everyone who has spoken. I wish I could go through all the issues. I will conclude by saying that those who are distressed about their sexuality should only be offered interventions that support them for who they are.</p>

          <p eId="para_323">This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 148, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matters, therefore, which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_324"> For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated a proposed grouping. A Senator may contribute once on each grouping. I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_325"> Before we commence, I draw Members' attention to a typographic error in amendment No. 22 in the numbered list of amendments. The Bill as printed is correct. Sections referred throughout the text as sections 33, 39 or 40 of the Domestic Violence Act 2018 were incorrectly entered as sections 33, 37 and 38 when producing the amendment list.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Charles Flanagan)<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_326">I am very pleased to be back in the Seanad for what I hope will be the concluding Stages of one of the most important pieces of legislation this House or these Houses will enact this year. In anticipation of a concluding debate on the 24 amendments in six groups, I acknowledge the participation, leadership and involvement of the former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, both of whom have joined us this afternoon. I acknowledge their role in bringing this important legislation to its current state. I thank them for their leadership and for ensuring that what we have after a lengthy debate is a very fine piece of legislation. I hope that over the next period of time, we can proceed through the amendments. I would be happy to take Senators through the amendments that have been made in the Dáil and for which I am seeking the approval of the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> Group 1 comprises amendments Nos. 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17 and 20. These are technical drafting amendments to improve the clarity of the provisions of the Bill. Amendment No. 1 amends section 2 by the insertion of a definition of civil proceedings under the Act, which is the term used throughout the Bill. This definition, which was included in the 1996 Act, was inadvertently omitted from section 2 of the Bill as published.</p>
          <p eId="para_328"> The purpose of amendments Nos. 6 and 7 is to improve the clarity of section 9 regarding the matter of applications for emergency barring orders. Amendment No. 11 is a technical amendment to improve the clarity of section 23(1) of the Bill, which provides for the geographic jurisdiction of the District Court and Circuit Court in civil proceedings under the Bill. The amendment makes it clear that the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Bill can be exercised now by any judge assigned to the relevant district.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> Regarding amendment No. 12, the deletion of section 23(3) of the Bill was necessary to ensure compliance with the principle that the District Court exercises jurisdiction by reference to districts. This principle has been the subject of case law in the Supreme Court since the 1996 Act was enacted. Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are technical amendments to improve the clarity of sections 25 and 27, which relate to civil proceedings under the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_330"> Amendment No. 17 relates to section 39 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad, which provides for a new offence of forced marriage. The section will allow criminal proceedings to be brought in Ireland for forced marriage offences committed by Irish citizens or residents anywhere outside the State. This will be subject to a requirement known as dual criminality. The act must also be an offence in the place where it was originally committed. Offences committed outside the State on Irish-registered ships or aircraft can also be prosecuted within this jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_331"> The new subsections 9 and 10 will ensure that criminal proceedings may not be brought in this State for a forced marriage offence where criminal proceedings have already been determined in another country in respect of the same act. These are standard provisions in legislation where provision is made for jurisdiction for offences committed outside the jurisdiction of this State. Amendment No. 20 will ensure that the transitional provisions will apply to all civil proceedings under the 1996 Act that have been commenced but have not been determined when Part 2 of this Bill dealing with court proceedings comes into operation. This will ensure that there is no uncertainty about the continuity of applications for the variation or discharge of orders under the 1996 Act and any appeals relating to orders under that Act that are under way when Part 2 of this Bill is commenced.</p>

          <p eId="para_335"> I have a couple of technical points I would like to make. These amendments, particularly amendment No. 1, do clarify the situation and anything that clarifies the situation is very welcome so I will certainly be supporting these amendments. However, I think Members will have a certain technical difficulty in dealing with these amendments for the following reason. What we have is the Bill as passed by the Dáil so it is different to the one that was originally presented to the Seanad. That is fair enough. The text of amendment No. 3 is, "In page 9, line 21, "and committed" deleted." However, line 21 just refers to subsections 2 and 3 of section 29. I do not have the slightest idea where "and committed" could possibly fit in so I am at a loss as to how to deal with this amendment. Amendment No. 8 just says, "In page 18, lines 21 to 24 deleted." The same is true of amendments Nos. 9 and 12 and a whole lot more. Because we have the Bill as passed by the Dáil, they are already deleted, as I understand it, so we do not actually know where they fit in. I am not sure what the way around this is.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">These amendments relate to the use of the term "intimate and committed relationship". They are Dáil amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 18 and 19. Senators will recall that during the debate on the Bill in this House, concerns were raised about the use of the term "intimate and committed relationship" in the provisions that specify who may apply for orders under the Bill. The background to the matter is that section 60 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 introduced access to domestic violence orders for persons living together in intimate and committed relationships. These replaced the provisions in the Domestic Violence Act 1996 that applied to persons living together as husband and wife. The intention was that same-sex couples who are not civil partners would have the same access to the protections of the 1996 Act as opposite sex unmarried couples. The wording was taken from the definition of cohabitant in section 172 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. The term "intimate and committed relationship" was framed in order to provide a threshold to which the court must have regard in deciding whether to make an order. This matter was considered again, in consultation with the Attorney General, in the context of the Bill before the House. It would not be in the interests of victims of domestic violence if perpetrators could try to avoid having orders made against them by arguing that the relationship was not committed because, for example, of their sexual activity with a third party or because the victim of violence had previously sought to end the relationship. This is particularly relevant to safety orders in view of the fact that section 6(1)(a) will remove the cohabitation requirement for couples who are not married or who are not in civil partnerships.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> Dáil amendments Nos. 3, 4, 5, 18 and 19 provide that the term "intimate and committed relationship", where it appears in the Bill, will be amended and the words "and committed" deleted. Dáil amendment No. 2 inserted a new subsection (3) into section 2 to ensure protection for victims of domestic violence who are or were in an intimate relationship which is no longer sexual in nature. Subsection (3) makes it clear that a relationship does not cease to be an intimate relationship for the purposes of this Bill by reason only that it is no longer sexual in nature. The text of the new provision is drawn from section 172(3) of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.</p>

          <p eId="para_356">I welcome the Minister. I am very happy that so many of the debates we had in the Seanad were reflected in the shaping of this Bill. For example, I am particularly happy that the crime of coercive control, which was debated in this House, is contemplated under the Bill. It is a credit to the Minister and his Department that he engaged on all of those issues and that they are now reflected in a stronger Bill which will do good work for people in Ireland. One of the issues we debated that was of particular importance to me was my concern regarding the phrase "intimate and committed" and how it might be used. The Minister was not in a position to accept amendments in the Seanad but I am very happy that he took those concerns on board and consulted the Attorney General. The end result is that the content of those amendments is now reflected in the Bill. It is very important, particularly in situations where a relationship may serve as a consideration in sentencing, for example, as an aggravating factor, that there should not be any ambiguity or any potential for debate on the question of the commitment status of a relationship. The Minister has addressed that issue. People will have different perceptions. We have to also consider violence that might be occasioned by former partners. This really helps to address and clarify the issue. I am glad the relevant term has been deleted.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> I also welcome a measure added in the Dáil, which we had not discussed in detail in the Seanad, namely, the clarification that, for the purposes of the legislation, an intimate relationship does not cease on the basis that it is no longer sexual in nature. The Bill recognises that an intimate relationship - and, indeed, a relationship in which coercive or controlling behaviour may be taking place - is not necessarily one which requires ongoing cohabitation or an ongoing sexual relationship. It can last even when new relationships have been formed by one of the parties. This is a very positive strengthening of the Bill and it is indicative of the collaborative approach taken. Those who are seeking safety, security and support from the State will be grateful for all of these changes and for the openness the Minister has shown in taking them on board.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I welcome these additional amendments. In the context of what Senator Higgins just said, I recall a couple of battles here - I believe we won them by vote - when the Government opposed what we were doing. It entertained me greatly to see Government spokespersons on the television afterwards wallowing in the approval that was given and taking credit for it. I thought their performance was majestic.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> Amendment No. 2 is very good. For the avoidance of doubt, a relationship does not cease to be an intimate relationship for the purposes of this legislation by reason only that it is no longer sexual in nature. I can speak from personal experience here. I had a relationship with an Israeli citizen, Mr. Ezra Yitzhak Nawi, for many years, and it was only sexual for the first three years. We continued to share an apartment in Jerusalem, to make meals together, to go on holidays together and to go for walks together. It was an intimate and loving relationship. The sexual element just evaporated. I am glad to say there was no domestic violence but, of course, in these situations there could easily have been. It is very important that the Bill is extended to cover these, and I welcome the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I welcome the Minister. I acknowledge the presence earlier of his predecessor, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, who have both done so much work on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> I agree with Senator Conway-Walsh that it is important that we move swiftly through the remaining Stages, although there are some important issues in these amendments. I want to express my support for them. I acknowledge the work of Safe Ireland and its support for the amendments, which clearly strengthen the Bill. In particular, I welcome the tightening up of the phraseology around intimate relationships, along with the specific new provision that Senator Norris has spoken about, which I think will assist victims and survivors of abuse within intimate relationships. I refer to the new provision that a relationship does not cease to be intimate merely because it is no longer sexual in nature. That is very worthwhile. As the Bill has gone through lengthy debates in this House and the other House we have made numerous improvements to it, to strengthen protection for victims and survivors generally. I will limit my remarks to that. I support the amendments in the groups put forward from the Dáil, and I hope we will have an opportunity to briefly address the Bill in its entirety at the conclusion of the debate. </p>

          <p eId="para_365">Group 3 includes Dáil amendments Nos. 8 and 13. These relate to arrangements for out-of-hours sittings of the District Court in urgent cases. Senators will recall that a new section relating to out-of-hours barring orders was inserted on foot of an amendment tabled by Senators Black and Ruane on Committee Stage. That new section, which was section 10 in the Bill as passed by the Seanad, provided that An Garda Síochána may communicate with an on-call judge to apply for an out-of-hours barring order. My Department, in consultation with the Courts Service, An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, examined the new section to see what improvements and adjustments would be needed to ensure that the provision is legally clear and will be workable by An Garda Síochána and the Courts Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> A new section 24 was inserted by Dáil amendment No. 13 to provide for the arrangement of out-of-hours District Court sittings. It provides that a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant may request the Courts Service to arrange a special sitting of the District Court for the purposes of an out-of hours application for an interim barring order, protection order or emergency barring order. The section goes on to provide that the Courts Service may, with the consent of a judge of the District Court, arrange such special sittings of the District Court in the relevant District Court district as may be necessary in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> This new section will apply to applications for interim barring orders, protection orders and emergency barring orders. It would not be limited only to cases where a Garda attends an incident. It is also broad enough to include cases where a victim of domestic violence walks into a Garda station and seeks assistance. The new section would replace section 10 of the Bill as passed by the Seanad. Dáil amendment No. 8 provides for the deletion of that section. </p>
          <p eId="para_368"> In presenting this section, I acknowledge the contribution of Senators Ruane and Black, who brought forward the amendment in this House. I hope that what we have done accords with the import of their view. I know we changed the wording somewhat but my view is that we changed it for the better and I hope it meets the Senators' approval. I acknowledge their contribution in that regard. </p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T15:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_369">I thank the Minister for being here this afternoon. I wish to start by welcoming the Domestic Violence Bill 2017 back into the Seanad. It is progressive, strong and wide-ranging legislation that sends a signal to domestic violence victims in Ireland that the State will act and intervene on their behalf to safeguard their dignity and safety and that of their children. I compliment the Minister on shepherding this Bill through the Oireachtas and on how receptive he and his Department have been to open engagement on it, especially during its Seanad Stages. I am incredibly proud of the Bill. It is something that is very close to my heart. It is a testament to the Minister's work and that of his officials, so I congratulate him on that. I am proud to have played a part in improving it, along with my colleagues across the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> Amendments Nos. 8 and 13 relate to the issue of access to emergency barring orders outside of normal court sitting hours. We debated this issue extensively on Committee Stage and I thank all those who supported the proposal put forward by Senator Ruane and me to insert section 10 into the Bill. We felt that timely access to barring orders for victims of domestic violence in the middle of the night or at weekends had to form part of this major reform of this area of law. That was the spirit in which our proposal was tabled. These are often the times when people most need urgent help and we have to be aware of that. I appreciate the engagement of the Minister and the constructive proposal outlined in amendment No. 13, which will allow for a special sitting of the District Court for such orders to be issued. While I recognise that this will allow for the orders to be issued outside of hours, which is welcome, I wish to express some disappointment, as this is not what Senator Ruane and I envisaged in our original amendment. It is a step back from what was initially proposed and agreed by this House. If a barring order cannot be issued on the spot by an on-call judge by electronic means, every practical and procedural step required for a special sitting of the court, including transport, legal preparation and a wide variety of other issues is a potential danger to a victim of domestic violence, no matter how soon it can happen outside of hours. </p>
          <p eId="para_371"> That said, after reviewing the Safe Ireland legal briefing on this issue during the debate on this section on Committee Stage in the Dáil, I recognise and accept the legal issues that could arise when these orders are issued <i>ex parte</i> and based only on hearsay evidence. I also recognise the drafting issues referenced by Deputy O'Callaghan during the debate and I thank him for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> As a result, Senator Ruane, who would love to have been here but cannot make it, and I will accept the Minister's proposal on the issue and will not oppose amendments Nos. 10 and 13. We recognise the Minister has made a considerable effort to meet our concerns and those of Safe Ireland, which we really do appreciate. </p>
          <p eId="para_373"> All I ask is that this area is kept under close scrutiny when the Bill is enacted, that significant resources are put into making these special sittings accessible to victims outside of hours and if issues arise, that we come back quickly with reforms and legislative change. Many thanks are due to the Minister for his assistance and engagement on this issue. He has done an incredible job. We can all be collectively proud of the Bill and I commend it to the House. </p>

          <p eId="para_375">I thank Senator Black for her remarks. I do not wish to delay the House but I do wish to record something of a response in respect of the disappointment that she expresses on the matter of electronic applications. There really is a difficulty there, although of course we will review it in light of ongoing and further developments, because this is an evolving body of law. The interests of justice demand that the court has an opportunity to assess the demeanour of the applicant for any order, and for this to be done on a face-to-face basis. This is particularly important in cases where applications are made on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, with only one side being present. I cannot see how it could be considered appropriate or proportionate to allow application for a barring order by telephone or email, given the seriousness of the consequences for the person being barred from his or her property. That is a reality of everyday life. Allowing applications to be made by telephone or on foot of an email, where it would be difficult to verify the identity of the applicant, could give rise to very serious legal consequences. However, I take what Senator Black has said into account. We will have further opportunities to examine this in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> I will move rather speedily to group 4. These amendments relate to the service of orders under the Bill by An Garda Síochána. Senators will recall a new section, subsection (3) was inserted into section 19 on Seanad Committee Stage on foot of an amendment tabled by Senator Norris and others. The new subsection provides for the service of orders by An Garda Síochána. My Department, in consultation with the Courts Service, An Garda Síochána and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, examined the new provision to see what improvements and adjustments might be needed to the text. Dáil amendment No. 10 therefore inserted a new subsection into section 19 to provide that a court may direct personal service of an order by An Garda Síochána. That will apply in cases where the respondent was not present when the order was made and where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she may evade service or where there is any other good and sufficient reason to direct that the order be served by a garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> It should be noted that section 19 provides that if a respondent is present in court when the order is made, he or she will be taken to have been notified at that stage of the existence of the order. Dáil amendment No. 9 provides for the consequential deletion of subsection (3).</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> In group 5, Dáil amendments Nos. 16 and 21 relate to the application of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 and to proceedings for offences under the Bill. Section 34, as passed by the Seanad, provided that certain sections of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 would apply also to criminal proceedings for the breaching of a domestic violence order. Senators will recall that section 30 of the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act 2017, which was enacted after publication of the Domestic Violence Bill, provides for substantial amendment of Part 3 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992 which related to special protective measures for the giving of evidence by victims and witnesses in criminal proceedings for violent sexual offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> Dáil amendment No. 21 inserted a new section to amend section 12 of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, which defines the relevant offences to which Part 3 of that Act applies. This new section will ensure that all of the protective measures of Part 3 of the 1992 Act will apply in criminal proceedings for the offences of breaching a domestic violence order, or coercive control or in respect of forced marriage. Dáil amendment No. 16 provides for the consequential deletion of section 34.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> Group 6 amendments relate to Part 4, which will replace the reference to the Domestic Violence Act 1996 in existing legislation with references to the corresponding provision in this Bill. Since this Bill was published the Mediation Act and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act have both been enacted. Dáil amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are technical amendments which replace the references in those Acts to the 1996 Domestic Violence Act, with reference to this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> Dáil amendment No. 22 provides for the amendment of Schedule 3 to the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. Schedule 3 was inserted by section 29 of the Criminal Justice (Spent Convictions and Certain Disclosures) Act 2016. This sets out a list of offences that are excluded from the application of section 14A of the 2012 Act. Section 14A provides for circumstances in which certain convictions are not required to be disclosed in relation to Garda vetting. The offences listed in Schedule 3 are offences which would give rise to a bona fide concern that a person could pose a threat to a child or vulnerable person. The offence of breaching an order under the Domestic Violence Act 1996 is listed in section 3 and Dáil amendment No. 22 proposes to add the corresponding offence under this Bill and also new offences of forced marriage and coercive control. These amendments are merely to ensure there is not any conflict, contradiction or lack of certainty with other pieces of legislation which have gone before it and also to acknowledge the enactment since the publication of the original Bills of the Mediation Act and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Act.</p>

          <from>Senator Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_382">I thank the Minister for coming to the House today to discuss this Bill. I also thank Deputy Frances Fitzgerald who started our journey in taking this most important Bill through this House and the other House. In addition, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, for his interest and willingness to work with all of us to get the Bill to be the best that it can possibly be. I acknowledge the work of all of my colleagues in the Seanad and in the Dáil. I also acknowledge the great work of SAFE Ireland, the rape crisis centres, Women's Aid and all of the other front-line services which have worked so hard to bring this Bill together. Above all, I thank the women who have shaped this Bill because, mostly, the Bill has been shaped by women who have experienced domestic or sexual violence. I also remember the women who have died violently in this country in recent years, and their families, today.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> Like many others, I have waited for a very long time for this Bill to be processed through the Houses because, like them, I recognise that domestic violence is a crime - one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed. It always has been a crime but the difference this Bill will make is that coercive, controlling and abusive behaviour perpetrated against an intimate partner will be a crime as well. That gives me some assurance that women and children will be safer as a result of the Bill, and not only women and children but also men. I acknowledge the increasing number of men who come to me who are experiencing violent and abusive behaviour. The Bill will protect people in all such situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> The success of this Bill is dependent on two things. One is that it is enacted as quickly as possible and that the details within the Bill permeate right through the system. Training must be provided for the Garda and also for judges so that everybody is absolutely aware of what the Bill means and how it can protect people in the future from the crime of domestic violence. That must be done immediately. Of course, in order to do that the Bill must be underpinned by resources. There needs to be a re-examination of all the cuts to front-line services that were made during the years of austerity in particular. That is not to say that there is not austerity now but severe cuts were made to front-line services such as community development projects and family resource centres and they need to be re-examined. The Bill must be underpinned with real finances in order to do the job in terms of the training and supports that are required for women.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> I encourage more women and men to come forward. There is no need to lead a life of abuse and violence, which has meant lives have been cut short. I have no doubt the Bill will save lives. The Bill is just a step in the right direction. There are many other things that we need to do. We need an all-island approach to domestic violence. I urge the Minister to examine the issue. Clare's law was recently passed in the North. It is a fantastic law which allows women to find out if their partner has a history of abuse. If a person is concerned about his or her sister, friend or somebody else who is close to him or her, it is possible to find out that information. Again, that makes people safer. I thank the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#ColetteKelleher" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_386">I welcome the Minister to the House. Today is a very good day for women, children and men, including young men and all those affected directly or indirectly by the horror of domestic violence. It is not always a matter of the person at the receiving end; it is also about the child looking on and learning terrible lessons for life. As a result of this ground-breaking Bill, soon to become law, homes and the places where domestic abuse and violence take place will be off limits. Those who commit these dreadful, horrible, life-limiting, life-threatening acts will be clear that they are committing a crime and are now on notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> As a result of this legislation, Ireland will be a safer place. All credit is due to Safe Ireland for its campaigning, guidance and wisdom in bringing the legislation to where it is today. It was inspired by the women it represents and the horrific stories it was told and it knew something had to be done. The women of Safe Ireland with whom I and others were proud to work inspired us in turn. Shauna is here today. I thank Catriona Gleeson, Caroline Counihan, Sharon O'Halloran and Simone George, in particular. They are amazing women. They worked with us, as legislators from all parties and none, from spring into summer and then into the autumn and winter. It felt like a long haul at times. We formed a great team. I must thank, in particular, Mr. Pádraig Rice and Mr. Aengus Ó Maoláin for their hard work and dedication in producing this Bill. I also thank Charlotte Simpson.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Safe Ireland was inspirational and an absolute privilege to work with. I acknowledge the work of Women's Aid and the National Women's Council of Ireland. I acknowledge the good work done in the Seanad to improve and strengthen the Bill. Working together collegially, we introduced important measures to an already good Bill. We worked hard so the Bill would include the offence of coercive control, recognising the undermining and unrelenting chipping away of a person by controlling and manipulative behaviour, gaslighting, making victims doubt themselves, isolating victims and cutting them off from their friends and family, monitoring a partner's telephone use and interactions, and slowly and deliberately destroying a person, most often by destroying a woman's confidence and freedom to be herself. That this kind of heinous, controlling behaviour is now an offence is momentous. This is a huge cultural shift regarding what is and what is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Another important provision in the Bill that we fought hard for in this House will ensure an intimate relationship between victim and perpetrator must be regarded as an aggravating factor in sentencing for a wide range of offences. There is welcome recognition in the Bill that an intimate relationship applies when people are not cohabiting and not having a sexual relationship. Statutory guidelines for making judgments on domestic violence, crimes and offences and their punishment are also welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I particularly thank Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, who was so pivotal and central in getting the ball rolling with this legislation and shepherding it. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, especially also and, of course, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan, and his officials for being open to persuasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Let us remember again why this domestic violence legislation is so important and needed. In 2016, there were approximately 3,500 incidents of physical abuse against women in the domestic environment. An EU study in 2014 reported that 14% of women in Ireland had experienced physical violence by a partner since they attained the age of 15. Up to 6% of Irish women had experienced sexual violence by a current or former partner and 31% of Irish women, or a third, had experienced psychological violence by a partner; hence it is so important to establish coercive control as an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> It is worth noting that since 1996, when the first domestic violence legislation was introduced, 216 women have died violently. Up to 63% of those women died in their own homes. Where there was a determination of culpability, 56% of these women were murdered by a partner or an ex-partner. Another 32% were killed by someone they knew. Therefore, domestic violence in all its forms - psychological, physical and life ending - is a real and present threat. That is why this law is so urgently needed. All credit is due to the Government for acting with speed to put it in place to protect all those whose very lives could depend on it. We look forward to this Bill being signed into law by the President of Ireland, commenced and enacted. The Bill's becoming law takes us one step closer to ratifying the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, better known as the Istanbul Convention. In 2015, the then Minister of State, Senator Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, signed the convention. The passing of this Bill means we are one step closer to ratifying it, thereby adding our names to the 30 countries that have already done so, including Germany, France and Denmark. Iceland ratified in April and Croatia is very nearly there. We do not want to be in the company of countries that lag behind, such as Hungary. Ratifying the Istanbul Convention is important because it means an independent expert group will monitor the implementation of all the articles in the convention. States are legally bound by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> It was a proud moment for me last week when I was able to say publicly at the Council of Europe that we were close to passing very progressive domestic violence legislation and that Ireland would be soon in a position to ratify the Istanbul Convention. I understand from the Minister's speech in the Dáil last week that only one more legislative action is required to enable ratification of the convention, namely, the Bill on extraterritorial jurisdiction for certain offences. I would like to know when the Minister plans to publish this legislation. Can he make a commitment that the Istanbul Convention will be ratified by the end of this year, making 2018 a truly great year for all those experiencing domestic violence, in whatever form? It would make Ireland a much safer place.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">I will just make a few brief comments to note the passage of the legislation. It is ground-breaking. I commend the Minister and his officials who worked so hard on it over a lengthy period. I commend the Minister's predecessor, former Minister Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, on her pioneering work in steering this legislation into the Oireachtas initially. As others have said, there has been a great deal of legislative scrutiny and legislative improvement as the Bill has passed through both the Seanad and the Dáil. I commend all my colleagues involved in this, particularly Senator Colette Kelleher, who really did so much to co-ordinate our efforts in the Seanad to ensure the legislation was strengthened and improved as it passed through. The Senator has expressed very eloquently the really pressing need for this legislation in terms of the impact of so-called domestic violence or violence in an intimate setting on so many women across Ireland, including, very tragically, the women who died at the hands of partners or former partners. We are all very mindful of the really serious nature of the abuse, assault and criminal activity that we are seeking to deal with in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> I very much welcome the creation of the new offence of coercive control, which we debated extensively in this House, the identification of an intimate relationship as an aggravating factor in sentencing, and the fact that we will now have a list of factors and circumstances for judges to take into account in determining applications for a domestic violence order. The latter was a crucial provision that many of us sought.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> I welcome very much the procedural changes we have brought in through the legislation. I refer to the restrictions on cross-examination of a person, the power to hear evidence by video link and the power to hold breach hearings <i>in camera</i>. All of us will recognise the improvements these measures and others will make in practice for the very many women and others experiencing domestic violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> I look forward to working in the future to ensure the implementation of the legislation and to ensure we will meet our commitments under the Istanbul Convention so we can ratify it. I echo what Senator Kelleher said in this regard. I thank the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, for their commitment on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_399">On behalf of the Fine Gael Senators in the Seanad, I would like to commend the Minister in the first instance for being the person who has committed to ensuring we got to the stage. I pay tribute to the former Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for her significant role in this and also to our colleague and current Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton. Even when the Minister of State was Chairman of the Oireachtas committee, he had done significant preparatory work on this issue in terms of bringing in the stakeholders, hearing their stories and producing the report, which was important at the time. I was a member of the committee with Senator Ivana Bacik and others, and very important work was done. I also pay tribute to our former colleague, Tony Mulcahy.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Sometimes, during the legislative process, people give testimony. All of us in the justice committee will remember Tony Mulcahy's personal testimony at the time. I was in contact with Tony last week. He is very pleased that we have reached this day. On this important day, I want to remember his contribution here. </p>
          <p eId="para_401"> We have done tremendous work in this House to enhance the Bill. I wish to pay tribute to everyone who played various roles on this, including Senators Kelleher and Bacik. There is no point in naming everyone, they will know the work they did. It was a collaborative effort. It is an important example of why the Seanad should not have been abolished. Great work has been done since the referendum. We are always looking for ways of improving but sometimes it is good to acknowledge the positive, extremely important contribution that the Seanad continues to make in improving legislation. I have no doubt that the legislation that we are passing today would not have the strength, depth or effectiveness, were it not for the contribution made by Members of Seanad Éireann. It is a great day. I congratulate the Minister and everyone involved.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">I believe my colleague, Senator Kelleher, already spoke very eloquently and covered all the points. There is a suite of measures. Even since the Bill passed through the House, new areas and measures have evolved in the experience of women in particular and victims of violence, including intimate and sexual violence, which is passing through the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Progressive and strong as it is, I think we all recognise that this legislation may need to be further amended in future to strengthen and reflect the review being undertaken in this area, for instance. I wish to echo the point on training which will be fundamental to ensuring that when this legislation is enacted it has a meaningful effect. I also wish to add to the point on resources. I echo Senator Conway's point. This is an example of in-depth collaboration between civil society groups, which have already been named, and legislators from all parties across the House. At times the Government worked with us, and resisted at others, although it later took the relevant points on board. It could serve as an example to other Departments on how it is important to listen and recognise that good ideas and improvements can come from all sides of the House. I hope we can put in place the resources and training that will create an environment that will make this legislation effective, meaningful and ensure it has full effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> I thank the Minister and commend the passing of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group, and especially our leader, Senator Catherine Ardagh, our spokesperson on justice Senator Lorraine Clifford-Lee, and on my own behalf, having followed the debate with great interest although I did not contribute, I welcome the passing of the Bill. I compliment the Minister for steering it through, as I compliment his predecessor, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton on the part they played. I commend my Seanad colleagues from all parties, particularly those from the Independent group, and the women of the House. Notwithstanding the valid point made by Senator Conway-Walsh, the legislation is primarily important from the perspective of women. It is another step in the right direction for bringing about equality for women. We have shamefully treated women in this country as second-class citizens. The big debate of the day on cervical smear tests raises further concerns. We have a long way to go but this is an important step forward and I commend the Bill.</p>

          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_406">I commend all Members of the House for their participation in this very important legislation. I commend the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on his engagement, for listening and stewardship. It is important that, as Senator Higgins said, it is a single piece in the jigsaw but it sends out a very clear message from the country's Parliament. It addresses the needs of women and children primarily, but as Senator Conway-Walsh noted, it also affects men which we should not forget. There is a duty on us to work collaboratively with all the organisations. I want to pay tribute to Noeline Blackwell for her work. It is also important to recognise former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, for what she did in her time in the Department. It is important to pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Flanagan. It would be easy for a Minister immersed in a Department with a list of controversies or issues, to put such a Bill to one side, but he did not do that. He prioritised it, for which I thank him.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> As a society, we need to look at this issue in the context of our national relationship with alcohol, addiction and gambling and how we can improve mental health. Senator Conway was correct in commending former Senator Tony Mulcahy on his bravery and his immersion in the Bill when he was a Member of the previous Seanad. I thank him. It was the personal stories such as Tony's and also of so many women that helped to shape minds and bring about change. I thank the officials in the Department. They are often criticised but they also deserve credit. Senator Conway was correct that this is a good day. The Oireachtas delves into legislation and makes positive changes. I thank all Members of the House. We can put aside our political difference on other issues, this is something that unites us. We may have a different approach in how to get to the end, but we are united in our aim to improve the lives of our citizens and, in this case, primarily women and children. </p>

        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_408">I will speak very briefly to add my words commending all those who have been mentioned, including the Minister and his predecessors and their officials, who have brought a very positive and co-operative frame of mind to this process, which predates my own involvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I echo the remarks made by Senators Buttimer and Conway-Walsh that this is an issue which also impacts on men, and there must be a space for their voices in this debate. We have a particular role. I have noted with great respect and deference the leading role played by our women colleagues in this House, something that is not unique to this legislation and is probably the case with most items that come before the Seanad, but I have found this a learning experience. I found it informative and at times an emotional process, given the subject. If, in the course of outworking this legislation, we accept and concede that the vast majority of victims of domestic violence, intimidation, abuse and harassment are women, then we must also recognise that the vast majority of perpetrators are men. That is why I think male colleagues' powerful contributions and interventions on the debate in this House are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Like any other legislation, as welcome and significant as its passage is, it is worthless unless we can make a tangible difference to the lives of the women and other victims. We need to continue to work in the collaborative and proactive way that we have through the Stages in this House. As this now plays out in broader society, we need to recommit and rededicate ourselves to keep a watching brief on this issue and keep alert to it. As Senator Higgins rightly said, we need to work with our colleagues in the NGOs to ensure we face down the issue of domestic violence. We need to use whatever influence we can in supporting victims. We need to use the full rigour of the law to bring those responsible before the courts.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">I would. It gives me great pleasure not to open up the debate, but to close the debate on this important legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I reiterate my appreciation to Senators for their contributions and constructive engagement during the various Stages of the Bill. In particular I highlight this afternoon's contributions by Senators Norris, Conway-Walsh, Kelleher, Higgins, Conway, Ó Donnghaile, Buttimer and Ned O'Sullivan. This is one of the most important items of legislation to come before the Oireachtas this year. I know we are all pleased that we have reached the point where the Bill is about to be passed by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I do not suppose there is any criminal or family law legislation enacted in the past two decades that does not have the fingerprints of Senator Bacik on it and this is no different. She continues to make a valuable contribution along with everybody else, in ensuring we acknowledge that domestic violence can have devastating physical, emotional and financial consequences for victims, as well as society as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> Protecting and supporting victims has been a key priority for the Government. The enactment of the Domestic Violence Bill is a key part of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The Bill will allow us to proceed further on the important issue of ratifying the Istanbul Convention, as Senator Kelleher mentioned. I want to see the convention ratified as a priority. The Bill will help us meet many of the requirements of the convention. A final piece of the legislative jigsaw will be a short technical Bill dealing with extraterritorial aspects.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Yesterday I received Government approval for the heads of the criminal justice (Istanbul Convention) Bill. It is my hope that this legislation can be advanced quickly. I would be happy to keep Seanadóirí fully informed and briefed. I hope we can have early publication and consequent debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I was pleased to ensure that from 1 January the financial contribution required from applicants for civil legal aid in domestic violence cases in the District Court was removed. This practical change will help ensure that victims of domestic violence feel confident about turning to the courts and it removes a possible barrier to access to justice. Senator Conway-Walsh is right in saying that now that we have passed the Bill, we need to ensure that people are informed about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Senator Conway-Walsh also mentioned an all-island approach and I agree. The Senator will know that I do not have an opposite number with whom to engage in Northern Ireland. I dare say the Senator and her party can probably do a bit more than I can about the restoration of the Executive in Northern Ireland to ensure that there is a justice Minister in Northern Ireland with whom I would really like to have a very early and important meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, and the former Tánaiste, Deputy Fitzgerald, who as Minister for Justice and Equality, made tackling domestic violence a personal priority. She published the general scheme in 2015, brought forward the published Bill last year, introduced it in the Seanad and joined us earlier this afternoon. I take this opportunity to say that throughout her life, Deputy Fitzgerald has worked to advance the cause of the vulnerable in society. She has been particularly active in advancing women’s rights as a social worker, as an advocate and more latterly, as an active and senior politician. She continues to do great work in that regard for which I thank her.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is an exceptional colleague and an invaluable help to me in our busy Department bringing an understated compassion and sincerity to the many challenging issues on his desk. In developing the Bill, my Department and my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, have engaged closely with groups who support victims of domestic violence. Many of those have been mentioned here today. I acknowledge the work being done by these organisations, some of whom I have met very recently, and their contribution in strengthening the provisions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> For too long, domestic violence has been seen primarily as physical abuse. The new offence of coercive control sends a clear, consistent message that non-violent control in an intimate relationship is criminal. The effect of such behaviour may be as harmful to victims as physical abuse because it is an abuse of the unique trust associated with an intimate relationship. If I omitted to mention Senator Black earlier, I want to acknowledge her great contribution in the changes we managed to bring about at her request - or dare I say at her insistence - on earlier Stages of the Bill. </p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Another important provision will ensure that an intimate relationship between victim and perpetrator must be regarded as an aggravating factor in sentencing for a wide range of offences. This new provision sends a message that society will no longer tolerate the appalling breach of trust committed by one partner against the other in an intimate context.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> I thank my officials in the Department of Justice and Equality, many of whom worked hard to ensure we got to this point in the spring of this year. In particular I highlight the senior officials, Greg Heylin and Tracy O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> This Bill, soon to be enacted, will help to improve the protection of the law for victims of domestic violence, as it puts the needs of victims first and foremost. Like all Seanadóirí here, I look forward to its enactment and implementation.</p>

        <speech by="#AnthonyLawlor" eId="spk_172">
          <from>Senator Anthony Lawlor<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_425">One of the things that stands out for me in regard to this Government is that, in my first week in the Dáil in 2011, we did not have a penny to spend and we could not afford a nail to hammer into a wall, whereas we are now talking about projects which will involve a capital spend of €116 billion. I welcome Project Ireland 2040. It is highly important that we plan for the future. Those of us who have spent time on the rugby field or coaching young people will understand the phrase, "Fail to plan, plan to fail". I very much welcome the fact the Government has put forward this project and the National Development Plan 2018-2027, as well as, in the agricultural sphere, the extension of Food Wise 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> While I am not going to talk about specific projects, I am fascinated by where the funding is coming from. The Government is proposing that €91 billion will come from Exchequer funds and the other €25 billion will come from semi-State companies and other sources. State-owned businesses that are not mentioned are the banks. Those of us who had their first six months in the Houses in 2011 will remember the State invested €10 billion in AIB and Bank of Ireland and had previously put €10.6 billion into those two banks. There is a lot of hoo-ha at present, particularly from the banking sector, that they should look to be set free and should be allowed run their businesses again. We currently own 71% of AIB and 14% of Bank of Ireland. Some €20 billion of what we invested was from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, at the time, I believed that fund should have been used for capital investment. There has been a capital deficit in this country since 2009 up to the arrival of this new national development plan for 2018 onwards. I very much welcome that plan and also the vision of Project Ireland 2040. The €20 billion we put into AIB and Bank of Ireland could have been used for capital projects, to keep the people who had to leave this country working here in the construction industry. That €20 billion could have saved us a lot of money on social welfare payments and it could have been used to make better investments in schools, hospitals and roads that we are now trying to catch up on. As a result of the economic crash, we have had a capital investment deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> I suggest, given our 71% and 14% ownership of those two banks, that we do not sell any further shares. My reasoning is that, as we invested €20.6 billion, we have to get that money back plus the foregone costs that are associated. Any banker will explain that if one has €20 billion to invest, one expects to make a profit. We should not be just getting that money back; we should be getting it back plus a profit, plus the foregone costs on social welfare payments and other payments the State and the taxpayer had to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I will make a suggestion which the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, might take on board. In the next couple of weeks the State will receive some €268 million from the dividends paid by AIB and Bank of Ireland. There is a small shovel-ready project in Naas, in my own area. Naas General Hospital has been looking for an endoscopic unit, it has planning permission ready and all of the enabling works have been done. It is looking for €16 million to complete the project. That €16 million will allow 1,200 people to come off the waiting list for endoscopy at Naas General Hospital. It will also allow increased capacity in the day ward, which will allow the hospital to increase its theatre capacity. That €16 million which is coming into the NTMA could be used to complete that endoscopic unit at Naas and the remainder of the €268 million could be used to build many primary schools throughout the country. I ask the Minister to consider what we are going to do with the dividends we are going to receive from the banks, and that we do not use them to pay down debt but use them for future capital projects, and also that we maintain ownership of the shares we have in both those banks.</p>

          <from>Senator John Dolan<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_429">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan. To get straight to the point, right now I would be calling this plan "Ireland 2040 - Our Plan minus 643,000 citizens with disabilities". There is not much, if any, consideration of them. Let me go through it. On the last day he spoke, the Minister of State said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_430">We want to see the country developed as a whole. We want to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to rear a family, have a home and job in their local area, and provide that opportunity for themselves and future generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">That is ambitious and optimistic. My concern is that it does not include people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Let us take the jobs issue. Some 31% of people with disabilities are in employment compared to over 70% of people who are not disabled. To take housing, the social housing list from the Department in 2013 was 3,919 but when it did its survey in 2016 it had gone up to 4,450, an increase of 14%. When we look at the housing adaptation grant, the level of grant is extremely low and the means regime then comes in and starts to shave that away. That is not fit for purpose to support people. If we think of young families where a child has been born with a physical condition, the family needs to be able to expand the home they have, or they will be looking to move. Some 1,200 young people with disabilities are in nursing homes who should be living independently or in some other kind of community facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> With regard to people with intellectual disabilities, it has gone the other way. Provision of accommodation for people with intellectual disabilities in the past ten years has decreased by almost 2.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Housing in accommodation provided by support funding has gone down by nearly 7%. The number of people with intellectual disabilities being supported by their family in a family home increased by almost 20% in that time. The trends are going against us; there are no two ways about it. </p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I will refer to transport. With Bus Éireann, one has to give two days' notice and one still cannot be sure of getting the right service. DART has a pilot scheme in Dublin which aims to bring the waiting time down to four hours. Irish Rail requires 24 hours' notice, and not one carriage on one train has its own accessibility functions. Rather than retrofitting, the company relies on manually operated ramps, and they are often forgotten. The availability of rural transport is a huge issue for everybody and there are also issues of accessibility. Do not get me started on taxis.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> People with disabilities are way down the list when it comes to the level of education that they have compared to their able-bodied peers. I am dealing with a case at the moment where a further education institute which I will not name actually said to a young woman in a wheelchair that it would not provide a hoist. The institution has accessible toilets. Its management did not consider that they should provide a hoist so that she could use those facilities. Considering jobs, transport, access, housing, poverty and education, we still have big issues, and I do not see any hope or succour in what I read in this plan. </p>
          <p eId="para_437"> In the early part of his presentation in this House during his previous appearance, the Minister of State said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_438">The plan is based on costed and prudent projections of growth for 2% over the period 2022 to 2027. That is important bearing in mind, and we have said this both here and elsewhere, the shocks that could potentially be out there on the horizon.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Let us be clear about one thing. There is no shock around the outstanding needs of people with disabilities in this country. I will make two points. The programme for Government committed to ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. That was done two months ago. Now it is time to get on with the work. There is no shock or surprise there. We have committed to getting on with the work. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, has estimated that our population increased by 4% from 2011 to 2016. The population of people with disabilities has increased by twice that. There are more people living with disabilities; people are living longer, and living with more severe disabilities. </p>
          <p eId="para_440"> On page 92, we find reference to disability services. The document notes that the NDP will continue to support the capital programme for the purchase and adaptation of houses. I have already outlined that the trend is going in the opposite direction. We are not keeping pace, never mind making improvements. </p>
          <p eId="para_441"> To conclude, demographics are going against us. The provisions made in this plan are very weak. Its provisions for housing will not keep us standing still, never mind moving forward. There is no reference to the UNCRPD and the whole raft of articles to do with housing, employment, transport, etc. I am sorry to say that, and I hope the Minister of State will be able to come back sooner rather than later to show us some ambition in this plan to make sure that over the next ten or 20 years things will be put right for people with disabilities. </p>

        <speech by="#PaulGavan" eId="spk_174">
          <from>Senator Paul Gavan<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_442">I would like to begin by genuinely welcoming the fact that we have reached a time in Irish politics where long-term strategic capital and infrastructural planning has become part of the political discourse. This in itself is a good development. For far too long, we have staggered from Government to Government and budget to budget, with Ministers expected to think short term in order to deliver for their own constituencies. Without a doubt, this has contributed to the imbalance in developments that we have seen across the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> In the same vein, it is essential that the national planning framework has broad cross-party support in order for its vision to be achieved by successive Governments. Sinn Féin welcomes several proposals in the plan, such as the commitment to the M20 motorway, and regionally speaking, the 96-bed unit in University Hospital Limerick. These initiatives represent the potential for progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> We are also fully supportive of the Government's decision to reinvest and revamp its capital spending, marking a distinct change of direction for this Government. In 2014, Ireland had the lowest level of public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, GDP, of the entire EU 28. Astonishingly, we repeated this feat in 2015. Such low levels of State investment in infrastructure are exactly why we have a housing and health crisis today. That is also why so many of the proposals in this plan are actually old projects that are overdue by a decade. I remember standing on a platform in Nenagh in 2009 calling for the 96-bed unit. It has taken ten years, but it is welcome. </p>
          <p eId="para_445"> We cannot simply see capital investment as low-hanging fruit to cut away and expect a country to stand still. It will in fact go backwards, which is what has happened to our infrastructure over the last decade. I support the Government's commitment to increase investment in this plan. However, I must also highlight the fact that Sinn Féin disagrees with how the Government intends to do this. Project Ireland 2040 essentially represents a commitment to the flawed, wasteful and expensive model of public private partnership, PPP. Whatever case could be made for PPPs as an emergency measure in the bad times is long gone. They enable the Government in the short term to dress up considerable amounts of public expenditure and put it off the balance sheet. PPPs are essentially an accounting anomaly that lead to the distortion of public debt. The evidence from Britain clearly shows that PPPs do not give value for money. The British National Audit Office recently reviewed three different Departments' use of public private partnerships, and found the PPP model to be consistently more expensive than the traditional procurement process. Its review found a PPP hospital to cost a staggering 70% more than a publicly-funded one and a bundle of schools to cost 40% more. Only three countries in the EU spend more on PPPs than Ireland as a percentage of GDP, namely, Britain, Hungary and Slovakia. Members will notice that two of those countries are governed by parties of the hard and far right. Everyone else seems to have copped on to the fact that they are a waste of money. </p>
          <p eId="para_446"> I cannot cite statistics in regard to the performance of PPPs in Ireland, because we do not have that information. The value for money tests which the State carries out on PPPs are not made public. The contracts are not made public. Post-project reviews are rarely carried out by the State, and not one single review has even been published. I wonder why that is. As of 2016, the Irish State was spending €225 million per year on public private partnerships. That figure is expected to reach €345 million by 2021, and to increase further to coincide with Project Ireland 2040.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Particularly with the collapse of Carillion, we need to take another look at the use of public private partnerships. Even putting their excessive cost aside, there is a real moral hazard here which can be exploited by the private market. Sinn Féin is of the view that the inclusion of PPPs in this plan is a major mistake, and I ask the Government to reconsider their inclusion.</p>

          <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_448">I welcome my colleague, Deputy O'Donovan, to the House to continue this important debate. While it is important that we look forward strategically, we must do so in the context of where we have come from in the last ten years. While we would have loved to see capital expenditure in this country, we have to look at the reality of where this country found itself in 2008. I remember coming in as part of a Government in 2011 when our unemployment figures were soaring and cutbacks were the order of the day. It is important to note in this context that the CSO today announced the April unemployment figures, which are now at 5.9%. That is huge progress, and I think we must acknowledge that, even though challenges remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> I also remember when the Action Plan for Jobs was announced during the last Government. That plan was rubbished by the Opposition at that time. We were told that it was unrealistic and that we could not achieve our targets. What has happened? We have exceeded all of those targets for employment figures and our economy is back to growth again. It is important, now that we are back to growth, that we manage it in a sustainable way. That is why this Government is doing what it is doing in outlining a strategic vision for our country over the next 20 years. Project Ireland 2040 is an overarching plan to steer Ireland in the right direction. Contained within it are growth priorities for our larger regional cities to counterbalance the unsustainable economic vortex that presently surrounds our capital city, Dublin. </p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Not only is there substantial provision for urban growth in our regional cities and towns, there are also clear support-based financial initiatives to support and sustain rural Ireland, which is important. This is what all the political parties and representatives have been demanding for the past several years. I believe that An Taoiseach and his Ministers have shown real courage by maintaining the integrity of the Project Ireland 2040 plan, and not giving way to demands that had the real potential to destroy the ability of the plan to deliver on its clear objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">They have also ensured that the plan is backed up by capital investment that will deliver infrastructure and the real tools and economic drivers for the regions to make sustainable activity happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> The Opposition parties are struggling to criticise the plan because it has been subject to deep consultation throughout the country. It is well thought out, makes good sense and is a good plan for our citizens and for Ireland. The plan has the real potential to succeed, unlike its predecessor, the national spatial strategy. The reason that plan failed, although well-intentioned at the time, was because it was interfered with politically. It was diluted and there was something for everyone in the audience. Just like the decentralisation plan that failed, it was destined to fail from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> It is important to note we must plan for the next ten to 20 years in a sustainable way. I welcome the fact new funds are being established, for example, the €2 billion urban regeneration and development fund, the €1 billion rural development fund, the €500 million climate action fund and the €500 million disruptive technologies fund. All of these funding streams will no doubt help rebalance the economy. However, I caution that, for a growing economy that is aspirational and ambitious, we will need housing, sustainable jobs and the skill set to meet that growing demand. Our schools and colleges have to be equipped and we need apprenticeships to ramp up rapidly to meet the demand. With regard to infrastructure, connectivity is very important for our regions. We need adequate access in terms of roads and broadband, and we need to interconnect our cities, which is why it is welcome we have new investment in motorways.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> In the case of Waterford, which is one of the cities identified to double in capacity, I argue we need to upgrade the N25 and the N24 linking the Minister of State's city, Limerick, with Waterford. The regional cities have to be connected so citizens can drive between them. We also need to upgrade the technological university in the south east and University Hospital Waterford, a regional hospital that serves a full region. There are also the ports and airports, as well as sports and recreation. The area with real potential is the north quays in Waterford city, a strategic development zone that is identified as a priority in the national plan, which I welcome. The funding stream for the redevelopment of the north quays must be clarified in terms of process and mechanism. I note that, on the announcement of Project Ireland 2040, it was stated that an overarching and oversight body would be set up to ensure that all Departments give the deserved priority to the growth of our cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> I wish the plan well and I fully support it. I look forward to proper engagement in the coming months as we set out on this plan that will sustain our country and its people for the next 20 to 30 years.</p>

        <speech by="#RobbieGallagher" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Senator Robbie Gallagher<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_456">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discus this important plan, Project Ireland 2040. The fact we have a plan is to be welcomed and we all appreciate and understand that a plan is needed. As the old adage goes: fail to plan, plan to fail. Unfortunately, this plan is a missed opportunity in many ways. As someone recently said to me on the street, "This Government amazes me because they can tell us what they are going to do in 20 years time but they cannot tell us what they are going to do with the major issues today, tomorrow and next week." There is a fair degree of truth in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Any development is welcome. However, of the €116 billion in development projects that are mentioned in the plan, €42 billion worth have already been announced and there is nothing new in them. The manner in which the Government used the plan to promote itself and the way the plan was presented to the Irish people in Sligo that weekend were regrettable. It ended up being a project for promoting the Government, rather than a project for 2040.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> When the draft plan came out, we discovered that if one was to draw a line from Dublin to Galway, there was no mention of any development north of that line. Thankfully, through the voices of opposition, including opposition from the Minister of State's party backbenchers, at the last minute changes were made to the plan which, to my mind, affects the credibility of the plan going forward. Again, it was a lost opportunity. Ultimately, this plan will be judged not on what it promises but on what it delivers. Unfortunately, when we look at promises made by this Government, whether in regard to broadband, housing or health, it would not inspire anyone with much confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Brexit is very much in our focus at present and more space and credibility should have been given to that. None of us at this point know what our island will look like post-Brexit, when the UK leaves. The promotion of the plan at this time is a mistake and we could have benefited from stalling it. We have to look at the all-island context and, as I said, the fact we do not know what the country will look like following Brexit means this is another lost opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> With regard to some of the projects outlined, I will talk about how they impact my constituency, in particular the Monaghan area. I note some which are listed as new projects date back a decade or even longer. The N2-A5 project was mentioned but it has been mentioned since the Good Friday Agreement was signed over 20 years. Similarly, the Ulster Canal project has been around for a long time. The refurbishment of a number of buildings located at St. Davnet's campus in Monaghan town had been mentioned up to two years ago. A primary care unit for Monaghan has also been mentioned but that was first mooted 15 years ago, when I was a member of the town council, and it was presented to the people of Monaghan as some kind of a consolation prize for the hospital being taken off call. Not one block has been laid at that development. I am sure the Minister of State will agree it is hard to have confidence in this plan when these announcements are presented as new.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> There are also missed opportunities in the region I represent. One concerns the east-west link which would connect Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Roscommon with Dundalk. There is no mention of that road. Again, I believe it is a mistake because Dundalk has been recognised as a growth centre for the region and the future of those counties will lie in their proximity to and connectivity with that location. The fact it is not mentioned is regrettable. From a Monaghan perspective, the Monaghan-Dundalk main road is very poor. We have been looking to get it upgraded because many students from the region travel the route daily, as well as people going to work. We welcome the announcement this week of 400 jobs for Dundalk by a Chinese consortium. Again, however, connectivity with that centre for the people of Cavan, Leitrim and Monaghan needs to be improved. The Minister of State might keep in mind those issues going forward.</p>

        <speech by="#MauraHopkins" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Senator Maura Hopkins<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_462">I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber to resume the discussion on Project Ireland 2040. When Senator Coffey made his contribution, I was very much reminded of mistakes that I am aware of in County Roscommon with regard to poor planning. I live very near an unfinished housing estate that is a terrible legacy of the Celtic tiger.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">It involves houses that were poorly built, ten of which were knocked down, using resolution funding, at a cost of €250,000. Also included were houses built where there was no joined-up thinking on where people would work or how they could be part of a community. I never want to see mistakes like that repeated. It is very much a wake-up call. We need to plan properly to ensure we have houses of good quality built in the right places. We need to plan for excellent infrastructure and good employment opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> I was one of those who expressed considerable concern over the draft national planning framework in regard to the importance of including regional hubs. I was very happy to see the inclusion of Athlone and Sligo in the final Project Ireland 2040 plan. It is critical that we have regional hubs to support more balanced regional development and, in the case of the west and north west, offset the pressure on Galway city. When I say that, I speak about a visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, to Ballinasloe last Friday week. Ballinasloe is a town with great potential. It has very good examples of excellent infrastructure. It has two exits off the M6. It has excellent community, sports and educational facilities. It has an IDA business park with excellent potential. Two flagship companies, Aptar and Surmodics Medical, are located there. Ballinasloe, however, needs to be properly supported by our agencies, including the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and local enterprise offices, to ensure some of the pressure on Galway city is offset. We do not want Ballinasloe to become a town of commuters working in Galway when it has excellent facilities and untapped potential in its IDA business park. The Minister of State, Deputy Breen, visited last Friday week in respect of an application made by a community group, Ballinasloe Area Community Development Company Limited, which has applied for planning permission for an advance facility. There should be more emphasis on this by the IDA and we should not be leaving it to community organisations to apply for planning permission. We certainly need more proactivity in respect of those employment agencies. The foundation for maintaining strong communities is access to employment. We need to work on the untapped potential in Ballinasloe.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> It is important that we see delivery on the M5. I acknowledge it is part of Project Ireland 2040. It is critical that there be capital investment in the N5 between Ballaghaderreen and Scramogue. In the term of the last Government, the Ballaghaderreen bypass was delivered. There are considerable challenges owing to unsafe roads and excessive volumes of traffic going through the likes of Frenchpark, Bellanagare, Tulsk and Strokestown. It is critical that there be investment to make our roads safer, reduce travel times and make us more efficient and capable of competing with other areas right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Similarly, businesses need reliable high-speed broadband to trade online, gain access to consumers, and market services and products. It is critical that rural broadband be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> I want to speak about the delivery of a rehabilitation unit for Roscommon hospital. This is mentioned in Project Ireland 2040. Some €7.85 million is being allocated for the project. It is critical that we see it delivered as quickly as possible. I know from having worked in the health services, particularly in the area of rehabilitation, that people need access to timely specialist rehabilitation. It will be very important to serve the people of the west and to act as a satellite centre of the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dún Laoghaire.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AliceMaryHiggins" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Senator Alice-Mary Higgins<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_468">Colleagues have spoken about many of the issues, and I will try to raise a new one. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O’Donovan, to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> We are considering long-term thinking, which is important and needed if we are to ensure we can plan for a collective future in Ireland and, importantly, situate ourselves within the collective challenges faced in Europe and the wider world. Therefore, the long-term thinking element is very welcome. There are areas where more joined-up thinking is needed. Some of the issues in this regard have been highlighted. We must ensure, while meeting the environmental targets set for 2040, that there is stronger thinking in terms of how we ensure they are fully reflected. We must ensure that we give ourselves the space to respond to what I hope will be strengthened targets at European level. The sustainable development goals comprise an example. Ireland took a lead within the United Nations in this regard to ensure those targets are really being reflected and that we place ourselves within the long-term collective project, not only nationally but also internationally. There could be strengthening in this area. The Minister of State should speak to how he envisages the plan responding in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> With regard to joined-up thinking, Senator Dolan spoke very eloquently about ensuring that we address issues that affect communities right across Ireland, not simply on a community basis but as a cohort. If 18% of the population have a disability, the needs of a substantial proportion need to be reflected in the plan. When we plan for population growth, we must look to the detail, including on family type, for example. A large number of households are now headed by a single parent. We must bear that in mind in a proper and meaningful way in our strategies, such as our housing strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> It is welcome that the plan recognises the importance of social infrastructure, as well as capital infrastructure. Social infrastructure is crucial to all parts of Ireland and it ensures the benefits of a growing economy are felt throughout Ireland. In this regard, I refer to intensive employment areas, such as care, including home care and childcare, or areas where we can ensure, if we invest properly, quality employment in every town.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> I recognise that the rural fabric has been spoken about in terms of hubs and employment. Various members have spoken about various parts of the country but a point that is cross-cutting, important and complementary, and on which the Minister of State will be working with the Minister, Deputy Ring, is that we must ensure we restore the community fabric that has been cut away. In our community development projects, for example, we have been very much focusing narrowly on employment recently. The capacity to work on other parts of the social fabric has been diminished. I refer to the community fabric, be it youth services or services for older people. These are part of what create a real development plan — a community development plan that reaches all parts of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Family resource centres have been mentioned by others. I echo the concern expressed strongly in the other House and at meetings of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection that citizen information services are being undermined by a current proposal involving narrowing. This needs to be examined. The services are how we connect people and address collective issues and collective rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> In the time I have left, I want to focus on just two specific issues, which concern not where the money is going but how projects are developed. I urge the Minister of State to genuinely take on board in the first instance the concerns expressed about public private partnerships. He should not dismiss them based on any ideological or other perspective but should look to the evidence and real concerns that exist. I refer, for example, to the kinds of contracts that were made for toll roads. We have been tied into contracts that have proved debilitating and which are at odds with meeting our climate change targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Another important limitation with public private partnerships is that they can diminish responsiveness either to new policy priorities that we identify together or to the innovation offered by community. That is the nature of a contract, and it is a concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> My final point is about procurement, which is a most important one for me and one on which I hope to have a specific debate with the Minister in the House. Perhaps he will indicate his agreement to that debate. If we are to spend €116 billion, can we ensure that every euro will be put to the maximum benefit of our people? Can we ensure that we will include and give weighting to social, environmental and community benefit criteria when we are issuing contracts? We must use the maximum space afforded to us under European procurement rules. I ask the Minister specifically to address the question of procurement. How do we apply joined-up thinking to procurement and how the money is spent? Will the Minister include a weighting for social benefit, good environmental practice and good employment practices so we can ensure that good employers and those who give back get these contracts? Will he also ensure that social clauses are used in how these are delivered, that is, going beyond the simple social clause of taking on the long-term unemployed and looking to the wider interpretation of social clauses? I hope the Minister will indicate a willingness to take a deeper look at how we spend the €116 billion to ensure a wider pool of benefit for everybody in Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_179">
          <from>Senator Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_477">I dtús, cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. This debate about Project Ireland 2040 is about the strategic vision we have for Ireland and, in my case, for Cork. Cork lies at the heart of Project Ireland 2040. I welcome the strong inclusion of Cork and the south in the plan and, as Senator Coffey correctly said, it is important that we focus on delivery of the objectives in the plan. It is extraordinary that the only criticism from Fianna Fáil is of the launch of the plan, not what it includes. The plan is about investing in the regions and putting in place the infrastructure Senator Dolan spoke about and for which we all advocate to deliver for the citizen. This plan is about the future of people and of place. In my case, it is Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> This is about planning and developing a sustainable city and county, with a new enlarged city and a new local government structure that will benefit the people in that enhanced city. The €116 billion of investment is about fostering growth beyond the M50. The majority of the plan relates to outside Dublin. In the case of Cork, it puts in place a strategic plan that is tangible and can be delivered by creating a growing city. There is new investment in roads, such as the M28, the M20, the N22 and the Dunkettle roundabout. I welcome the Taoiseach's comments about the MetroLink going through Na Fianna's grounds. I hope An Bord Pleanála will listen to them with regard to the N28 and the proposed motorway in its deliberations on the oral hearing and deliver an alternative to the residents and those of us who support them. We are not against the proposal but against the way in which it was foisted upon the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> The other important point in Project Ireland 2040 is what is deliverable for healthcare in the south of the country, including new hospitals and a new elective hospital. Senator Gavan spoke about International Workers' Day on the Order of Business and I am sure he will join me in welcoming the new hospitals for Cork. It is the first time a Government has planned to build new hospitals. That is important, along with culture and education. We also must have a conversation about mobility and a city centre movement strategy. I believe we must now develop the question of the relationship we have with the car and our future relationship with public transport. Part of the difficulty is that many of our towns and cities are of a different era when there was little population. Now there is growth and an increase in the use of cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> We saw that recently with the issue surrounding the mobility strategy for Cork city, under which cars were banned from Patrick Street after 3 p.m. We heard from the traders, who must be listened to, about the potential impact on business. Equally, however, we must examine the city centre movement strategy of the city council, in conjunction with TII, under the overarching concept of how we want our cities to look in the future. That also poses the question of how to combat online trading by our citizens given that we purchase an increasing amount online. How do we see our cities growing? For me, the island that is the city centre of Cork is an important and integral part of Cork. It is not about the suburbs <i>per se</i>, but the island and how we can get people to come into it. The plan for Cork city is ambitious. It is a great growth plan for the expansion of the city, and I welcome that. However, the existential question still remains as to what type of city we want, what relationship there will be between public transport and the car and how we can marry the growth of online activity with the traditional, old style shop in the middle of Cork city. That requires answers and engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The city of Cork is the place where economic activity prospers, and the plan is for growing communities within the city centre. Project Ireland 2040 is ambitious for Cork and I welcome that. It creates an alternative to Dublin which all of us want.</p>

        <speech by="#PatrickODonovan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Patrick O'Donovan)<recordedTime time="2018-05-02T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_482">I will try to respond to as many speakers as possible in the short time available to me, after both today's discussion and the debate on 7 March. Clearly, one can tell who has read the strategy and who has just read the newspaper articles about it. It is very obvious. Some people do not have a clue what is in the strategy, but that did not stop them coming in here or to the other House for the uncontrollable windbaggery that goes on in both Houses. They have not read it. That is obvious because they give the same old regurgitated stuff that comes from their press offices. It is really disappointing. I am sure everybody is busy but this is the most important document to be presented to the Houses of Oireachtas in this Dáil and probably in the next Dáil because it outlines what will be done for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> A Senator who is not present now talked about missed opportunities. The missed opportunity was the fact that this country went into free fall and bankruptcy because we ran out of people to whom we could sell houses. Now people talk about missed opportunities instead of putting up their hands, saying "<i>mea culpa</i>" and acknowledging that the reason nothing was done for the last five or ten years is that the State was essentially banjaxed. They might take some responsibility for that, but that does not happen. I am around here long enough to know that the day one sees people take responsibility for their actions in a previous Government is the day one will see red blackbirds, so it will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Then there are the usual perennial objections for the sake of objecting, whether it is about public private partnerships or whatever. I do not have an ideological issue with public private partnerships but I have an issue with looking back on public private partnerships and not naming the ones in which we should not have participated. Should we not have done Grangegorman, the refurbishment of the courthouses, the Garda stations or the Limerick to Galway road, all of which needed to be done? All of the other things were done at a time when we were very close to not being able to keep the country's doors open, and we were also able to keep industrial peace. Public private partnerships as an entity are not all bad. We have said we are going to review them and that will be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> I received much criticism on the last occasion, 7 March, from Members who obviously had not read the plan. I was accused of being non-Dublin centred. I specifically used my speech on the last occasion to identify some projects that were carried out in my region to encourage Members to look at what is in it for their regions. However, they fell into the usual trap of criticism for the sake of criticism.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">One Senator said to me on the previous occasion: "We need to be heard and the Minister of State needs to listen to us". Perhaps the Senator from that party might regret what she said because I listened to a lot of what she said. Much of it is the same as her previous leader said, namely, that the European Union should take its money, hive off and get out of town. Where would we be now if we had taken the advice of some people in this House and in the other House on how the economy was run from 2011 to 2016? As Senator Coffey said, we made mistakes and we are the first to admit that but for the first time since 2006 or 2007, unemployment is now below 6%. The people who are working are contributing to an economy that allows us to borrow, spend and invest money. We are not saying everything is right. I completely agree with Senator Dolan that it is totally disgraceful that a person has to give notice that they want to get on a train. That should not happen in 2018. He is correct that a plan must be put in place to make sure that is addressed but without capital, without a plan and without investment in semi-State companies - and without sound semi-State companies - one cannot do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The last night I was in the Chamber I had to laugh at the reference that was made to regurgitated announcements. The speaker then went on to name a road in County Mayo and she said she was delighted to learn it would be done. It is just like the reinvention of the Ballymagash town council.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> Reference was made in the debate today and on the previous occasion to the spending code. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform states specifically on page 100 of the plan that there will be adherence to the spending code. I mentioned the cases speakers have highlighted as missed opportunities, yet nobody could pick one item to remove from the plan. Not one person has suggested removing a project because they know it is politically toxic. They know there is €116 billion. They know that exhaustive consultation has been involved. They know the inputs from local authorities, State agencies and Departments. They know the value for money programmes will have to be met. They know the projects will have to be properly procured. Senator Higgins referred to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> I have no problem coming back into the Seanad. I love coming in and any time I get an invitation, I always come in. Senators need have no fear in that regard. In spite of that Members failed miserably, as they did in the other House, to mention just one thing they would take out. They seem to have decided instead to give out about the cover of the document and the launch date. That is pathetic. When one has to look at the balloons that were used on the day rather than the substance, it proves two things, first, that one did not read the plan and, second, that one does not know what is in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> The other thing that has surprised me is the obvious lack of knowledge that is still circulating on the difference between the national development plan and the national planning framework. They are two totally different things, which are being packaged together as Ireland 2040 for a reason, namely, to show that we are no longer going to make the mistakes of the past. Some people have missed the fact that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government produced the national planning framework, notified the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the line Ministries, who were then able to come up with projects on the basis of where people were going to live and the demands that would exist. It was not done on a nod and wink or a wing and a prayer. It is important that we take such an approach because we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. I do not remember who noted - it might have been Senator Hopkins - that we cannot have a situation in the future where we have glorious white elephants. To respond to Senator Higgins's point, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have discussed how we make sure that we put some sort of overarching programme in place to make sure that the delivery of the plan is in line with Government commitments and that there is proper oversight on spending, and that if something runs quickly into the sand that one would take it out and put on the brakes from the start. I was involved in project management in industry and I know that one could not run an industry in the same way as some public projects are run. We have to learn from the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> It was said that there was nothing relating to Brexit. I contest that point. It is just not true and it proves that the plan has not been read. One must look at the ambition that is in it for ports, airports, roads, broadband and connectivity to Europe by way of energy interconnectors. That proves the Government is looking beyond Britain exiting the European Union. The same is true of what we are doing in terms of cohesion and everything else in the European Union at the moment. From the Government's standpoint in that regard it is obvious that it is Brexit-proofing as we need to go on. The only point I will make on that contribution is that I agree we do not know what is going to happen in regard to Brexit, but it beats Banagher to give out about everything that is in the plan and to talk about everything that has been re-announced, most of which was re-announced 13 or 14 years ago when we were not even in government. When one talks about credibility, that is where credibility falls asunder altogether. I was pleased to see a significant number of jobs announced last week in County Monaghan by the Taoiseach and the local Minister, Deputy Humphreys, in Combilift.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">The Senator should deal in facts. It is a bit disingenuous, when in the Houses of the Oireachtas, not to use the opportunity to speak about a local company that is creating so many jobs. It is doing so because there is a safe, stable environment led by a Government which is economically and politically sound. Ireland is a safe and stable country in which to invest and companies know, please God, that there will be a return on investment. They would not invest in a white elephant if that is how the country was perceived. With the greatest respect to Senator Gallagher, he missed the opportunity to pay tribute to the company today.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">As for the alignment that has been done from the objectives of the national planning framework and the national development plan, the two are one. The objectives that are set out in the national development plan are completely aligned to the national planning framework. That was the whole reason for it. The delivery is something we all have a concern about because we all remember the last time a massive amount of money was spent. We all saw the monumental failures that happened such as, for example, the PPARS project. In some cases decentralisation worked but in other cases it was a total disaster. Much of the national spatial strategy was good but much of it was not good and it did not materialise into anything. We know what can happen and that is the reason we must be mindful of the mistakes of the past. What is different in this case is the fact that there is a joined-up plan that has capital in conjunction with planning but also that it will be delivered with the support and oversight of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I welcome the opportunity to come to the Seanad today. As a neighbour, I have no problem coming here at any time to discuss anything. Senator Higgins referred to procurement. I chair the Government's group on improving access by the SME sector to public procurement. We are constantly looking for suggestions as to how procurement areas can be modernised. We are at a stage now where we are open to suggestions, given that the process has bedded down. I attended a local government procurement conference this morning and I challenged local authorities to contribute to the process. We are open to suggestions if they think there is anything we should be doing. It is fair to say that 94% of what we spend as a country is spent in Ireland and more than half of it is spent in the SME sector supporting a lot of Irish jobs. I would welcome the opportunity to come to the House to listen to constructive suggestions on procurement. Senator Dolan made a legitimate point about the 12% to 15% of people he feels may be discommoded, which I will relay to the Department and to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who deals specifically with this issue. He is correct; I would not think it is tolerable either.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">I want to inform the committee that I intend to table an amendment in respect of section 1 on Report Stage which will correct an error in the drafting of the section. The Minister referred to in this section of the Bill is the Minister for Education and Skills when, in fact, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for the functions of the educational welfare service. As the committee knows, these powers transferred to my Department on the commencement of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I will of course continue to work closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in respect of all matters relating to Tusla's educational welfare service in order to ensure that every child in the State is provided with a high quality education to allow each and every one of them to meet their potential. I know full well that is also the intention of my colleagues, including Senator Ó Ríordáin, who is sponsoring the Bill. I appreciate that very much.</p>

          <p eId="para_504">Again, I want to inform the committee that I intend to table an amendment or, perhaps, a number of amendments on Report Stage in order to address issues that may emerge with regard to changing the definition of a child and the impact this may have on the operation of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. The change to the definition of a child for the entirety of the Act will have implications which are currently difficult to anticipate. For instance, bringing all children enrolled in a recognised school within the scope of the Act could impact on the decision of parents as to whether they should enrol their children in school before reaching the compulsory schooling age of six. It is important to note that the compulsory schooling age would not change on the basis of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Another potential impact would be to bring more children and parents under the scope of section 25 of the Act. Under this section the parent of a child who is neglecting to cause his or her child to attend a recognised school can be served with a school attendance notice and face subsequent prosecution should the parent contravene the requirements of the notice. The penalties for parents who face such a prosecution are a potential fine and imprisonment of up to one month. In this regard the proposed Bill could lead to a situation whereby a parent of a four or five year old child faces prosecution in respect of the non-attendance of a child who has not yet reached the compulsory school-going age. There is potential for a legal challenge to the legislation on that basis given this ambiguity. The officials in my Department are currently carrying out a section by section analysis of the Act in an attempt to identify some of these potential unintended consequences.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">I commend Senator Ó Ríordáin, who sponsored the Bill, for bringing it forward. I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome her comments on the Bill. We are all cognisant of her comments on the need to be mindful of unforeseen consequences. Clearly it is not our intention to dissuade parents from sending their children to school before the age of six. Both Senator Ó Ríordáin and myself look forward to working with the Minister and her officials to ensure that the Bill can be strengthened and improved upon in such a way that it meets our good intentions in bringing it forward without having the more negative consequences about which the Minister has spoken. We will be very happy to work with her and to bring the Bill forward to Report Stage with the sort of amendments the Minister has described.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I concur with my colleague and I also welcome the Minister to the House. I appreciate the work that she and her officials have done in this regard. I completely agree with her. What she has outlined is not the intention of our Bill in any way. The intention is to bring parents under the compassionate arm of the State rather than having them end up in a courtroom. I appreciate the difficulty the Minister's drafters will have in differentiating between a child not enrolled in a school and one who is. The intention of the Bill is to ensure that Tusla and the agencies of the State can deal compassionately with all children within the primary school enrolment system, particularly four and five year olds, and that they can be interacted with, encouraged and empowered. Nobody wants to see the parents of any child in a courtroom situation. It is a failure on everybody's part if it comes to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> We want to have that compassionate engagement and interaction from the agencies of the State for four and five year olds enrolled in school in order to correct poor patterns of behaviour at the earliest stage so that they do not compound and embed themselves into a much bigger problem later on. I appreciate the difficulty that the Minister's drafters will have. We will support her at every step along the way. Perhaps in time a more comprehensive Act may be needed to deal with this whole range of issues over a period of time. From the Labour Party's perspective, we are absolutely determined to work with the Minister on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">I thank the Senators so much. It is really helpful to hear both of them speaking about the intention behind the Bill and the way in which it impacts on or influences this particular section. </p>
          <p eId="para_510"> As the Senators would both be aware, the issue about which we are speaking would have been one of the more challenging ones dealt with in the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 which established the National Educational Welfare Board before that body was absorbed into Tusla. These issues are extremely challenging and need to be dealt with sensitively and always with the intention of supporting parents in sending their children to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> If we were to take a look at some of the debates on the original Act in respect of this issue, some of these conversations would have taken place then as well. It is important for me as Minister to name those issues because of the possibility that they may result in a need for amendments on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Although it is wonderful to be here on Committee Stage, we need time to reflect further on a couple of these things. I will be speaking on one or two more sections to indicate some issues which we want some time to examine. I totally accept and appreciate what the Senators are saying. My officials and I are very pleased that they will be willing to work with us in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to correct an error in the Long Title. The Long Title of the Bill refers to the National Educational Welfare Board. This amendment will update the Long Title to reflect the current position, namely, that the board is no longer in existence and that its functions were transferred to Tusla educational welfare services. As Members know, in order to fulfil its role Tusla educational welfare services is responsible for the provision of education welfare officers who engage with schools in identifying and dealing with issues of non-attendance of particular students and in general terms to implement the provisions of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. It is simply a reflection of the history of the change.</p>

          <p eId="para_515">I appreciate the Acting Chairman's indulgence. I thank the Minister and I reiterate that I hope nobody thinks that the intention of this Bill is stick rather than carrot. There are principals like myself in my former occupation who had the situation where they could only deal with the agents of the State, the National Educational Welfare Board as it was then and Tusla now, if a child was over six years of age. If there is a child in the school with very poor attendance patterns, for whatever reason, there was not the opportunity to refer that child because the legislation provided for children between the ages of six and 16. The intention of this Bill is not to hurt families. It is not to try and create difficulty between the school and a family. It is intended that a school can work with a family to address these poor behaviour patterns and that they can be empowered to do so by legislation. That is the ethos behind the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> I am delighted the Minister has accepted the Bill, is taking it on board that we have reached Committee Stage and can progress it. I mention a child who is enrolled and who is dependent on adults advocating for him or her. When one is 16 or 17 years of age, and in the education system, one is in a position to advocate for oneself and it is a different conversation, but when a child is four or five years of age, he or she needs adults to back him or her. Children need their parents, family and whole school community to back them. I am delighted that people in this House are backing those children and the Minister is too. I appreciate the Minister's support.</p>
