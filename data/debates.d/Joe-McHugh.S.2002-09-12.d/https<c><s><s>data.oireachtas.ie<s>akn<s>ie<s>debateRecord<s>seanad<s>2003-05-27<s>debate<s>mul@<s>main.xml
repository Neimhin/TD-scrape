          <p eId="para_5">Last Wednesday we had an interesting debate on the third level fees issue, which has fizzled out with the Minister doing a dramatic U-turn on the matter. There was much rhetoric over a long period, which was best encapsulated by Deputy McGuinness of Fianna Fáil who said it was a bogus debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">We should now concentrate on the recent report by the National Competitiveness Council and Forfás on Ireland's performance in the euro zone. Was it anticipated that Ireland would become the most expensive country in the euro zone, even more expensive than France and Germany? It is imperative that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment comes to the House to see how we can address the issue. Over the past six years Ireland has had the highest inflation rate in Europe and it has caught up with us. There is transparency within the euro zone as a result of which other countries can compare our prices to theirs while Irish people can do likewise when they travel abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should come to the House to debate the issue, which is relevant to the consumer who must pay a great deal more for groceries and in pubs and restaurants. This would be better than the House debating bogus issues that are not relevant. The Minister should outline her plans to reduce inflation and bring Ireland's rate into line with that in other European countries. I implore the Leader to get the Minister into the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">The issue of prices and inflation, raised by Senator Finucane, can be discussed during the debate on Sustaining Progress. However, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has raised the issue of the groceries order on three or four occasions recently. I do not know what is the correct view to take. I suspect most of us are the same. We have received material for and against from all sides. It does not appear to have worked in terms of controlling prices. That is the only bottom line that I know. In my heart I feel it should be retained but my head tells me that if it is not working then maybe it should be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I would like to hear from the Tánaiste, and I put it to the Leader that a debate would be very helpful. There are no differences on either side of the House on this issue. People have views in terms of wanting to protect small shops and various parts of industry and so on, but we also want to make sure that the consumer is getting the best deal possible. I do not know the answer but I ask that the Tánaiste come to the House and open up this debate. Let us have a debate without necessarily coming to a conclusion on it. Let us have information and hear views in order to help us to come to a conclusion on the best way forward before people start taking a stance for and against the Government position. It would be very useful to have a consultation and discussion at this point.</p>

However, I would like to put a different question to the Government, but in particular to the Tánaiste because clearly she is the person who can find money where nobody else can, particularly if it means keeping the coalition together and saving a Minister's career if that is required to keep the Government together.

Maybe she could restore a few very badly needed community employment schemes, particularly in those areas where unemployment is rising by the day. Maybe she would be better off if she listened to those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">I ask the Leader of the House to convene a debate as soon as possible on the report just published by the Convention on the Future of Europe. This House has played a valuable role in the past year in particular on this whole issue, having had members of the convention come to speak to us and to hear our views on the proceedings of the convention. If we have learnt any lessons from the Treaty of Nice and the debate on it, it is that early warning and early debate are extremely important. This House has a role to play in that. Clearly, some very important issues for the future of Europe and our role in the future of Europe, in particular as a small state, have emerged from the published report and I ask for a very early debate on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">I also put it to the Leader of the House, as have other speakers, that we need to look at the whole issue of inflation. I know we will touch on it later today but I would particularly like to hear the views of the relevant Minister – I think it is the Minister for the Environment and Local Government – on the whole issue of retail strategy and, in particular, the size of very large out of town retail outlets sought by overseas companies wishing to come here and the potential effects on local industry and on towns which many of us represent. It is important that we do that at an early stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I also ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on the report which has emerged from the Convention on the Future of Europe, both yesterday and today. We have had very good discussion here in the Seanad with the members of the convention, and in that context and the context of the work of the National Forum on Europe and the Joint Committee on European Affairs, it is important for the House to discuss this. There are issues, particularly with regard to the institutions, representation of Commissioners and whether the presidency of the Council should be a permanent position or at least held for a five year period rather than rotated, as at present. These are some of the aspects to which we should give considerable attention, particularly since it is a draft. We should give our views in support of the work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, whom I commend. Ultimately, this issue will be decided by an Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I support Senator O'Toole's comments about the euro and its appreciation against the dollar. Many of these aspects can be addressed in the debate on Sustaining Progress. Ultimately, competitiveness will decide whether we can keep our heads up in a trading sense concerning our exports to both the sterling and the US dollar areas. I am sure the Tánaiste would be quite happy to debate the competitiveness issue with us at some future date.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">If media reports are correct, it seems that the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, will have to make considerable concessions in the CAP and marine negotiations on fisheries policy and quotas, respectively. While we know we have done well out of the Common Agricultural Policy, this country is largely dependent on agriculture for sustaining a considerable tranche of the population. On fisheries policy, we can no longer afford to sell the family silver. We have seen our fishery grounds pillaged repeatedly. If free access is granted to the Irish Box, particularly to the Spanish, we will have considerable difficulty in developing our resources. Before too long, preferably next week, both Ministers should come to the House to spell out the Government's stance on the Fischler proposals and fisheries policy. We should give them whatever support and solidarity we can. It should not be a case of closing the door after the horse has bolted.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">I ask the Leader to provide time in early July to debate in detail the Forfás consumer pricing report of 2003, which places the Republic of Ireland second highest in the euro zone, next to Finland. Increases in Irish consumer prices in the past five years have sharply outpaced those of our European neighbours. To gauge reaction to the high prices, I am launching a "name and shame" consumer campaign today in conjunction with the Consumers Association of Ireland. I call on the general public to get involved in this campaign to expose the rip-off in consumer goods and services and the massive price hikes, which are making us uncompetitive. I want to empower the public to get involved in this campaign and to use – not abuse – parliamentary privilege, which will allow me to name the highest and lowest prices in Ireland when the campaign is finished in June. Furthermore, as Senator O'Toole said, on my journey from Roscommon to Dublin today, I passed 25 petrol stations and there was a difference of 11 cent in the price of a litre of unleaded petrol. Now is the time to take a stand.</p>

The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, seems to have held the line pretty well. When attempts were made to abolish the Irish Box altogether, he simply refused and indicated he would veto this. Concessions have already been made. No more should be made for precisely the reason stated by Senator Higgins. We cannot afford to let the Spanish destroy all our fishing stocks.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The Leader may agree with me that it might be appropriate for us to congratulate the national airline, Aer Lingus, on winning the award as the best value airline in Europe, despite the intervention of a mean-minded Mr. O'Leary, who is also very misinformed. He described the executives who voted for another prize as ignorant and stupid because they voted for an airline as being the best when it did not provide flights to England. I accept that it may not, perhaps, provide flights from Dublin, but I wonder if he has heard of a city called Cork? As someone who is geographically challenged, perhaps he could be informed that Cork is part of the Republic of Ireland.</p>

I am seeking such a debate because I tabled the motion at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, where it was passed unanimously. If the Seanad also passed it, we could send it on with further strength to the Minister. It need not be an expanded debate.

She was born into an Anglo-Irish family and lived a life of luxury and elegance at Lissadell. She is immortalised in the beautiful painting outside the Chamber, which was painted by her husband, Count Casimir Markievicz. From 1908 Countess Markievicz turned her back on luxury and the welfare of the Irish people became her most absorbing interest. Constance was the first woman to be elected to the British Parliament in 1918 and the following year she became Minister for Labour in the first Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I wish to move to a different subject. Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste to suspend immediately the reduction of 5,000 in the numbers participating in the community employment schemes at this time of economic downturn and lack of job opportunities for so many in the community and given what is happening in parishes and community and voluntary organisations? Since the situation is so difficult for older people who are long-term unemployed and there is much valuable work to be done, the people concerned should be given the opportunity to continue that work while they are able bodied. I call on the Leader to use her good offices with the Tánaiste to ensure this is done.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I support the request for debate on the report of the Convention on the Future of Europe. At the National Forum on Europe it was useful to have somebody there who actually knew what was contained in it. It is important that some or all of the Irish representatives, including the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, should be here to help the House through the intricacies of the debate. I know the Leader is keen to involve people. Javier Solana visited the House last week but went on to talk to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. It was a great pity we could not have had an hour with him. Perhaps we could look at this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">I also support the request for a debate on the Congo. It is an awful situation as anybody who read Fergal Keane's article in <i>The Independent</i> last Saturday would see. It would also give the United Nations a chance to rehabilitate itself. While I support the acquisition of Lissadell House, people need to think of a fitting and productive use for it – perhaps as an international Yeats study centre or something like it.</p>

People with disabilities are facing severe cuts in the services available to them. Eighteen year old disabled people will now have no places to go to in September.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_125">On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am pleased to present to the House the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Bill 2000. The enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to accede to the Council of Europe Agreement on Illicit Traffic by Sea implementing Article 17 of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, done at Strasbourg on 31 January 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The international community has already provided a framework for dealing with certain drug trafficking offences at sea. That framework is contained in the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, more commonly known as the Vienna Convention, adopted by the United Nations at Vienna in December 1988. Ireland has already given effect to the provisions of the Vienna Convention by the enactment of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which led to the ratification of the convention by Ireland on 3 September 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Arising from Ireland's obligations under the United Nations convention, it is an offence under Irish law for a person on an Irish ship, a ship registered in a convention state or a ship not registered in any state or territory – no matter where the ship may be – to be either in possession of controlled drugs or involved in the carrying of such drugs, knowing or having reasonable grounds to suspect that the drugs are to be imported or exported contrary to Irish law or a corresponding law of any other country. At present, the Irish authorities may stop, board and detain a ship registered in a convention state where such drug trafficking is suspected, provided that convention state agrees. The other convention states have enacted similar laws, so that there is a shared jurisdiction among all convention states.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">The United Nations convention is silent on the consequences of shared jurisdiction, in particular on which state ought to prosecute in such circumstances. However, the terms of the convention recognise the need for further improvement of these provisions by providing in Article 17 for regional agreements to enhance effectiveness in this area such as that contained in the Council of Europe agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The purpose of the Council of Europe agreement is to build on the provisions of the United Nations convention and deal with the issue of shared jurisdiction by making provision for the concept of preferential jurisdiction. This, in effect, gives a flag state the right to seek to exercise jurisdiction concerning any drug trafficking offence committed on board its vessel on the high seas in priority to the jurisdiction of another convention state. The agreement makes provision for the procedures to be followed by Council of Europe member states in applying this concept of preferential jurisdiction between them.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">As is clear from the explanatory report published with it, the experts involved in drafting the agreement considered that, in practice, the normal case would be that the relevant offence or offences will be prosecuted by the authorities of the intervening state. Situations may arise, however, for reasons of policy or on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, when the flag state might wish to prosecute the suspect and the agreement sets out in detail the rules to deal with such a situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The Bill gives a statutory basis to the concept of "preferential jurisdiction" and makes provision for the legislative mechanisms to give effect to it. For example, if a foreign ship on the high seas off the coast of Ireland was suspected of carrying drugs, the authorities of the flag state – that is, the country where the ship is registered – could, under the convention, request Ireland, or alternatively Ireland could seek permission from the flag state, to stop, board and search the ship. If evidence of drugs was found, the ship could be taken to and detained in an Irish port and the crew arrested. The crew would be guilty of a drug trafficking offence, not only under Irish law but also under the law of the flag state.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">The Council of Europe agreement seeks to establish an agreed method of dealing with such a situation by giving the flag state preferential jurisdiction. In the example I have just given, the flag state would have the right to insist on prosecuting the crew and could, therefore, under the agreement, require the crew, the ship and any evidence found on board to be surrendered to it by the Irish authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Alternatively, under an unusual requirement of the agreement to which I will return later, the flag state could simply require the release of the ship and crew. Under the agreement, such a requirement of surrender or release would have to be made within 14 days of the receipt of a summary of evidence from the arresting state, which in this case would be Ireland. The summary would have to be given to the flag state as soon as possible after arrest. If, as is expected to be the norm, flag states do not exercise their right to preferential jurisdiction under the agreement, the arresting state will be free to initiate a prosecution under its domestic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">In dealing with the Bill, it is fitting that I should again pay tribute to the commitment of the men and women of the Garda Síochána, the customs national drugs team and the Naval Service, which are tasked with the continuing fight against drug trafficking at sea. The bravery and dedication they bring to their work in dealing with drug trafficking by sea, which is often carried on in extreme and hazardous weather conditions, has continued to yield substantial results in terms of seizures of drugs and arrests for smuggling.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Figures available for the past six years show that the Irish Customs Service has examined 2,087 vessels. In the five year period ending December 2000, 970 kg. of cocaine and 3,280 kg. of cannabis resin with a total estimated street value of £202 million, or €256.5 million, has been seized at sea. In 2001, 504 examinations of ships took place and, in 2002, the number of such examinations increased to 587. These examinations typically involve boardings and/or partial or full searches of the cargo. Co-operation between the law enforcement agencies of the member states and beyond is vital in tackling the supply of drugs as drug traffickers recognise no national borders and the drugs trade is truly international.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">At national level, initiatives to enhance operational co-operation between law enforcement agencies include a memorandum of understanding and a working protocol between the Garda Síochána and the Customs Service and the establishment of a joint task force – incorporating the Garda Síochána, Customs and the Naval Service – to combat international drug trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">In terms of international co-operation, a number of initiatives have been undertaken including the appointment of drugs liaison officers to Europol and Interpol and in London, Paris, Madrid and the Hague to enable the exchange of information and intelligence between Ireland and its EU partners. The Garda national drugs unit continues to maintain close contact with law enforcement agencies within the EU and in non-EU countries. These contacts have borne fruit and a number of significant internationally driven seizures have been made. The drug barons and traffickers must be made to realise that our law enforcement agencies will continue to work together and enhance their co-operation in order to combat the international trade in drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. The Bill provides for a convention state which is a party to the agreement, provided for in section 3, to make a request in accordance with section 7 to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the surrender to that state, in respect of a drug trafficking offence, of a person who has been arrested, a vessel which has been detained or anything on the vessel which has been seized or detained while on the high seas, under procedures already provided for in section 35 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">When a convention state vessel is taken to an Irish port and detained, any person arrested will be brought before the High Court as soon as possible in accordance with section 5. The court will then remand the person pursuant to section 6, pending an order by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for that person's surrender to the convention state on foot of a request by the convention state. On receipt of the request, the Minister will certify under section 8 that a request for the surrender of the person has been duly made. Where the court is satisfied that a request for the surrender of the person has been made and evidence of an arrest warrant is produced as provided in section 9, the court, subject to certain requirements, will make an order committing the person to prison or, if under 21 years of age, to a remand institution. The person must then await the order of the Minister for his or her surrender.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">In compliance with the requirements, as set out in section 9, and before committing the person, the court will inform him or her that he or she will not be surrendered, except with his or her consent, before 15 days have elapsed. He or she will also be informed of the provisions of Article 40.4. 2º of the Constitution relating to the making of a complaint to the High Court that a person is unlawfully detained. A person committed to await surrender may be released as a result of a successful application under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution, as a result of an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court or if the surrender and conveyance out of the State of the person is unduly delayed, as indicated in section 20. In the absence of any such request for surrender being received within 18 days of the arrest of the person, the Minister, in accordance with section 21, must order his or her release without prejudice, however, to proceedings being taken in the State against the person for the drug trafficking offence in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">There is always the possibility that the arresting officers might find evidence of offences other than drug trafficking – for example, illegal arms. In such cases, the consent of the flag state will be required for a prosecution in the arresting state. However, the arresting state will be free to prosecute for any offence occurring after the vessel has been taken into its territory – for example, if the vessel's crew assaults an arresting officer. This provision is contained in section 14. A requirement to surrender a person to a flag state will take priority over any domestic proceedings and the High Court is being given power to order the suspension of any such proceedings, without prejudice to their eventual reinstatement as provided for in section 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Under section 17, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may order the surrender of a person, to a person duly authorised by the convention state to receive such person, if satisfied that the request for surrender is in accordance with the agreement. A similar power is granted to the Minister in section 18 in respect of vessels and evidence. Provision is made to ensure that any arrested person is given time, before surrender, to make a complaint to the courts under Article 40.4.2º of the Constitution that his or her detention is unlawful and this is provided for in section 19.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">I referred earlier to an unusual requirement of the agreement which at Article 15.5 makes provision for the flag state, instead of seeking surrender of the detained vessel and crew, to request the intervening state to release them forthwith without charge. When such request is made, the intervening state is obliged to release them. Provision for this requirement is made in section 21(<i>d</i>) of the Bill. In drawing up the agreement, the experts felt that it would be difficult to foresee all the kinds of situations that might arise in its practical operation. It was, therefore, agreed to include this provision as an exceptional safety valve in case something went entirely wrong in the procedure. The explanatory report with the agreement makes it clear however that this provision would only be relied upon in very exceptional circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Provision for Ireland, as the flag state, to exercise its right to preferential jurisdiction and seek the return of a person detained by a convention state, or the handing over of a vessel or thing seized by that state, is included in section 24. On receipt of notification of such detention or seizure for an alleged drug-trafficking offence, the Minister will decide, after consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, whether the State should exercise its preferential jurisdiction for the return of the person, vessel or thing. If such jurisdiction is to be exercised, the Director of Public Prosecutions may then apply to the District Court for a warrant of arrest of the person detained or the handing over of the vessel or thing detained. Provision is included in this section for the issue of warrants and for the alleged offence to be treated as having been committed in any place in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Some changes to the 1994 Act are necessitated by the Bill. I will give an outline of these in addition to some other important changes on the scope of offences covered. The agreement, at Article 3, also requires that each party to it shall take such steps as are necessary to establish its jurisdiction over the relevant offences – any of the drug trafficking offences described in Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Vienna Convention – whether committed on board a vessel registered in a convention state or a vessel of no nationality.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Section 33 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 is being amended to take account of this requirement, so that it will apply to such drug trafficking offences, and not, as at present, only the offences of possession of controlled drugs or carrying drugs for import or export. This provision is contained in section 28(<i>b</i>). This amendment will widen the range of drug trafficking offences at sea to include not only those to which I have already referred, but all drug trafficking offences, as comprehended in the 1994 Act, when committed on board an Irish ship, a convention state ship or a ship not registered in any country or territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">While the Council of Europe agreement obliges us to make such provision only for ships of the Council of Europe states, this provision is being extended to also include the ships of all convention states under the United Nations convention. Were this provision not so extended, it would result in the unsatisfactory situation of having a narrower range of offences applying to the ships of United Nations member states than would apply to ships of Council of Europe member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">In the context of this legislation, the opportunity is being taken to make amendments to sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994, which relate to enforcement powers, jurisdiction and prosecution provisions for convention state vessels which are outside the landward limits of the territorial seas of the State. At present, the authority of the Minister for Foreign Affairs is sought in respect of such vessels and that authority may not be granted unless the Minister has obtained the consent of the foreign state. In consequence, action may not be taken against convention state vessels in Irish territorial waters, which are suspected of drug smuggling offences, unless the consent of the flag state has been obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">During the drafting of the legislation, advice received from the Attorney General indicated that where such a vessel is in Irish territorial waters the consent of the foreign state to board the vessel is not necessary and sections 35 and 36 are being amended to take account of this advice. The amendments to give effect to these changes are contained in section 28(<i>c</i>) of the Bill. The question of preferential jurisdiction for flag ship states – the main purpose of the Bill – does not arise where the ship is arrested within territorial waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">I hope that the proposals contained in this significant and somewhat technical Bill will meet with the approval of all Senators. The Bill honours an important international obligation. Furthermore, it is a positive indication at an international level of both our ongoing determination to tackle transnational organised crime and our continuing commitment to tackle the scourge of drugs in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">Following on from the conclusion of the Helsinki European Council, which called on the EU to follow up the 1997 action plan to combat organised crime with an EU strategy for preventing and combating organised crime, a new EU strategy – the Prevention and Control of organised crime – A European Union strategy for the beginning of the new Millennium – was approved by the Council of the European Union in March 2000. This seeks to build on the Tampere conclusions and ensure a continuing co-ordinated response to tackling organised crime at EU level.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The strategy provides the framework for an integrated and multidisciplinary European approach to prevent and control organised crime and contains 11 political guidelines and 39 detailed recommendations in respect of the prevention and control of organised crime. Recommendation No. 27 of that strategy document contains a commitment by member states to ratification of this Council of Europe agreement in addition to other conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">This is one of a number of Bills which are currently being dealt with which will lead to ratification of international agreements. In particular, the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 will enable Ireland to ratify the UN Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, the UN Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, the UN Convention against the Taking of Hostages and the UN Convention on the Prevention of Attacks on Internationally Protected Persons. It will also give effect to the EU framework decision on combating terrorism. The Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003, which was before the House last week, will give effect to the EU framework decisions on joint investigation teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I am sure that all Senators will agree with the general purpose and thrust of the Bill and I hope we can get it enacted quickly so that the process can be put in train to enable us to ratify this important international agreement. Ratification of the agreement will be a further demonstration of our willingness to do all we can in conjunction with our international partners to continue to tackle organised crime and, particularly, ensure the perpetrators of drug smuggling offences on the high seas are brought to justice. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_157">I welcome the Minister of State and the Bill, the purpose of which is to give effect to the Council of Europe agreement on illicit traffic by sea implementing Article 17 of the United Nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, more commonly known as the Vienna Convention, done at Strasbourg on 31 January 1995. Any measure which helps in the fight against the drugs culture must be welcomed and supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">The Bill will give greater powers to the Garda, Naval Service and Customs and Excise in the fight against the importation of drugs. Ireland is a gateway for the importation of drugs to the United Kingdom and the Continent. It also has a large coastline of approximately 3,000 kilometres which is extremely difficult to manage. The Garda, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service will require additional support services to carry out the duties required. These services must be provided if the Bill is to be fully implemented. The services available are not adequate to deal with the problem. Our coastline makes the country attractive for traffickers to import drugs before sending them to other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I am glad that the figures available for the past six years show that Customs and Excise has examined 287 vessels. In the five year period ending December 2000, 970 kilograms of cocaine and 3,280 kilograms of cannabis resin with an estimated street value of €202 million were seized at sea. This shows the great work being done by the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the Naval Service and the national drugs team. However, they need more resources and facilities to enable them to adequately police our coastline.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">The drugs problem is having a huge effect on many citizens. It is also having an effect on services, including our health service, because drugs take a toll on people's lives and they must be looked after. It also leads to crime on our streets. Money spent in this area is well spent. Those trafficking in drugs must be caught. We must not leave any stone unturned to ensure Ireland is not used for the importation of drugs which are either sold on our streets or sent to other countries on the Continent. The drug traffickers must be brought to justice. This measure will help to streamline the provisions under the Criminal Justice Act. It will also give greater powers to other countries to ensure the problem of drug trafficking by sea is addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I will not delay progress of the Bill through the House. I wish the Minister of State well and I hope the Bill will be implemented quickly.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_89">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_162">I thank the Minister of State for his presentation and presence in the Chamber. I thank Senator Terry for sharing her time with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">I also welcome the Bill which has already been passed in the other House. I am concerned it has taken such a long time to get to this stage. I agree with the Minister of State that it is important to enact it as quickly as possible. It is necessary legislation which implements an earlier UN convention which did not deal comprehensively with the area of jurisdiction. It is an important part of dealing with the drugs problem, which is an international problem. As the Minister of State said, it does not have any borders. This Bill and other legislation on international co-operation are important in tackling drugs related and other types of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">The drugs problem has a devastating impact on communities. The work done to help them to tackle drug addiction is important. I refer specifically to the work done under the national drugs strategy. We need more resources for community development which would help to prevent drug addiction. Money was found recently to resolve the issue of the reintroduction of third level fees. This shows money can be found for important issues relating to disadvantage. The Government must also accept responsibility for finding money for projects such as the RAPID programme which operates in part of my area where there is a drugs problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">The Bill deals with international trafficking on the high seas. Senator Terry said Ireland was a gateway for international drug trafficking. Deputy Costello referred in the other House to an expert report which was published in 2000 by the US Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs and identified Ireland as a potential gateway for international drug trafficking. As our location makes us a target, it is important that Ireland is seen to be vigorous and to have and to enforce comprehensive anti-drugs legislation. We must also ensure we have the necessary resources. I support Senator Terry's comments about the good work being done by Customs and Excise, the Garda, the national drugs team and the Naval Service but they must be properly resourced. I would be interested to hear the Minister of State's comments in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">I welcome the idea of options in terms of who would prosecute offenders. I will discuss the sections of the Bill in more detail and any proposed amendments tabled by the Labour Party on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_167">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus an Bhille. The Bill is welcome. Although published in 2000, it is only now being debated. Why was there such a delay? The legislation deals with a relatively significant problem but there are not many issues involved. Often short Bills are presented when that is the case but this Bill is comprehensive, presumably because of the various technicalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">The legislation covers two main issues – the prosecuting jurisdiction for vessels detained in international waters and the absolute authority of the State to make arrests within its territorial waters. The enactment of the legislation will enable the Government to ratify the Council of Europe agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The Bill's provisions are interesting. It will be an offence for an Irish person to be involved in drug trafficking, wherever his or her ship is located, and Irish authorities will be permitted to board a vessel at sea if the convention state in which it is registered agrees. This relates to shared jurisdiction. It arises because the UN convention is silent on such jurisdiction in terms of prosecution. The legislation recognises the Council of Europe agreement that the preferred jurisdiction should be the country of registration of the vessel, particularly when it is arrested at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">If a ship is suspected, the flag state can request the authorities in Ireland to board the vessel to determine whether it is carrying drugs and there is also a provision whereby the Irish authorities can make such a request to the convention state in which the vessel is registered. The power to arrest should not be subject to that provision. The international law of the sea may well dictate otherwise, but those involved in drug trafficking are sophisticated in the way they approach the law because of the money at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">If a vessel is suspected of drug trafficking, it would be entirely appropriate for the relevant authorities to take the initiative, with the power to prosecute subject to the prior agreement of the convention state in which the vessel is registered. Delays in boarding a vessel, which may arise because of the necessity to follow procedures to obtain permission, could result in the drugs being hidden or dumped at sea and lead to an unsuccessful prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The legislation also provides that the flag state can seek the evidence in a case and, subsequent to considering it, the state can seek the return of the crew and the ship by exercising the preferential jurisdiction option or it can require their release. That is a strange provision. If the state, whose authorities have boarded the vessel, feels it has sufficient evidence to pursue a prosecution, it is strange that the flag state should have the right to request the release of the ship and crew. Under the legislation, the arresting state would be obliged to adhere to that request. Perhaps the Minister of State will elaborate on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The legislation will also amend the 1994 Act, under which the Minister for Foreign Affairs must seek the consent of the flag state to board a vessel even if the vessel is arrested in Irish territorial waters. That is a logical progression. We must have absolute authority within our jurisdiction and it is strange that this provision was included in the 1994 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Drug trafficking is a major international problem and tackling it requires cohesive co-operation between all states. The legislation, the convention and the Council of Europe agreement are useful tools to achieve that. Ireland subscribes to them and it is interesting that all groups in the House and all right thinking people support the provisions in the Bill and the full implementation of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">Organised crime gangs are heavily involved in drug trafficking in Ireland. The result is that unfortunate individuals become addicted to drugs, their families are badly affected and other people become innocent victims of the violence of drug barons. The unfortunate murder of Brian Fitzgerald by drug gangs in Limerick has been raised in the House on a number of occasions. This appalling vista needs to be tackled and no stone should be left unturned to bring the perpetrators to justice. This legislation is part of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">It is incumbent on states to pool their expertise. The House recently passed the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill, which is part and parcel of the fight against crime in general. I have no doubt that drug trafficking will figure highly on the list of tasks to be undertaken by such teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">It is argued that the forces of law and order throughout the world are losing the battle against drug traffickers. A friend of mine compares drug trafficking to alcohol prohibition in the United States in the 1930s when organised crime gangs became heavily involved in the drinks trade. His solution is that drug trafficking should be dealt with in the same way by liberalising drug laws. However, many people believe that if drugs were legalised, they would be used more widely and the social consequences would be much greater. However, the organised crime element would be removed. It is an interesting theory. I wonder whether research has been conducted internationally in this regard to examine the consequences of drug use, particularly in Holland where a liberal approach has been taken though the opening of special cafes for those who smoke marijuana.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Senator Terry alluded to the difficult and dangerous task faced by the Naval Service. The Minister of State will be much more <i>au fait</i> with the resources available but the fishing industry believes that more naval vessels are needed to patrol our waters effectively in terms of fishery protection. If the industry is correct, then more vessels are needed to tackle drug trafficking. There is anecdotal evidence that waters off the south coast are being used by international drug gangs to redistribute drugs throughout Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">It strikes me that the Naval Service not only benefits our own island but also has implications for the rest of Europe because of the vast stretches of water that surround us. The case could well be made that within the European Union greater financial assistance could be given to the provision of the resources necessary. The Minister of State might consider that. I am sure it has already been taken up with the European Union. To combat crime in this area it is essential that resources are provided because there is no shortage of resources on the part of the criminals to evade detection. If we fail to match them then obviously we will fail overall in the curtailment of this serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Section 2 concerns the exercise of powers by enforcement officers. I have already suggested that it is perhaps cumbersome to have to await direction if a control vessel suspects for some reason – perhaps prior intelligence from sources at a port or from Interpol – that a ship may well have drugs on board. I presume such activity can also be detected by satellite and by observation of vessels coming together at sea in order to exchange drugs. It is important that any naval vessels within the vicinity should be able to act speedily. If an inquiry has to be put through to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who in turn has to get the approval of the flag state, it may not be the most effective procedure from the point of view of enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Practical experience may well disprove some of what I am saying, but there are a number of registering authorities. The first thing to determine is whether a vessel is registered with Bureau Veritas, Lloyds or whoever, and it might not be registered at all. I know from experience that this is not quick or easy to determine. The same name may be used on more than one ship. As I argued earlier, it is desirable that the power to arrest should not be subject to that procedure. The Minister of State may well point out that we cannot do that under the international law of the sea. If the argument is considered to be of merit, perhaps we should make approaches to see if we can get changes in the law in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">In many instances these vessels may be registered with countries that are not party to the convention. Obviously, criminals will be well aware of the legislation and will try to evade it. It is important that we can also move on those vessels that are not registered and that there is no way out for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">Section 4, on communication by the master of the vessel, seems sensible. I wonder whether that should not be restricted to vessels which are arrested in international waters. There are concerns that it might prevent or obstruct the making of an arrest, and there are provisions in the legislation to avoid that.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I ask why section 5 provides for an arrested person to be brought before the High Court, rather than the Circuit or District Courts, which would normally deal with offences of that nature. Section 7 concerns the request for surrender. Presumably this only applies to vessels which are arrested on the high seas, not in territorial waters. Has that given rise to any difficulties? It seems an unusual provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Subsection (2) provides that the request may be transmitted by facsimile. Facsimiles are generally not accepted in law. The authentication of facsimiles would be an issue, and obviously organised criminals would be very sophisticated in getting around that if there were any loopholes in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Overall I welcome the provisions of the Bill. It is definitely a step in the right direction and it will be interesting on Committee Stage to tease out some of the issues in the various sections. The whole thrust of co-operation at international level, which we have seen in a number of the Bills before the House, is a positive step in the fight against crime generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_187">Like the other speakers, I welcome the Bill. As Senator Terry has said, every effort should be made to combat drug trafficking. I ask the Minister of State to state briefly the position in relation to tourist pleasure boats.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">One can travel now from Kilrush to Dingle, to Kinsale, across to the south of England, on to France and right along the French coast, down into Spain and then over to North Africa. I am sure pleasure boats can come in the other direction also. Are any real checks done on those types of yachts or cruise boats that transport tourists? People stay on such boats overnight when they dock at various marinas along their routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">We have a certain amount of control at airports and major sea ports but have we any real control when it comes to cruise boats and pleasure craft? In Ireland they can travel up the Shannon all the way to Northern Ireland. It is a great way for people to travel from a tourism point of view, but one wonders whether other activities might be carried on at the same time. I hope this type of activity will be covered in this Bill also because one never knows what can take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction, but I wonder why it has taken since 1995 to get this in place. I hope it is a major success because there are huge drug problems in every town in this country. Undoubtedly there are similar problems in other countries but we can see it on the streets of small towns now. As previous speakers have said, every effort should be made to do whatever is necessary to control the trafficking of drugs. I welcome the provisions of the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_191">I welcome the Minister to the House and welcome this very important legislation. I see it as an additional weapon in the fight against organised crime, particularly the trafficking of drugs at sea. This complements the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Bill 2003 which we debated last week. What we are doing with both Bills is tackling these guys on the ground and at sea. I have no doubt that this legislation is sending out a clear message to the criminals that we are serious about our business in this regard and will not be deterred in our actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The Minister of State alluded to the fine work that the Garda, the Naval Service, the customs officers and the national drugs team are doing, and I echo those sentiments. They are doing a fine job in the most hazardous of conditions. If gardaí are involved in boarding ships – I am not sure if they are – they are probably, excuse the pun, out of their depth in terms of tackling these guys at sea. Nonetheless, the results have been formidable. The Garda has made a number of arrests and there have been quite a lot of seizures. If we hurt these fellows in the pocket, hopefully they will soon wise up. Co-ordination between all agencies is essential, particularly between our European partners because these fellows know no boundaries. They ply their trade wherever there is a buck to be made. If we co-operate and there are no hiccoughs, we should further improve our success rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The Minister referred to the initiative of enhanced operational co-operation between the law enforcement agencies, particularly the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service. Added to these will be the joint task force. As these agencies are becoming more experienced, the situation will improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Minister also referred to the drugs liaison officers in Europol and Interpol. Enhanced co-operation, particularly in information and intelligence sharing, is the way forward. The more information and intelligence there is, the better will be the strike rate. Even to date, they have been extremely successful and have pinpointed many operations. Many arrests and seizures have taken place on the high seas.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">If the drugs barons and those plying their trade on the seas see that we have the resources to back up the legislation, they will think twice before going about their lucrative business. They are probably at their most vulnerable with a full ship on the high seas. If anything happens at that time, the game is up for them and their investment is lost. Serious losses cause serious concerns for them and if we provide the resources, we could be very successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">As with the legislation last week, tackling the drugs problem lies at the heart of the Bill. There were no drugs in this city 20 years ago. The drugs problem is now critical.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Senator Terry rightly said that, as an island nation, Ireland is extremely vulnerable. She mentioned that we have 3,000 km. of coastline which has to be defended. The Naval Service could not come near to covering our entire coastline. The Minister of State might outline whether any additional resources are likely to be provided. Some jurisdictions have their own dedicated coastguards. Although that might not be a bad idea, I am not suggesting that we go down that road. However, I wonder what is the strike rate in countries with these dedicated services.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Senator Jim Walsh alluded to the fact that these people have their own quite sophisticated intelligence. If we are to match them, both at sea and on land, we must also match them in intelligence. I am aware that this matter is in hand. As Senator Tuffy said, the US Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs carried out a survey in 2000. While it concluded that Ireland is not a major player in international drug trafficking, it referred to the fact that our coastline is very vulnerable and it also stated that we should seriously consider doing something in that regard. It even went on to point out certain set-down spots on our coastline that are more vulnerable than others.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Drugs are a menace to the country and to our friends in Europe and across the sea. They have made inroads into every country in the world. Millions of people have died as a result of drugs, which have destroyed large parts of inner cities – including that of Dublin – across the globe. I represent an area in the north inner city which probably has the worst drugs problem in the country. Going into flat complexes, I frequently step over 15 and 16 year olds who are spaced out at all hours of the day and night. It is too simplistic to say that it is their parents' problem because, in many instances, the parents are also strung out.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">These are the consequences of what those involved in trafficking drugs are doing to our cities and towns. The problem is now finding its way into smaller villages and towns. A small minority of people is getting very rich off the misery of others. These people must be targeted effectively and in the harshest way possible. There should be no place for them to hide. I know the Minister of State and his colleagues in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are right behind this.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The Bill gives real clarity in providing that when these people are apprehended, there will be no opportunity for them to exploit any conflict that might arise between jurisdictions. This is important because if they see loopholes, they will dive in. If we are at one with our EU partners and have clarity in our legislation, we will deal with them head on. For our security and that of our neighbours, we must continue down this road and take these people on. If we do nothing, it will have a negative impact on the shaping of the next generation.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">I wish the Bill a speedy passage through both Houses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_203">I wish to express my gratitude to Senators Terry, Tuffy, Jim Walsh, Kett and the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">I hope the Bill can be enacted quickly so that we can continue to reinforce our commitment – in this instance in conjunction with our international partners – that no effort will spared to bring drug traffickers to justice wherever they may seek to operate. In response to Senator Kett's concluding comment, the Government will not be found wanting and will pursue those trafficking drugs vigorously both on land and, in this case, at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">As stated earlier, Ireland has already given effect to the provisions of the United Nations Vienna Convention by the enactment of Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The Council of Europe agreement, which gave rise to this legislation, builds on the Vienna Convention by making provision for the concept of preferential jurisdiction. While the Bill may seem somewhat technical in nature, when taken in conjunction with the 1994 Act, its enactment will bring certainty to international co-operation in this area, which will serve to act as a further deterrent to drug trafficking at sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">This is an excellent example of the Government's commitment to continue the recent co-operation with our international partners in our fight against drugs. In Europe and throughout the world, the Minister and officials from his Department continue to participate at the various fora that aim to provide new solutions to the problems of international drugs trafficking and international crime. The EU Action Plan on Drugs 2000 to 2004 was endorsed by the European Council in June 2000. This plan sets out detailed measures to achieve the objectives and targets in relation to tackling supply and demand for drugs set out in the EU drugs strategy, which was endorsed by the European Council in December 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">In 2000, subject to ratification, Ireland signed the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and two protocols thereto. I refer here to a protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, particularly women and children, and another against the smuggling of migrants by land, air or sea. The convention and its protocols are important milestones in the world community's efforts to combat the threat posed by cross-border crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">As the borders of the European Union continue to expand it is imperative that co-operation with the countries of central and eastern Europe is enhanced in the fight against organised crime in order to defeat our common enemy. Ireland will continue to participate in EU measures to improve co-operation with these countries. Co-operation at a bilateral level is vital and in that context we have already signed intergovernmental agreements on crime and drug trafficking with the republics of Hungary and Poland as well as Cyprus, Bulgaria and Russia. Requests to enter into similar bilateral intergovernmental arrangements have been received from a number of other candidate countries and those are currently being examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Senator Terry referred to the serious effects of drugs on our citizens and other knock-on effects. Of course we must apprehend those trafficking in drugs and they must be brought to justice; the Government will not be found wanting in that regard. There is a cost involved in human and financial terms. If we did not have this problem much of the funding involved could be diverted elsewhere. The Government will provide the necessary funds for activity on land and sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">Senator Tuffy referred to the need for further development of our domestic drugs strategy. I assure the House that this strategy is kept under review on an ongoing basis between the Departments and is adapted to changing needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Reference was made to the Naval Service reorganisation. The Naval Service underwent a period of examination in the Pricewaterhouse report on the Defence Forces. That report was followed by the White Paper on defence. Policy arising out of those reviews was matched by a Naval Service strategy contained in a two-part plan. Part one dealt with meeting Ireland's defence policy needs at sea and a naval strategy and plan of action for the future. Part two was the Naval Service value for money implementation plan. The plan was endorsed by the Minister for Defence and the Naval Service and is now well advanced. This ambitious plan is designed to implement the effectiveness and efficiency recommendations made by Pricewaterhouse and it builds on the Government decision that the Naval Service will be the State's principal seagoing agency with a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Government's desire for increased efficiency and greater effectiveness is fully embraced in the plan, as it is a requirement to be held to demonstrate the State's sovereignty at sea. The plan is also underpinned by a number of strategies.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Senators Jim Walsh and Tuffy referred to the delay in bringing the legislation forward, which is a reasonable point, though generally speaking Ireland has a good record in participating in such international measures. While I accept the convention was open for signature as far back as January 1995, we must not lose sight of the fact that the convention came into effect in May 2000 and the Bill was published in April 2000. The Government is anxious to ensure that Ireland can accede to the convention at the earliest possible opportunity. To date, only two other EU member states, Austria and Germany, have ratified the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Ireland has taken many steps to tackle drugs, including the formulation of the national drugs strategy. Since 1996 the Government strategy on drug misuse has been based on the recommendations and policies of the two reports of the ministerial task force on measures to reduce the demand for drugs. The overall aim of the current strategy is to provide an effective and integrated response to drug misuse and this is reflected in a partnership working with the communities most affected by the problem. The current drugs strategy covers the period 2001 to 2008 and the objectives and actions involve a range of specific commitments from various Departments and agencies against which progress is measured. Priority continues to be given to those areas where heroin problems have been identified. Encouraging progress has been made in recent years and the local drugs task forces continue to be a central vehicle for key actions under the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Senator Walsh referred to arrest on the high seas. While he has a point about boarding ships on the high seas, we must remember that ships have a right to pass and re-pass under the Convention on the Law of the Sea. We must respect the sovereignty of other states.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">He also referred to the discrepancy in the 1994 Act concerning the State's power to board ships in its territorial waters. This issue has been misinterpreted by several states and is now being corrected in the Bill. Senator Walsh referred to a delay in receiving approval from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and of course time is of the essence. During the drafting of the legislation, advice received from the Attorney General indicated that where such a vessel is in Irish territorial waters, the consent of the foreign state to board the vessel is not necessary. Sections 35 and 36 of the Bill are being amended to take account of this advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Senator Walsh also mentioned liberalisation of the availability of drugs. Holland operates a coffee shops policy and there are questions as to whether this is the way forward. Member states are not convinced by this policy, primarily for health reasons. Senator Walsh asked why extradition cases should be brought to the High Court rather than the Circuit or District Courts. This procedure is a mirror of the extradition process.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The issue of whether a fax is or is not an adequate means of transmission was raised. It is, in fact, and a number of EU and Council of Europe instruments, negotiated in recent times in a mutual legal assistance context, allow for this means of transmission.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The Leas-Chathaoirleach asked about tourist boats registered in Ireland. These are subject to Irish law. Foreign boats are subject to the terms of this agreement. There are local checks on tourist boats by the Naval Service, customs officers and gardaí. Our coastline creates problems for us because smaller boats can come into almost any nook or cranny. However, I compliment the Naval Service, the Garda and the customs officers for their vigilance. The public has a role to play as well. If people become aware of smaller boats coming close to shore, they should alert the authorities and assist them in every possible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">Senator Kett correctly stated that this is only one of many measures being taken to tackle the scourge of drugs. I again pay tribute to the commitment and dedication of the members of the Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the national drugs team and the Naval Service in the exercise of their duties in the fight against the trafficking of drugs in what are often very dangerous circumstances. There must be no safe havens for those who engage in drug smuggling. The Bill will ensure such people, when apprehended, will not be able to exploit any conflict between jurisdictions in that states will work in close co-operation to tackle this evil trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl do na Seanadóirí, ach go háirithe dóibh siúd a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht tábhachtach seo – don Leas-Chathaoirleach agus do na Seanadóirí Terry, Tuffy, Breathnach agus Kitt.

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_94">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_221">Sustaining Progress continues the successful formula of its predecessor agreements of a consistent policy framework in the macro-economic, distributional and structural areas. The new agreement aims, within the parameters of the programme for Government, to build upon the progress made under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. It is appropriate to current circumstances and reflects the reality of an uncertain international environment. It acknowledges fiscal constraints and their implications for the pace of progress across all policy areas. The overall macro-economic objective is to achieve a medium-term growth rate capable of sustaining high levels of employment and promoting social inclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I cannot overstate the importance of competitiveness and, if jobs are to be secured, of reducing inflation as quickly as possible towards levels comparable with those of our trading partners. I am also mindful of the recognition in Sustaining Progress of the reciprocal relationship between competitiveness and social inclusion, whereby "competitiveness helps to generate the resources to enhance social inclusion, while increased social inclusion enhances competitiveness".</p>
          <p eId="para_223">The anti-inflation initiative contained in the new agreement involves representatives of employer and union organisations working with the Government to target domestic sources of inflationary pressure. The sustained appreciation of the euro, together with uncertainty in the international economic environment, make it even more imperative that wages and costs evolve on a sustainable basis and consistent with the terms of the agreement. If wages and prices continue to increase as they are at present, employment and output levels will be compromised.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The new agreement charts the way forward in these uncertain times. It seeks improvements in public services, through a better focus on priorities, and anticipates a dividend from modernisation and change right across the public sector. The pay and benchmarking increases for public servants are linked to the delivery of such improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Sustaining Progress provides a basis for confidence in our ability to take advantage of the international recovery when it comes. It details actions already under way or proposed by Government in areas such as infrastructure, the environment and the need for adaptation to continuing change. We want to ensure that the country is provided with a level of physical and social infrastructure that is affordable and underpins economic development for the benefit of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The special initiatives part of the agreement, which is a further development of the partnership process, identifies a number of major cross-cutting economic and social issues which will be progressed over the lifetime of the agreement. We are also concerned with progressing the social agenda. The actions set out in the agreement aim to promote a fair and inclusive society in which people have access to quality public services. Across the public expenditure area, there is increased emphasis on the monitoring and evaluation of outputs and on value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The implementation of the agreement is being overseen by a high level steering group composed of representatives of each of the social partner pillars and of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance. The agreement between the Government and the social partners has identified housing and accommodation as a key policy area requiring sustained and integrated effort. It proposes: the introduction of a new affordable housing initiative, as well as the continuation of efforts to increase the supply of housing generally; to improve the delivery of social housing; and to implement planned reforms of the private rented sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The objective of the affordable housing initiative will be to enhance the supply of affordable housing. It will be aimed at those who, in the past, would have expected to purchase a house from their own resources but who find that they are unable to do so in the current housing market. Under the initiative, houses will be made available for sale on a full cost-recovery basis and will not impact on the Exchequer. Therefore, it will not detract from the Government's emphasis on delivering a broad range of initiatives for lower income groups and those with social and special housing needs. The initiative will also complement the continuing efforts to maintain a high level of overall housing supply which brings greater stability to the market and greater opportunities, particularly for first-time buyers.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Government's response is being pursued as a matter of urgency. The first meeting of the steering group to advance the various special initiatives under Sustaining Progress has already taken place. The Government undertook preliminary work in advance of this. The Department of Finance has been involved in discussions with other Departments to flesh out detailed actions which will be undertaken to deliver on this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">A total of 57,695 houses were completed nationally in 2002, which was the eighth consecutive year of record housing output. While it will be important to maintain this trend of increasing output, it will also be necessary to optimise output from the local authority and social housing programme. Sustaining Progress provides a framework for the Government and the social partners to contribute to and deliver on housing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Under the programme, the Government committed itself to amending the Redundancy Payments Acts to implement the recommendations of the report of the redundancy review group. It agreed to enhance statutory redundancy terms to provide for two weeks pay per year of service, with the abolition of differentiation by age, and to retain the bonus week in the calculations of payments. The rebate of 60% of the statutory redundancy payment from the social insurance fund will apply to this revised level of support. Following the recent introduction of the amending legislation by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the revised rates took effect on 25 May. The fact that this measure is expected to cost €149 million to implement – financed through the social insurance fund – is an indication of the high level of Government commitment to it and to honouring the terms of Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The public service pay agreement provides for a pay increase of 7% over an 18 month period, with an initial six-month pay pause. This increase is to apply as follows: 3% from 1 January 2004; 2% from 1 July 2004; and 2% from 1 December 2004. In addition, the agreement provides for the payment of the increases recommended by the public service benchmarking body on the following basis: 25% of the increases in 2003 backdated to 1 December 2001. This was already provided for under the adjustment to the PPF agreed in December 2000 – 50% of the increase from 1 January 2004 and 25% of the increase from 1 June 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Sustaining Progress emphasises the need for industrial peace and stability in the lifetime of the agreement. To that end, there are similar provisions in the public service for settling disputes through the Labour Relations Commission and/or the Labour Court or, where relevant, the appropriate conciliation and arbitration scheme. In addition, a public service sub-group of the national implementation group has been established to review progress on the agreement and to consider any issues arising from its implementation. There is a commitment by the parties to agreeing codes of practice for disputes in essential services.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Provision is also made for the continuation of the public service monitoring group, which was established under the PPF, and consists of representatives of the public service employers and the public service unions. In addition to fostering industrial peace, the approach in this agreement builds on the experience in the PPF in that it links payments to the achievement of progress on flexibility and change. There is a strong emphasis on the need for co-operation with change and with modernisation. Unlike the PPF, in which only the final phase of the agreement was linked to achievement of targets, the target setting in this case will have to allow assessments of progress before each phase of the general rounds and the final two phases of the benchmarking increases are paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The aim of the modernisation process is to improve the delivery of public services. This will involve increased flexibility by staff in service delivery, changes in recruitment methods to attract those with the necessary skills and expertise, the achievement of better value for money and a strong emphasis on improving customer service. Other modernisation objectives and specific commitments have been agreed by the health and education sectors, the local authorities and the Civil Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">A key element of Sustaining Progress is that payment of 75% of the benchmarking increases and all of the general round increases will be made only if satisfactory progress is verified in regard to the commitments in the chapter entitled "Delivering Quality Public Services". This means co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation and the maintenance of stable industrial relations. The central feature of the arrangements to verify that the conditions for the payment of these increases has been met is the establishment of performance verification groups for each sector of the public service. These groups will make an assessment of progress no later than one month before each of the four payment dates specified in the agreement. These assessments will be made in respect of agreed action plans for each organisation derived from the commitments in the agreement, which have been agreed by each performance verification group, as well as on an assessment of progress achieved in the relevant sector provided to the performance verification group by the Secretary General responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The agreement also provides that each sectoral performance verification group will maintain close contact with the various organisations under its remit throughout the reporting period. This contact will also help ensure that action to implement commitments will be early, consistent and effective. Performance verification groups for the Civil Service and the health, local government and education sectors will ensure that progress under the new agreement is sufficient to warrant payment. While this mechanism is similar to the quality assurance process which operated under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, I am satisfied that it will be even more rigorous, as progress can be assessed and payment awarded at sectoral, organisational and grade levels rather than – as was the case under the PPF – at organisational level only.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Civil Service, education and health sector PVGs have nine members plus an independent chairman, while the local government sector PVG comprises six members plus an independent chairman. Each of these PVGs includes independent members drawn from the private sector and customers of the relevant sector of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">As well as the PVGs, arrangements have also been put in place by the Department of Finance to monitor developments, across the public service, in respect of the commitments in Sustaining Progress. In addition, an SMI implementation group of Secretaries General has assumed the role of overseeing and driving progress towards achieving these commitments. The SMI implementing group of Secretaries General has also taken on the crucial role of promoting the modernisation agenda over the duration of the agreement, ensuring that action is taken to meet the commitments in the agreement and monitoring progress in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Significant work is also taking place within public service organisations, which are currently putting in place all the necessary measures to ensure that the public service change and modernisation agenda set out in Sustaining Progress are delivered. Secretaries General who are responsible for agencies within their sector are being advised to ensure that commitments are being met in these organisations and that they actively participate in pushing forward the change and modernisation agenda. I am satisfied that these verification arrangements will be sufficient to ensure that significant progress is made on these commitments over the lifetime of Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">As previously stated, there is a strong emphasis in the agreement on the need for industrial peace in both the private sector and in the public service. This arises because of the greater need for certainty by the employers that the terms of the agreement will be adhered to and that action will not be taken to secure pay increases in excess of the terms of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">In the public service in particular, there have been disputes in the past about pay and non-pay issues. These have disrupted public services and had a negative impact on people availing of such services. As employers, we cannot continue to have these disruptions. The new agreement puts in place mechanisms designed to ensure that if there are disagreements between management and unions, they will be resolved within a framework set up in the agreement and without resource to industrial action.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">All of the previous agreements contained industrial peace clauses, but the provisions in Sustaining Progress are reinforced and underlined to a much greater extent than heretofore. The public service unions cannot have been in any way unclear that industrial relations stability was an essential requirement and demand of the Government negotiators, and it was to this that they signed up.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Taxpayers have a right to expect that, in return for the substantial increases in the public service pay bill – in the region of €2 billion – arising from the new agreement and benchmarking, they will get a better public service, free from interruption from disputes. In the context of the need for industrial peace, the Government is concerned about current instances of industrial action in the public service in contravention of the agreement. If the stability which was sought and negotiated in the agreement is to be delivered, it is important that these disputes are resolved.</p>

        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_245">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Sustaining Progress programme. There is no doubt that partnership agreements have been one of the cornerstones of the recovery of this country's economy, particularly since the dark days when it languished as one of the worst and most under-performing in the EU. The coming together of the social partners in order to work out a common economic and social platform and programme over a fixed timescale has undoubtedly provided stability and growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">While one must acknowledge the unprecedented and totally politically unselfish grand gesture by Alan Dukes, as leader of Fine Gael in the late 1980s, in committing the party to the Tallaght strategy, one must also give credit to the then Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, who, together with the social partners of the time, were the architects of the first programme – the Programme for National Recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Up to that time, the country chugged along on what were known as national wage agreements. The problem for the country and the economy, however, was that they were just that. We had a very confined sequence of agreements which dealt only with wages and, almost always, played catch-up, as inflation – as Members will recall – sometimes spiralled as high as 18%. Inflation eroded the real value of the wage increases awarded in preceding agreements. The spiral continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The success of the Programme for National Recovery, the Programme for Economic and Social Progress and the subsequent programmes, lay in their being multidimensional. They dealt not just with wages, but with a range of economic factors and became more all-embracing as they evolved. One need only look at the index to Sustaining Progress to see how they have evolved and developed in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">A key to the success of the programmes has been the review mechanism, which was previously known as the central review committee but to which the Minister of State referred as the steering committee. Members on this side of the House welcome Sustaining Progress, which is an excellent document. Following the initial hiccups that are an inevitable part of the wheeling, dealing and bartering that takes place, we all breathed a sigh of relief when the deal was finally struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">What is noteworthy, but also a matter of concern, is the fact that Sustaining Progress is a very short-term arrangement which will last approximately 24 months. One cannot blame the unions for their reluctance to sign up to a longer-term agreement or arrangement, given the current economic volatility. Uncertainty was one of the keynotes in the Minister of State's contribution. There is a considerable amount of economic uncertainty and volatility in terms, for example, about what growth will be achieved in the economy. There is also considerable uncertainty about what will be the rate of inflation and the impact this will have the wage and taxation elements agreed in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Sustaining Progress illustrates the developments that have occurred since the early programmes were introduced. It refers, for example, to the establishment of a PIAB in respect of insurance claims, although it does not go far enough. It also refers to child care and to care of the elderly. With regard to the latter, however, we have been presented with yet another study and little commitment to real action. There is a section dealing with combating long-term unemployment, which is particularly significant if one considers current unemployment trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">In the section dealing with waste management, policy details are, again, not spelled out. I have a major reservation about our failure to manage recycling. Our efforts in this regard have been much too diverse and disorganised. Until we put some kind of semi-State structure in place for waste management, we will not get to the core of the problem or be successful in managing what is a potentially lucrative area. I have previously advocated that a semi-State body such as Bord na Móna – which has done excellent work and shown considerable imagination in diversifying, but the core business of which has been greatly diminished because of the disappearance of the bogs – should be brought in to deal with waste management. If and when it becomes a profitable enterprise, it should, by all means, be sold off.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The programme refers to improving the nation's health, which is a topical issue, and alludes to tackling alcohol, drugs, etc. It then proceeds to deal with the macro-economic policy areas and with taxation. The programme is comprehensive and we are glad that the deal was finally struck.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I spoke about uncertainty. What is certain at this juncture is that the economy is going through a very turbulent period. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the succession of job losses that have become a weekly feature. In the last week of April, for example, Unifi Ireland announced that it was making 250 workers in Letterkenny in County Donegal redundant. This was followed a few days later by the loss of 80 jobs at Mutual and Scottish Provident. The pattern continued into May, beginning with the announcement that Celestica in north Dublin was closing down with 250 employees being let go. This was followed a few days later with the loss of 25 jobs at the UK-owned Cedar Software in Castlebar. Since then, the Gallaher cigarette company has decided to let 121 employees go at its south Dublin plant. In Waterford, Kromberg and Schubert has cut its staff by 70 and these jobs are going to Hungary. The Mater Hospital announced last week that it is letting 121 of its staff go.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">In April ISME, Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, predicted that up to 20,000 industrial jobs could be lost before the end of the year as small companies faced what it described as "a crisis of confidence". In a survey carried out for ISME, 55% of manufacturing companies stated they expected a downturn over the next year. One third of manufacturing companies responded by saying they expected employee numbers to drop while some 37% of respondents reported that they employed fewer staff than this time last year. This compares to a figure of 18% of firms which stated they had increased employee numbers. When one considers that 28% – more than one in four companies – have had cancellations of orders in recent months, ISME could not be accused of being overly pessimistic in its predictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Equally sobering has been the frank assessment by the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland regarding the major deterrents in the economy to US firms staying here or new United States companies establishing. The message from the chamber was blunt and to the point. We have lost our competitiveness which, as we all know, is the key.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">I have listed the various job losses over the past seven weeks. However, if one examines the reason companies are upping sticks and leaving, it is not that they are going out of business but rather, in most cases, that they are simply transferring their operations out of the country. They are moving to low cost countries where labour costs are much cheaper – for example, Hungary in the case of the Waterford plant which has lost 70 jobs. They can make exactly the same product to the same standard but at a much cheaper cost, thereby making much greater profit for their United States shareholders.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">In spite of the mountain of evidence that insurance costs are way out of line with those in developed countries and adding hugely to employer difficulties, nothing substantial has happened. I mentioned earlier the new agency which has been set up in relation to the processing of claims. We have been very strong on diagnosis over a long period and on the prescriptions: awards and legal costs are too high, and the system is too cumbersome and needs to be streamlined. However, as of now and in this programme, all we are doing is picking at the problem. I give credit to the current Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, for his actions some years ago as a Minister of State. He decided to grasp the nettle but was faced down by his colleagues because of pressure from the legal eagles. This area must be tackled if we are to make and sustain progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The problem is that there are so many damaging negatives surrounding the economy. Last week, for example, the National Competitiveness Council, NCC, predicted that Ireland was about to become the most expensive country in the euro zone. In 1995 our prices were well below those of our EU partners. Now, because of inflation, we are 2.5% above the EU average and have overtaken our partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The shopping basket speaks for itself. The House should consider the cost of getting sick. A box of the same brand of 12 antibiotic tablets cost €6.60 in Spain, €11.10 in France and €20.50 here. Throughout the whole range of the shopping basket and in regard to residential rents, alcohol, tobacco and restaurants, prices have gone through the roof. People are being ripped off. We are killing the goose that laid the golden egg. If we are trying to achieve recovery of the tourism industry, to have prices pitched at so high a level by comparison with our competitors is extremely damaging. For example, in the year to January 2000, the cost of services provided by the State increased by 15% compared to a national inflation rate of 4.8%.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The analysis from the NCC could not be more blunt or explicit. It states: "More broadly, the price of all goods and services that are subject to significant levels of Government influence accounted for 59% of national inflation in the year 2003." The Forfás report carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers agrees with the broad thrust of the NCC conclusion, although it does not put the figure as high. Nonetheless, it is still extremely high and the implications are obvious and damaging. It means high prices, high inflation and a body blow to competitiveness. Companies based here find that their prices are rising and they will exit from the country as soon as they can find a more attractive foreign base. It is an extremely difficult situation, one not improved by today's announcement that the euro has reached a record high of €1.19 against the US dollar. The high cost of living and housing is a major deterrent to top class researchers and scientists – crucial to industrial development – coming here.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I will finish on a parochial but an important point. The Minister for Finance and his Department reduced the starting salary scale for secretarial assistants working with Deputies and Senators in the Houses of the Oireachtas in October last. This decision was taken, I am told, by the Department of Finance on the basis that it was no longer possible to pay age-related salaries which were deemed to be discriminatory under employment equality legislation. In adjusting the salary scales to reflect his adherence to the employment equality legislation, the Minister fixed the starting salary for secretarial assistants in the Houses of the Oireachtas at €327.82 per week, a massive reduction of €70 for a secretarial assistant on the former starting salary of €398.15 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Despite the secretarial assistants exhausting every measure at their disposal, the Minister and his Department have refused to review the situation. The secretarial assistants and their representatives have pleaded for examination of this matter by the Minister. They have exhausted every channel. Fine Gael, therefore, was obliged to refer the matter to the Labour Court on 7 March 2003. To date, the Department has not even had the courtesy to respond to the Labour Court's invitation to attend a conciliation conference to consider the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Even allowing for the benchmarking award of 8.5%, plus 7% under Sustaining Progress, the secretarial assistants employed since October 2002 will still not have reached the original salary scale of €398.15 per week. I would like the Minister of State to address this issue which has been ignored by his Department. From the point of view of view of fair play, the moral obligation of the Department, cothrom na féine and doing justice to the workers concerned, this matter should be addressed and the Minister should at least respond to the Labour Court invitation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_96">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_265">I welcome the Minister of State. While I have no knowledge of the situation pertaining to the secretarial assistants, if the facts are as stated by Senator Higgins, I would have a good deal of sympathy with the case made.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Senator also gave a very fair historical analysis of one of the most notable achievements of the past 15 years, social partnership. While it is not the only ingredient of our economic success and social progress, it has certainly been a very powerful one. This is the sixth agreement. As somebody who has come from the Department of the Taoiseach, the acronyms roll off the tongue: Programme for National Recovery, PESP, PCW, P2000 and PPF. I am not sure what this agreement is – perhaps SP, although I do not think it has been worked out yet.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I congratulate all of the social partners, especially the trade union leader, Senator O'Toole. The trade unions have always been a key partner in the process. I also pay tribute to a group which is perhaps mentioned less often, civil servants. They are involved in all the committees and, certainly in regard to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance, immensely committed to the process. They have built up tremendous expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">The critics of the process come from both directions. On the one side, there is the ultra-leftist element in the trade union movement which would clearly prefer a kamikaze, Scargill-type leadership and, on the other, the rigorous, right wing neo-liberals who always dismiss these agreements as just wage agreements. They are a great deal more than that. If they were just that, they would only have half the merit. The inclusivity of all social partners is important. I am glad that the farmers' organisations and the social and community pillars decided, though not without hesitation, to come on board. As far as the farmers' organisations are concerned, it is far more important to get increases on the REPS than the 20% on roll-over relief for what in many cases is a significant windfall payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">One does hear odd voices from different parts of the spectrum, arguing that social partnership in some way detracts from democracy. I have always disagreed with that argument. It is an addition and an amplification of democracy. Democracy, in my definition, means the greatest possible popular participation. This House was an early attempt – one can argue not very far-reaching – to recognise the different vocational elements in society, agriculture, labour, industrial, and so on. Social partnership in that regard is more effective in achieving that recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">We live in difficult economic times. It is not clear how long these difficult circumstances will continue. As we have seen before, international agencies like the OECD and the EU tend to predict the upturn will happen in the autumn or early next year. Often it can take much longer than people care to anticipate. Senator Higgins pointed out that we now have the challenge of the strength of the euro on the currency markets. That said, we did live for two or three years with the punt at parity with sterling. Though we are not at that equivalent stage, if we could do it before, then presumably we ought to be in the position to do it again.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Some of the economic debate of the last year or two centred on whether the economy would have a soft or hard landing. I will state, though I heavily qualify my remark as we do not know how long the difficulties will last, so far we have had a soft landing. Unemployment is still only at 4.5%. If it stays at that rate, it will not be too bad. Senator Higgins gave a list of job losses. I wish I had come equipped with a similar list of job gains. I am not denying the job losses and the pain they have caused. Recently, Tipperary town experienced it with the PAL factory closure. However, there are some positives in all of this. While we lose some investment, we are still managing to attract it. We are going to face a competitive challenge form Eastern Europe. If that requires us to up our game, so be it.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">It is a tribute to the negotiators that, despite the wage terms of the agreement, it looks as if the trade unions, in particular, were accepting something a little under par with regard to the expected rate of inflation. It may be that with the downward pressures on inflation, especially with the strengthening exchange rate, they will have to do a little bit better than using the rate of inflation. Good luck to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Last year a small firm employer told me in Drogheda that the great benefit of social partnership, particularly for small firm employers, was that it gave a reasonable degree of certainty and stability in industrial relations. Employers did not have to enter into difficult negotiations with their workforce. There were clear guidelines that benefited industrial relations in small, and by definition, vulnerable, businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Benchmarking has been attacked in some quarters. I have always defended it. It is often attacked because what the public service does is not measured by the profit line. However, as we noted this morning, not all the huge pay increases at the top of the scale are measured by the profit line either. The public service – teachers, health workers etc. – makes just as valuable a contribution to society as the private sector. I would not extol the public sector above the private sector, but if benchmarking is needed to attract and keep people in the public sector, as well as providing for industrial peace, then it is worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">There are problems anticipated in the health services and the point has already been made by the Minister of State. Sustaining Progress, at paragraph 23.2 on the modernisation of the health service, states:</p>
          <p eId="para_276">The parties to this Agreement recognise the paramount importance of a stable industrial relations climate. The need for stability is all the greater in the context of implementing the Health Strategy, which envisages improving and extending services, underpinning investment, and the requirement for modernisation, change and reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">There are many problems in the health service, yet, health service workers, some of whom have achieved large wage increases in the recent past, should not operate on the assumption that the public and the media will back the blank cheque approach to solving problems within the health service. If it is claimed that the Government is acting contrary to Sustaining Progress, we should have chapter and verse on that. If we are to achieve progress in health, descending into industrial relations chaos is not going to be the way to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">It is important that we do not talk down the economy. In many respects, the economy is in a strong position. I read over the weekend some of the problems faced by the German economy with some 4.5 million people unemployed, a yawning deficit and unsustainable social provisions. The Irish economy is in a much stronger position than that. There is a temptation in the media to preach economic hell and damnation. Sometimes the Opposition succumb to that as well. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Lemass, used to criticise the Department of Finance for its inverted Micawberism, always waiting for something to turn down. That is a temptation that should be resisted.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The programme recognises that the main challenge we are facing is one of consolidation. We need to hold on to the considerable economic and social gains we have made, as well as building on them. Nothing would be easier than to fritter them away. One can spend decades building up an economic reputation and then destroy it within six months. It can be hard to recover that ground. It is tremendously important, having made the huge effort collectively over the past 15 years, that we do not throw it away in more difficult circumstances. The fact that this agreement is in place is a considerable assurance that people intend to tackle the problems constructively and together.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I want to mention the cost of insurance, although this is by no means the first time I have mentioned it. The Irish Life annual report for 2002 came into my home because one of my children has a small number of shares in the company. Irish Life's profit increased from €46 million in 2001 to €290 million in 2002, a 600% increase. We are all aware from our personal experience of outrageous increases in the cost of insurance. Will the barn in the farmyard fall down because of the events of 11 September 2001? Hardly, but people have been faced with demands amounting to a several hundred per cent increase. This is an example of the huge profits being made, certainly by one company, on the back of that event. If that is not the case, and I do not pretend to be an expert on the insurance industry, I would like a detailed explanation for this huge increase because there is no doubt that it is having a crippling effect on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I would like to see the Government, the Tánaiste and the Department adopt a vigorous approach to the insurance industry. At times we may have tended, officially anyway, to be a little too protective in that we needed a strong and solid insurance industry and so on, but not at the expense of the rest of the economy. This is something the social partners need to get their teeth into and examine the profits of the insurance companies in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 and call them to account in the Oireachtas if that is necessary.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_282">I thank the Minister of State for outlining the position. It gives me great pleasure to discuss this issue. I strongly support the points made earlier by Senator Mansergh about the effort that goes into the production of such a report. I ask the Minister to convey my thanks to the teams of civil servants who worked day and night and at weekends over a long period, and have done so for the past 16 years each time it was necessary. I mention in particular the three lead Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment which were involved. The team co-ordinated by the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department, Dermot McCarthy, was superb.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">I will break with precedent and say that the Minister's adviser here today, Ciaran Connolly, had a huge input into the work in terms of modernisation and flexibility. Mr. Connolly and his team would give anybody watching their operation a great sense of confidence in the Civil Service and the way it goes about its work. It is important to say that because we often argue with them. Indeed, I often banged the table across from these people but, whatever differences I had with them, I never questioned their commitment in terms of what they are trying to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">From the narrow point of view of trade unions, and I will speak more broadly later in my contribution, I agree with many of the points made by Senator Higgins on the importance of making partnership work and keeping a check on it afterwards to ensure it delivers. The advances made in the area of minimum pay, redundancy payments and union recognition are the most significant in quantitative terms ever made in those areas. In the redundancy area it has been the greatest advance since the scheme was established. In the area of union recognition, we did not get what we were looking for but we made significant advances on those made previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Government's change in its approach to the charter of rights in Europe was the most significant aspect for the trade union leadership, although I have not seen a line or a paragraph in any newspaper about it. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government were prepared to change their position on an issue that had embarrassed the social partners in Europe in terms of the position they were taking. This was hugely important to the leadership of the trade union movement and I want to record that they were supportive of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">As I said to many trade unions when we were selling this, the process of negotiation is very simple. One spends weeks and months trying to hammer out a deal and nobody is ever happy with the outcome. In my 30 years of negotiation I have never been satisfied with the outcome of negotiations. I presume one never should be if it is to be fair negotiation, unless the other side collapses completely. It is always about compromise and when we sit down at the table we know that. Having achieved what we achieved, however, I believe it is a good deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">A point was raised about the level of expectation. People had higher expectations and others talked about inflation but here is an interesting point. I said three months ago, and I say it with even more confidence today, that when the 18 months is at an end we will have had an increase higher than the rate of inflation over that period. I am certain of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Senator Mansergh and a number of speakers made reference to those who constantly talk down the economy. It is interesting to go back over the Sunday newspapers for the months of November and December last when all the great commentators gave their views on the economy. I am talking in particular about the people who forecast increases in inflation and so on. Five months later, only one of those commentators has proven to be right, that is Davy Kelleher McCarthy. The Dublin footballer got it right about inflation. Our view in the trade union movement, and on the Government side, based on the information before us, was that there were deflationary pressures which would bring down inflation and that is proving to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I make that point because these forecasters should be shown up on every occasion. They have the greatest brass necks in society. We talk about many groups but these people can pop up on "Morning Ireland" or television programmes, a month after getting it wrong about growth, inflation, deflation and other aspects of the economy, and give a new set of forecasts, yet nobody asks them about the previous set. They should be challenged every time and I am fed up asking radio interviewers to remind these people about their previous forecasts.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">It is interesting to watch what is happening with the euro. We all believe that people in the service industry and other sectors took advantage of the introduction of the euro. There was inflation at that stage which was driven by greed rather than anything else, and we have all paid the price for that, but we have also seen the gains. <i>The Economist</i> used to be dearer in Ireland than in any other country in Europe. At least that was always my view when I saw the different prices in lire, francs, Belgian francs, Deutschmark or whatever, but it is now approximately €4 in every euro country. It is interesting to make those comparisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">We used to hear about Mac economics, which was based on the price of the Big Mac in various countries throughout the world. We all should have our own price measurements. The comparison I make when I travel to other countries in Europe concerns the price of the regular size pizza margherita.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">No, not the drink, the pizza. We are anti-drink at the moment. We cannot mention drink. I am talking about the basic margherita pizza, which one can get anywhere in Italy for about €5.50 to €6, whereas it is difficult to get one for less than €7 here. To make comparisons, we should have access to lists showing the price of baskets of commonly purchased goods in the various European Union countries. I have noticed convergence in some areas. More surveys such as the Forfás report published last week would increase downward pressure on prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Recently, I was asked about the housing initiative to which the Minister of State referred. People have short memories. One of the commitments made in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness negotiated three or four years ago was that at least 50,000 housing units would be built each year. Every commentator on the PPF said this objective could not and would not be achieved. I remember trying to explain the issue to trade unionists opposed to the measure. It is a tribute to social partnership and a major achievement that 58,000 housing units were built last year and more than 50,000 in each of the two previous years. I do not want to return to the discussion on who owns development land and its appalling manipulation. At least we are making progress and the new initiative on social housing will deliver even greater advances.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I am the type of person who likes to remind people of promises they have made. The Minister for Finance agreed to fund the pay award recommended in the benchmarking report, under certain conditions. He delivered on his undertaking, despite the advice of all the commentators, including my good colleague Senator Ross every Sunday, not to meet the cost of benchmarking. This was an extremely important decision. I appreciate it when people deliver on deals in which business is done and hands shaken. This has been the case through thick and thin in the partnership process and is part of the basis of social partnership. It also means, however, that I have to sell my soul when representing my membership in some negotiations or do deals of which one would not be proud. Ultimately, the reason we are paid our salaries is that we are prepared to prostitute ourselves on behalf of our members. The condition is that both sides must deliver on any agreements reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">The Minister of State raised the qualitative nature of benchmarking and the importance of ensuring modernisation and flexibility form part of the process. I wish to address the myth that trade unions are opposed to modernisation or flexibility. This is not the case. At the same time, however, trade union members are no different from other workers in that, like everybody else, they feel threatened by major change. The most difficult aspect of life is implementing change as it is a natural source of worry and fear. It is important that the changes agreed continue to proceed gradually. Under the headings, Education, Health, Local Authority and Civil Service, we have outlined a significant number of issues on which progress must be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">The Minister of State and Senator Mansergh referred to the importance of industrial peace. I fully support industrial peace, it is part of the new agreement and was one of the objectives of the participants in the process. If difficulties arise in this regard, they must be addressed. We have created ways for doing this and will stick to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">In every part of the social partnership process, particularly in the trade union movement, there are what I describe as career nihilists for whom all outcomes will be a sell-out, betrayal or the worst decision ever made. They will argue in favour of walking away from social partnership, which is an unfortunate position as it creates uncertainty, distrust and problems. People with a negative approach to life will always find a receptive audience because the forces of "No" are always more powerful that the forces of "Yes" in all parts of this island, not just among Unionists and loyalists in the North. Persuading people to buy into change is always difficult. Social partnership is about the management of change.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I ask the Minister of State to take with him one message, namely, that social partnership does not apply only at the highest levels, but must also have depth and operate at ground level. It must mean asking people in accident and emergency departments their views on how such departments could be more effectively managed. It is about ensuring that people at all levels use their brains at work and give their views on how this might be done best.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">It also means that those making decisions must share the decision-making process with others. There is a significant lack of confidence in this regard in Government Departments and industry. People are afraid to consult because they do not have the confidence to say "No". However, consulting people does not mean one has to be led by them. People need to be given a good hearing and their views taken on board. They should also be told when their comments do not fit in. We must do this honestly and openly to ensure people are not afraid of the process. Workers must be stakeholders in the services and products they deliver or the industry of which they are part.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I wish to address briefly the issue of democracy in the partnership process. The Government is part of social partnership and should report more often to one or both of the Houses or a joint committee on progress being made in negotiations. All the other parties to the negotiations do this. The trade union leadership must seek the approval of its members, representatives of the farming organisations must consult their members which, as the Minister of State will be aware, they do not do quietly, while IBEC and the employers representatives also consult their members. There is, therefore, no reason the Government side should not report to the Houses on progress and the objectives it hopes to achieve. This would ensure that all concerned would at least buy into those objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">As a trade unionist, my role in negotiations is to increase the proportion of national wealth allocated to the trade union members I represent, while others want to maintain the <i>status quo</i> or shift wealth in other directions. The issue at stake is simple. Wealth is created and shared through profit, reinvestment or taxation which is then redistributed towards services, the support of the disadvantaged in society, the running of the State etc. The process can only begin if wealth is created in the first instance, which is conditional on whether we are competitive. The trade union movement is committed to competitiveness because its members know there is no future without it. We will work on this as well as on the control of inflation and the expansion of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">In the past 15 years, Ireland has moved from having the worst debt to GNP ratio in western Europe to having the best, with the exception of Luxembourg, which in some senses does not count. Although we have the highest rate of inflation in the European Union, we also have its highest growth rate. In such circumstances, making a fair comparison would require that we take as our inflation target the average EU inflation rate plus 50%. While I accept we are not within reach of that target now, it must be our objective. It would be impossible to sustain our current levels of growth while keeping inflation at the European average. We are catching up with other members states.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I could say much more on the issue of partnership. It has brought people closer together and forced Members on this side of the House to understand the problems facing those on the other side and <i>vice versa</i>, which has been good for all of us.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_100">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_305">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this subject, which has, as Senator O'Toole stated, become an integral part of the society in which we live and the way in which we conduct our business. Social partnership has been a feature of public life here since 1987 and the partnership process has become an accepted part of our political arrangements and essential component of the way in which our system of economical management functions. Ireland has achieved great success in recent times, to which social partnership undoubtedly made a significant contribution. In particular, it has helped us to deal with change and cope with the rapidly changing demands of the international marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Our economy has undergone dynamic changes and a process of adjustment during the past 15 years. Old industries have closed, but new ones have replaced them. Old technologies have been abandoned, but new ones have been embraced and old work practices have been jettisoned and new ones adopted. Employers and workers have proved that partnership is the key to the workplace and our future success. It facilitates change in management for everyone's benefit. This is a crucial part of the partnership process.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Globalisation was seen as a threat by many people in recent years, but we saw it as an opportunity to be embraced. The more we opened our economy to outside investment, influences and competition, the more we succeeded. Our model is now being copied by many other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Social partnership was an easy system to operate during the past five to six years. We had a rapidly growing economy, the capacity to increase public spending substantially and the ability to deliver generous increases in social supports. However, we are now dealing with a more demanding situation. The international economy has slowed remarkably. We continue to out perform our European neighbours, but we have not been immune to the pressures of international recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The rapid appreciation in the value of our currency in recent months adds to our difficulties. The euro reached an all-time high against the dollar today. A rising currency is good news for us in terms of inflation. A strong euro means that we do not import price inflation from the dollar and the sterling areas. However, a rising euro represents a challenge for exporters. Ireland is an exporting country. Statistics show that we are now one of the greatest trading nations in the world, particularly if we measure international trade as a percentage of our total economic output. Our ability to deal with this challenge will be crucial to our continued economic success.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I hope that social partnership will help us to deal with that challenge just as it helped us to deal with similar challenges during the past 15 years. The new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is comprehensive and covers a wide range of issues relating to social inclusion, employment and economic progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">A feature of all partnership agreements from the outset has been a commitment to pay moderation. This is a central part of the new deal. We can pay ourselves lavish wage increases, but if they are not supported by productivity improvements the net result will be an increase in unemployment. That would undoubtedly be a step backwards. It is vital that we maintain moderate wage levels and that we do not price ourselves out of competitive export markets and ultimately jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Sustaining Progress includes provision for the payment of benchmarking awards. Benchmarking is an important issue, not just for those who work in the public service but for the entire country. The benchmarking awards will close any gap that exists between the public and private sectors in terms of wage levels. I hope that the awards will also deliver the reforms necessary to modernise our public service and make it more responsive to the needs of a rapidly changing economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">There is a price to be paid for everything. We, as public representatives, have to continuously enforce the principles behind the social partnership. As Senator O'Toole said, it is a <i>quid pro quo</i>; it is a partnership deal. We must make ourselves more productive in return for the demands made on the economy in regard to wage increases. I hope this social partnership agreement will be embraced in good spirit. Social partnership has served the country well in recent years and, if embraced, Sustaining Progress will be the cornerstone for our future economic success.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_101">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_314">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, and I congratulate him on the tremendous work he is doing in the Department. I look forward to some wonderful decisions in regard to decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">I have, for the first time, had the opportunity to vote for an agreement as a member of SIPTU. I am in the House as a SIPTU member and nominee of professional associations. I was delighted when the document was issued because I could contribute a vote in favour of it. It is an excellent agreement. Some features of the agreement, such as those regarding affordable housing, are important. The constitutional review in regard to property rights will also have a bearing on the excessive price of housing. The cost of housing is totally inflated and it is difficult for any young person, couple or partners to buy a new home. There is a major difference between buying a house now and the position that obtained 30 years ago, when it was much easier to build one's own home. It is important, therefore, that this document is given priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I compliment the Government on its introduction of the improved redundancy payments from last Sunday. This is a major development. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, brought the relevant legislation forward in a most expeditious way and it was passed by both Houses on 25 May. It will help those who lose their jobs in these difficult and challenging times. We are fighting to maintain our position in a market where the strength of the euro is not a help.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The Forfás consumer price report 2003 – which was compiled on Forfás behalf by PricewaterhouseCoopers and published in the past week – clearly indicates that we are outpricing ourselves. We will have to take action, individually and collectively, to bring prices down. Today I launched the "name and shame" consumer campaign, which is linked to this agreement on the basis of the excessive prices for goods and services operating in the Irish market. There is free choice as far as prices are concerned. Bearing in mind that I was launching the campaign, I brought this issue to the attention of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs, whose support I was seeking. Its outlook is that if people comply with the law in regard to the display of prices, they are free to set their own price. The product prices regulations of 2002 require the individual pricing of products in each supermarket or shop and the display of prices in garages. That is the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">There is a good case to be made for having a barcode machine in stores – some stores already have them – for checking prices prior to going to the check-out. Then if the price is not quite clear the customer can find out exactly what his or her basket of groceries will cost. If the customer does not like the price, my advice is to put the item back on the shelf.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The campaign I launched today will run for the month of June and will mobilise people throughout the country to contact the Consumers Association of Ireland, which has agreed to support the campaign in order to highlight the best and worst examples of competitive pricing. The Leader, Senator O'Rourke, has agreed that we will have a debate in the House in early July – when the campaign is complete – on the Forfás report. In that debate, I hope I can name and shame those traders who are making excessive profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">On the journey from Roscommon to Dublin today I noticed a differential of 11 cent in the price of unleaded petrol. That is an example of the lack of competition. There seems to be an agreement between all the traders in some towns to keep the price of petrol the same. However, that is not the case in other towns. The public should be more aware of prices. If people are not satisfied with the price in one store, they should make their views known to the owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The minimum grocery price order was part of Government policy for some time. It was put in place to ensure major outlets would not have loss leaders and to limit the size of superstores on the outskirts of towns. However, that is not the main issue. When our surveys are completed, it may be possible to impose maximum price levels on drink and food. The restaurant sector is seen as a serious contender in this regard. The report published by Forfás states the increases in consumer prices over the past five years have sharply outpaced those in our European neighbours. Ireland is the second highest in the euro zone after Finland. Pubs and restaurants are the worst offenders, with the most expensive food from low priced outlets, the second from mid-priced outlets and the third from high priced outlets. The power is in the hands of consumers and we must empower them to use it. As Members of this House, we must take action through Government policies to retain the lowest possible and most competitive pricing. We do not want to outprice ourselves as we are now in the euro zone which means people can compare costs in Spain, Greece or anywhere else within the zone. Our costs exceed those in most other European countries, with the exception of Finland, an advanced society with a high standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The agreement the Minister of State outlined is a step forward. I compliment Senator O'Toole, president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. It is a great honour that he is a Member of this House. He has contributed greatly to all the agreements which Senator Mansergh was effective in negotiating when in the Department of Finance and the Department of the Taoiseach. He deserves our praise for the great work he did on all previous agreements. He welcomed the publication of this agreement and praised the higher civil servants responsible for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I fully endorse the agreement because it contains the successful formula of previous agreements, namely, consistent policy framework, macro-economics and structural areas. I wish it every success. It is vital that it works and is adhered to and that first class industrial relations continue. We must retain our competitive edge because, if we do not, we will have difficulty selling our products. As a former Minister of State with responsibility for trade and marketing, I know it is a major advantage that the euro is not strong <i>vis-à-vis</i> the dollar and sterling. However, it is competitive at present. We will compete with the new member states after next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I wish the agreement every success and thank the Minister of State for coming into the House. I invite him to participate in the name and shame campaign in his capacity as Minister of State. I hope he brings it to the attention of the Consumers Association of Ireland which will be delighted to investigate excessive pricing. I noticed during my trip from Roscommon to Dublin this morning that one of the best prices for petrol was in County Westmeath.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_325">When I was in County Meath over the weekend I noted that the price of unleaded petrol was more than €1 a litre, the highest price I have seen. Senator Leyden probably did not notice this on his trip from Roscommon to Dublin but he might like to note it as one of the most extraordinary price increases we have seen recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I recall speaking in 1992 to a college friend who had emigrated to London, as many did in the early to mid-1980s, because of the lack of employment opportunities. He got married there and is now working successfully. When he came home in the early 1990s, he said things had improved and that he wanted to know the key to it. We discussed the national programmes and the manner in which they had been used successfully to turn around the situation we faced in the mid-1980s of high unemployment, serious economic difficulty and emigration, which had caused a huge drain on the economy. There is no doubt the formula used in the national programmes, including Sustaining Progress, of bringing all the partners together and hammering out a national agreement whereby there would be industrial peace and wage levels would be set at a certain level which would help employers was successful. The Government, in turn, kept its side of the arrangement. It worked successfully in conjunction with major investment from the European Union for education, roads and other infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The national programmes since the late 1980s have been a major contributor to our economic prosperity and enhanced economic performance. However, things have changed, some for the better. How well will this formula work in a changed environment and how well will the programme work over its lifetime? It was interesting to note the level of difficulty the Government faced in the late stages of the negotiations on the programme, particularly its efforts to keep the voluntary and community pillar and farmers on board, as the Minister of State knows. What is in it for some groups and why should they stay in it? Some elements of our society are probably wondering if it is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">There is a major change in our economic environment. In the past year, in particular, a number of people have faced problems. Inflation was mentioned on more than one occasion in the House. It is causing problems across the board. Job losses have started to rise in recent months. It is fine to talk about benchmarking and pay increases but that will not help someone who does not have a job. The increases in indirect taxation since the last general election mean that the value of many people's pay packets is considerably undermined by increased ESB bills, third level registration fees and hospital charges. The situation has changed a lot in the past year. One must ask if the agreement is capable of maintaining the level of economic activity we need.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The Minister of State did not refer to the voluntary and community or agricultural sectors, yet he mentioned the housing issue, flexibility and increased productivity linked to benchmarking, without specifying what that entails. He also did not refer to the problems that have emerged at the heart of the partnership process, which must be addressed if this structure is to be maintained in its current form. What thought is the Government putting into this? Does it intend to abandon this structure or does it plan to alter the partnership process to make it more flexible and relevant for the future? The Minister of State did not address this issue, which is crucial, particularly given our changed economic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Senator Leyden referred to the expansion of the European Union over the next number of years. Ireland will have to be competitive in that changed environment. The world economy has changed and Ireland will also have to compete in that environment. How much planning is the Government doing for the future? Will the partnership process serve the economy as well as it has done in the past?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_331">I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is funny how times change. I did a course in industrial relations in the National Institute of Higher Education, Limerick, in the 1980s and I recall writing a project on whether there would be another agreement and what it would be called. I do not recollect what I thought it would be called but I predicted there would be another agreement. Nobody at the time, including the gurus in the Departments of Finance and Industry and Commerce, failed to predict the success of the agreements and the difference they made to the economy and Ireland's position in the global economy. The history of the agreements needs to be borne in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I pursued a part-time course in Limerick and worked full-time for a recruitment agency in Galway, which paid my tuition fees. There was significant unemployment in the State and the agency more or less ran a social service for the unemployed. I recall letters landing on my desk from numerous public representatives asking for help for various individuals who came from great families. There were no jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Digital had a plant in Galway and used a temporary workforce. It was great when people got a three-month temporary contract to work for the company because they experienced a manufacturing environment for the first time. They were able to include that experience in their CVs and seek alternative work if their contracts were not renewed for another three months. The opportunity to work at the coal face of a multinational organisation made a difference to people in the west.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I use the same recruitment company nowadays and it is frantically trying to find people to fill temporary production positions for which they would earn more than the minimum wage. People are being hired on temporary visas from the United States and New Zealand, countries with which Ireland has agreements. The workforce in Galway is mobile and flexible because there is more work than the locals can handle. This should be mentioned, even though it does not take away from job losses. My heart goes out to people in places such as Donegal, which suffers because of its peripherality, and Waterford where jobs were lost at an engineering company.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">We must ask what has happened and whether it will be sustained. I spoke to the general manager of a multinational company recently and he asked me whether I knew what was killing the company. I said I was aware there were difficulties related to wage costs and competitiveness but he said it was the cost of logistics, including rent, insurance and insurance claims. Many people are bringing claims against companies that have adopted good health and safety practices. I am worried that false claims under the employer's liability scheme have not been eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The cost of doing business in Ireland is increasing on a daily basis. Insurance costs are killing both large and small organisations. Competitiveness is vital. I do not pretend to understand economics but in the old days Ireland was able to match the US dollar for dollar in terms of production costs. We knew we could not compete with the Philippines or India and we hoped we could beat the US and, therefore, attract multinational companies, but we are not doing that anymore. It is incredible that companies in the US can make products cheaper than their counterparts in Ireland. That is frightening.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The basis of our economic policy should be the reduction of inflation and improving competitiveness by driving down costs to ensure companies continue to invest in Ireland and provide jobs that are needed. Economic growth must be enhanced. The Taoiseach attended a function in Galway last Saturday night and he spoke about Ireland's position in the world economy in terms of growth. Officials from various EU member states meet our Ministers and officials at Council meetings and they are envious of Ireland's economic growth. While growth is not in double digits anymore, it is much better than in other member states. Our economic growth needs to be enhanced and fertilised so that we can eradicate the inflationary and anti-competitive weeds. We need to ensure core industries are examined and costs are reduced so that we can create a competitive environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Continued industrial peace is a key factor in this regard. There has been an increase in the number of industrial disputes in recent years. That does not help nationally. Perhaps we need to move from the bad old days when people embarked on industrial action when disputes were not working out. Ireland cannot afford that anymore.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">The INO conference is being held at the airport hotel in Dublin and during a radio report this morning nurses said they would consider industrial action to fight cutbacks. That is not the way to fight the challenges in front of us. Industrial action never saved anybody. It cost us jobs, competitiveness and investment. Industrial peace and the moves that we have built into this agreement are crucially important for our continued development.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">It is interesting that affordable housing has been identified in this agreement as one of the key drivers in terms of policy delivery and what we want to give back to the people. More and more people who visit my clinic on a weekly basis are saving the money they need to put down their deposit, ensuring that they have enough work to earn sufficient money to buy an affordable house and then getting into the system to benefit from that scheme. People do not want to be provided for by the State. They want to buy their own homes. The brilliant thing now is that they are doing so, either on their own as single people or together as couples. That is the way we will continue to go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I did not know until recently that under the working time legislation a person who works by choice for more than 48 hours commits a criminal act and can be prosecuted for choosing to do so. If I have one job in which I work for 39 hours, Monday to Friday, but also have a part-time job at weekends because I want to save to go to Australia, I can be prosecuted, as can my employer, even though I am working by choice. I sometimes wonder where our sense of entrepreneurship and drive have gone. While it is not the case with this agreement, we can move too far over towards protecting employees from themselves without realising that sometimes we need to let them look after themselves.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_342">I have more than doubts about this document. I recognise that when a debate of this sort happens in this House, people take the opportunity to speak about anything they feel like. It is a very wide-ranging debate with very few interruptions from the Chair regarding relevance, simply because this document is so all-embracing that one can speak virtually on any issue affecting the public finances or public policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">What does that tell us about the document? It tells me that it is a document which could be an election manifesto, an agreement or programme for Government or just a pay deal, which is the bones of it. However, it is a pay deal with an awful lot of cosmetic and aspirational dressing around it. It tells me that the governance of this country is not taking place in this building and that power rests elsewhere. I regret very much the readiness of all parties in this House to take so much dictatorship of policy, principally from the trade union movement but also from others whom they so benignly call the social partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">This is, I think, the fifth document of its sort—</p>

          <p eId="para_345">The sixth.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_346">It is the sixth document of its sort, and Fianna Fáil backbenchers in particular will tell one privately that they have far less access to Ministers than those who are now dubbed the social partners. They have a democratic mandate, the social partners do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">This is not the most powerful of all the documents issued over the six-document period but is a programme that will, to a certain extent, probably be adhered to. This reveals where the power lies because this is not just a pay deal. It is full of aspirations about other issues. It is not as bad as some of the previous agreements, where even foreign policy was agreed between the Government and trade unions, employers, farmers and a few others when it was absolutely none of their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I regret that this pay deal has extended the power of these social partners and deprived Members of the Oireachtas of power. The price of the pay deal, which the Government has been so anxious to agree, has been to allow those with no mandate from the electorate to dictate policy in other areas. The effect is to emasculate Members of the Oireachtas, to reduce their influence and show a certain contempt for democracy. Many Members of this House have realised this over a period of time and many privately resent it. However, many are very reluctant to speak up on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The reason is quite simple. There is no doubt that the most powerful extra-democratic group is undoubtedly the public service unions. The most obvious manifestation of that is the pay deal struck in this document. It is difficult to tell, whatever people say, how much the public service pay deal will cost but it will certainly cost over €1 billion initially. Members of this House are silent on that pay deal, from which we all will benefit greatly. Week after week, they come in here and bleat for special pleading on third level fees and other issues, but they are very happy to go along with an extravagant deal to buy off public service unions, which the country cannot afford.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">It is not just because we are beneficiaries of it that we are silent. That is not, to be fair, the real reason. We will do very well out of the increases that are coming and will get some very nice back-pay cheques in the next few weeks. However, the real reason people do not speak up against benchmarking in these Houses is that politicians are terrified of the public service unions. There is no doubt about that. If people listened to the private sector outside this House – I am talking about private sector workers, not just employers – they would find that the resentment at this deal runs very deep.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Members of this House feel, as politicians – we all suffer from it – that if they keep reasonably silent this will go away and they will not get the blame for it. However, I do not know any independent economists who have said this deal is good for Ireland, good for the economy or can even be afforded by this economy. I suggest this is because it cannot be afforded, and in the present circumstances it is the most extravagant of all the pay deals.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The public service has been bought off for the moment. There was a very clever device whereby the benchmarking body was set up. Coincidentally, it reported on 30 June 2002, after the general election, so it kept the public service unions very quite until then, while they were blatantly tic-taced that they were to get a very good deal. That was perfectly obvious to anybody who watched what happened. It is no coincidence that the only private sector person on that benchmarking body, Mr. Jim O'Leary, an economist, resigned before that body reported. This happened because there was obviously a tacit agreement that after the general election these guys would get what they wanted. Many believed they would be quiet until that point and that the payment would be made then. That is exactly what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The benchmarking body never revealed the criteria used for making the realignments in the public service. There was a degree of secrecy which would do credit to the Masonic Order. Now after the general election all this money will be paid. Back money is being used to keep the public service unions happy. A vote has been held and because public service unions are far stronger than private sector unions, this will go through. There is silence. How many in either House have spoken against this issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_355">How many outside feel very strongly that it is a bad idea? Is it just coincidence that there is some sort of unanimity in the Houses, when outside there is no such unanimity? This arises from fear of the unions and an embarrassment that we are beneficiaries of this deal, which cannot be afforded.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">There are two extraordinary details in the document. One is the cosmetic nature of the aspirational items it contains. It is obvious that there is a great deal of guilt written into the document. While we hear so much about price inflation, as mentioned by both Senators Leyden and Higgins, we hear nothing about wage inflation. We have exorbitant wage inflation which will contribute greatly to our lack of competitiveness. Nothing can be done once excessive wage increases have been awarded to those who do not need it. Public servants are the most protected group with secure pensions and pay while some are living in poverty and others, taking risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">In order to give some sort of fig leaf to the inflationary aspect, the Government has set up what it calls an anti-inflation initiative, mentioned on page 71 of the document. It is the greatest drivel I have ever read in any document ever produced by any social partners. It talks about "aggressive efforts" and "target-driven approaches". There is jargon throughout which will not make a jot of difference to the inflation rate. The Government knows this perfectly well because it knows the document is contributing to it. This is its effort to apologise.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">I am glad to speak in this debate. This is what makes the Seanad such an agreeable Chamber. Everybody has different points of view and those who hold contrary views can give them full expression here. I am pleased that we can do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Today we are debating Sustaining Progress. While I do not know who thinks up the names every time there is a new agreement, it is to their credit that they have never had to repeat themselves. The first agreement in 1987 was born out of a time of great concern for the economy. I find it ungenerous of Senator Ross not to state that were it not for the first programme introduced by the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, with the input of Senator Mansergh and many others, we would have been truly down the Swanee.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">We all know the coalition which was in power from 1983 to 1987 when the country underwent a period of sustained over-expenditure which will never again be matched. It pushed us right to the brink and if the programme had not been inaugurated, worked through and managed, we would be in a very dangerous position, as Senator Ross knows. As we all know, the country was rescued. While we can say much about other matters concerning the people involved, credit is due for this. Leadership was given and reciprocated by the trade unions, the employers' bodies, the voluntary sector and everybody involved, and it worked.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_365">The farmers were, of course, involved. At the time the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, was a rising star in the IFA, as he is now in his new role. Everybody pulled together and the economy was saved. We continued and are now into our sixth programme. Senator Higgins's party was involved in one of them when Deputy John Bruton was Taoiseach. They continued with a spirit of co-operation and compromise and a determination that the economy would perform strongly within Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">As a Minister, when I was in Brussels speaking to Ministers from other countries, I was asked how Ireland, as a small open economy trading globally, had managed for more than a decade to sustain very strong economic growth. We continue to have strong economic growth, although at a much lower and realistic level. Although, unfortunately, unemployment is increasing, we continue to have high employment, the best in Europe. We have the highest economic and employment growth. Even though three EU countries are not in the euro zone, our rate of inflation, nearly the highest in that zone, is too high. In many cases high employment and growth bring in their wake the kind of inflation we are now experiencing. The mission now is to reduce inflation to a much more realistic level and at the same time maintain good economic and employment growth. Although not always the case, inflation is often a by-product of high growth and employment. Sustaining Progress will seek to align all these matters in so far as it can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">This is a very worthy document. During the years some partnership agreements have been good while others have not been so good. For 16 years there has been strong agreement between all the parties. This agreement is interesting because it deals with affordable housing, which is a very important element in the programme. I am very interested in the verification process and the performance verification groups for each sector in the Civil Service – the health sector, local government, education, etc. Rigorous parameters have been put in place, as have reporting methods for each group. It will be the responsibility of the Secretary General of each Department to claim ownership of this and to work it through to verifiable authentication of its work. That is extremely positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">There have been industrial relations tensions among various groups along the way, but no one was promised Tír na nÓg on entry into these agreements. People had their eyes open going into the agreements, which sought to make the country fairer for employer and employee, for the agricultural community, for disadvantaged groups and so on. We sought to bring all those groups together in a binding social contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">When one tells this story to people from other countries they are astounded that we have had agreements for this length of time – 16 years – under various Governments and that we have managed the economy to a particular level by having such a social contract. There are those who wish to throw this to one side and let free market forces prevail to see how matters develop, We would do badly in that situation because we would not have the confidence in ourselves that this programme provides.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Senator Ross said that everyone in the wider world – where, no doubt, he is a shining star –is giving out and cavilling about this agreement. I have met no such people. I do not sit at home all weekend sewing a fine seam. Like most people, I go out and mix with individuals from all levels of all society. I have heard no one come out with a sustained dirge about this programme; quite the contrary, people are quite glad it has been put in place in a fair and equitable way. They are congratulating all sides involved in the political debate because of the general consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Some people do not like consensus and I understand that. I am sparky enough myself and I would not want consensus on everything. At the same time, consensus on matters such as going forward with the economy with a well thought out programme such as this, which brings sections of society together in a non-combative, non-envious way, is surely to be applauded. That is what the document seeks to do. It will have to be verified, monitored and delivered on and those are tasks for all of us, not just the groups formally set up for those purposes. However, let us not continue to run ourselves down. I do not know why we moan about ourselves all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I commend the agreement and I commend the hearts and minds of those who worked on it. The Seanad will watch the progress of Sustaining Progress and we will have regular reports on it. I thank the Minister of State for coming before the House. We will have to make him an honorary Member because he is here so often.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">Senator Higgins raised the issue of job losses, but ours is still the second lowest unemployment rate in Europe. As Senator Mansergh said, there are some good news stories in this regard and I was happy to be associated with one. A good friend of mine, Gerry McCaughey of Century Homes, announced over 300 jobs last week, some of them in my constituency. We hope we can turn the corner in this situation though we cannot be complacent.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Senator O'Toole was quite complimentary about the agreement, perhaps because he was on the winning side. He was very complimentary about the Civil Service and I echo his comments. My past experience has been on the other side, lobbying at negotiating meetings. Nobody ever declares full satisfaction—</p>

          <p eId="para_377">—and less so this time. It can be difficult to get a consensus. In addition, the sophistication of negotiators has improved substantially over the years. It took a long time to achieve consensus this time. The fact that it is an 18-month pay agreement is probably a weakness, but that is as much on which consensus could be achieved. The Government would have wished for a longer pay agreement and a lower rate, but, though people were trying to reach a consensus, we ended up with a three-year national social partnership and an 18-month pay agreement. As stated earlier, it follows on from a very successful formula which is already in place and the very words "Sustaining Progress" suggest that it is about continuing with the progress that has been made. It takes into account the more difficult national and global fiscal situation that now exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">In terms of priorities and timeframes for delivery across all the areas, the pay agreement runs for 18 months and provides greater flexibility in an uncertain economic environment. There is greater acknowledgement by the parties to the agreement that, over the period of Sustaining Progress, there will be limited scope for future increases in public expenditure. Improvements in public services will be sought primarily through a greater focus on priorities and some reallocation of existing expenditures as well as through accelerated modernisation and change across all sectors of the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Regarding some of the key features of the programme, there is considerable emphasis in the public expenditure area on an improved monitoring and evaluation system, on prioritisation, on assessment of outcomes and on the provision of value for money. Value for money is something to which we all have to aspire. There will be a major focus on some elements which feel they got the best deal to do the business and to give value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Implementation of the agreement will be overseen by a high level steering group composed of representatives of each of the social partner pillars and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Finance. There will be a great deal of focus on this and rightly so. It is one thing to get the deal agreed, but it is then all about delivering. It is important to Government and the social partners that this is delivered upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Representatives of employers and union organisations are working with the Government to target domestic sources of inflationary pressure. There is general acceptance that this is a very real worry and something on which everyone has to work. The new affordable housing initiative will be introduced and it is both important and welcome. The Government agreed to an enhancement of the statutory redundancy terms and the fact that this is being implemented so soon is greatly appreciated by people who, as Deputy Higgins said, will find themselves in the unfortunate position of losing their jobs. There will be further redundancies, unfortunately, but redundancy terms have now been enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Regarding public sector pay, the agreement provides for a pay increase of 7% over 18 months, with an initial six-month pay pause. In addition to this increase, the award recommended by the public service benchmarking body will also be implemented as agreed. An important condition of the payment of the general rounds and the final two phases of the benchmarking increases for each sector, organisation and grade is that they are dependent on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change. That means satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the new agreement. Payment is dependent on verification of satisfactory achievement of these provisions. While some might argue – rightly so – that the deal on benchmarking has been generous, the conditions attached are equally strong. We have to see a better return on the other side.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_384">Absolutely. Payment is dependent on verification of results and I expect it will be strongly adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The Government agreed to pay terms which are generous by comparison with those in our trading partners and which will, over the period of the agreement, provide protection for living standards. In return, we can expect the trade unions to deliver on the commitments entered into, in particular, that there will be industrial relations stability. Of all the difficulties we face, that is one we do not have. I note today that all French air traffic is stalled. One can imagine the massive blow that is to the French economy. People may say the pay terms are a high price to pay but they are warranted to guarantee industrial peace in terms of wage difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Sustaining Progress is a further continuation of the social partnership process. Social partnership has served the country well over the past 15 years and benefited all sectors of the community. It provides a process which allows the social partners to address current problems which we all face while also addressing long-term issues affecting the future of the country. In adopting the social partnership approach, we have acknowledged that we value the contribution of the social partners in the development of a better society for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Senator O'Meara referred to the fact that I did not mention the community pillar. I understand it is quite happy and has bought into the process. I am sure it will watch its implementation closely. Likewise, while the negotiations with the farming pillar continued longer, in terms of the major decisions which will be taken nationally, at European level and even globally in terms of the World Trade Organisation, the consensus was that it was better to be in and on the same negotiating team. There are substantial commitments in the agreement to support agriculture in the difficult times ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">It is generally accepted that since its introduction, social partnership has contributed greatly to the enormous improvements in the economy, including the dramatic expansion in employment. However, as I said, we now face challenges in a number of areas in the face of an uncertain economic environment. In the period ahead we need to be able to sustain high levels of employment, maintain competitive investment and bring down inflation. I am confident that Sustaining Progress, if approached with goodwill by all sides, will contribute to this.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_391">I raise the issue of dyslexia, although not on behalf of any organisation. As the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, is aware, the Dyslexia Association of Ireland is a voluntary organisation which relies very much on subscriptions and voluntary inputs from teachers. It has done tremendous work. With its workers, volunteers and all those involved, it would like to see the recommendations made in the 1998 report submitted to the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and published in 2001, implemented. That is the reason I raise the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Service provision and mainstream funding are needed. For example, the group in Letterkenny, County Donegal, has relied on local authority funding. It received €10,000 in development funding last year from local authority subscriptions as an acknowledgement of the work it was doing. This is a major issue and funding, whether for psychologists or otherwise, is required to identify the needs of young people who suffer from dyslexia. I know the group refers to those who suffer from dyslexia but perhaps "suffer" is the wrong word. It is politically incorrect to use the word "suffer" in that the people concerned do not suffer; they just have a different way of looking at things. I bring this issue to the Minister of State's attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline to the House the position on the issue raised by the Senator. All children in the primary system who have been assessed as having special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, have an automatic entitlement to a response to their needs, irrespective of their level or location. The nature and level of the support provided are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Children with dyslexia are generally catered for on an integrated basis in ordinary primary schools where they can be supported by the learning support or resource teacher service. There are over 2,300 resource teachers – whole-time equivalents – and 1,531 learning support teachers in the primary system.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. Decisions on placements are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and parental wishes in relation to their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">Review and assessment of the adequacy of educational provision and support services in mainstream and special classes and schools are carried out as part of the normal work of my Department's inspectorate. All special schools and classes dedicated to children with dyslexia operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1. Pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. Additional resources are allocated to individual second level schools to cater for special needs pupils enrolled in these schools. Applications for resources are referred to the national educational psychological service and each case is considered on its merits.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">My Department also provides funding for schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia. Grant aid is also provided for the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to support its work with persons with dyslexia.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The report of the task force on dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms. Since the task force reported, a number of initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include: the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia; and a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for children with dyslexia.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">In addition to these measures, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate input from the education partners and other interested parties. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are now well advanced. A chief executive officer designate has been appointed and an order to establish the council will be brought before the Oireachtas shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I will also be bringing forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill 2002, aimed at establishing the rights and entitlements of persons with special needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and providing the necessary framework for effective service delivery. My objective is to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess. Given the assessment already being carried out and the proposals I have outlined, I have no plans to carry out any further reviews at this time.</p>
