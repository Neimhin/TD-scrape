        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I welcome Deputy McHugh who wishes to participate in this meeting.  With representatives of the Green Energy Growers Association, we will consider the quantities of green energy producing crops that can be grown in Ireland and the quantities of heat and power that they can produce.  I welcome Ms Ann Kehoe, the association's national director, whom I have met in other incarnations.  I blinked when I saw her.  It was a good few years ago when she was arguing for another cause.  I also welcome Mr. Robert Ronan, chairman of the association's management group.  I thank both of them for attending so promptly, although we first had to deal with some housekeeping business.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Before beginning, I draw everyone's attention to the fact that while members of the sub-committee have absolute privilege, the same privilege does not apply to witnesses appearing before the sub-committee.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  This is the usual warning I must give; therefore, our guests will know that they are no different from the hundreds of others with whom we have dealt during the past two and a half years.  Am I correct in believing Ms Kehoe will make the opening statement?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms Ann Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_8">Yes.  I thank the sub-committee for its invitation which we were delighted to accept.  I will tell members who we are and what we have done.  I will refer to the biomass side of renewable energy and the possibility it can produce for the economy in Ireland.  We are talking about producing renewable energy from natural resources here and how we can do this in a way that adds value to everything we do throughout the economy.  The primary drivers in this marketplace are climate change and energy security.  This marketplace is here to stay and will not disappear because these two issues are so important to every economy, but particularly to ours as a small island off the west coast of Europe.  It is not a fad.  We must examine four aspects of the renewable energy we have in abundance: biomass, produced from crops, land and trees; biogas, through anaerobic digestion and waste products from any industry; bioliquid, renewable energy that comes from the land because it is a seed crop; and air and water.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">We concentrate only on biomass.  All members of the Green Energy Growers Association are farmers and we want to produce something that is valuable and that can be turned into renewable energy from the land.  We seek efficient use of land.  We are a non-profit organisation and have not been funded by anyone except ourselves.  We started in 2006 and wanted to do something quickly.  We were willing to provide our land base and years of expertise to develop this quickly.  That is why we took the route we took.  We must keep this in perspective.  We are a small island off the west coast of Europe.  We have a certain amount of land available and a certain population.  We must keep our targets real and keep focused.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Members are aware that biomass is a raw material to produce solid bio-fuels, which can replace oil, gas and coal.  We refer to combined heat and power plants, commercial boiler systems and domestic heating systems.  I did not include all of the pictures when I sent the committee secretariat the presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The crops we are talking about are miscanthus, reed canary grass, straw, trees and most plant life.  The harvested straw or cane from that is converted and processed into chip, pellet or briquette and produces solid bioenergy when combusted.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">How does one go about this to ensure that it develops in a well-planned, strategic manner so that as one invests money it is invested at the right place and the right time?  We designed a production plan and a national framework by which we could produce biomass in the most efficient way possible.  The framework examines energy crops, where and how it can be produced as well as the kind of processing and capacity.  We also asked if there was a carbon incentive from this type of renewable energy and whether we could trade the carbon from it.  We examined where we could target Government funding and, to date, it has been targeted in the right place, namely, the establishment of efficient biomass crops.  We now need to move on to the market place.  One must invest in supply chains so that there is efficient delivery of products.  We must also set standards.  This is no longer a problem because the standards have been set by Sustainable Energy Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">We examined what we can produce.  One such crop is miscanthus, a perennial grass that produces 15 to 20 tonnes of biomass per year.  It takes two years to establish.  Once planted it grows for 20 years without replanting.  It is quite expensive to establish but minimum inputs are required.  The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides an establishment grant towards every hectare and has committed to continuing the establishment grant for two years after 2010.  It is a woody type straw or cane and is harvested with existing agri-equipment.  Miscanthus is sparse on the ground when it is first planted and it takes two years for the plant to expand.  I have provided a picture of the plant after a number of months and another at the three-year stage, when it is ready to harvest.  The picture also shows mechanical planters.  We have developed the equipment necessary for it.  Miscanthus is a vigorous plant but it takes two years to establish it so that it fills the field.  Another picture shows the crop when it is two years old and 12 ft. tall.  Every year one harvests the crop in springtime and it grows again.  We see crops that are high yielding and that produce major tonnage through an efficient use of the land.  With regard to the fuel and food debate, we ensure that we do not have a negative impact on food production.  Much land is available.  Between REPS, the nitrates directive, the sugar beet industry closing down and set-aside being abolished, land has become available.  Some 700,000 hectares of land could be used to produce these crops, without affecting food production.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">One can use traditional farm equipment to harvest.  For mowing, one uses mowers and bales it into square bales.  At this stage the biomass raw material is ready to be converted into energy.  Miscanthus is the foundation crop and we will continue to grow it.  It will guarantee supply but one also needs other crops in the mix.  For tillage farmers seeking a rotational crop to replace sugar beet, this picture shows industrial hemp grown in Cahir, County Tipperary.  We grew 120 hectares of industrial hemp last year so that we could research it.  It is a wonderful crop but requires further work.  This is a crop that could be used in tillage farms for biomass.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">How does one get the raw material from the bale form into, for example, the heating system in the Oireachtas?  We developed a network of seven green energy services companies, GESCO.  Each of these companies is owned by the farmers and land owners in each region and these are the people who produce the crops.  Each person, including Mr. Ronan and I, invested in the local regional energy services company.  We are the shareholders of these companies.  They are based in rural areas and contract growers to grow the crop.  The majority of shareholders also grow crops.  We store the crop and process it into biomass to be turned into bioenergy products for delivery to consumers and industry as fuel, in the form of chip, pellet or briquette, or as managed heat and power.  The latter system means that the green energy service company installs the system.  It is similar to the service provided by Bord Gáis.  The green energy service company provides the energy and the consumer pays per month.  Each green energy service company is a private limited company and produces the crop, ensures the crop is processed properly and markets the finished product, sale of heat, to consumers.  We have seven green energy service companies and each region's company has assessed the region.  The company knows the energy users, the number of houses in the area, the commercial energy users, the industrial energy users, and local authority and Government buildings.  They know what is required in each region, the capacity and what we can produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">There are seven regional bioenergy companies, with 40 directors and 200 shareholders from the agricultural community.  We intend expanding the shareholding because the first stage of development involves 30 shareholders in each region.  We expect to expand and we hope that many more farmers from those regions will join us.  We have invested more than €4 million in research and ensuring the crops are developed.  We are now ready to enter the marketplace with this raw material.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Due to the money, time, effort and planning involved, we know that we must guarantee a secure supply of this raw material to guarantee the development of this business.  The only way to do so is to encourage the best use of the land.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The economic benefits to developing in the way we have, include providing confidence for people to invest in this new technology and the business itself and stimulating investment in bioenergy technologies.  When large, small or manufacturing companies see that a crop, material or energy is indigenous they become more confident in investing in this type of technology.  They are no longer afraid that there will not be enough of the product in five years time.  This industry can create a new economic sector in the country and provide real employment opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">With regard to seed reproduction, and therefore crop production, this is a very labour intensive industry as it involves grading and production.  New equipment is necessary and agri-contractors find they are busy at a time of the year they normally are not.  Many people are involved in the manual grading and planting of the crop.  As the crops are harvested in the spring, employment is provided at a time of the year when normally it is not.  Processing involves transportation and specialised delivery equipment and the manufacture of commercial boilers.  We are very close to signing a contract with a commercial boiler manufacturer in Germany.  It is quite a small company and if this develops well it is very interested in manufacturing those boilers here.  For us, this would mean that from the seed to the field to the furnace everything would be produced and manufactured here and this is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">People believe that renewable energy must be produced and delivered locally.  It represents new career opportunities for young farmers and could activate or reactivate and restructure rural development.  It involves effective and efficient land use.  The rural environment protection scheme and the nitrates directive are very good and were necessary but we have got slightly sidetracked away from efficient land use.  We considered that efficient land use meant making the best use of subsidies and supports.  What we mean by efficient land use is producing something valuable from that land.  Efficient food and fuel balance is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">This has been a bad year for farmers and I am sure many of them will not return to the production of corn.  Does GEGA say to them that there is a need to get involved in this?  How is the product marketed?  How would GEGA find customers for its product in Kildare, where I represent?  If a farmer is to produce the material there must be somewhere it can be used.  It would not be right to take it from Kildare to Dublin or Carlow.  It must be done locally.  How does GEGA establish itself in an area?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Ms Ann Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_30">The seven regional green energy service companies are established.  To prove this particular biomass material can be produced effectively here we planted it.  This had to be done to demonstrate that it can work and we planted more than 1,000 hectares of miscanthus.  Deputy Fitzpatrick was 100% right to raise this issue.  Our group does not have miscanthus growing in Kildare.  If a Kildare-based business approached its nearest green energy service company, which is probably Kilogen, we would ensure that for the first two years the material went from other parts of the country to that customer.  In the meantime, our prime concern would be to get clusters of growers very close to that business so that within three years the fuel for the business would be produced regionally and locally.  We have no problem transporting fuel for a couple of years.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Senator Brendan Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_31">I thank the Chairman and Ms Kehoe for her presentation.  Miscanthus is GEGA's foundation crop and 1,000 hectares are planted.  What stage of the three-year cycle to which Ms Kehoe referred is it at?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Ms Ann Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_32">In 2006, we planted a very small amount in County Wexford as a trial and that has been harvested.  In 2007, we planted 150 hectares and the first harvest, which was light, was this year and we will have full production in 2010.  We have also planted another 500 hectares.  It is slowly but surely coming on stream but it will take two years for the 1,000 hectares to be in full production.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick stated, what we need to do now to move into the commercial marketplace is to encourage people to grow the crop.  Tomorrow, we will meet officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and we will tell them that we are delighted that €20 million has been put into an establishment grant for the next three years but that we would not mind if 25% of that budget was taken and used to install commercial systems in places such as Teagasc in Moorepark and Kildalton College because somebody needs to kick-start this.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">We are ready; our commercial systems are guaranteed and we know what we need to do.  The problem is money, the same problem that everybody has.  Potential business customers are finding it difficult to get the capital to invest in the system as are we.  The problem is that money is scarce and until we can demonstrate with a prototype that this works they will not be willing to take the risk.  This morning, we met SEI and tomorrow we will discuss the issue with Department officials.  It would be fantastic if we could install two systems somewhere, perhaps supported by the Government, which we could maintain.  They could serve as demonstration models which financial institutions, potential customers, growers and elected representatives could see working.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">In terms of the growth of the plant and the land, climate, conditions and potential pests, where does miscanthus grow naturally?  It is being introduced to Ireland.  Are there risks in this regard?</p>

          <from>Ms Ann Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_35">In the beginning we were told it grows on marginal land but it does not.  The crop requires relatively good productive land.  Land which produces grass or another crop well and has a good nutrient level will grow miscanthus very well.  We have tried to grow miscanthus and are glad we did so because we now know it does not work on bad, cold or unproductive land and it will not grow vigorously.  Relatively good land is required.  That is one of the reasons we have also researched the potential of reed canary grass for marginal wet or boggy lands.  However, we have not done enough research to expand production.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">At present, we have three customers which have reached the stage of seeking finance.  The first, a piggery, is ideally suited to the agri-industrial side because it has the capacity to handle the big bale format.  The second customer is a community swimming pool, which is also ideal for us because if we could develop a system for a swimming pool the ensuing publicity would be very positive.  This facility is open to the public from early in the morning to late and night and it would demonstrate the uses of this system in any environment.  Both facilities could incorporate a large commercial boiler into which large bails could be fed automatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">We are working with Carlow Institute of Technology to develop a feed-in mechanism for chipped product.  In this regard, we have commenced negotiations with a hotel which includes a golf course, swimming pool and conference centre and has significant heating requirements.  We have also begun negotiations with a milk and cheese manufacturing facility but no interest has been shown in using it as a demonstration model because of fears that its manufacturing process would be affected if anything went wrong.  We recommend to customers that they maintain a backup system.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">We would love to have a demonstration system in a facility such as the aforementioned swimming pool so that we could iron out problems.  We are finding that high energy users are very interested in us.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">It would be very close to thinnings except it is cut like straw.  It only turns brown when it is hit by cold weather, and sharp frosts in particular.  The colour change means the moisture is being drawn down to the end of the plant.  After being mowed it can be left on the ground for six weeks in rain or snow because it has a glossy exterior.  It must be cut so that the moisture which sits at the bottom two feet of the crop comes out.  At that stage the crop can be bailed with the big bailer.  It has to be brown when it is cut.  If it is cut when it is green, like the daffodil and everything else that is green, it will die.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">In terms of harvesting a crop in County Westmeath in the spring, miscanthus has a rhizome which grows underneath the ground.  It takes three years to establish a crop because the rhizome grows in various directions at 1 metre intervals.  It helps to dry the land by creating a table which allows easy travel.  That does not mean it is a miraculous cure for wet ground, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">One will often get a dry week in January, February or March, at which one point the crop can be mowed and left until the next period of dry weather.  The only restriction is that it must be taken up by April, when the new shoots begin to grow.  The window of opportunity is relatively wide, therefore.</p>

I have visited farms throughout Europe and in most instances the host farmer was not present because he or she was pursuing other activities.  Agricultural enterprises are not enough to sustain families.  A crop such as miscanthus would lend itself to new activities because it requires little time from a management point of view once the crop has been established.  It allows the landowner time to do other things and still get a decent return from his farm.</p>

If, for example, seed stock for 200 acres would be delivered to the Chairman, two people with machinery would have gone to a field and lifted those rhizomes out of the ground.  They are then taken into a facility where the very labour-intensive operation of dividing and grading the seed stock takes place.  There could be six people in such a facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">As a result of the country's climate, we would probably lift this well before it would go to the Chairman's 200 acres so it would have to go into cold storage.  Such facilities would also have loading elements and there should also be transport to get it from there to a farm.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">There is very specific equipment to plant this rhizome.  One would need an ordinary tractor but a specific planter.

          <p eId="para_84">This is not like sowing a seed that flows automatically.  This crop can stick together and can be big or small.  There is only one way to plant, which we have learned the hard way; people need to be on the back of the tractor dropping the rhizome.  There would be four or five people in that operation.  It is then rolled and planted.  There would be some weed control and the crop would be minded.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">A tractor and mower is required for harvesting, as well as a baler.  The product must be loaded and stored as well.  The next level takes the crop from its raw material state.  It can be taken to a facility where it is chipped and transported onwards.  The transport area will develop fairly quickly as specialist equipment is required for loading.  It may be the same equipment used for woodchip.  Nevertheless, specialist trailers are required and if the crop is to be developed properly, such equipment must be manufactured for loading.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">We are dealing with commercial boilers and if miscanthus is mentioned to anybody in the energy industry, one would be told that miscanthus must go to a very specific miscanthus boiler.

We know what the best boiler is and the manufacturers are contracted to distribute the boilers.  It is a small company in Germany and if we develop this fast enough — and there is a requirement for boilers — those boilers could be manufactured here.  The German company wants to outsource manufacturing to Ireland.  As Mr. Ronan mentioned to representatives of Sustainable Energy Ireland this morning, if this is developed in Ireland we will have the potential to export those boilers to the UK.</p>

We would love to encourage tillage farmers but they like to plough and till every year.

          <p eId="para_102">The most important question asked today concerned how we can expand this industry and get more people to grow the crop.  There are two ways.  The first and most important<b> </b>is that we must demonstrate that there is a marketplace.  We must install two or three of these systems and complete the loop.  If farmers see there is an absolute marketplace for this crop when it is burned, that it has high calorific value and produces energy efficiently, that is one way.  People will say, “There is a marketplace for this, I know where it is going and I will grow it”.  The second way is the result, when the crop is profitable and gives a real return per acre — which it does.  Those are the two ways.</p>

The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food gives a grant of 50% to a maximum of €1,450 so the cost involved is approximately €1,000 per hectare to plant the crop.  It is expensive to find the money up front but when one considers how long the crop is in the ground the cost is not huge.  At the same time——</p>

          <from>Senator Brendan Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_124">That was the figure given that would not affect food supply.  Given that good land is required, as Ms Kehoe stated, does this not have the potential to impact on food production.</p>

          <from>Ms Ann Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_125">No.  Sugarbeet was produced on very good land and is no longer produced.  Set-aside generally happened on tillage farms.  It might be the worst corner of a farm but if the farm was a good farm there would be good land in set-aside.  REPS 4 was intended to impose very restrictive 12 ft. margins on this but now many farmers cannot get into REPS 4.  Although this will impact on them financially it will free up land that little bit more.  We have looked at this very carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Regarding our situation, the Chairman referred to sheep.  For years, my husband and I were intensive sheep producers in a non-disadvantaged area in the Suir valley in County Tipperary.  After very many years of hard work of producing intensively we discovered there was probably a better margin to be got by becoming more extensive and going into REPS.  I am ashamed to say that the best land in the country, the Suir valley, is not producing anything like it should be.  We now have 40 acres of miscanthus in the ground and 300 sheep instead of 900 and are much happier with the fact we were producing more effectively from that land.  It was unsustainable to try to produce 900 breeding sheep in the marketplace at the time whereas now we have developed.  The land is good.  Mr. Ronan was in the same situation.  He was an intensive suckler and beef producer.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">Ms Kehoe mentioned that one of her first customers is likely to be a piggery.  The committee had some presentations on the potential of pig slurry for anaerobic digestion as a potential source of energy.<b/> What is the potential for the integration of Ms Kehoe’s system with any other, such as anaerobic digestion?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_97">
          <from>Ms Ann Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_130">Large producers of waste, for example, in the meat processing industry, would probably never use biomass because they have tallow and waste and therefore use anaerobic digestion very effectively.  One thing surprised me.  I thought that anaerobic digestion would take off a great deal faster, particularly in areas such as Deputy Morgan's constituency where there is large-scale chicken and pig production.  I thought it would have developed much faster and I do not understand why it has not done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">As we see it, there is no single resource in this country that will produce all the energy we need.  There will be a mix.  Biomass will suit one sector and anaerobic digestion will suit another.  Solar and wind energy will suit others.  It is a combination of all that will give us a renewable energy industry.</p>

We would love to grow crops in County Kildare, but the reason we have not pushed for crop growing there is we concentrated on where we had clusters of growers.  However, we are now ready to expand outwards.  We would love to grow miscanthus in County Kildare if anyone there was interested in doing so.  We had a stand at the ploughing championships and will develop the process with anybody with an interest in the matter.  We would love to match it with the marketplace.  In other words, we would note that there was a lot of potential in County Kildare and begin to grow crops there.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">We have extracted the maximum amount of information from Ms Kehoe and Mr. Ronan.  I thank them sincerely for coming and assisting us in our deliberations.  We have taken this issue to a sub-committee which has only five or six members.  As Ms Kehoe is aware, it is a sub-committee which sits in a bunker with no members of the press or anybody else present.  We have been meeting for over 12 months and many do not know we are here.  The main committee met yesterday and will meet again next Tuesday.  There is a lot of work being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Members travelled to Güssing to look at the concept being followed there.  Our intention is to try to have three, four or five similar projects in Ireland.  That recommendation will eventually be made.  We thought it might be made before Christmas.  Like the delegation, we decided to extend the period of time involved in order that we could make the right decision rather than rushing the matter.  We hope to make a recommendation in that regard and hope it will go before the Government because this is an attractive concept.  We also need to develop one or two schools in order that people can learn the skills required.  There are many inputs but many of the required skills are not available such as how one deals with wood pellets.  We have received 25 or 26 submissions from persons interested in different aspects.  They are being evaluated.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The media may complain about us but they are not interested in this subject, even though, as the delegation can see, we have been sitting here with it for more than an hour to gather information.  However, we are not clapping ourselves on the back for doing this, as it is our job.  We took this issue on to be dealt with as part of a special project.  I think we have taken on something useful.</p>

It is high time we took advantage of the grass, trees and whatever else we grow in the ground because they seem to grow faster here than anywhere else in the world.  As the "green isle", we have always had natural and comparative advantages which we have never used very much, other than in the footing Kerrygold gained.  It is the only decent brand we developed.  In our case, the old saying, "faraway hills are always greener", is untrue.  Our hills and fields are greener.  We need to harness their potential to employ people in rural and semi-rural areas in green projects to which the delegation referred and to provide power and heat for small local enterprises such as those to which Deputy Fitzpatrick alluded.  That is our objective.</p>

We are hoping to give them a ray of hope.  We hope to convince the Government this is an important issue.  Large bodies such as Sustainable Energy Ireland have more power than us and the most important thing any body, Government or otherwise, could do is provide for change.  The day they are afraid of change is the one on which they will have lost the battle.  The delegation has played its role in helping us to change and see the value of what it is doing.  I hope Sustainable Energy Ireland is listening carefully because we found this a very useful exchange.</p>
