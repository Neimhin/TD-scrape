          <from>Ms O'Rourke:</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Order of Business is No. 1, Local Government Bill 2003 – Report and Final Stages, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and conclude not later than 4 p.m.; No. 2, Finance Bill 2003<i>(Certified Money Bill)</i>– Second Stage, to be taken at 4 p.m. and conclude at 7 p.m., prior to which the Minister will be called upon to reply, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; No. 3, Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 – Second Stage, to be taken at 7 p.m. and conclude at 10 p.m., prior to which the Minister will be called upon to reply, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Senators may share time.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_2">This week the business of the House will be dominated by the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The importance of passing legislation swiftly to facilitate the enactment of provisions is understood on this side of the House but the proposal to take Committee and Report Stages of both Bills tomorrow is unprecedented. I ask the Leader to consider reordering the business for rest of the week to create a gap between Committee and Report Stages in both cases. The Finance Bill alone contains over 150 sections, to which my party has tabled 40 amendments which we wish to ensure are discussed on Committee Stage. These Bills must be treated seriously to ensure that they receive the parliamentary scrutiny to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I ask the Leader to make time available next week or the following week for a debate on the quarterly report of the Central Bank, which will be published tomorrow. The Governor of the Central Bank made comments today which I understand will be contained in the report. He stated that the level of bad debt ratio in the housing market has grown considerably in the past year or so. This shows clearly that a policy of lending far too much money to customers – which is pursued by some Irish banks – has led to a difficult situation in respect of an increasing number of bad debts. I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Finance to respond to the report which will be published tomorrow. The housing market has entered a more difficult cycle and increasing pressure will be put on people, particularly those on the first step of the housing ladder, to make substantial repayments on mortgages.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole:</from>
          <p eId="para_4">I notice the Order Paper now has a fancy cover. This is a disposable document, something that we throw in the bin at the end of the day. The new cover is lovely and it looks well, but it seems to be a huge waste.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach:</from>
          <p eId="para_5">I am informed that it is a saving of printing costs, not a waste. It has to do with VAT considerations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole:</from>
          <p eId="para_6">It may save money in printing costs perhaps, but the cover is made of at least 100 gram paper and that means many more trees have to be cut down. The management of waste is important to Members on both sides of the House. If it is the case that, because the tax laws regarding such matters as VAT are so convoluted, irrational and illogical, we can save on VAT by wasting more paper and killing more trees, then that matter should be examined and we should do so today. It can also be raised during consideration of the Finance Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I approve of the fact that the Government is spending a lot of money to develop e-government so that Members can conduct business electronically. There is no reason that we each cannot have electronic screens in front of us in the Chamber and read the Order Paper electronically and so save on paper costs. I ask the Leader to investigate whether this can be done in the House.</p>
          <p class="Center" eId="para_8">I asked the Leader previously for a debate on the finances of the health services. Will she indicate when it is estimated that the report of the committee on the health services, chaired by Niamh Brennan, will be published and when the House will be given the opportunity to discuss it?</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The trade union movement will be meeting tomorrow to make a final decision on Sustaining Progress, which I hope will be accepted. I ask for a discussion on this issue which covers many matters, such as housing, that the House should examine. I know that my colleague, Senator Ross, supports my call for a debate on this subject.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_10">In regard to the Order of Business, it is remarkable that we are seeking to progress through the House within a matter of a few hours today and tomorrow the two most important Bills which come before the Oireachtas annually. The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Finance Bill are extremely detailed, complex and lengthy and it is staggering that the Leader thinks we have sufficient time to debate them today and tomorrow. I appreciate that there is a statutory requirement in regard to the Finance Bill. However, we have spent a good deal of time in the House dealing with issues of far less importance. There is no prospect at this point that we will deal with the number of amendments tabled, regardless of how expeditiously we deal with them. I ask the Leader to consider seriously Senator Hayes's suggestion to extend the time available to us, particularly on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I read with some interest over the weekend remarks attributed to the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in regard to third level fees. He appears to be rethinking the possibility of introducing such fees in some form next year. I am sure the Leader will agree that whatever about the merits of the issue, the uncertainty is causing some disturbance to those who may or may not be facing a considerable bill in a few months' time. Perhaps she will indicate when she expects the Minister to produce the expected report on third level fees. Will she ensure once it is produced the Minister will come to the House to debate the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_12">On the amount of paper we use in this House, I was looking through the Finance Bill which includes an interesting provision whereby the Revenue Commissioners can oblige persons to make electronic tax returns in some cases. It seems the Revenue is moving rapidly along the lines of obliging people to use electronic means of communication. Perhaps we should give a lead in this House by doing something similar.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CamillusGlynn" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Mr. Glynn:</from>
          <p eId="para_13">I ask the House to support me in expressing concern that mobile phone charges in this country appear to be four times more expensive than in other European countries. We should ask the relevant Minister to come to the House to debate the issue. It is a scandal given that the mobile phone is now an integral part of the way business is done, not just inside and outside this House but also in the commercial world in general. In view of the fact that charges in this country are four times more expensive than in Britain, it is time we had a debate on the issue to see if anything can be done about it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Ms Terry:</from>
          <p eId="para_14">Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House to explain the reason there is an appalling situation in the Eastern Regional Health Authority where children who may have been sexually abused must wait for up to three months to be assessed at the special unit in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin? That three month period relates to children on a priority list. Those not on the list may have to wait up to seven months. This is very serious for children who may have been abused and cannot be assessed. As hundreds of children are involved in just one health board area, what are the numbers involved throughout the country? It is a very serious issue which I want the Minister to urgently address.</p>

They are fighting for their families, their poor little homes and their children, like the six year old girl who had her leg blown off and whose picture was in yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i>. I opposed Saddam Hussein with my feeble efforts, such as they were, when others supported him. Today, in this House, I salute the bravery and courage of the Iraqi people in standing up to this criminal aggression. The sooner there is regime change in Washington the better for the planet.</p>

Last year more than 3,600 people benefited from the scheme, but they are now unsure if they will be able to complete their studies. The withdrawal of the scheme is at variance with the express wishes of the Minister for Education and Science, who wants to reintroduce third level fees to allow the disadvantaged to participate. One Minister is withdrawing an allowance and the chance of participation by many of the disadvantaged, while another seeks to encourage it.

          <p eId="para_27">I support the call by Senators Quinn and Glynn for a debate on the Competition Authority report. Telecommunications was one of the two areas highlighted. As we are in the Single Market, we should ensure we get the benefit of competition but this is not happening in the industry. Also, there have been many calls for a debate in regard to legal fees. Senator Quinn is correct in saying the Law Library will not regulate competition in that area. It is ironic that a body which will articulate the various arguments in a case involving a breach of the provisions of the Competition Authority is effectively immune from the provisions of that authority. That is wrong and the Government needs to correct the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Will the Leader provide time for a debate on the taxi industry which has moved from quantitative to qualitative control? It is fair to say, when one sees the criminal elements which have infiltrated the industry, that quality type criteria are patently not being applied. We not only have anecdotal evidence in that regard but also evidence from recent court cases where it is clear that unsavoury characters have become involved in the industry. There is an onus on the State to ensure quality controls applied in any other industry are strictly applied. We do not have a great record in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">Senator Brian Hayes talked about the Finance Bill and asked if we could alter the Order of Business in order that there would be more of a gap between Committee and Report Stages. I will see if we can do anything about this and come back to him on it. He also asked about the Central Bank quarterly report, a question which, I think, Senator Mansergh answered. We could deal with the report which is coming out on Thursday, particularly the section dealing with housing, during the course of the debate on the regulatory authority Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Senator O'Toole commented on the Order Paper and does not want waste created. I wonder if we should make a recommendation that recyclable paper should be used. That could be done. It is a matter we could take up with the procurement office of the Department of Finance which arranges such matters. The Senator also spoke about e-government and suggested we should all sit here in front of screens. It would be useful if we had screens here and did not have to use paper.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I do not think the Senator would stay seated behind his screen for too long when one considers that his strength lies in the exuberance he displays when he stands up.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">It was stated the Brennan report should be placed in the public arena. We all wish that would happen in order that we could read it. I asked about it on several occasions and was told by the Minister for Health and Children that he had not yet received a copy. It was commissioned by the Minister for Finance. Senators O'Toole and Mansergh have also been vocal in seeking to have a debate on social partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Senator McDowell mentioned the Finance Bill. While I am not trying to be smart, I checked the passage of last year's Bill through the House. Sometimes one sees a golden age when one speaks about what happened in past years. Therefore, I wanted to be on firm ground. While we can table and discuss recommendations to the Bill, it cannot be changed. Less time was devoted last year to it and the Social Welfare Bill. That is not an excuse but a fact. This week is crowded, which I regret because we could have had longer discussions on both Bills. However, they must be passed before a certain date to allow people to get their dues and the measures to come into force.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">I read the report about the Minister for Education and Science and third level fees. The Senator concerned is correct about the level of uncertainty. More young people and their parents are asking about what will happen in relation to such fees. I expect the matter will be brought before the Cabinet this week or in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">I agree that we should have electronic means of communication. Senator Glynn mentioned mobile phone charges and competition. Senators O'Toole, Brian Hayes and Quinn, among others, have consistently mentioned the Competition Authority and the different European reports, as well as that by Indecon. If there is a free slot next week, we will have a debate on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Senator Terry mentioned the three month delay in the priority lists for young people who have been abused and need counselling and special programmes. I read the report which is appalling today. It is not the fault of those in Crumlin because I am sure they are busy. The delay for non-priority cases is seven months. It is more difficult to cope with this. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children and it might be useful to discuss it on the Adjournment in order to get precise information.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Senator Mansergh mentioned the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill. He also called for a debate on social partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Senator Norris mentioned the catastrophe of war. As he told me he had to leave the House as soon as he had spoken on the Order of Business because he had to attend a committee meeting, I understand the reason I am looking at an empty chair. He is right that the war is a catastrophe. The names of places such as Umm-Qasr and Basra now slip off our tongues. When I spoke last week, I agreed with Senator Ryan about the level and content of the reporting on television and radio. We could hear more about it over the weekend. Regardless of one's views, there is no doubt that RTE has adopted an even-handed approach to its coverage of the war. Its reporters are doing an excellent job and I hope they come home safely. Senator Ryan and I were castigatory, not of any one station but of the content and tenor of the debate on television. Others have their own views but I believe RTE is doing a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">There is a crisis in relation to the truth of the reportage on other stations. Yesterday morning a 100 acre site was found full of nuclear weapons or weapons of mass destruction but today there is not a word about it. It is as if they were never found. We need to have our critical faculties in order when listening to reports. It is a human catastrophe.</p>

We shall have it either the last week of the session or the first week of next session, depending on the availability of the Minister. It is an important Bill. The Senator's colleague, Senator O'Toole, chaired an expert committee which laid the foundations for the Bill. The Competition Authority report, the Indecon consultants report and an EU report will be published this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">In regard to the matter raised by Senator Ulick Burke, the Minister for Social and Community Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, will be present later today and the Senator may wish to raise it with her. It concerns a postgraduate course in regard to which a lady from UCG, Professor Fitzpatrick, is very active. The finance for education is being taken away from postgraduate students, a matter we should raise with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Senator Finucane sought a debate on neutrality. Such a debate would be worthwhile. I was interested in Professor Ronan Fanning's article in the <i> Sunday Independent.</i> When one read it, it made much sense with its historical analogies.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">Senator Brennan raised the issue of house prices which increase from the day the first payment is put down on a starter home to the day the final bill is paid. Given that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will be present in the House shortly, the Senator may wish to raise the matter with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Senator Jim Walsh asked for a debate on the Competition Authority report. He was also critical of the Law Library and its inmates. I declare an interest in that a member of my family works there. Therefore, I will not comment. The Senator also asked for a debate on the taxi industry. An interim regulator, Mr. Jim Farrelly, has been appointed and I understand he has started business. While it was important to address the quantity issue, I agree it is important to address the quality issue also.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">This amendment recommends that the abolition of the dual mandate, which will be found to be unconstitutional, should not apply to Senators. On previous occasions, I referred to various articles of the Constitution. For example, I spoke about the constitutional amendment which gave rise to Article 28A. I also referred to Articles 2, 40 and 15.14. The latter requires that a person cannot be a Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas and the position regarding the President is similar in Article 12.2. The legislation is worded in such a way as to stop a person running for election – not just to disallow them from holding both seats – and is a recognition that a constitutional problem exists with regard to making an elected person surrender their seat. The mandate in a local government election comes from the people. A county councillor running for election following enactment of the Bill will have the right to challenge legislation which forces him or her to surrender the council seat to which he or she was elected by the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">There will be particular difficulties for independent councillors elected to the Oireachtas. Such people do not have an assurance that the person co-opted in their place will be an independent candidate. He or she could be replaced by a majority of the council because he or she is not a member of a political party.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">The wording of the Government amendment raises the issue of primacy of the elected local authority member and is a recognition of Article 28A. We should not be legislating on the dual mandate. We should trust the electorate. I referred in my Second Stage contribution to the remarks of the 1961 Electoral Committee that we should trust the electorate and let them take the consequences of their actions. I strongly believe that rather than placing limitations on who can be elected, we should be removing some of the existing ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Parties could choose, as the Green Party has done, to ban the dual mandate within their organisations. Those who do not wish to hold the two roles should not force that position on everybody else. If one cannot perform the two roles, then one should make a personal choice to give up one of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">There are many issues within local government besides the dual mandate which need to be tackled, such as how we organise our politics, fund our Government and the powers given to councillors and politicians at national level. What is important is not what role one holds, but what one does. There are many limitations at local government level on what can be achieved. County councillors, irrespective of whether they are Members of the Oireachtas, find it difficult to obtain funding. We should address that issue first.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">The fact that PR and multi-seat constituencies will remain in place means the Dáil and Seanad will continue to meet mid-week to allow Oireachtas Members to nurture their work at local level. If the Minister is considering the abolition of PR and the introduction of single seat constituencies, I urge him not to lose the run of himself because the people are against such an idea. They prize their ability to choose. I know Fianna Fáil wishes to introduce single seat constituencies in the long term, but it is not something to which the people will agree. It does away with their right to elect representatives of smaller parties and independent candidates. The Government will fail in this regard and the Dáil and Seanad will continue to meet mid-week.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">We also need to look at ways of improving how we organise our debates. Many people mentioned that recently when speaking about the House of Commons debate on war with Iraq. The administrative way they organise business contributes to a better quality of debate. It is the manner in which we organise our business, not the quality of politicians, that is at fault. We should undertake reform in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">The reality is that there will be pretend councillors due to the amendment the Government has published today. There will be Deputies and Senators who will have no responsibility but who will receive all the information. That is because they want to remain involved in local government. If the Government wants to do this, it should do it properly and allow them to be elected and take on the responsibility of being local councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Local and national politics are complementary. What a practising councillor can bring to national politics – and what a national politician can bring to local politics – is important.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy:</from>
          <p eId="para_91">I wish to make a number of points to support the case for Senators. The Government should let the practicalities determine who runs for what office. Few MEPs also serve as Deputies because it is not practical to do so. However, it is clearly practical to hold a local government mandate and be a Member of the Oireachtas. Why ban that? There are anomalies in that there will be the dual mandate of Deputy and MEP. Why not ban that dual mandate first? The dual mandate will not be gone in 2004 because Deputies and Senators will still be running for the European Parliament and will be allowed to retain their Oireachtas seats for a year or two afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">I am not setting up Senators against Deputies. My personal view is that the dual mandate should not be banned. For the purposes of proper debate, it is important that this view is put in the House. The step being taken by the Government is so significant that it is important we debate it fully, irrespective of party political views.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">I sympathise with the argument for ending the dual mandate but, overall, feel it is a wrong move. A special case can be made for Senators because their electorate is largely made up of county councillors. That should still be the case in respect of Seanad reform and councillors should have a role in electing Senators, which would be one way of keeping the worthwhile local government link. County councillors should be allowed to run for the Seanad while remaining on county councils. Practising councillors remain in touch with the operations—</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I am sticking to the amendment, which relates to Senators. I think I should be allowed to make my point. The Minister will probably speak for as long as I do.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">There is value in having the voice of local government in the House. One of the problems that will arise is a high turnover of Senators because councillors like to elect sitting councillors to the Seanad. Nominated Senators have a particular problem because they are practising county councillors who are in the House for just one term. If they are not nominated on the next occasion and are not elected to the Seanad, they will be left without the vocation which they may have practised for a long time at local government level. This is despite the fact that they may have been very good representatives both at Seanad and local government level. We are doing people in that position a disservice. It is ironic that I am putting this argument when all the nominated Senators are on the Government side.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">To have a dual mandate is more manageable for a Senator than a Deputy, though I am against the change in general. There is no question but that Seanad Members spend less time in the Houses. This is evidenced by the fact that we are paid substantially less and have substantially fewer resources than Deputies. Senators do not have a local mandate and are not elected by their local constituencies, as are Deputies.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon:</from>
          <p eId="para_104">I second the amendment. We examined and discussed the various sections of the Bill in great detail on Second and Committee Stages. The Minister said he would bring forward legislation to address the lack of powers vested in elected representatives, the main area of concern mentioned by Senators, at a future date. I would like to ask the reason there has to be a delay, however, as we should be placing confidence in local representatives. Voters should have the ultimate say in relation to who represents them; they should be allowed to decide whether a given man or woman is capable of representing them on local authorities or in the Oireachtas. Many are concerned that they will lose contact with the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">On Committee Stage I mentioned that a perfect report about waste management had been submitted by my local authority but the Minister decided that it was inadequate and the council did not receive funding as a result. I argued the matter on behalf of the local authority in the Oireachtas and received a favourable response. It is being re-examined at local level, where it matters. I agree with Tip O'Neill who once said, "All politics is local," as it is important that there is a link between local authorities and the national Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The Bill recognises that Senators and Deputies are equal but we do not enjoy the same standard of facilities as our colleagues in the other House. It is important that Senators are given the same facilities as Deputies but no steps are taken in that regard in the Bill. We are not provided with the secretarial services made available to Deputies. We are not considered to have a constituency, as such – the entire country is our constituency.</p>

          <p eId="para_108">There should be a link between local authorities and the Oireachtas. I have no problem with the present system which links local authorities with the Seanad. A Senator who is also a member of a local authority does not receive two salaries – as dual mandate holders, we make a commitment of work. My local authority sent me my P60, rightly so, on the day I was elected to this House. It is important that Senators are given the facilities such as secretarial services in our constituencies that are enjoyed by Deputies. We carry out the same functions as Deputies in our constituencies; for example, we are contacted by those involved in the various development associations. We play a significant role in the development of our communities. I hope we will continue to be involved in such matters for a long time but the Bill is making it less likely.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I am convinced, as a result of contact with my constituents, that people believe this change is not needed.

          <from>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Cullen):</from>
          <p eId="para_115">I respect the points both Senators have made on this subject which we have debated in great detail, not only on Second Stage but also on Committee Stage. The termination of the dual mandate is the stated official policy of practically all the political parties, including the Labour Party and Fine Gael. It is important to keep this at the forefront of our minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Senator Tuffy's amendment proposes to end the dual mandate for Deputies but not for Senators. She knows well that this would change considerably the relationship between the Seanad and the Dáil. To be eligible to stand for election to the Seanad one has to be eligible to stand for election to the Dáil and <i>vice versa. </i>If the amendment was made, the Seanad would be on an unequal footing in the Oireachtas. That would be a foolish move.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">There have been many opinions expressed on this subject, including those of the General Council of County Councils, the Barrington report on local government, the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the National Youth Council of Ireland. Moreover, the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe made similar recommendations last year in its report on local government in Ireland. Therefore, we are not short of eminent reports on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Some Senators are making the mistake of thinking that one has to be part of the local government structure and that it almost cannot function without them. There is no point in furthering this argument. If one really wants to reform local government, the Dáil and the Seanad and address the issue of sitting days, the issue of the dual mandate must be addressed. We receive a lot of flak from the public because of how it perceives the fact that we sit in plenary session only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. I disagree with this perception very strongly but it is a bone of contention. Our present sitting arrangements create the wrong impression. There is no reason we could not sit on Mondays like other parliaments. Local authorities have to sit on Mondays and Fridays to accommodate Oireachtas Members. This makes it difficult to have a serious reform process.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">I do not think Senator Bannon expected the Government to have dealt fully with the Local Government Bill in the nine months since it took office because there are other things happening in tandem. The review of the Seanad has to be conducted. The Taoiseach has asked me to chair the proceedings and I have accepted the position. All the issues cannot be dealt with at the same time. This Bill is part of a much wider process that has been discussed and voted upon over the past ten years. The European Parliament has set an example in that, from 2004, one will no longer be allowed to be a MEP and a member of a national parliament at the same time. Other examples pertain to Ministers, Ministers of State, Cathaoirligh, Leas-Cathaoirligh, civil servants, gardaí and judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The Senator is correct in saying it is a matter for the electorate to decide. I am not preventing anybody from making the decision to stand for election to local government. Anybody is eligible to do so. All I am saying is one cannot be in both the Oireachtas and local government at the same time. Standing for election before deciding which role one would assume would be hoodwinking the public. I do not envisage anybody knowingly standing for election to local government who is a Member of his or her national parliament, getting elected and then deciding to give up the latter position. This argument is spurious and I could counter it for the next two or three hours. However, we have other aspects of the Bill to deal with and I am not prepared to accept the amendment as brought forward.</p>

I believe they do not have similar legislation in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">In the Europe Union there is a committee of the regions which, by many people's standards, would be the equivalent of the Seanad. That has county councillors on it.

          <p eId="para_126">The Minister referred to local authority meetings being timed to facilitate Oireachtas Members.

          <p eId="para_138">An Oireachtas Member should be allowed to run in local government elections. This Bill provides that Oireachtas Members must first give up their seats in the House before they run in local elections. If they fail to be elected to a local authority, they end up without any mandate. At all other political levels, a Member is allowed to keep his or her seat. For example, Deputies can run in the European Parliamentary elections and still retain a seat in the Dáil. If successful, they can then decide to stand down from the Dáil. Similarly, county councillors can run for the Dáil or the Seanad without giving up their local authority seat.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">This is a profoundly unfair proposal which will prevent national politicians from transferring to local government level, yet moves from local to national, and national to European levels can be made. The Minister has stated in the House, both today and at Committee Stage, that he could not foresee someone wanting to move from national to local government level. I give the example of Ken Livingstone, who transferred from national politics to local government level. Why is it so unforeseeable? If we value local government and if, as the Minister has said in previous debates on this Bill, it will be reformed and made more attractive, why would someone not want to transfer from national to local government level?</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Some Senators may be here for only one term and as they are now precluded from running in the next local election they could find themselves after the next general election without a seat in either the Seanad or in local government. It is very difficult to get back to local government level and that is very unfair. The Minister has mentioned the plans at European level. I am sure the Government will not force a Deputy to give up his or her seat before going to the European Parliament, so why should that happen in relation to an Oireachtas Member running for local government?</p>

          <p eId="para_150">The purpose of this amendment is to allow an adjustment period because people at national level are being disallowed from running for local government. Some of the present Deputies and Senators came in on the basis that they were local authority members. They are now suddenly in a position whereby they are not only prevented from running in the next local elections but also will come under heavy pressure to give up their seats early, which is totally unfair.</p>

I am sure they will not be too happy when Independent Members, who will probably stay on until the end, remain on the local councils, while the Minister's party is pressurising his colleagues to give up their seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">The reason for this amendment is to allow an adjustment period. If the Minister makes such a dramatic change and takes away the members' rights it should not happen while they are within the period of change. They should have a chance to adjust. As the Bill affects Oireachtas Members initially, and local councillors later, the change should be deferred at least until the next general election. I have put in the date for local elections because we can be more certain of that than the date for general elections.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">It is not that. I am sure a case will be taken and one of the bases for that will be that people who came in under the present regime are to be disallowed their rights when they are in midstream. Why is the European Parliament allowing Ireland a derogation? The Minister said it is because we hold our European elections at a different time from our general election. I wonder why that is. We can have a Deputy who runs in the next European election and is elected to the European Parliament but does not have to give up his Dáil seat until the following general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">In terms of the derogation that Ireland has sought in relation to the European Parliament it seems, to judge from what the Minister has said – I do not have much information on this – that he recognises a need for a period of adjustment, yet he does not recognise that in relation to Oireachtas Members. He is being very unfair to Members who are county councillors but he is not extending that disadvantage to Deputies or Senators who run in the next European elections, as they will. It suits the Government parties to allow the dual mandate exist in relation to the European Parliament.</p>

It would be better from a practical point of view to allow the legal and constitutional issues to be aired to establish whether this provision is unconstitutional and to allow people to adjust and to make their choice. They are not being allowed to run without giving up their seats first, therefore there should be a period of adjustment. That is the relevance of the argument.

Some of the counties they run are quite small with less than 30,000 people, like my own. There is a need to reform and change this huge structure.</p>

If local government was properly structured, some of us might opt to serve at that level rather than nationally. The first, second and third class rates in place should be examined and dealt with. Councillors need new powers to lead their communities but there is no provision for them in the Bill which should be more substantive and ought to include the new sections it is proposed to introduce down the road.

There is no getting away from the fact that both parties are tabling amendments this afternoon which directly contravene their policy positions. I have been asked to provide certainty in terms of the direction we are taking but the amendments tabled seek to reintroduce uncertainty which I am not prepared to do.

          <from>Mr. Cullen:</from>
          <p eId="para_191">I am glad we have had time to deal with this amendment which addresses issues at the root of much of the debate on Second and Committee Stages. The amendment seeks to provide that when Oireachtas Members leave the local government system, their dealings with the local authorities at a representational level will be secure. I bring it forward in direct response to concerns expressed by Members of the House during earlier debates. Where Deputies and Senators cease to be local authority members, they are likely to continue to interact with such authorities on behalf of their constituents. Oireachtas Members have a legitimate case. As a politician who lives in the real world, I acknowledge that elected representatives in the national Parliament are justifiably interested on behalf of constituents in the policies and operations of Departments and other agencies. Given the wide range of local authority activities, it is usual for Oireachtas Members to approach them concerning policy matters or individual constituents. I have recognised these facts from day one and provided for such matters in the published Bill through guidelines. Having listened to the concerns voiced by Members of this House across all political parties and met colleagues from the Dáil, I fully accept what has been said. I am strengthening the provisions of the Bill which relate to local authority dealings with Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The amendment will replace section 3 of the Bill. Senators will see that under the Act, regulations which have the force of law will be made by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in place of guidelines to address local authority dealings with Oireachtas Members. It was very strongly believed by all political parties that provisions should be put on a statutory footing. The general thrust of the regulations will be that local authorities should, as a matter of course, put in place systems and procedures to provide that relevant documentation supplied to councillors is also supplied to Oireachtas Members. Such documentation would include notices of agendas, minutes of meetings, annual reports, audit reports and corporate plans. My list is not exhaustive but it conveys the general intent of the provision. Section 3 is formulated to provide for the making of regulations covering such matters as access to documentation, information and communications generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I emphasise that all local authority customers are entitled to expect a high standard of service in accordance with local authority customer action plans. This overarching principle should guide the actions of local authorities and common sense augment the regulations in informing the operation of the new arrangements. One can only legislate so far. While the amendment seeks to secure the position of Oireachtas Members in their dealings with local authorities, the representational role carried on in the normal way by councillors is in no way affected. That they will not be treated any less favourably is reflected in subsection (4)(<i>c</i>) of the amendment. Senators will agree that it is in everyone's interest to adopt the balanced approach the amendments seeks to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I bring the amendment forward in good faith and ask Senators to accept it in this light. I have no doubt that in the years following the ending of the dual mandate, the roles of local and national representatives will evolve to a point where local government matters will be of less significance to Members of the Oireachtas who will operate in the context of a fully developed committee system. For now, the amendment is my attempt to meet the real concerns of Members. In discussions of section 3 access was their overriding concern. Arrangements to facilitate access on a statutory basis are key to the amendment which exceeds the requirements of Members in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I support this amendment in principle. I believe the abolition of the dual mandate is taking away something which Members of the Oireachtas formerly held and this is an attempt to deal with that. The Constitution states that there shall be directly elected local authorities. This section is either toothless or could be challenged on constitutional grounds. The amendment recognises that there is a problem because it says one thing and then qualifies it. It refers to the functions of a local authority as specified in section 63(1)(<i>a</i>) of the Local Government Act which relates to the importance of democracy and local government. It recognises the primacy of the local authority member. I do not believe that one can have it both ways. This is in effect to allow Deputies and Senators to keep up their work as local councillors without having the responsibility that attaches to being elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I sympathise with the view expressed by Senator Dardis that Oireachtas Members should have access to local authority officials. The problem is that it gives an importance in terms of accountability to local authority members that is in contradiction to the Constitution. My attitude is that any member of the public who writes to a local authority should receive a reply.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy:</from>
          <p eId="para_205">In some way this indicates that the Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas has pre-eminence in a sense. The wording recognises the problem and for that reason it is either meaningless or, if it means anything, it will be open to a constitutional challenge. I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently that an independent councillor has said he would be willing to take a constitutional challenge to any such measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">There are many contradictions. The Minister said that he will not treat councillors less favourably. That should be the case because elected councillors have primacy over Oireachtas Members if they are not members of a local authority. That is as it should be. The Minister said that in time people will focus less on local government, but I doubt that. He spoke about the separation of the duties of legislator from those of a local authority member. The abolition of the dual mandate creates a problem for Members of the Oireachtas and this is an attempt by the Minister to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">In fairness to all Members of the Oireachtas I ask the Minister to publish the regulations so that we can see what is proposed by this section. Section (3)(<i>a</i>) proposes “the supply, without charge, of notice, agenda and minutes of local authority meetings to members of either such House”. I can obtain this information from the Internet, as can my next door neighbour or anyone else. Subsection (3)(<i>b</i>) refers to the “supply by local authorities of other specified documentation or other specified information”. I ask the Minister to spell out what this means because it is very important from our point of view and for our rights as Members of the Oireachtas. Subsection (3)(<i>c</i>) is also meaningless because Members correspond with local authorities in the same way they correspond with residents' associations and various bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">This amendment is like the Emperor's clothes and its purpose is to keep backbenchers on board. Members who vote for this amendment are making a mistake.</p>

I wanted to replace the word "guidelines" with the word "regulations". While I am pleased that the Minister has done so, I do not think he went far enough. He could have gone a step or two further in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I am concerned that Oireachtas Members may not be in a position to meet planners and county managers. It is important that provisions are made for us to meet them as we did before. I ask the Minister to consider the incorporation into the regulations of a director of services in the local authority who would have responsibility to deal with Oireachtas Members. I ask whether Senators will be given the same facilities as Deputies when this Bill is adopted. We do not have the same facilities at present and it is important that we are accommodated in a similar fashion.</p>

Area meetings are very important and I referred to them on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Senator Dardis referred to planning matters. Oireachtas Members should be allowed discuss matters such as prior notice provision with council officials. I do not mean they should try to exert influence but rather discuss issues of planning with the officials. I would like to see those issues covered in the regulations.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I appreciate what Senators said. This is a reflection of many concerns raised with me. In the majority of cases, there is no need for such a section. From speaking with colleagues in my party and other parties, I am satisfied that the vast majority of Deputies and Senators have a good working relationship and that there is no need for this provision. There are, in some cases, certain difficulties in regard to access. When one considers some of the people who raised these points, I understand why there might be difficulties in regard to accessing information. I included the amended section in order to clarify matters in regard to subsequent regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The provision is sufficiently broad. As politicians, we have learned collectively that if we try to define everything we will end up trying to deal with local government through the Electoral Acts, etc. No one will be able to take action because the legislation will prevent them from doing so. There is a danger of going too far. I am pleased with the way in which Members, including Senator Bannon, responded to what is set out in the legislation. We will consider regulations subsequently. However, I will not introduce a tome of regulations because people operating at official level would begin consulting it to see what they can and cannot do. The provision works extremely well. This is a broad framework to keep everyone at local authority level aware of what is going on. I respect the Senator's perspective on the issue.</p>

If unlimited expenditure is allowed, it will put pressure on people to spend more money because they will believe themselves to be in competition with everyone else. It would be a good idea to limit local election expenditure. This would end the waste of money, level the playing pitch and limit the amount of money candidates would spend.

In recognition of that, the Minister has taken away the reserve function in regard to waste charges. However, problems could still arise because people might vote against the Estimates and, therefore, there might be a threat to abolish a council. This would mean a council could be abolished but that there would be elections, which would be in keeping with the Constitution. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, he should consider the issue as soon as possible. Despite the recent environmental legislation which makes waste charges a reserve function, problems will arise in relation to local authorities that are threatened with abolition and being replaced by non-elected commissioners. A constitutional challenge will arise at some stage.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_44">Question proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#CharlieMcCreevy" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_156">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy):</from>
          <p eId="para_262">The Finance Bill 2003 implements the tax changes announced in the budget last December and includes a range of other measures, many of which are targeted at closing off tax loopholes and updating and modernising the tax system. This year's Bill has 171 sections and I propose to give an outline of the main provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">Part 1 of the Bill which covers sections 1 to 72 deals with income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. In my period in office the income tax burden has been reduced significantly. The average tax paid, including PRSI and levies, by a single person on the average industrial wage has fallen from 28% in 1997 to 17% today. In 1997 a single employed person on the equivalent of €98 per week was liable for tax. Following this year's budget the figure is €223 per week, an increase of 128%.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Some 380,000 persons or 25% of income earners were exempt from tax in 1997. Following this year's budget, the corresponding figures are 618,000 persons or 36% of income earners. This increase of over 40% in the numbers of exempt earners is even more impressive when one remembers that both the workforce and the numbers on the tax record have grown substantially over the last six years. Before the Government took office in 1997, a single person with an income above €17,270 became liable to tax at the top tax rate. Currently, the standard rate band for a single person stands at €28,000 per annum – higher than the average industrial wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">This lowering of the income tax burden has rewarded both employees and employers alike and contributed to our strong employment growth. However, the circumstances we now face limit the scope for further major reductions in the direct tax burden. Instead we face a period of consolidation. The more limited resources available this year in respect of the budget income tax package are being targeted at those in the lower income brackets and the elderly. When the statutory minimum wage came into effect in April 2000, less than 64% of the minimum wage was exempt from tax in the case of a single person. On foot of the tax measures I took in budget 2002, 90% of the minimum wage became exempt from tax. I am pleased to confirm that section 3 provides for an increase in the employee tax credit which maintains the figure of 90%, even taking account of the increase in the minimum wage in October 2002 to €6.35 per hour. It also increases the entry point to the tax system for all employees from €209 to €223 per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">My other priority this year in relation to the income tax package was to assist the elderly. This is in line with the goal I set myself when I took this job of removing large numbers of elderly taxpayers from the tax net. Section 2 increases the exemption limits from income tax for persons aged 65 years and over to €15,000 for a single person and €30,000 for a married couple – this represents an increase of over 15%. When combined with changes last year, the limits have increased in value by almost 40% over the last two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Section 6 provides for the direct application of PAYE to the currently taxable benefits-in-kind. This will facilitate the application of PRSI, including the training and health contribution levies, to such benefits. From next year, employers will deduct and pay over to the Revenue the appropriate PAYE income tax and PRSI and levies from wages paid to employees at the same time as the benefit is being provided. While income tax has always applied to these benefits, hitherto they have not been subject to PRSI and levies. Application of PRSI and levies to benefits-in-kind is the norm in most EU countries. Share options are not being included in this treatment because of practical issues that apply specifically in their case but revised procedures for their taxation are being introduced in section 8.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">As part of this initiative, section 6 also provides for a major simplification of the calculation of the benefit-in-kind taxable charge in respect of cars and vans. Senators will be aware of my record of introducing simplification into the tax code wherever possible. From next January, a simple five rate structure will apply to cars, replacing the current system where up to 17 different percentages and categories can apply. Many thousands of those paying BIK on cars and vans will see their BIK income tax charge reduce as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Sections 7 and 8 deal with the tax treatment of share options under unapproved share option schemes. I am making a number of changes to ensure that in future the income tax liability is settled at the time the share options are exercised, while providing some relieving measures for those persons currently in difficulty where the tax charge on their share options exceeds the value of the shares. The seven year deferral facility introduced in 2000 is being abolished in the case of options exercised after enactment of the Bill. From 30 June this year a person exercising share options must pay the tax due within 30 days. The tax payment will be taken into account in calculating the person's final liability to income tax for the tax year concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">By way of concession to taxpayers whose income tax liability may be higher than the value of the shares, such taxpayers will have the choice of making a payment on account capped at the value of the shares. The balance of income tax will become due for payment where the taxpayer makes a gain on the disposal of these or other shares. This provision applies where the options were exercised before or on 6 February 2003. If a taxpayer wishes to avail of this provision, he or she must notify the Revenue Commissioners by 1 June this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">Section 9 gives effect to the increase in mortgage tax relief available to first-time buyers. The current annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed is being raised by over one quarter from €3,175 for a single person and €6,350 for a married couple to €4,000 and €8,000, respectively. In addition, the period for which the relief is available will be extended from the current five years to seven years in all. Some 45,000 first-time buyers will benefit from these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Maintaining a broad tax base with low tax rates has contributed successfully to our economic development and strong employment growth. In order to protect the tax base it is essential that tax avoidance schemes and loopholes are tackled vigorously when they come to attention. By tax avoidance schemes, I mean the unintended use of certain tax provisions. These should not be confused with specific tax incentive schemes introduced to encourage certain investments or behaviour. I have a proven record in tackling tax avoidance schemes and closing loopholes. A range of provisions throughout the Bill are designed to put a stop to such schemes or tighten legislation to ensure reliefs are focused on the intended objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Section 12 is designed to counter schemes whereby tax reliefs available to a trading company are transferred to individuals who, although nominally trading, are in practice passive investors. The effect of the section is to ring-fence the tax reliefs arising from certain specified trades carried on by an individual in a passive way to the actual income arising to the individual from that trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Section 13 closes a loophole in regard to the transfer of capital allowances on buildings from companies to individual investors. Where a building in respect of which a company has claimed capital allowances is sold to individual investors, those investors will only be entitled to set the capital allowances related to the building against their rental income from the building concerned, rather than against a wider range of income, as is currently the case. It has since come to my attention that the same effect can be achieved by using borrowings and an intermediary company. I issued a press release last week announcing that I would have a provision in next year's Finance Bill closing off this possibility from the date of the press release. I also intend to close off any other variant of this scheme that comes to my attention in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Section 14 makes a number of changes to the tax regime governing various pension products. In summary, the main items provided for include the alignment of contribution limits for personal retirement savings accounts or PRSAs with those applicable to other personal pensions and occupational schemes; the abolition of the facility to obtain excessive tax relief by making last minute additional contributions just prior to retirement; and new rules that will prevent approved retirement funds being used for investment in assets or property for private or family business use, for example, the purchase of a holiday home by the fund for personal use.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Section 15 provides for a number of changes to ensure the BES and seed capital schemes continue to apply as intended. The schemes are due to expire at the end of this year and I will be reviewing them before next year's budget. Section 16, another anti-avoidance measure, counters contrived arrangements between spouses in relation to mortgage interest relief for investors.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">The question of repayments of overpaid tax and the application of interest to such repayments has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent times arising from the Ombudsman's report entitled, Redress for Taxpayers, on this issue last November. The provisions in existing legislation have grown over time for different purposes and vary both within and across tax heads. At present there is no general right of repayment of tax or general entitlement to interest. In reviewing this issue I considered it essential that a new general provision be introduced which was coherent across different taxes and situations. It is also essential, as I indicated in my response to the Ombudsman's report, that whatever scheme is put in place should take account of the potential Exchequer costs of any new general scheme. I consider the proposals in the Bill represent a balanced approach to these objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Section 17, with other sections of the Bill, provides for a general right of repayment of tax in relation to valid claims made within a four year period. These replace existing provisions on repayments where they are in place. This will apply across all tax heads, except customs duties which are a direct EU tax. The right of the Revenue to make assessments to tax and pursue inquires will also be limited to four years unless it has grounds to suspect fraud or negligence for earlier years.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">These sections also provide for a new general entitlement to interest on overpaid taxes. This provision will apply from six months after the date on which the claim is made by the taxpayer. However, where the Revenue misconstrues the law, interest will be paid in general from the date the excess tax was paid, subject to the overall time limit on repayments of four years. This new scheme will replace all other existing arrangements, including those provisions dealing with interest paid on refunds of overpayments of preliminary tax. The rate of simple interest on repaid tax is being reduced from 0.0161% per day to 0.011% per day or from approximately 6% to 4% per annum. Such interest is tax free. These measures provide a fair and transparent scheme for the refund of overpaid taxes and interest on such refunds in the future. They also address the issue raised by the Ombudsman in relation to the need for a general scheme. All these provisions are subject to a ministerial order and will come into effect after the orders are signed.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">While I am on the topic, I refer to section 166 which provides the Revenue Commissioners with statutory authority to make on a discretionary basis payments for loss of purchasing power to those widows affected by the High Court decision in the case of O'Coindealbhain <i>v.</i> O'Carroll. The Revenue Commissioners will make these payments by reference to the consumer price index, as recommended by the Ombudsman. To complement the statutory provision for widows made in this section and complete the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Ombudsman's report, the Revenue Commissioners will make payments in respect of loss of purchasing power to ten other taxpayers to whom the report refers. These payments will be made by the Revenue Commissioners wholly on an exceptional <i>ex gratia</i> basis to the ten taxpayers concerned and no others. The provisions in section 166 and these <i>ex gratia</i> payments are intended to deal with the cases raised by the Ombudsman only. The general scheme of interest and repayments provided for in the Bill is prospective.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Sections 18 and 19 provide for an extension until 31 December 2004 of the existing schemes of stock relief for farmers in general and for certain young trained farmers. A commencement order will apply to the young trained farmer scheme given potential EU state aid implications. Section 20 provides for a tightening of the type of capital expenditure covered by capital allowances for the purchase of transmission capacity rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Section 21 relates to tax relief on donations. It provides for a maximum limit on the amount of donations that can attract tax relief where the donation is made by an individual directly associated with the organisation, for example, an employee or certain members of the body. In these cases, where the aggregate of donations in a year of assessment is in excess of 10% of the individual's total income, the excess will not attract tax relief. Tax relief for donations in all other situations will continue as currently without any ceiling.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Section 23 gives effect to the increase from five years to eight in the write-off period for allowances for capital expenditure incurred since budget day on plant and machinery. As I indicated in my Budget Statement, I consider it appropriate in present circumstances to seek an equitable balance in raising revenue from all sectors of the community. This is one of the measures which will raise revenue from the business sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Section 24 extends the current scheme of capital allowances for buildings used as private hospitals to hospitals providing certain acute services on a day case basis. The main change made to the provision is that, in the case of a day case hospital, the minimum bed requirement is being reduced to 40 beds from the 70 bed requirement that applies generally. As this extension has been the subject of some public debate, I want to outline how it arose. In the Finance Act 2001 I introduced a scheme to encourage the development of private hospitals. This followed a similar relief to encourage the development of private nursing homes. The scheme had a range of conditions about the services to be provided, the number of beds, etc. to ensure only genuine hospitals qualified as well as providing for conditions such as discounts for public patients. The minimum bed requirement was reduced in last year's Finance Act from 100 to 70.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I was approached towards the end of last year by a constituent who indicated concern that the conditions as set out in the legislation militated against day case hospitals. I asked my officials to meet the persons concerned and examine the issue. In the event the meeting did not take place until towards the end of February and the change to the scheme was made by way of Report Stage amendment to the Bill, though signalled on Committee Stage. I made it clear in the Dáil that the issue came to my attention because of an approach from an individual constituent. I considered there was a very good case for making the change and I would have been of this view no matter who brought it to my attention. The relief was intended to apply to all private hospitals. There was no intention when introduced of excluding day-case hospitals. It is not unusual that the terms and conditions of reliefs are adjusted in the light of experience and of issues brought to my or my Department's attention by promoters of individual projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Section 25 provides for the reduction of the annual rate of write-off for capital expenditure incurred on hotel buildings to 4 % per annum, while the annual capital allowances for holiday cottages are being abolished. Subject to transitional arrangements, both these amendments apply to construction or refurbishment expenditure incurred on or after budget day. The transitional arrangements provide that these changes will not apply to such capital expenditure incurred by 31 December 2004 if a full and valid planning application is received by the relevant planning authority by the end of May 2003. These new dates should cater for the vast majority of cases that have been brought to my attention since the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Section 26 sets out the expiry dates for a number of tax incentive schemes. Those affected are the urban renewal scheme, the town renewal scheme, the park and ride scheme and the student accommodation scheme. Sections 27 to 30 make various minor changes to these schemes. I have always held the view that targeted, well designed tax incentive schemes can be a useful instrument in achieving desirable public policy objectives. As I said earlier, these are very different from unintended uses of the tax system through tax loopholes and avoidance schemes. However the value of such incentive schemes must be balanced against the important objective of ensuring a wide tax base if we are to maintain low rates. It must be borne in mind that such schemes usually also mean that higher earners can reduce their tax bill substantially.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">Given the current and prospective budget situation and the objective of broadening the tax base, I consider it necessary to finish the schemes mentioned, and some others, by the end of next year. I will be keeping all tax expenditures and incentive schemes under review. This is not to say that I will not consider introducing tax incentives where I see the potential benefits as outweighing the other factors I mentioned. The extension of capital allowances to the construction of hospitals providing acute hospital services on a day-case basis is one such example.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Section 32 closes off a loophole relating to tax avoidance schemes involving contrived financial arrangements in relation to a relief available to lessors in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the provision of student accommodation. This section requires, among other restrictions, that any loan involved for the lessor must be taken directly from a financial institution instead of from the third level college. Section 33 tightens up the arrangements for relevant contracts tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">All tax incentives and reliefs are subject to ongoing review. In the case of some of these incentives, there are no legislative provisions regarding a return of the exempt income or gains. The relevant legislation is now being changed in section 35 to provide for the return to Revenue of the details of the exempt income or gains, as well as losses, arising in connection with three of these tax incentives, namely, the exemptions for stallion fees, profits from forestry and greyhound stud fees. This will enable a further assessment to be carried out of the actual costs and benefits involved in these three reliefs. The legislative change will come into effect at the commencement of the next tax year, 1 January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Section 36 closes a loophole, under which the sale by an individual to a company of a rent roll from a building can facilitate tax avoidance. This loophole has been used to seek a situation where, through the sale of the rent-roll to a financial institution, the rental income that should be charged at the 42% rate of income tax is charged instead to corporation tax at the 12.5% rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">Section 38 permits the Government to enter into tax information exchange agreements with the governments of other jurisdictions. Double taxation treaties already provide for exchange of information but this section facilitates agreements with any jurisdiction specifically on exchange of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Section 42 provides for the introduction of a pay and file system for corporation tax. This will require a company to submit the balance of tax within nine months after the end of the accounting period in question. This will align the corporation tax return filing and final payment deadlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I recently established the National Development Finance Agency to assist in providing cost effective finance for public investment projects by advising State authorities on the optimal means of financing and, in some circumstances, providing finance or forming companies to secure finance. Sections 43, 72 and 139 confer exemptions from tax on the NDFA in the performance of its statutory functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Sections 44, 46 and 47 are further anti-avoidance provisions. Section 47 is designed to counter tax avoidance schemes involving a balancing charge, that is, a clawback of capital allowances, arising following the disposal of machinery or plant. These schemes seek to avoid the charge or to pass the balancing charge arising from an individual to a company, which would be taxable at a lower rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Our capital city has become a significant player in international securitisation transactions and it is important that we continue to compete successfully for this business. In order to achieve this, Irish tax law must keep pace with international developments. Securitisation involves the creation of tradable securities, traditionally from existing assets or future income streams. It is used to raise finance in a manner more efficient than traditional borrowing. By its nature the securitisation business is constantly evolving and producing more sophisticated transactions. Section 48 updates our tax regime in order to bring more of this high-value business to Ireland. Accordingly, the overall effect of these changes is to greatly increase the types of financial assets which can be securitised.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Section 31 on dealing in securities and section 37 on matching foreign exchange gains and losses on certain assets are also targeted at facilitating a strong international financial services industry. Ireland has also become a successful international centre for fund management. A feature of this sector in Ireland is that a high proportion of the business is fund administration. Our strategy is to build on this by encouraging more fund promoters to locate their investment management function here, in addition to their fund administration operations. In this regard, section 51 removes a technical obstacle to achieving this goal by providing that a tax liability on a foreign fund will not arise solely because of the activity of the Irish agent acting on its behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Section 62 amends the scheme of tonnage tax for shipping companies introduced in the Finance Act 2002 to conform to EU requirements. Tonnage tax is a scheme whereby, as an alternative to charging corporation tax on certain profits of a qualifying shipping company, a tax charge is levied each year instead on the tonnage of the ships operated by the company. The amendments to the scheme include confining the tonnage tax regime to profits derived from shipping activities and a requirement for separate accounting where a company engages in tonnage tax activities and other activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Sections 65, 66 and 67 make significant changes to the capital gains tax regime to remove some relieving provisions which I feel are less necessary now that the tax rate is set at 20%. These changes will also spread the burden of the revenue-raising measures needed in the current budgetary situation. Section 65 gives effect to my budget announcement that indexation relief will not apply for years after 2002. Section 66 removes the facility to defer capital gains tax by the issue of debentures, loan stock or other similar securities.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">Section 67 abolishes roll-over relief. This relief allowed for the indefinite deferral of a capital gains tax charge on gains accruing on the disposal of certain assets where the proceeds were reinvested in certain other assets. This change is effective for all disposals from 4 December 2002 onwards. In some cases, the tax has been rolled over on several occasions, and in some cases gains realised over 20 years ago remain untaxed. With a low CGT rate now firmly in place, it is an opportune time to widen the base to ensure all pay tax on their gains when they are realised.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">Certain tax rules, which, at present, allow individuals to avoid a capital gains tax charge by selling assets during a period of temporary residence abroad, are being changed. Section 69 accordingly imposes a capital gains tax charge in such circumstances. Section 70 ensures that a person receiving a payment under a non-competition agreement is liable to tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">Section 72 adds certain persons to the list of those who are entitled to exemption from capital gains tax. These additions are sports bodies and registered trade unions, subject to certain conditions being fulfilled. This is consistent with the income tax exemptions already available to such bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Sections 73 to 86 relate to alcohol products tax and include provisions to consolidate and modernise excise legislation covering the various alcohol products in order to make it more accessible to users. The opportunity is also being taken to streamline existing provisions and to make some minor changes in the area of offences. Sections 87 to 90 are restatements of existing provisions on foot of the consolidation and modernisation of existing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">Section 91 confirms the budget night increase in the rates of excise duty on auto diesel which, when VAT is included, amounts to 3 cent per litre. Section 92 confirms the budget night increase in the main rate of excise duty on spirits which, when VAT is included, amounts to 20 cent on a standard measure. The lower rate of duty which had applied to low strength spirit alcopop drinks is also abolished.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Section 93 provides for an updated offence of selling, delivering or keeping for sale any spirits on which excise duty has not been paid. It also provides for a presumption in any proceedings for an offence involving counterfeit spirits that excise duty has not been paid on those spirits.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Section 96 confirms the budget night increase in the rate of duty on cigarettes which, when VAT is included, amounts to 50 cent on a typical packet of 20 with <i>pro rata</i> increases in respect of other tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Sections 101 and 106 make an amendment to the definition of crew cabs for VRT proposes. Such cabs have the capacity to act as domestic and commercial work vehicles. This will ensure smaller domestic type crew cabs, currently classified as category C vehicles and liable for flat VRT of €50, will be reclassified as category B vehicles liable for VRT of 13.3%. The Bill also includes an amendment to the definition of "pick-ups" to ensure certain genuine, small pick-up trucks will continue to be correctly classified as category C, not category B. Section 103 confirms the budget change whereby the 30% VRT rate will apply to vehicles exceeding 1900cc.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The electronic commerce directive provides for changes in the rules concerning business to business on-line supplies, new rules regarding on-line supplies of services for private customers in the European Union from outside the Union and a special scheme for such non-EU suppliers where supplies are made to private consumers. A series of sections in this part of the Bill transpose the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The VAT invoicing directive aims to simplify, modernise and harmonise the conditions laid down for VAT invoicing and remove barriers to electronic storage and transmission of invoices across the European Union. The Revenue Commissioners have issued regulations which partially give effect to the directive. However, it is necessary to transpose the remainder in section 122 and follow-on regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Three changes are proposed to the VAT treatment of property. Last year's Finance Act introduced the concept of economic value into VAT law. Economic value means the cost of acquisition and development of a property and identifies the full amount on which the developer claims input VAT in respect of the development of a property. This concept was introduced to prevent avoidance schemes. Section 114 ensures the meaning of "development" in the definition of economic value includes expenditure such as architects' and other professional fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Short-term letting of property is usually exempt from VAT. It is possible, however, to waive the exemption on short-term letting and charge VAT at the standard rate. In some cases, prior to short-term letting, individuals will have claimed input VAT on the development of the property with the intention of entering into long-term leases which did not materialise. The change in section 117 allows the Revenue to take this into account when calculating what the taxpayer needs to pay if he or she then cancels the waiver. Section 121 creates a requirement to maintain records as long as the property is in the VAT net and for six years thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Sections 140 and 143 confirm various increases to stamp duty on credit and other cards, cheques and non-residential property. Section 141 gives effect to the announcement on budget day that a specific contribution to the Exchequer is to be obtained from the financial sector for the three year period 2003 to 2005. The targeted contribution is €100 million per annum for each of the three years. The required amount for 2003 is to be obtained from each relevant financial institution or group by way of a special stamp duty of 50% of the amount of the tax payable on deposit interest by it to the Revenue in the calendar year 2001, excluding any arrears relating to earlier years. This charge is subject to an upper limit of 0.15% of the institution's or group's average deposits from Irish residents in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Part 5 of the Bill deals with a number of changes to the capital acquisitions tax code. Section 146 makes changes to the general administration of CAT and will facilitate swifter processing of gift and inheritance tax returns. The new measures already apply to other taxes and the changes mean that in the future the system of self-assessment for CAT will be more like the system that currently operates for the other self-assessed taxes. In addition, the changes are an essential element in the Revenue's soon-to-be launched on-line filing facility for CAT returns.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Section 149 provides that with effect from 1 January 2003 the annual small gifts exemption is increased from €1,270 to €3,000. Sections 157 to 162 deal with Revenue powers and administration. Section 160 increases the maximum fine for summary offences from €1,900 to €3,000. Section 161 contains a number of provisions to facilitate the investigation and successful prosecution of revenue offences. It is proposed to allow for the creation of certain evidential presumptions in relation to proof of books, records etc in court proceedings for tax evasion cases. A provision is also included creating an offence of falsifying, concealing or destroying documents relating to a Revenue investigation. A judge hearing a trial on indictment will now be able to make information available to the jury to assist it in its deliberations. Such information would include charts, transcripts, summary information etc. Section 162 allows unpaid penalties to be pursued in the District and Circuit Courts as well as the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Revenue powers have been significantly enhanced in recent years. There is a need to take regular stock of the remit of such powers to assure the Government and the public at large that these powers are meeting the needs of the taxation system and being used as the Oireachtas intended. The opportunity now presents itself to perform a stock-taking exercise to ensure the current balance and strategic direction are correct. Accordingly, I have recently established a high level group chaired by former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Frank Murphy, to examine the current provisions and make recommendations for any changes considered necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Section 164 is an enabling provision that will allow the Revenue Commissioners to oblige certain categories of taxpayer to file returns and pay tax electronically. There are considerable benefits from electronic interaction with the Revenue but I consider it desirable that the move to electronic filing and payment be achieved to the greatest extent possible on a voluntary basis. Save in exceptional circumstances, I do not envisage bringing the new provisions which are subject to a commencement order into effect until further consultation has taken place with practitioners and there is a fuller understanding of the reasons more voluntary use is not being made of electronic filing for certain taxes or categories of taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">As Minister for Finance, I have managed in successive budgets and Finance Bills to create a low tax rate environment across all taxheads. It is a position from which the economy has thrived. Despite the need to increase revenue yield this year, I have stuck to my core belief that the best direct tax rates are low tax rates. However, if we want low rates, we must also secure a wide tax base to fund this policy. This Finance Bill is designed to consolidate our position going forward. I commend it to the Seanad.</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_318">One of the problems one faces as Opposition spokesperson is that if one sketches the gloomy reality of the current crisis in the economy, one invariably attracts the comment that one is playing politics or not acting in the national interest but nothing could be further from the truth. The economy is in big trouble and the Celtic tiger a thing of the past. It is highly doubtful it can be resurrected or resuscitated under the current regime. The difficulties facing the economy are largely, although not exclusively, self-inflicted. They arise as a result of Government mismanagement, a frightening and growing lack of competitiveness and a fundamental failure to tackle key issues which make it increasingly difficult for enterprise to survive, let alone thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The clearest and most irrefutable proof that we have a major crisis in the economy is provided by the number of job losses. Ten days ago the Small Firms Association estimated that 400 jobs per week were being lost to the economy. Based on current trends, this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future as investment and business confidence continue to weaken. When investment begins to decline, job creation dries up and when confidence dissipates, investment dries up.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The statistics contained in the Forfás report published last month speak volumes. During the last two years we have lost 61,000 jobs which had been assisted and grant-aided by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. They were created on the back of the success and confidence of the Celtic tiger. The sad reality is that few of those losing their jobs have been able to find alternative employment because the current climate does not facilitate job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">We should not look at these 61,000 jobs as merely cold statistics. Each job lost is a tragedy for the community but particularly for the jobholder. In many cases, the jobholder is the main earner of a family and there are all the knock-on consequences, including loss of income, signing on the unemployment register, the slashing of a family's standard of living, mortgage difficulties and the inevitable prospect of having to sell the family home and car.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">In a recent article in the <i>Western People,</i> my local paper, journalist Michael Commins quoted from an interview with Mr. Pius Ford, a key activist with the Irish community in Manchester and the British midlands. Mr. Ford confirmed that the trend of Irish emigrant families returning to this country over the past ten years to set up home and enjoy the fruits of the Celtic tiger has not alone been stopped but is being reversed. The Claremorris-based company Ark Furniture Removals has confirmed that its business is booming, but in the wrong direction. Many of these families are uprooting and returning to Britain lock, stock and barrel. The reasons given by those interviewed and by the company are stated to be job losses, the cost of living since the introduction of the euro and poor services, particularly in the health sector. These people return to Britain sad, disillusioned, devastated and embittered. They are embittered that the dream of seeing out the rest of their and their children's lives in the country of their birth and origin has been shattered.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">The main reason jobs are being killed off is that the Government seemed to blandly accept that the boom was guaranteed as far into the future as could be foreseen, and that there was no end in sight. We are in our present situation because the Government did not adopt prudent management practices. It failed to put the national interest before narrow self-interest in its reckless determination to spend its way back into office. The Government knew exactly what it was doing and it has left a dire legacy, similar to that of its predecessor in 1977, which it will take light years to repair.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">It is well known that the key to job stability and creation is competitiveness. Ireland's competitiveness was the key pillar on which the Celtic tiger was created. Sadly, we are no longer competitive. The cost of creating and sustaining a job is simply too high. If an economy ceases to be competitive, indigenous employers will go out of business and foreign industrialists will up sticks and go elsewhere. Who could blame them?</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Our inflation rate is double that of our European colleagues. I use the word "colleagues" advisedly because, though we may be colleagues under the EU umbrella, when it comes to competing and seeking out valuable enterprises they are able to out-bid us. Our competitiveness has disappeared – the edge which was so attractive and which was part of the magical formula that attracted jobs here in such numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Enterprises and industrialists look at competitiveness and infrastructure, but what do they see when they look at this country? They see broadband communications not rolled out and lagging behind other countries; traffic congestion which means that delivery costs are too high – Dublin is second only to Calcutta in that respect; a country that has failed to meet its electricity generation requirements which has led to inadequate and unreliable power supply; a country where electricity costs are expensive; and one where there is a Third World rail system.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">They look at Government policy in terms of prices and see a country where the Government has consciously added to overall costs, a situation further fuelled by the Government decision to increase VAT rates from 12.5% to 13.5% in this Finance Bill, increasing costs for an average family by €182. They see motor tax increased by €30, hospital charges increased by €133, the qualifying threshold for the drugs refund scheme increased by almost €200, VHI costs up by €66, cigarettes and alcohol up by €180, bank charges up by €83, ESB bills up by €72 and college fees up by €275. All of these increases are a direct consequence of a conscious decision as part of the Minister's budgetary policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">To the average family, the cumulative negative impact is approximately €1,500 per annum. Increases in local authority service charges and the 9% increase announced by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Séamus Brennan, the week after the budget for Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann charges add to the impact. The increases deliver a solar plexus blow to thousands of families, many of whom voted for the return of this Government to office on 17 May last and are now left belatedly to rue that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">One of the most damning indictments of this Government's performance has been its failure to protect jobs and living costs by tackling grossly excessive and extremely damaging insurance costs. Small enterprises employing 20 to 30 people are expected to pay employer's liability insurance of €60,000 per annum. How can such small enterprises keep trading when, in a declining market environment, there is a 40% hike in insurance, not on a phased basis but in one fell swoop? The more people they employ, the more punitive the insurance premiums become.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I know of two small enterprises in my immediate area which have had to throw in the towel and close down simply because they were not in a position to pay the 40% increase in insurance liability. More companies will go to the wall because of the excessive insurance premiums being demanded. We have seen, for example, St. Patrick's Day festivals being abandoned throughout the country this year because communities could not afford public liability insurance. Children's playgrounds have been closed down in many places for the same reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">Some time ago when a Member of the Dáil, I carried out a survey of public liability claims against local authorities. As far as I can recall, in the case of Dublin Corporation there were 593 claims in a particular year. Of those, approximately 580 were settled out of court, some on the steps of the courthouse. Some 40% of the cost of those claims went on legal costs. The management and operation of insurance in Ireland is absolutely crazy. For example, if somebody trips on a pavement outside Leinster House this evening, they do not have to lodge a claim with the local authority until 24 March 2006. Three years can elapse before a claim has to be submitted. In the name of sweet heaven, how can any local authority enter any kind of a defence when such is the situation? Where would be the proof, evidence or witnesses?</p>
          <p eId="para_332">It is an untenable situation but one that could be addressed in one fell swoop by a simple piece of legislation. This has not been done. I welcome the establishment of a State claims agency but that is only a trivial rectification of a situation that is totally out of control. It is well-known that the courts process hundreds of fraudulent claims, which are corroborated and assisted by the manner in which the legal profession and, to an extent, the medical profession operate. The courts should not have to deal with insurance claims; they should deal exclusively with criminal matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Ireland should adopt a model similar to the quick, efficient, non-adversarial and streamlined system which operates successfully in New Zealand. Such a system delivers claims on time, in a judicious manner and with minimum costs and the involvement of lawyers is largely dispensed with. There can be massive awards in this jurisdiction, but large lump sums are not awarded, irrespective of the extent of a person's injuries, on foot of claims in New Zealand. Awards are made in instalments to cover maintenance and day-to-day living costs, but, unlike the system in this country, payments cease when the person who has been awarded compensation dies.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">A recent survey conducted by the Irish Insurance Federation highlighted what everybody knows, namely, that the number of fraudulent insurance claims has escalated beyond all proportion. It should be a criminal offence, punishable by law, for a person to lodge a fraudulent insurance claim. However, such legal provisions are not in place. Payments are sanctioned in respect of fraudulent claims each day because it can be cheaper for insurance companies to settle out of court rather than pursuing an expensive legal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, mentioned changes in vehicle registration tax. This country's failure to tackle this issue flies in the face of what happens in Europe. The VRT rate for a car with an engine capacity of less than 1400cc is 22.5% of the open market selling price, the rate is 25% for cars between 1401cc and 1901cc and it is 30% in relation to cars that are over 1902cc, as a result of the Minister's adjustment. VRT represents a huge imposition on a person buying even a modest family car.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The manner in which accounts held under the special savings investment scheme, which was introduced by the Minister for Finance, have lost their value is frightening and may yet exceed the Eircom debacle. Why did he not provide in this Bill an escape hatch for those who are trapped for the next five years? Ark Life, Irish Permanent and the Bank of Ireland have said that holders of special savings accounts that are linked to equities are losing substantial amounts of money. Not only are they losing their basic savings, but the Government bonus is also being eroded.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The 1% increase in the basic rate of VAT is punitive and will impact across the board. It has not yet started to bite, but people will feel its effects soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I will make submissions in relation to individual sections on Committee Stage. I will make clear during that debate that the Finance Bill 2003 has failed miserably to provide the propulsion and energy needed by the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">I wish to comment on one or two points made by Senator Higgins. The Senator implied that the Celtic tiger could be revived if other parties were in Government, but I do not think such an idea is based on reality. The eight years of exceptional growth enjoyed by this country resulted from a combination of certain exceptional conditions and the fact that the right policies were pursued at the right time. If the right policies are pursued in the future, however, it is unrealistic to expect an annual growth rate of between 8% and 10% over a period of years, even if Fine Gael is in Government. Employment levels in this country are quite good, when one considers the prevailing international conditions. There was no net loss of employment last year; there was a marginal gain.</p>

          <p eId="para_346">—on a Third World railway. Having travelled from Kilkenny on my way back from a meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, I totally disagree with the Senator's opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The suggestion that this country is in the same financial position as it was between 1977 and 1981 is false because our economic and financial fundamentals have never been so strong. I believe they will remain strong. The Seanad has only a formal legislative role in relation to Finance Bills and its input is, to all intents and purposes, a mere formality. Senators can help the legislative process, however, by deliberating on the Bill's provisions and giving advice on future developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The most important function of a Finance Bill is to enact the provisions of the budget. I am sure it will be pointed out tomorrow that the tax concessions provided in the Bill are well below indexation, whereas social welfare increases, which will be debated in the House later this evening, are slightly above indexation. The ESRI gave a positive analysis of the distributive impact of the budget and mentioned that those who will gain from it will be those in the bottom 40% of the population. There will be some losses at the higher end of the scale. The Minister mentioned that one of the budget's objectives – one with which I agree – is to retain low tax rates. It is terribly important, in the interests of employment, to ensure that our tax system remains competitive. Our tax system was hopelessly uncompetitive for much of the past 25 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">I spoke to a British MP in Kilkenny about the many extra impositions that are about to come into effect as a result of Gordon Brown's budget, particularly the increase in employers' national insurance contributions. Ireland is competitive in relation to such matters. It is important that Ireland can compete with its nearest neighbour, given that we share a similar geographic space with it and the fact that people in both countries speak mainly English.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">There have been no indications so far this year that the public finances will not stay on track and I am hopeful that they will. We will know more after the publication of the figures for the first quarter. The real issue in relation to financial management is the generation of maximum revenue and economic growth. The Government has been more successful in the past five years, in terms of generating increased revenue, than any other Government in the history of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The budget is very much in line with the new social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress. I am sure recommendations will be brought forward on Committee Stage as part of an attempt to fully index tax allowances. The taxation section of Sustaining Progress does not say anything about tax indexation, which, frankly, is impossible this year. It states, "The objective is to ensure that the tax system facilitates a level of economic growth sufficient to maintain high levels of employment and quality public services, is fair and able to adapt to changing economic circumstances". It also states personal tax reductions will be focused on keeping those on the minimum wage out of the tax net. We have achieved and are maintaining the target of 90% in this respect and moving towards a target which will ensure 80% of all earners will pay tax at not more than the standard rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">Over the past year or two the Minister has frequently made the point, backed up by the European Commission on more than one occasion, that we have the most favourable income tax system for the low paid of any country in Europe. The budget has not affected this. People can use phrases such as "stealth taxes" or "tax drag" but it was important to maintain the low rates of 20% and 42% that we have achieved. I support fully the efforts of the Government in this regard. It was also important to honour, in the interests of predictability and reliability, the pledge to reduce corporation tax rate to 12.5%, which has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Sustaining low tax levels cannot be done without also looking at expenditure levels. The Minister shares my horror at the escalating cost of infrastructural projects, in respect of which those involved are thinking of a price and doubling it. Part of the problem concerns land compensation, at which we must look very closely, to the point of examining the constitutional position.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">People need to look for lower cost solutions rather than accepting deluxe engineering decisions. Nowhere is this more important than in public transport plans for the greater Dublin area. Some of the planners have got to get real because we are talking about vast sums of money which could be spent on other social priorities such as health and education.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I compliment the Minister on the way in which he has increased the age exemption limits over a series of budgets such that any pensioner, even one on above average income, is free from the tax net. Housing policy is very important. Not all young people want to rent houses over a long period. This must be kept under very close review.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Farmers are a little disappointed about roll-over relief, which is still under discussion. I do not disagree with the Minister's position. A deal was negotiated with the farmers a year or two ago when they were blocking roads and buildings. Perhaps the proposal on roll-over relief is contrary to their expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I support very strongly the Minister in his efforts, which he must redouble, to counter tax avoidance methods. He defined them very well as "unintended use of certain tax provisions." I have often wondered if there could not be some general clause which would put a question mark over anything that is not explicitly provided for in the relevant legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I am in favour of the Minister's press release on a provision to close off the possibility of tax abuses from the date of that press release. Once a problem has been identified one can issue a press release and say it will be dealt with in the next Finance Bill. That is proper order. It is a scandal that some of the highest earners in the economy are paying little or no tax or less tax than most. Pressure from the accountancy profession has to be resisted. Those who are doing really well should not begrudge paying tax and supporting services which contribute to their prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Minister is correct to get rid of many of the reliefs which are mostly property related. There is no great case for relief of what are relatively sure-fire investments. It is a good principle that incentives be time-limited rather than endlessly extended. Incentives should be concentrated where there are serious risks involved or most of those engaging in the activity concerned do not make any profit or make losses. There are a few examples of this. One uncontroversial example relates to the removal of VAT from books in 1982, after which the publishing industry never looked back.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">I have some regrets about the curtailment of film relief. There was much risk involved. I accept that it cost a lot but it helped to develop an Irish film industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">On the subject of income tax breaks for artists and writers, <i>The Irish Times</i> featured an article entitled, The tax break that makes art possible. This exemption was courtesy of one Charles J. Haughey. When the Minister was in Cheltenham, there was an article about Irish horses being a race apart, stating that the unique quality of Ireland's trainers and riders once again produced an unforgettable Cheltenham festival.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn:</from>
          <p eId="para_368">I do not like accountants but there are exceptions. When one hears of a company that has just appointed a new chief executive who was formerly the financial controller, one can see the company change. The companies that once were driven towards looking after their clients and customers suddenly become driven by percentages and money. I learned very early in business that one can sometimes make more money by reducing the percentage – the use of percentage to express a margin is banned in our company. I know I am speaking here to the converted and that there are exceptions to these accountants and I am delighted that the Minister is one of them. He has given examples in his speech, when he referred to his low tax policy. Since the Minister has taken office, he has if I am correct reduced capital gains tax, corporation tax and betting tax, and has each time earned more money. It is possible to bring down the percentage of tax in business and actually get in more revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">If I were to leave one thought in the Minister's mind today, it would relate to value for money in public spending. This need is not understood in the public service, nor has it been in the past. We can expect very little growth in tax revenues in the foreseeable future, as Senator Mansergh said. It may be hard to deliver even the tax yield currently expected. It thus becomes more critical than ever that we get a firm grip on public spending and prevent it from running completely out of control, as it has done so spectacularly in the recent past.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">This will not be made any easier by Sustaining Progress, the new partnership agreement, because it includes as well as everything else the benchmarking awards. We are looking at a quite substantial increase in public spending with very little to show in the way of return – this at a time of little or no revenue growth to fund that extra spending. Benchmarking – I am sure Senator Ross will have something to say about it – is a done deal at this stage, and nothing can roll it back. What it imposes on us is an obligation to revisit the issue of public spending, to see if we can squeeze better value out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">A favourite theme of mine is how value for money is almost totally ignored when it comes to public spending. We cannot allow such a situation to continue. I often draw the contrast between spending in the private sector and in the public sector, and I have no doubt that the private sector operates better in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">In a private company, when a spending proposal is made, the first question asked relates to the benefits that might flow from the expenditure, and if the benefits are in proportion to the costs. If they are, the spending is approved. That never seems to happen in the public sector. The private sector considers goals, objectives and measurements in order to see if value for money can be obtained. Companies which do not take this approach soon go out of business. Because Governments do not go out of business, that basic discipline is lacking. When a proposal is made in the public sector, the decision to accept it is largely based on political factors. Cost comes into it peripherally, and a costs and benefits balance hardly ever arises. What often decides the question is whether or not the money is there to spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">A typical case which has frustrated me recently is the putting of money into reducing hospital waiting lists. We have spent a lot of money on this over the years, yet the lists have not been reduced. I do not know what cost measurements take place in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">The way we approach public spending is even worse in projects, because we do not attempt to assess their costs or benefits. This is the practice of throwing money at problems on the assumption that if we spend money, we must get a corresponding result. The proof that this is a wrong approach is shown clearly by the health service. Over the past five years we have more than doubled the amount spent on health, but what have we to show for it?</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I am concerned about value for money in the health service. Let me tell the House of something that happened in the Mater Hospital yesterday. A man went in for throat surgery for cancer. There were two medical teams, oncologists and plastic surgeons, all ready, but they then had to cancel, because budgets were not met. They were obliged to stand around and do nothing, though they were being paid. Some part of the budget did not kick in. That happened on another occasion recently in the Mater Hospital. Medical staff were obliged to stand around and not attend to the public patients, though funds had been allocated, but not to certain aspects of treatment, yet the State is spending money on sending public patients abroad to be catered for in the private sector. I mention the Mater Hospital because I know something about it, but I am sure such situations occur in other hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We regularly hear of hospitals closing off facilities, reducing public services. The money was spent on the assumption that a favourable result would automatically flow from it, but despite all the health service spending, results are not being delivered. The service seems to be bloated with administrators rather than medical practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Since we cannot expect to increase Government revenues in the short-term, we must spend our public money better. As we have almost totally neglected the issue of value for money, this is the obvious place for us to start. I appreciate the Minister staying to hear my view, and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely. If we are to tackle the issue, we must focus on value for money in future.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">I welcome the Minister to the House and I also welcome this Finance Bill, not so much for its detail but for the general philosophy behind it. It is difficult to welcome a Bill which is basically cutting back on some of the gains which we have made in recent years, but it is also irresponsible not to recognise the difficulties which the Government has faced in the economy in the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">It would be easy always to oppose everything seen as unpopular, as an Opposition usually does. Such blind opposition would be wrong in the case of a Bill of this sort, which is a recognition of the realities of the economy. I am disappointed in the reaction of those on this side of the House, because one of the strange things about being in Opposition is that it never has a good word to say about the Government. It has said bad things about it in good times and in bad times. These are the easy times to oppose.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I would have more easily taken the Fine Gael reservations as expressed by their spokesman if I had heard anything constructive. It is very easy to say that this is the Government which bought the election. To some extent it did and it is easy to say that the electorate now feels fooled by the Government promises made. There is some justification in that statement too, but they were all at it. It was the most incredible bidding war since 1977.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Whereas the Government has not fulfilled all its promises, I think it was Senator Norris who said in an earlier debate that he was glad it had not done so. If all the promises made by the Opposition had been fulfilled, we would have been bankrupt by Christmas. Thank God the Opposition did not get into Government, because there was a danger that it might have paid off every Eircom shareholder, and that the taxi drivers might have got some extraordinary compensation for running a closed shop for so long. I am sorry if I have embarrassed the Minister of State.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross:</from>
          <p eId="para_383">He might not agree with regard to that area and I would be interested in his comments. I have a view on it which does not reflect particularly well on the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Deputy McCreevy has been a great Minister for Finance. Some would say that he has had an easy time, but he has been directed by a philosophy which is not particularly popular in the country in its raw form – a fairly basic commitment to private enterprise and the entrepreneur which sometimes treads on the many corns of vested interests. No one has encountered more political opposition from minorities and the politically correct than the Minister, but he has the courage in difficult times to do what is necessary and stick by what he believes in. That is difficult for a politician. It is simpler to take the easy way out.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I draw one exception to that. The House will forgive me if I mention public expenditure, which Senator Quinn so eloquently dealt with. The most irresponsible financial, economic or fiscal decision taken by any recent Government was to pay the full benchmarking award. It is even more disturbing that there is almost unanimous agreement in the House about it. There is no need to have a debate on benchmarking, for all the political parties are agreed on it. If they are not agreed, they are being as quiet as church mice about it because they are scared stiff of taking on any vested interests. I am disappointed that the Minister, who has shown such courage in other areas, did not take on the benchmarking monster, which is, of course, an enormous increase in public expenditure at the very time when we cannot afford it.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">An estimated €1.5 billion, and probably more, will be paid out if this agreement, from which Senator Mansergh read, is passed by the unions, employers and farmers, particularly the first two groups. It was an extremely cynical exercise. The report on benchmarking was issued on 30 June 2002. It was peculiarly timed so that the public service unions would not cause difficulties before the election. If one is being charitable, it was an extraordinary coincidence. Those unions did not cause difficulties. After the election, everything was apparently agreed behind closed doors, but the benchmarking body suffered an extraordinary blow when, many weeks before the report's publication, its most independent member decided to leave. It is quite obvious that he bailed out because he regarded the report as a ready-up. It was agreed with powers in IBEC and the ICTU, under Government pressure to agree anything and not to cause splits before the election, and out they came.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Unfortunately, the Minister afterwards agreed to those twin pressures from the so-called social partners which have become almost irresistible to successive Governments, which have given them so much power that it is almost impossible to enter debate in this Chamber without someone proudly stating that they will do nothing until they have consulted, normally with the unions but occasionally with the employers too, although the latter group tends to be their lapdog. The Minister comes here to say that he will of course consult with the social partners before he does something. It is in virtually every script. Why the hell should he consult with them?</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Senator Mansergh read from that document. If I am not mistaken, Senator McDowell is reading it now as I speak. There is all-party agreement that it is the most important document, for it decides the future finances of this country. The Senators bring it up here before the debate and take their instructions from the unions and the employers – that is where the danger lies – on corporation tax, capital gains tax and the biggest possible item of public expenditure, public service pay. Senator Quinn touched on this matter too. For some extraordinary reason, public servants are getting a far better deal than those who work in the private sector. Why are they getting more? Why are they getting back money? Why is no one in this House prepared to say that it is wrong? The reason is that they are all scared stiff of the teachers, the nurses and all those particularly powerful unions and will not say a word against them, although most people know that the award cannot be afforded. Politicians cannot and will not stand up to those vested interests.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Mr. Kenneally:</from>
          <p eId="para_393">As an accountant, I stand here with some trepidation. I heard Senator Quinn's views and Senator Ross will be glad to hear that I will not refer to the aforementioned document in my contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">I congratulate the Minister on many of the Bill's provisions, as he has made many radical and welcome changes to the income tax code. "Radical change" is a phrase often trotted out, but it can mean very little in real life. In this instance the Minister has made real changes to the tax code by moving over recent years to a system based on tax credits, which means that the poorest segment of society does proportionately better than the well-off. Previously the system was skewed in favour of the better-off, and there was no real effort to bridge the gap between rich and poor. Like Robin Hood in reverse, the rich got richer while the poor drifted ever farther out of reach down the poverty ladder. When the bands were widened and the allowances increased, it was the poor who lost out. Now, while both groups get the same amount of money, it means proportionately more to the less well-off than the relatively rich.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The Minister will recall that I expressed reservations about his individualisation proposals. He knows well that I am not one who often takes such action. I did not do so lightly, but I felt very strongly that we were not recognising the role of the homemaker adequately and that we were taking the wrong path. Thankfully, the Minister listened to those of us who had such reservations at the time, and some progress has been made since with the introduction of the homemaker's allowance. I am pleased that the Minister has seen fit to make changes, and we have a much fairer system as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I am glad that the Minister proposes in section 14 to extend the capital gains tax exemption to personal retirement savings account assets. People are living longer nowadays and, in view of the age profile and pension liability which faces us, I am glad that people generally are making better personal provision to protect the value of their pensions and, consequently, their standard of living. It is to be hoped that the Minister's action will encourage people to make even better provision. The phrase "an old head on young shoulders" comes to mind, for it is difficult to encourage people to make provision for their pensions from a young age, when it would be at its cheapest. The thought of planning for a retirement which could well be over 40 years in the future would occur only to the most sensible of young people or those, such as public servants, who must make mandatory payments. Any incentive to encourage such forward planning is to be very much welcomed, as it will also help take part of the burden from the shoulders of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">I recall when capital gains tax was reduced from 40% to 20%, something previously mentioned. The Minister was heavily criticised for doing so. The income from this source rose during the period while the exemption limits were halved, but inflation in the meantime makes a strong case for raising them substantially again.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Minister is attempting to bring equity to the rates of interest paid on taxes overdue and taxes overpaid. While those who overpay are refunded with a 4% bonus, those who owe money to the Revenue Commissioners are penalised at a much higher rate. I welcome the Minister's efforts to regularise matters and to introduce a measure of equity, but I hope it does not become more profitable to overpay tax in the expectation of a 4% return than to invest one's money in the bank.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally:</from>
          <p eId="para_400">It is a possibility. We are all too well aware that the old bugbear, inflation, is a problem once more. It affects our competitiveness and has had an adverse effect on our "fundamentals", that much loved term from some years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">While a number of factors are involved, indirect taxation is a major concern. Having reduced the general rate of VAT to 20%, the Minister raised it to its previous level of 21%. I urge him to consider reversing this decision to relieve pressure and to reduce inflation. There is every reason to believe that the present rise in inflation is a temporary setback, but any measure to curb it should be given serious consideration. I was under the impression that our eventual VAT target was a rate of 17%, which would bring us into line with our European partners. During his summation, I would appreciate indications from the Minister of his plans in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Ease of comparison is one of the many benefits of the euro, but tourists are complaining about our prices which obviously exceed those on the Continent. Pricing ourselves out of the market would be disastrous for the tourism industry, traditionally one of our largest employers and sources of foreign revenue. We must reduce indirect taxes as a matter of urgency as this will help to reduce inflation and impact positively on wage demands and awards.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I am well aware of the dangers, having witnessed the recent loss of 63 jobs in my constituency. The jobs at Honeywell were further up the skills ladder than is usually the case but they were not lost to the company, rather they were transferred to India. India is much more competitive and has a better educated young population than was the case in the past. It is now in the position we were in 20 years ago and we must be on our guard against creating a climate in which jobs are lost to another well-educated but less costly workforce in another jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">While I have just preached in favour of lower excise duties and indirect taxation, I feel we must tackle tobacco consumption once and for all. The only way to do this effectively is to raise the price of the product until it is outside the reasonable reach of the consumer. As this would have an adverse effect on the consumer price index, cigarettes should be excluded or two CPI figures should be published. The CPI figure which does not account for cigarette consumption should be agreed by the social partners as the basis for wage demands and negotiations. The special nature of the problem and the health, social and financial costs of smoking to society are reasons the principle would gain universal approval. I realise there might be difficulties at EU level, but we should pursue such a policy nonetheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I note the Bill provides for further extensions to urban renewal schemes. This is a regular occurrence which makes it appear that the deadlines we place on such schemes are never taken seriously by developers and property owners. We must address this problem. Limits are limits and we should stick rigidly to them. The substantial benefits to developers of the schemes are reason to require them at least to meet their deadlines. Projects will go on and on while the guidelines and regulations continue to be flouted. It is ridiculous to continue to extend these deadlines. The only case for postponement is if it is necessary to commence an archaeological dig.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Our economy is sound as a result of the policies implemented by this and the previous Governments. The setbacks it is experiencing can be withstood by our broad base of employment. We are in a far stronger position than we were a decade and a half ago when a mood of blackness covered the country. While we have lost a certain number of jobs in the current downturn, we have experienced nothing like the setbacks we suffered when our employment base was devastated by business and industry closures. These things are cyclical and will improve in the future. In the meantime, we must maintain our competitiveness and ensure that we do not lose out to developing economies with attractions which are similar to ours but less costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">We must continue to improve our infrastructure. Any capital spending is a good investment. We recoup almost 20% of such moneys through income tax and VAT, which means that the impact is not as great as it seems at first glance. I have a great interest in the future of the motorway from Dublin to Waterford and in the development of other motorways. It is vital that these developments go ahead in their entirety and without delay. If we are serious about the dispersal of the population, we must provide proper means of travel. We have to maintain a capital programme because without it we will lose our pace and our place at the top of the league in an expanded Europe. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. McDowell:</from>
          <p eId="para_408">I join other Members in welcoming the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, to the House. I am opposed to this Bill for many of the reasons Senator Ross appears to support it. That will hardly come as a surprise to anybody, certainly not to Senator Ross. I will take a couple of minutes to refute some of the points the Senator made as I suspect the Minister will not take the trouble to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">We should remind ourselves of the reasons the benchmarking body was established in the first instance. When we came to review the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness two and a half years ago, we discovered several problems within the public service. There were and still are huge numbers of badly paid public servants at the lower grades, while qualified professional civil servants working in planning and architecture and senior civil servants in Departments proper were being lost to the private sector where they could earn a great deal more. No responsible Government could have ignored those twin problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The difficulty with the benchmarking body is that we do not know the rationale behind the recommendations it ultimately made, which is a pity. This issue will not be resolved through a once-off payment. The problem will not disappear, which is why review of the relative position of qualified people in the public and private sectors must be ongoing if it is to be relevant. A once-off bribe to public servants over the next two years will not suffice. We must reward useful public service while dealing with the issue of low pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I point out to Senator Ross that the benchmarking body was established in December 2000 and it will be June 2005 before the last payments are made. To pick a figure of €1.5 billion out of the air is massively to overstate the cost which is being met over a long period of time. If the expenditure of €1.5 billion succeeds in buying industrial peace within the public service while addressing the issues which arise in terms of public sector pay, it will be money well spent. We are entitled to expect greater flexibility in terms of delivery of service within the public service and greater flexibility in terms of the change of command and the way in which things work in the public service. That is an important <i>quid pro quo</i> in terms of the implementation of the recommendations of the benchmarking body.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I refute the implication by Senator Ross that the Labour Party looked to buy votes in some way at the last general election. It is not my business to defend other parties and in a sense the last election is certainly seen as spilt milk by the Labour Party in that we did not succeed in persuading enough people to vote for us. I take exception to the constant repetition of this notion that we attempted to buy votes. The Labour Party proposals targeted where we would spend extra money and outlined from where we would obtain it. We proposed increases in taxation and charges and diversion of money from existing funds. I refute the notion that, to use Senator Ross's phrase, we would have bankrupted the country before Christmas. Nothing could be further from the truth. We made the hard choices because we identified, at an early stage, that it was necessary to make a link between increasing charges and taxation and spending extra money. It is what any responsible Opposition party would do.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">In terms of where we are at present, it is useful to make a distinction between the Exchequer balance position and the position of the economy in general because they are going in two distinctly different directions. I do not believe that we have a real crisis in the public finances. We have a projected current budget surplus for this year of something in the region of €3 billion or €4 billion. That is an extremely high surplus by historical standards and one that gives us options.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">There is an increasingly worrying position in terms of the general economy. In his Budget Statement in December, the Minister projected a rate of increase in GNP of just 2.25% for this year. If he got another opportunity, I believe he might revise that figure downwards. It would not surprise me if we were to come out with a figure of between 1% and 1.5% increase in GNP. It must be asked how we have gone from double digit growth to less than 1% growth in just two years. In reality, it has occurred in a shorter period than that. It is not sufficient to say that this is entirely due to the international economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">There are serious weaknesses within our economy of which we must be aware. We have become dependent on a number of sectors for economic growth, almost all of which are foreign-owned and, specifically, American-owned. These are the chemical, pharmaceutical and IT sectors. That dependence has served us well in the past five or six years, but it would be a matter of concern if the international downturn were to be exacerbated in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">We also have an increasing problem with competitiveness because of the relative strength of the euro now as compared with six months ago. There has been an appreciation of the euro currency against the US dollar of in the region of 20% to 25% and an appreciation against other currencies with which we trade of in the region of 10%. We must deal with the issue of domestically-generated inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The Minister decided not to increase direct taxes or capital taxes in the budget, but rather chose to make increases in indirect taxation. His colleagues have also decided to permit increases in charges that are the direct responsibility of the State. I refer here to the TV licence fee or gas and electricity charges. This has all quite deliberately added to inflation and thus avoided any increases in direct taxation or capital taxes. There are times when I might support that kind of approach, but, at a time when the competitiveness of the economy is under threat, I think it is a mistake. We may well live to regret it.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">My view is that we reduced capital taxes and income tax too quickly and by too much. I acknowledge that there is a particular difficulty in increasing income tax, although the Minister has achieved this by stealth in the Finance Bill. I believe he should have been looking at measures to broaden the tax base as part of the tax revenue projections for this year and this has not been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The Minister makes much of his bringing forward the date for the elimination of tax incentives. I agree with his approach to this issue. Tax incentives are an appropriate and useful way of ensuring development in areas where it would not otherwise happen. Inner city areas such as Gardiner Street have been developed thanks to the use of tax incentives. A careful eye must be kept on the dead weight effect of tax incentives. Tax incentives for the IFSC were a good idea when it was starting up, but in the last three or four years they would not have been regarded as a good idea and most of those incentives have now been reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">I do not believe that the Minister is serious about bringing forward the dates for the elimination of tax incentives. I do not believe that his view has fundamentally changed at all and he hinted as much in his contribution. The measures he announced in the budget will not change anything. He has simply said that a few schemes that were due to come to an end in 2005 will now end in 2004. It would not surprise me, and it would be typical of the Minister, if, in next year's budget or that in the following year, he prolongs some schemes and introduces others. I do not mind as long as we keep an eye on the criteria and we know what we want to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The elimination of the film relief scheme is unfortunate. I am well aware of the downside and I know that particular individuals have reduced their tax liability greatly by the use of the film relief scheme. We did not have a domestic film industry of any size before the relief was introduced. It was an effective means of attracting filmmakers to work in Ireland. It could be criticised because much of the labour was not domestic and the gains were not long-term, but for a short period Ireland was regarded as a good place to make films. The announcement that the relief will come to an end next year is not good. I hope the Minister will, in time, reverse that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">On the issue of public expenditure, we still have options. The radical cutbacks which were made this year are not necessary, even though I acknowledge that some cutbacks would be both good and justified. To take the hatchet to public expenditure in the manner in which the Minister has done is not a responsible way to proceed. It is not good to halt the growth in capital expenditure. We know now that the NDP will not be delivered on time. The five NDP motorway projects will not be delivered before 2009 or 2010. This will reduce the competitiveness of the economy and will impose additional costs on industry and the Exchequer. It is regrettable and unnecessary that capital expenditure is not being sustained.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The effective abandonment of the health strategy is deplorable and I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, will have a view on this. It seems there was some vigorous debate in Cabinet when the health strategy was being drawn up. We know that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, won out, with the exception of the caveat inserted by the Minister for Finance that everything in the strategy depended on whether it could be afforded. The Minister decides whether we can afford it. Since he always took the view that health expenditure was a waste of money, it was clear what would happen to the health strategy. It has now been unceremoniously binned, which I deplore.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">All of us know that money could be spent better. Management of spending within the health service is not what it should be and we all have ideas as to how it can be improved. Without doubt, to get the improvements in the health service that our citizens deserve will require spending a good deal of additional money. The Government went so far as to put a figure on it in the health strategy, which was €12,700 million over a ten year period. We always knew it would cost a lot of money, therefore we should not now shrink back in surprise and say we cannot afford that. Improvements in services and technology cost a lot of money and it is deplorable that the Government has rowed back, in effect binning the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">I have a reasonable idea at this stage when the Minister is serious about something, and I am sure he is not serious about carbon taxes. This question arose approximately three years ago as part of the climate change strategy. The Minister paid lip service to it at the time. He announced last year that he would introduce these taxes this year. The tax strategy group considered it at some length and produced page after page of objections from various Departments. The Minister announced on budget day that he intended to introduce carbon based taxes from the end of next year, which I do not believe.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I am aware there are issues in this regard. I have some sympathy with those who are sceptical about this tax but we must be serious about it. If we do not intend going down that road, we must consider other means by which we can meet our Kyoto Protocol requirements. If not, there will be a serious cost to the economy and the country in a few years' time.</p>

Their individual and aggregate effects will consolidate the spectacular gains in the economy in recent years. They further advance the creation of a low tax environment, which from the beginning has been consistent with his approach and vision. They target available resources at the lower income brackets and the elderly, which is very socially progressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The tax system is a hugely important instrument of public policy. It is one of the few areas of legislation that affects every citizen. Everyone is affected by decisions made in the budget and Finance Bill. The Minister's decisions on taxes always have a bearing on whether we have more or less disposable or discretionary income. In that regard, the Minister has announced consistently that he wants to give workers more choices and discretion as to how they use the money available to them. I am an avowed supporter of that principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Decisions on taxes also have a bearing on competition and, obviously, the corollary to that is jobs. They have a direct bearing on improvement in public services, which has been adverted to by Senator McDowell. If I get an opportunity I will return to that issue at a later stage. These decisions also have a bearing on the extent to which the tax instrument is to be used to target the needs of the poorest and most marginalised in the community. Together with these multi-effects of taxation policy, each sector of the economy is constantly demanding ever greater equity, fairness and transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The Bill is being introduced in the currency of a sharp short economic downturn in the global economy, with an immediate impact on this small open economy. In light of the spectacular successes we have enjoyed over the past five years in our improved living standards and phenomenal growth in the delivery of public services, irrespective of current concerns about progressing the rate of increase in the development of our infrastructure, the real challenge for the Minister and the Government is to steer the economy safely in a sound financial direction by way of consolidation. The overall approach manifested in the Bill, and preceded by the budget, is a responsible and balanced response to current economic conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Deputy McCreevy has set out to be a reforming Minister for Finance and one of the hallmarks of the reforms has been the consistent and progressive reduction in income tax. Over the years, the burden of taxation has impacted on our competitiveness. I am referring to the 1980s when inflation was in double figures and there had to be double figures in terms of social welfare and so on. The whole thing became a vicious circle. The Minister has taken the view that one should begin by progressing towards lower taxation, and many other positive things will follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">In the past the burden of taxation has impacted on our competitiveness, retarded our economic growth and reduced the incentive to work. The system was permitted by successive Administrations to continue to develop in a hotch potch fashion. Taxation was frequently invoked in a type of fire brigade manner to target contingencies as they arose. Some of these contingencies occurred on a yearly basis and others on a half yearly basis. There was no clear long-term strategy to use taxation as an instrument for direction of the economy. The system turned into an unwieldy quango, adding bits, taking off bits and adding more bits from year to year. It was riddled with anomalies, which no one will dispute. It was extremely complex and, inevitably, blatantly lacking in transparency. Among its many adverse effects, including ongoing disenchantment among the taxpaying public, particularly the PAYE sector, it inevitably contributed to high unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The Minister set out his stall from the beginning. He set about modernising, reforming and simplifying the tax system. The recent changes have seen the average tax paid by a single person on the average industrial wage, including PRSI and levies, fall from 28% in 1997 to 17% now. This lowering of the tax burden has contributed significantly to our strong employment growth. It has rewarded employers and employees alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The large number of people removed from the tax net is another feature of this progress. In 1997, 25% of taxpayers were exempt from paying tax, whereas today it is 36%. When the statutory minimum wage was introduced in April 2000, less than 64% of the then minimum wage was exempt from tax. Following the 2002 budget, 90% was exempted, despite the increase in the wage last October to €6.35 per hour. Section 3 consolidates the 90% exemption level by providing for increases in the employee tax credits. The entry point to the tax system for all employees is increased from €209 per week to €223 per week. I support the removal of all minimum wage earners from the tax net and I am sure that is one of the Minister's objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Even in the present economic circumstances, the income tax package has been targeted towards the elderly and those in the lower income tax bracket. I welcome the decision to increase the income tax exemption limits for those aged 65 years and over. This year, the increase in the limits is over 15%. When account is taken of the changes last year, the combined increase amounts to almost 40%. I am, therefore, astonished at the begrudging concession by a few Members in the other House at the extension of this benefit to our senior citizens. I do not know on what basis they make their criticisms, especially in view of the need for equity and fairness in the system. It is only fair that recognition should be given to the contribution made by senior citizens to the economic and social life of the country throughout their working lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Since the Minister was first appointed, it has been his stated objective to maintain a broad tax base, thereby creating a low tax environment. This policy has been successful in contributing to strong economic growth and development. It has made a huge difference to people in terms of their discretionary spending and in giving them greater freedom of choice, which has enabled them to have a far greater influence over their lives. It has also enhanced productivity, contributed to moderation in terms of wage claims and has played a key role in the ongoing development of social partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">I commend the Bill and the Minister. From the outset he set out his stall and defined his vision for the economy. He clearly articulated his idea that tax policy could be used to create a low tax environment, thereby giving greater freedom of choice while promoting productivity, competition and employment growth. The testimony to the success of his approach is in the figures to which I have referred.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh:</from>
          <p eId="para_444">We are no longer competitive as a country or an economy. That is reflected in the cost of living increases. Six months ago, a basic basket of goods for a couple in Dublin cost €120 to €130, whereas today it will cost €150 to €160. I am not familiar with the cost of living in Dublin because I am only in the city a few nights a week, but in County Donegal consumers are moving across the Border to buy their groceries in Derry and Strabane. It is a worrying trend when people in the eurozone travel to the sterling zone to do their shopping because groceries are more competitively priced.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The stealth and indirect taxes, referred to by Senator McDowell, are also a cause of concern. While there was a spin put on the reduction in direct taxes, indirect taxes have increased, whether it be increases in local authority rates, higher bin collection charges, extra duty on credit cards and higher gas bills resulting from the 1% increase in the lower rate of VAT. There have also been increased charges on petrol, VRT and motor tax. This is evidence that there is something wrong with the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I do not usually believe what car salesmen tell me, but this week I took note when a car salesman indicated that since the beginning of the year, what he referred to as the "ordinary five-eighths", the PAYE worker or ordinary man or woman on the street, are no longer buying cars. These are the people – I include myself in this category – who are paying mortgage and hire purchase charges on their cars. They are also paying high levels of indirect taxes. By contrast, there has been a big increase in the number of new cars being bought by the high earners. This is a worrying trend because it indicates that we are becoming a two-tier society. That is what is happening during under this Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">It is scandalous that the price of houses is not included in the CPI, which means it is not a true reflection of the inflation rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Eating out in Dublin has gone off the Richter scale. I know of a couple who, rather than staying in Dublin for St. Patrick's weekend, travelled to Brussels where they had a cheaper weekend. I know of another couple, constituents of the Minister of State, who spent a weekend in Paris where eating out was cheaper than in Dublin. This raises serious questions about our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">People working in Dublin travel north of the Border to avail of dental services, which are cheaper. It raises questions about how they can access their PRSI dental benefits. Furniture and clothing are also more expensive in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Ireland is suffering from a reverse brain drain. In the past we suffered from a brain drain because of the lack of jobs, yet while today jobs are available, there is a brain drain because of the poor quality of life, especially in Dublin. People are unhappy with the quality of public services, including the public transport system. As a result, we are losing people who are trained and qualified in specialist areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The first-time buyer's grant was also abolished in the budget. The Minister could have allocated 1,050 of those grants with the money that was spent on the Spire. Many people from Donegal have been telling me what can be done with the Spire, but I will not place their comments on the record of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">There is hard evidence that talented people are leaving the country because we are not competitive. Tax receipts will be lower and aggregate demand is lower. People are buying beer and staying in on a Saturday night; they are not spending their money in restaurants. I do not blame restaurateurs or people in the service industry for this. The prices they charge have increased because indirect stealth taxes have driven up the cost of their raw material. Costs are spiralling and in the long-term these people will have to abandon their businesses because of increased costs, higher insurance and higher employment costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I accept and appreciate that pensioners did well in the budget and that their needs are being catered for. This contradicts what Senator Ross said, namely, that Members on this side indicate their opposition to things simply for the sake of doing so. However, I have discovered that elderly people are handing over substantial amounts of their pensions to their grandchildren in college for pocket money. That is not happening across the board. I do not have empirical evidence, but I have been speaking to pensioners who have been doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Senator Ross is an intelligent and articulate businessman, but it is time he changed the record. I take exception to him standing up on every occasion and saying that Opposition parties oppose just for the sake of doing so. That is wrong. As a new Fine Gael Member of the Oireachtas, I believe we are putting together credible Opposition points. In regard to every point I have made, all I had to do was to listen to the people on the street for their views. People are angry. People who do not even have an interest in politics are saying that they are being told lies because there is less money in their pockets today than there was six months ago. They are now saying that there is something wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I pay my taxes, but it still takes me six hours to get from Donegal to Dublin. I still get stuck in Ardee on a Friday evening for about half an hour on my way to Donegal, but I hear talk about CPOs and building motorways to Limerick, Galway and Cork.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">I wish to point out a number of things to Senator Ross who said that we have nothing to offer. We have been pushing for value for money in regard to public expenditure. The man and woman in the street knows that public money is squandered and wasted. The Senator knows there is waste and I challenge him to contradict me on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">In regard to what we have to offer, we need a quality product if we are to promote Ireland as a tourism destination. We will have to advertise Ireland and give incentives to people setting up tourism businesses. We will have to give tax reductions and offer people incentives to remain in business. People are going out of business. People in the tourism sector in Donegal this year are saying, "To hell with it, costs and insurance are too high." That is a problem. In order to remain competitive we need quality business in the tourism sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">I remind Senator Ross, who seems to have put himself forward as a Government spokesperson, that we have also pushed for radical reform in the education curriculum. To have a complete, radical overhaul, we must invest in research and development and examine the entire curriculum. In Romania and Hungary, children of 12 and 13 years of age are being sent to college to do degrees in car mechanics. What are we doing about encouraging young people to get degrees in car mechanics? We are pushing young people into academia and are not emphasising the practical side of things. What we have are young people who are thrown out of school early at 15 or 16 and enrolled in FÁS courses on car mechanics. That is an insult to the car mechanic sector in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">In regard to benchmarking for nurses and teachers, I am proud to push for the increases these neglected groups deserve and take exception to some of the remarks made earlier. My stand today represents the views I have heard on the streets in regard to this Government's actions. What happened under the rainbow coalition is history and what happened under the last Government has also been consigned to the past. We must live in the present and get out of the hole in which we find ourselves. We have to move forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">The Minister for Finance might call that being numerically challenged.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">A number of issues have not been mentioned by previous speakers in regard to the budget and the Finance Bill. The Minister of State would be familiar with the reduction in the budget allocation for Teagasc, which has led to the closure of a number of facilities. I am sure that he is well aware of the difficulties that have arisen in his constituency in regard to the €15 million cut in the Teagasc budget. The agricultural industry is in a state of despair at present. I have never encountered a lower level of morale among farmers or a more gloomy outlook.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">A Teagasc centre in my area of south Kilkenny is due to close and move to Kildalton College. It employs six advisers and deals with more than 1,000 farm families. It does not appear to be a huge saving for Teagasc because staff will not lose their jobs as all advisers and ancillary workers will be moved to Piltown. A new building must be refitted to accommodate them, yet the facility ten miles away in Mullinavat is being closed. This does not make sense. However, many decisions do not make sense such as the one to keep open a facility in the constituency of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Joe Walsh, which is considerably smaller.</p>

The Government is once again reneging on a promise, which is causing considerable concern for those affected. It has also had an impact on the social partnership talks which the agricultural body did not attend. Rollover relief also has a wider effect on the economy. It is a retrograde step.</p>

This is related to the huge increase in insurance premiums, which is a disgrace. Hospital charges have increased by 26%, the drug refund threshold by 31% and the television licence fee by 40%.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon):</from>
          <p eId="para_488">I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate on Second Stage of the Finance Bill 2003. Senators Higgins, Kenneally and others raised the issue of inflation and spoke about the importance of maintaining and improving our competitiveness. As a small open economy, Ireland's ability to trade, to a large extent, determines our living standards. Therefore, it is vital, as Senators said, that Ireland remains competitive primarily in relation to our trading partners but also in a global context. Inflation in Ireland, as measured by the CPI last year, was 4.6%. Bringing it down as quickly as possible towards levels comparable with our trading partners' performance must be a top priority if our competitiveness is to be maintained and jobs secured. If relatively high wage and price inflation were to be sustained, it would present a serious threat to the competitiveness of the economy. This is particularly the case in the context of the euro's recent appreciation against both the dollar and sterling.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">A number of factors, both external and domestic, are impacting on our current inflation trends. However, it is the domestic components of inflation on which we must focus our attention. In this context, the adoption of the pay arrangements set out under the new national partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, is important. Following discussions with both employer and trade union representatives, the agreement makes provision for moderate pay increases for the next 18 months. Moreover, the anti-inflation package contained in the agreement will see representatives of employer and union organisations working with the Government to target domestic sources of inflationary pressure. Issues such as excessive pricing, competition, particularly in more sheltered areas of the economy, and public awareness will be examined in this context. I am confident that, working together in partnership, we will address the issue of domestic price pressures in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">As regards benchmarking, raised by Senators Quinn, Ross and McDowell, we had maintained going into the partnership talks that this cost was significant and had to be spread over a number of budgetary periods. That is what has happened as the deal will be spread over 2003 and the next three budgetary periods. While the benchmarking deal is a significant cost, it is important to remember that this exercise was an independent evaluation of pay in the public service in comparison with that in the private sector. The process has the advantage over the previous experience of determining public service pay since it allows for a single overall evaluation and did not depend on historical relativities to determine the outcome. In the new pay agreement this departure from the old relativities based culture is confirmed by both sides. That is an important step forward in the way we determine public service pay. In addition, the new agreement contains measures to promote modernisation and change in the public service. This will improve the delivery of public services and reduce the incidence of industrial action. This should have a beneficial effect on all consumers of public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I do not share Deputy Kenneally's view about the desirability of reducing indirect tax rates to contribute to tackling inflation. Excise duties being flat rates have fallen behind inflation considerably in recent years and this fallen value could be regarded as helping to moderate inflation in earlier years. As regards cigarettes, the CSO publishes a figure without them but the issue is getting agreement that pay increases are calculated using this. As regards VAT, while our standard rate may be higher than that in some other EU countries, we have a zero rate on foodstuffs, etc. Our average rate across all products does not differ significantly from that in many of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">Regarding the question of charges raised by Senators Higgins and McHugh, the State continues to provide a wide range of services free or at low cost. While new charges have been increased in some areas, these provide additional resources for improved services. Charges also play a role in the efficient delivery of services to those most in need as, in general, they do not pay the charges. For example, medical card holders do not pay health charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Deputy Higgins referred to the high cost of insurance. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has responsibility for the insurance industry, announced on 25 October 2002 a programme for fundamental insurance reform. The programme reflects the commitments given in An Agreed Programme for Government and comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the insurance market and to reduce costs all round.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Senator Mansergh referred to the favourable position for low paid workers. The most recent data available from the OECD relating to the year 2000 indicates that for a single person on the average production wage Ireland has the lowest tax wedge in the EU, the EU average tax wedge being 42.4% while the figure for Ireland is 29%. Provisional data from the EU relating to the year 2000 shows that the EU average tax wedge for 2000 for a single low paid person on 50% of the APW is 35%, while Ireland's tax wedge on that income is 14.8%. For a married couple with 50% of the APW, the tax wedge in Ireland is 3.8%, while the EU 15 average is 32.3%.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Senator Kenneally referred to the new regime in the Bill providing a general right to repayment of tax. The new scheme reduced the interest rate from 0.0161% to 0.011% per day. It also replaces the existing provisions which apply interest on payments of preliminary tax. In future, the interest will only apply from six months after the date on which the claim was made. Accordingly, the question of taxpayers banking with Revenue by overpaying their tax should not arise. The rates paid and charged by Revenue must reflect the difference between deposit and borrowing rates available commercially if the rate charged on underpaid taxes is to encourage timely payment. The new provisions represent a fair and transparent scheme applying across all taxes and to all taxpayers.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I thank Senator Quinn for his favourable endorsement of the changes made by the Minister for Finance in reducing the rates of capital taxation. As is widely known, the reduction from 40% to 20% in the capital gains tax rate led to a big increase in the yield from this tax. For this reason and because of the economic benefits low direct tax rates bring, I cannot agree with Senator McDowell's suggestion that the Minister should have increased tax rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Senator Higgins suggested the Government should allow an exit from SSIAs. The Government tops up the savings deposited by people by 25%. If an account is closed before the five year period for any reason other than the death of the account holder, the terms of the scheme are breached, and a 23% tax applies on the withdrawal, which effects a clawback of the money credited to the account by the Exchequer bonus. If such an exit tax did not apply, it would not be necessary to save in the account for any significant period in order to receive the 25% bonus, merely to deposit money into the account and withdraw shortly afterwards. This would go against the purpose of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Unfortunately, time does not permit me to comment on all the many interesting contributions made by Senators. However, they can rest assured that their comments have been noted and, of course, the points raised can be pursued further on Committee Stage.</p>

        <summary title="motionProposal" eId="sum_54">Question proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</from>
          <p eId="para_506">Tá luachair orm bheith ar ais arís sa Seanad le Bille eile a chur os a chomhair. I am pleased to bring the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 before Seanad Éireann. This is the second of two Bills to implement the €530 million social welfare package of budget 2003 which, for the first time, brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2003 to over €10 billion. Senators will recall that a separate Bill was enacted in December last to give effect to the increases in weekly social welfare payments from the beginning of January. This Bill implements a number of key improvements in social welfare schemes such as increases in child benefit, improvements in the carer's respite care grant and the extension of the payment of increases in respect of qualified children as announced in the budget, in addition to a range of other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I am proud that the Government continues its commitment to building an inclusive society as reiterated in the programme for Government in June 2002. Tangible evidence of delivering on this commitment includes: a massive increase in spending on social welfare from the equivalent of €5.7 billion in 1997 to over €10 billion this year; significant increases in child benefit rates resulting in the rates of payment being more than three times that payable in 1997; and real increases in social welfare pensions with old age contributory pensioners now receiving €157.30 per week compared to the equivalent of €99 in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I wish to outline the provisions contained in the Bill. As Senators will already have considered it in detail, I will focus on a number of key provisions. Child benefit is a universal payment made directly to families and as such is the most efficient and effective way in which the Government can channel support to children. The rate for the first two children is being increased by €8 per month and for third and subsequent children by €10 per month. These increases, provided under section 3, will bring the monthly rates to €125.60 and €157.30 respectively. From April next, a family with three children will receive €408.50 compared to €382.50 at present – an increase of €26 per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">These increases will mean that, since the year 2000, child benefit rates will have risen by €71.64 per month for each of the first two children and by €86.20 per month for third and subsequent children. These measures will mark the beginning of the final phase of the child benefit investment package initiated in budget 2001 which, on completion, will see Government investment in the scheme rise by an additional €1.27 billion annually. An estimated 530,000 families with over one million children will benefit from these increases in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Furthermore, in supporting the ongoing programme of modernisation in the General Registry Office and to improve service delivery to customers, section 11 allows for certain awards of child benefit to be made in defined circumstances without recourse to a deciding officer. This provision will facilitate the automation of payments of child benefit for second and subsequent children where a claim is already in payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The Government, over successive budgets, has introduced measures to develop the types of services and supports which provide practical assistance for carers. In section 4 we continue to honour our commitment to supporting the valuable work undertaken by carers by increasing the respite care grant by €100, from €635 to €735, with carers looking after more than one person receiving a grant of €1,470 – an increase of €200. These increases take effect from June next. This measure, which is highly valued by carers, will benefit 24,700 carers and cost an additional €2.5 million per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I am also introducing changes in the arrangements for entitlement to increases in respect of qualified children. Section 5 provides that, from September next, entitlement to an increase for a qualified child between the ages of 18 and 22 years and in full-time education is extended to recipients of certain short-term benefits. Specifically, these are disability benefit, injury benefit, health and safety benefit, unemployment benefit and assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, where the claimant has been in receipt of the relevant payment for more than 26 weeks. This measure, contained in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, implements the commitment to increasing the qualifying child age limit to 22 years in line with the current arrangements for long-term payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Section 6 of the Bill, provides for the extension of the island allowance, currently €12.70 weekly, to pensioners over 66 years of age and in receipt of invalidity pension, disability allowance and unemployability supplement from April next.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The six weeks after-death payment arrangements are designed to provide transitional financial support immediately following the death of a pensioner. There are a number of anomalies within the scheme which section 7 aims to address. From June, where a person in receipt of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension, unemployment assistance, unemployability supplement, supplementary welfare allowance, pre-retirement allowance, disability allowance or farm assist dies and his or her spouse is in receipt of certain benefits in his or her own right, the payment of the deceased person's benefit shall continue to be made for a period of six weeks after death. Section 8 provides for a number of changes in the means test for social assistance schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I am particularly pleased to be in a position to tackle one of the remaining outstanding recommendations of the report by the Commission on Social Welfare. I refer to the inclusion of "benefit and privilege" in the assessment of means for unemployment assistance and pre-retirement allowance for claimants residing in the parental home. The commission recommended its abolition for persons aged over 25 years and I have taken an initial step towards achieving this by providing for the removal of this assessment for persons aged 29 years and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The section further provides for standardising the assessment of maintenance payments on the lines currently in place for one parent family payment to other social assistance payments such as disability allowance, old age and widow's and widower's non-contributory pensions, unemployment assistance and farm assist. This section also provides for the assessment of certain non-cash benefits, to be prescribed by regulations, in the case of persons claiming unemployment assistance, disability allowance, pre-retirement allowance, supplementary welfare allowance and farm assist.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">At present, orphan's payments in respect of children in foster care are made by my Department directly to the relevant health board which then combines the payment with the foster care allowance to make a total payment to the foster carer of €281.50 in respect of a child under 12 years and €308.50 in respect of a child aged 12 or over. A working group, which included officials from my Department and the Department of Health and Children, was established to examine payments to orphans and the foster care allowance. In line with the group's recommendations, section 9, in effect, ensures that while foster carers will continue to receive the same level of payment, this payment will be made by one agency only – the relevant health board. Health boards will now have full financial responsibility for supporting children in foster care and orphan's contributory allowance and orphan's non-contributory pension shall no longer be payable to children in respect of whom foster care allowance is being paid. However, orphan's payments will continue to be made by my Department where entitlement to such payments is established and where a foster care allowance is not in payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">In An Action Programme for Government we promised to modernise public services to make them more relevant to the citizen. We committed to improving access to public services by providing them electronically. Progressing the use of the personal public service, or PPS, number as a public service identifier is a key element of our e-government strategy. Section 10 provides for five new agencies to be added to the list of specified bodies authorised by legislation to use the PPS number. The section further allows for including in this listing bodies established by the Minister for Education and Science under section 54 of the Education Act 1998, and provides for the sharing of information with an t-Údaras um Ard-Oideachas, the Higher Education Authority. This measure will lead to improved administrative efficiency and effectiveness across public service agencies and help to reduce bureaucracy and continue the process of eliminating red tape.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Sections 13 to 15 provide for amending the rules governing entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance basic payments and rent supplements. Section 13 provides that, where new claims for rent supplement are submitted after the proposal comes into force, a supplement will only be payable where the claimant is lawfully in the State. This measure is being introduced for consistency. It removes the anomaly whereby a person could be in breach of their obligations to the State's immigration service while at the same time having their housing costs subsidised by the community welfare service. Following the enactment of this section, rent supplement will only be payable on receipt of a new claim from an asylum seeker if he or she is granted refugee status or leave to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This measure is being implemented following discussions with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The Government is committed to ensuring that the needs of asylum seekers are addressed in an appropriate manner. It has decided, therefore, that the accommodation needs of such people will be met exclusively through the system of direct provision operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The system has been in place for three years and the Department's reception and integration agency has built up considerable experience and expertise in that time. The backlog of claims for asylum that had built up has been reduced to much more manageable levels and a person claiming asylum in this country can expect to have his or her case dealt with within a few months. Given that the Department has a full range of suitable accommodation available to it to meet the needs of asylum seekers, as well as the fact that individuals are spending much less time in the asylum process before their claims are finalised, it is no longer necessary for asylum seekers to have access to rent supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Section 14 amends the conditions for receipt of supplementary welfare allowance in certain cases to align them with the entitlement conditions that apply to unemployment assistance. Under current legislation, a health board may require an applicant for supplementary welfare allowance to register for employment by signing on for unemployment assistance. The purpose of this provision is to require a person in such circumstances to seek work while receiving the allowance, pending finalisation of the claim for unemployment assistance. The proposal gives health boards the power to require a person to comply with the conditions – being capable of work, available for employment and genuinely seeking employment – that apply to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">These discretionary conditions will be applied on a selective basis if a health board considers that the circumstances of a particular case warrant such application. Those who will be affected by this provision are people for whom unemployment assistance or benefit is the appropriate social welfare payment, but who may have intended to claim supplementary welfare allowance indefinitely as an alternative to complying with the terms for receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">Legislation provides that three categories of people are excluded from entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, namely, those in full-time employment or full-time education and people engaged in industrial disputes. Health boards have always had the discretion to pay the allowance in urgent cases, even if the applicant is in one of the excluded categories. It is rare that payments are made in such circumstances, but it is important that health boards can deal appropriately with such eventualities.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Section 15 now provides health boards with the discretion to make payments in urgent cases in relation to claims for rent supplement from asylum seekers and those who are not lawfully in the State. This will ensure consistency with existing provisions in respect of other excluded categories, so that a health board will not be prevented from paying rent supplement as a result of the restrictions imposed by section 13 in circumstances which, in the opinion of the health board, are so urgent in nature that rent supplement should be paid. I emphasise that this section does not provide for exceptions that could result in payments being made in any individual case on an ongoing basis. It merely provides discretion to respond in an urgent case that will not remain urgent over time. I expect that very few, if any, payments will be made under this provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The operation of the social insurance fund is an important expression of solidarity in society. The fund represents the collective contributions of employers, employees and the self-employed to provide for pensions and short-term income support needs, when contingencies such as unemployment and illness arise. The most recent budget proposed that PRSI should be applied to benefits-in-kind granted to employees, with effect from 1 January 2004. This provision is important in enhancing overall equity, as well as improving the coherence between the PAYE and the PRSI systems. Sections 16 to 18 are designed to facilitate the assessment of such non-cash remuneration in relation to PRSI.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Section 19 is designed to ensure that agency workers who are neither employees working under a contract of service nor self-employed under a contract for the provision of services are properly insurable. Agency employment has been recognised and addressed in other employment legislation to ensure that agency workers may avail of legislative protection. This section contains two amendments designed to clarify the position of agency workers under the social welfare code. The first amendment states that individuals employed through an employment agency are insurably employed and the second amendment indicates that the person who is liable to pay the wages or salary of the individual in respect of the work or service performed will be deemed to be the employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">While most individuals are paid by agencies, the client company makes the payment in a small number of instances and the second amendment will cater for both eventualities. The amendments will resolve any ambiguity that may exist in relation to the insurability of agency workers. Given that many such workers tend to work in the more exposed sectors of the economy, the provisions will ensure that they are afforded the protection of the social insurance system. Questions of insurability of employment which arise will be examined and decided on by the insurability of employment unit in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Section 24 provides for changes to the Pensions Act 1990 that are designed to make some technical amendments consequential on the implementation of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002. One such amendment is designed to ensure that a person whose life assurance policy is designed to provide for a pension will be advised of the financial consequences of cancelling or reducing it in favour of taking out a PRSA. This is standard practice when an insurance policy replaces in part or in whole another insurance policy and is designed to avoid any potential for misselling. The broad powers vested in the Pensions Board under the existing legislation will be replaced with more specific powers. These will establish clear policies and principles which the board will use to respond to the current pension funding challenges facing defined benefit occupational pension schemes in the current investment climate of declining asset values and will give flexibility to pension scheme trustees in relation to submission dates for actuarial funding certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Following discussions involving the Pensions Board and the social partners, as well as consideration in my Department, it has been decided that the decline in the equities market warrants a flexible approach in relation to the funding requirements of the Pensions Act. The Pensions Board wants to avoid a situation where regulatory requirements would cause pensions schemes that are viable on a long-term basis to close or change from their existing defined benefit basis. The precise details of this approach are a matter for the Pensions Board, which is the statutory regulator. I understand that the funding requirement, on a case-by-case basis and in certain circumstances, will be set at 85% – compared to 100% at present – and that the funding proposal can refer to a period of up to ten years, rather than the current three and a half years. The board must consider that these modifications are necessary, are related to the performance of investment markets and are not contrary to members' interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The adoption of such an approach is intended to give trustees of pension schemes and sponsoring employers financial breathing space in relation to the funding of defined benefit occupational pension schemes. The long-term position in relation to funding is being examined by the Pensions Board and I look forward to receiving its report shortly. The trustees of the scheme may be unable to meet the statutory deadline for actuarial funding certificates if the actuary to the scheme is ill, has been replaced or if other administrative difficulties have arisen outside the control of the trustees. In such circumstances and where it would not be contrary to members' interests, it is considered reasonable to allow some flexibility if the Pensions Board is satisfied of the bona fides of the situation and section 24 allows for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 builds on the progress made in the social inclusion area by the Government. It is based on objectives contained in the programme for Government and the PPF and reflects the principles of the revised national anti-poverty strategy. I hope Senators have benefited from this outline of the Bill's key provisions and, in commending it to the Seanad, I look forward to a very constructive debate.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_534">I apologise on behalf of our spokesperson, Senator Cummins, who regrets greatly that he is unable to take this important Bill because he has been in hospital in recent weeks. He has asked me to stand in for him tonight and tomorrow. I welcome the Minister and her officials, whom I know very well given that I was social welfare spokesperson for my party for two years in the Dáil. I admire the officials greatly for their knowledge of what is one of the most complicated areas of public policy and for the advice they have given Governments, Members and committees of the Houses over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Many Governments have, over the past ten or 15 years, seen a radical reduction in consistent poverty. Ireland's figures compare favourably with those of other countries given the considerable reduction in the number of people in consistent poverty. Such people may not have a house, warm clothes or enough money to provide the bare essentials.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The main problem we face, which has been exacerbated in recent budgets, is the rise in relative income poverty in spite of the fact that we have had a very successful policy on reducing consistent poverty. The gap has grown substantially in relative terms in the past seven years in particular. Part of the problem concerns the social welfare system, for which the Minister is responsible, but a more significant part concerns taxation policy. There are only two ways in which the State can have an impact on people's income, either through direct taxation or social welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">We have seen many people doing exceptionally well in recent years – more luck to them – but although the very poor have had increases in the finances entering their household, budget after budget, there has not been a dramatic change. Some do not have the skills necessary to re-enter the workforce to avail of some of the income opportunities that exist. That is a constant problem at the heart of framing social welfare policy, just as it is in respect of taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Yesterday <i>The Irish Times</i> produced figures on spending on social protection in the European Union. The amount of money was calculated as a percentage of GDP and I was astonished to see that we are at the bottom of the scale. We spend 17.7% of our GDP on social protection – half of what is spent in France or Germany.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes:</from>
          <p eId="para_540">There are demographic arguments. It is true that we have a considerable number of people in the under-25 category but it is interesting that countries such as Britain, which has quite similar demographics to ours, has much better figures. Historically, Britain has benefited from the national health service and other forms of social expenditure that we have not implemented. We are still rock bottom when it comes to social spending, whether it is on social welfare, housing, education or a myriad of other areas. While we all accept that exceptionally large sums of money have been available in recent years, we are coming from a low base. That needs to be recognised when trying to frame our social welfare policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I have great sympathy for the Minister in her new role. As somebody who did his best to understand the complexity of social welfare policy for two years, I realise that her Department is huge and largely administrative in nature. The Minister finds herself administering schemes that have been established willy-nilly by many Ministers for social welfare since the consolidation Acts were first passed around the 1960s. She faces a problem in that a change to one scheme will clearly have an adverse effect on another. This is not how we would devise social welfare policy if we were to start afresh. If we were to do so, we would have a totally new approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Minister is in the first year of her term as Minister with responsibility for social welfare. A significant part of this responsibility involves making sound arguments to the Department of Finance every year to get money that will allow for changes to be made. Her job should also involve the radical reform of social welfare policy. I am not speaking from an ideological perspective, from the left or the right, but there needs to be a systematic root and branch reform of the way in which we administer social welfare policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">A long-term policy of many parties has been to harmonise social welfare policy and the taxation system. That is now possible for the first time because of the introduction of taxation credits. It could be argued that every citizen, regardless of his age, employment status or marital status, should be able to know the basic financial input to which he is entitled on this basis. The introduction of taxation credits affords the Minister an opportunity to introduce substantial reform of social welfare policy over the remainder of her term in office. She should spend time doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We have developed a considerable number of social welfare schemes and I am sure the Minister's officials will tell me how many there are at the end of the debate. It is a nightmare for the average person to understand the system. I know that Deputies and Senators spend much time trying to explain to people their basic entitlements. We would do a better job if we brought the concept of the taxation credit, the cornerstone of our taxation policy, to bear on social welfare policy. This would be a good day's work in terms of trying to bring about real reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">The real object of this Bill and that presented to the House in December is to implement the changes announced in the last budget. Most of the increases this year are puny in the extreme. This is because the management of the economy in the past year, particularly the large splurge of spending that took place before the election, has left us all trying to catch up with the financial irregularities that currently pertain. That is why the poorest of the poor will have to put up with very insignificant increases in respect of many schemes this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Consider the basic increases of between €6 and €11 that the Department of Social and Family Affairs is proposing and which were provided for in the Bill in December and in this Bill. When this basic increase is compared to the hyper inflation experienced in the marketplace, people are going to lose out. There have been increases of up to 10% in ESB charges. On 1 April, gas charges are set to increase by 9.5 to 10%. The increase of the lower VAT rate will impose additional burdens. All these, coupled with increases in motor taxation, television licence fees, council rents and the wide range of increases in the price of commodities will see the benefits provided by the Bill reduced in net terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I have always argued – the Minister can verify by reading my contributions to the Committee Stages of previous Social Welfare Bills – that inflation has a detrimental effect on low income earners. In economics class, the lecturer will always start by saying that inflation has the biggest impact on low income earners. They do not have the resources to tackle inflation, unlike those in a better financial position. After these changes have been implemented, they should be looked at again to see if benefits should be increased, in particular for low income earners.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Some years ago, there was a sharp increase in inflation over six months. The former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Dermot Ahern, wanted such a re-examination, but the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, opposed it. That information was acquired through a FOI request – God bless the Act – in the days when we used to find out what was happening around the Cabinet table. The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was a lone voice in arguing that those who suffered that difficult six-month period should see another increase in benefits. This year, I predict we will see the same argument come August and September, if the current problems of growing inflation continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The social welfare increases proposed in the Social Welfare Bill and the December Bill fall short of the targets in the national anti-poverty strategy. There has been cross-party support for this strategy since 1997. I congratulated the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Dermot Ahern, when he reviewed the programme before the last election. There are significant targets set out within the programme. However, on the basis of the figures presented to the House by the Minister, those targets will not be met within the two-year timeframe set out by the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">We welcome the increase over the years in child benefit, which was long overdue. It is the most important payment to the family unit. For many women it provides a financial boost to single-income homes. Child poverty is a significant problem here because, as pointed out by Senator Mansergh, in contrast to other EU states, Ireland has more children per head of population.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Fine Gael supports the progress made in increasing child benefits. However, the Minister knows that the Government's pre-election promise on child benefit has been broken. This is a let-down for many families who expected to receive the full amount. The increases proposed –€8 and €10 per month – are only a quarter of the full amount promised. In a deliberate political exercise large benefits were promised to people ten days prior to the last election. From a public policy perspective, it will be considered a bad day's work. People expected the money as soon as possible but that has not been the case. The spurious argument made to me was that it would happen at the first opportunity when the payment mechanism was resolved. That was just not true. There is a deliberate Government—</p>

          <p eId="para_561">Since we have moved to a higher pay-out for child benefit, we should consider paying it on a weekly basis rather than a monthly basis. More people could obtain child benefit through the electronic mechanism which can credit payments to a bank account. This could be done on a weekly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I have much to say about many matters, in particular the carer's allowance. I welcome the Minister's decision to give responsibility to the health boards for the payment of the orphan and foster child allowance. Many grandparents have become foster parents of their own grandchildren, particularly in cases where the parents are drug addicts. The majority of people in this situation cannot obtain the payment – some can, though, in exceptional circumstances. It is a new phenomena, particularly in working class areas, where the grandmother, in her late 50s or 60s, is having to rear children all over again. Can this be fully extended to these cases? I will also make some comments on the social welfare allowance.</p>

          <from>Ms Cox:</from>
          <p eId="para_573">I very much welcome the focus on child benefit, as a payment that is not taxed or means tested. The message should continue to go very clearly from the Department of Social and Family Affairs and from the Houses of the Oireachtas to the Department of Finance that this payment is not to be means tested or taxed. This is a payment that goes to the heart of the family. It is one of the most fundamental payments to prevent child poverty and to provide many people in difficult situations with the money they need to meet some of their household bills. Child benefit must continue to increase to take into consideration the type of expenses it is intended to cover. It is a support for the family and for the lone parent. It is a universal payment and must stay as it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Minister knows my feelings on this payment. I am disappointed that we did not increase it to the level that we expected. I understand and accept, however, that not everything was possible in a year when there were difficult choices to be made, but the mark must be set as we face into the next two years that we have to protect this payment. In the context of a payment to a three child family the benefit is now at €408.50 every month, and for a family of four children the payment is €565.80 beginning this year. That is a very fair payment but I want to see it increased because it is making a difference to families. I will continue to defend it for as long as I am in a position to do so and hopefully get it increased each year to achieve what we promised to do and what I believe is a fair and rightful payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">From the outset, however, I had a fundamental disagreement with one aspect of child benefit because it should not be used to pay for child care for people who are out at work. We continue to have a problem with the cost of child care. There are not enough places available. In certain circumstances if a woman is pregnant and looks for a crèche place she has no hope of getting a place for a child under one year of age in most commercial crèches. The reason is the ratio of staff to children and the cost of looking after the child according to the child care regulations. While I accept that the regulations are necessary, I believe we have serious problems in relation to how a woman cares for her baby. It is good to have parental leave and extended maternity benefits but if a woman needs to go back to the workplace, maybe because she is the breadwinner in the family, we have a responsibility to provide the type of child care that she needs or to create a system of better crèche facilities for young babies. That is the huge challenge facing us and it is becoming more apparent as the population increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">Although the issue of maternity leave is not specifically related to this Social Welfare Bill, we have a difficulty in relation to the implementation of the maternity leave requirements. The Minister knows quite well that Ireland must have the highest rate of premature babies in the world. This is because when women put down dates to claim maternity benefit they give dates two or three weeks after the due date of the baby. The legislation that comes under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform forces healthy women to take four weeks maternity leave prior to the birth of the baby and many women do not feel the need to do that. If they are healthy enough to do their work why should they be forced to take four weeks leave before the baby is born? Everybody colludes in this fixing of dates – employers, doctors, and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. We have to stop people telling lies.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">This message needs to go to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The last time I raised the issue, when Deputy Michael McDowell was Attorney General, he said it was a problem for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Now he is in the Department of Justice and I want the Minister to take the message back to him that this is his problem and we are going to solve it in the lifetime of this Government if I have anything to do with it. It should be a matter of choice if I am able to work those two or four weeks before my baby is due—</p>

          <p eId="para_584">That is a problem. Relying on the pairing system while one is sitting in the labour ward and missing a vote which might cause the downfall of the Government is not something that Members of this Parliament should have to support.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">No doubt the people on the other side of the House will say we do not have a commitment to carers and we should have a carer's allowance for everyone, but that is not possible now. Despite the difficult circumstances this year we have increased the respite grant, bringing it up to €735 a year for one person, and to €1,470 for two people. That is to be welcomed. This is a payment to people who look after the disabled, or elderly relatives, and it makes a huge difference in a household when that cheque comes in, whether from the Department of Social and Family Affairs or from the health board. I want to see that continue to show the carers that the Government values their work and recognises that it cannot be done 24 hours a day, seven days a week without some respite to enable carers to do their job properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I also welcome the increased disregards in relation to eligibility. Continuing to increase the disregards in order for people to benefit from the carer's allowance is the way to go. There is, however, an anomaly in the system whereby the carer cannot receive two social welfare payments. If a widower or widow is receiving a State pension or a pay related pension and then becomes a carer, that person cannot receive the carer's allowance. This is discrimination because they would have a disregard if their spouse were alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Senator Brian Hayes was right in that there are opportunities to look at reform of the social welfare system. It is time to look outside the box and to make the changes, some of which may be difficult. If they involve inclusion and supporting the disadvantaged it is time to make sure that we address the anomalies in the system. We must put the money into the pockets of those who need it most.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I welcome the increase in carer's allowance of €10 for those over 66 and of €7 for those under 66. Carer's benefit was one of the most creative legislative provisions ever made. It allows people to take carer's leave from their employment in order to look after a relative who is ill or in need of full-time care in the home. However, the system is relatively difficult to access for people in these circumstances who find themselves under stress in the home and at work. They must apply for carer's leave, have forms signed by doctors and employers and apply for carer's benefit. The two different systems involved need to be streamlined and there is no reason that one application cannot be made to serve for everything. Computerisation should have facilitated the implementation of a more efficient system.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Given that everybody has a personal public service number, there is no reason that the process should be so difficult. A friend of mine who made the decision to become a carer in order to spend time with her father, who died of a brain haemorrhage, during the last ten weeks of his life did not apply for carer's benefit. The process was complex enough to make her decide that it was not worth her while to apply. When she returned to work, having coped with the bereavement, she decided not to revisit the issue by applying retrospectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The provisions of section 19 relate to agency workers. I must declare an interest in this regard because I work as a recruitment agent in Galway. In common with the majority of agencies, we have paid a stamp, for which we invoice the employer, for each person who has worked for our business during the past 30 years. Section 19 seeks to provide that the person who is liable to pay the wages or salary of the individual in respect of the work or service performed will be deemed to be the employer. As most individuals are paid by the agencies, I take it that the latter are deemed to be the employers. If I place a temporary worker whom I pay €400 per week in a position, I will invoice the client for that sum plus PRSI at 8% or 10%. As the economy worsens, the client's business may be liquidated and I will be left with a bad debt of between €5,000 and €6,000 – including my fees plus VAT of 21%. I must pay PRSI, PAYE – which I have deducted from the employee's wages – holiday entitlement and VAT, but I have no protection under company law as a preferred creditor in the area of wages. I am not referring to my margins, which are my business, but I am entitled to some protection in relation to the payment of the various taxes. I should not be exploited. My agency should not be exposed to losses which might put it out of business and result in the unemployment of a further 40 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">This is not an issue for the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to address with the legislation before the House. However, as we make agencies more responsible in certain areas, problems will result from the lack of protection extended to them under company law. The issue should be addressed by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank the Minister for coming before the House for a debate to which I had looked forward. To Senator Brian Hayes I say that it is time to examine the future operation of the social welfare system. Now that he agrees with individualisation, we should use the opportunities the tax system provides to improve social welfare.</p>

          <p eId="para_598">The budgets of the past six to seven years have reflected an economic buoyancy we had not experienced for quite some time. In the black days of the recession when money was scarce, young people flocked to ports and airports as the dole queues became increasingly longer. It was quite an experience in the 1990s to witness the upsurge in employment and genuine economic prosperity. A case has been made that the mismanagement of the national finances has led to the sharp decline in expenditure by this Administration. In place of "mismanagement" I would use the term "fiscal rectitude". Fiscal rectitude took on a life of its own in recent years, largely as a phenomenon created by the Minister for Finance. As predicted, fiscal rectitude has ensured that in the downturn it is the least well off who have suffered the most. This state of affairs is reflected in a budget that does very little for people on low incomes, for carers and for others on the verges of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The budget was roundly criticised and condemned by many people and organisations for its inequitable and unjust provisions, particularly in so far as they affect those to whom I have referred. The unemployed, the underprivileged and the socially excluded have not received a fair deal from the Government. When my former party leader, Deputy Quinn, was Minister for Finance in 1996, Deputy McCreevy told him that when cutbacks in spending were needed it was the poor who would suffer most. This individual has shown his commitment to that principle as Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">I expect things to deteriorate over the coming years. When the national finances take a turn for the worse through the actions of the apostle of fiscal rectitude, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the poorest will be hit. I sympathise with the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, as I would with any Cabinet Minister who has to ask the Minister for Finance for money for his or her Department. As evidenced by the now defunct national health strategy, it did not do the Minister for Health and Children much good when he made a convincing case to the Minister for Finance to part with money and stop being so miserable with his allocations. Organisations such as CORI and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and those who care for people in need are not being spoken for at the Cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The dental dispute lasted for about two years during which PRSI contributors were unable to avail of treatment. In fairness to the Minister, she brought the dispute to a conclusion. Those most affected by it now find that essential and necessary dental treatment is costing a lot more. In some cases the cost of fillings has trebled. The high cost of living is hitting every household.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">The Bill provides for social welfare increases which are a pittance and paltry in the extreme. An unemployed person will receive a real increase of 30 cent per week. An unemployed couple with one child will be given 25 cent extra per week. The child benefit gain works out at about 54 cent per week. The increases are being nullified by the rate of domestic inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The Government gave a commitment over a three year programme to increase child benefit but only delivered on one quarter of the amount. It had been one of the many boasts of previous Ministers and was bandied about in the Government's election manifesto. This promise has been broken already and with a great degree of speed. I wonder if other promises will be broken. When it is decided to do a U-turn, is any thought given to those who will be most affected by such decisions?</p>
          <p eId="para_609">We have become more aware of pensions, including private pension schemes. One of the benefits of the Celtic tiger era was that people could afford to make provision for private pensions. The Minister for Finance told us repeatedly about the good state of pensions. The old age pension is now a smaller percentage of the average industrial wage than in the 1970s. This statistic must cause us to wonder what happened when things were going well. I know that this annoys Senator Cox, in particular.</p>

There is an additional €7 per week for carers under 66 years. The weekly income disregard is €19 under the carer's allowance scheme. The income per week threshold is €150 for those in receipt of carer's benefit, for those who wish to engage in limited self-employment. That is not good enough.

The Department is at best ambiguous about the process and misleading in the way it reports on it. The Department asserts that the analysis of poverty-proofing applies to the social welfare and income tax changes only. However, when referring to tax changes in general rather than income tax only, it asserts that the analysis "reflects the highly progressive nature of Budget 2003, which sees those depending on welfare getting the greatest gain".</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenneally:</from>
          <p eId="para_630">The people are not fools and they know on which side their bread is buttered.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, and congratulate her on the excellent job she has been doing since taking up office last year. Without any reflection on her predecessors, she is like a breath of fresh air in a Department which gives little scope for inventiveness or initiative. She has clearly indicated that she has her finger well and truly on the pulse of the nation. It is obvious she has brought to the Department the wealth of knowledge she has gained at the coalface of constituency work. I am aware of her weekly advice column in the provincial press. She seeks to get the information to the people through one of the most effective means possible, namely, local newspapers, which are so beloved by everyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Minister has some sympathy with my views in regard to a favourite subject of mine, the carer's allowance, to which Senator McCarthy referred. She indicated this in a previous debate on social welfare in the House. Carers have been ignored for many years and their work has gone unrecognised by all levels of officialdom. Thankfully, the situation has improved immeasurably in recent times. I am still of the view, however, that carer's allowance should be paid to everyone who fulfils that role, regardless of their circumstances. It is a recognition of difficult and necessary work carried out by such people and of the saving to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I realise the Minister does not currently have a budget for this expenditure. Neither is it her sole preserve as it impinges on the responsibilities of the Department of Health and Children. Carers' work saves the State a huge amount each year. However, this does not appear to be recognised, acknowledged or even properly quantified. It could be argued that we should be taking care of the elderly and the disabled, regardless of the circumstances, and that we should not have to be paid to do so. Naturally, people would be more likely to undertake the work if there is a financial incentive and if it benefits the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, is well aware of the pressures – not only financial, but also in terms of accommodation – on the health service. The Minister for Health and Children is also aware of the number of beds taken up by people who could and should be cared for at a less intensive level than in hospital, which would free up resources for more appropriate and urgent purposes. This could be achieved by moving some patients to nursing homes at half the cost or moving them back to their own homes, or those of relatives, at very little cost compared to the expense of hospital beds. The carer's allowance has the potential to solve a significant part of the hospital accommodation problem. One reason it might not have been implemented is the necessity for cross-Department co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The extra expenditure for the Department of Social and Family Affairs necessitated by the expansion of the scheme can be made available through savings in the Department of Health and Children. I urge the Minister to look closely at the advantages it could bring to the elderly and those with disabilities, as well as to the Exchequer and the health services. It will take some vision to achieve this and I believe the Minister is the right person to do the job. Has a study has been carried out to establish the cost of extending the carer's allowance across the board, including the benefits that would accrue to the State through savings in the Department of Health and Children?</p>
          <p eId="para_636">In common with a number of Members of the Oireachtas and many people throughout the country, I was disappointed that the student summer jobs scheme was abolished. In recent years the numbers participating in the scheme have fallen sharply, mainly because there was plenty of well paid employment available elsewhere. Regardless of whether it was the original intention, there were two main beneficiaries of the scheme, namely, the students and the sponsoring bodies. While these were mainly voluntary organisations, they were always groups who had some benefit to pass on to the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">A major summer camp was developed in my constituency with the resources made available through the scheme. The full benefit of the subvention was channelled back to the children and families in reduced costs for the camp. This meant that people of little means could send their children to the camp. Children of the Traveller community were accommodated as well as those with intellectual disabilities. This is just one of many schemes and services throughout the country which will be hard hit this year. Funding is now more difficult and the benefits will not reach so far this year, which is regrettable. I ask the Minister, notwithstanding the fact that she has informed the participating sponsors from last year of the discontinuation of the scheme, to reconsider the matter in a sympathetic way. The cost could not have been that great, yet the benefits for the students, sponsors and the community at large were great.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I realise that the community employment scheme does not fall within the Minister's remit. However, it is not that far removed in that many of the beneficiaries of the CE schemes were recipients of social assistance in one form or another. The progressive scaling back of the scheme has hit the voluntary sector hard. Together with the abolition of the student summer jobs scheme, it takes the backbone out of many needy and beneficial initiatives. I ask the Minister to look again at her own scheme and perhaps consult with her colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to reinstate and reinvigorate the community employment schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">To return to the Bill, I congratulate the Minister on the increases granted to child benefit recipients. An increase of €8 each for the first and second child, together with an increase of €10 each for third and fourth children, is very significant. It is of great practical help in rearing children. This brings the benefit for four children to €565 a month, a generous allowance by any standards. The fact that it is paid directly to the mother in most cases is of major benefit. I urge the Minister to maintain her excellent record in this regard in the future. I realise that we cannot indefinitely give increases of this magnitude. Having reached the required level to deal with the practical difficulties of expensive child care, it should be possible to maintain payments at the required level.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">When I discussed this matter with a constituent who has not been eligible for child benefit for a decade or more, he was surprised and pleased to note the huge strides made in recent years in terms of bringing these payments up to acceptable levels. He contrasted the current situation to that of the 1980s Fine Gael-Labour coalition which not only failed to adequately maintain the child benefit allowance at the time, but also removed the tax free allowances which were of major benefit to parents. He lamented the fact that he is not rearing his children in the current child benefit regime. He felt life is currently considerably easier financially than in the cash-strapped days of the coalition Government to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I thank the Minister for eliminating an anomaly which has been to the disadvantage of some pension recipients. The current six weeks payment after death does not apply to a spouse with a pension or allowance in his or her own right. This has been eliminated under section 7. It is an indication that the Minister is willing to effect improvements for the benefit of small minorities of disadvantaged people.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I have been concerned for some time about the treatment of certain recipients who qualify for disability benefit and invalidity pension. I have come across countless recipients who have had their medical condition certified by one or, perhaps, two consultants – after a great deal of examination and numerous visits to them and their GPs – only to have it overturned after a sometimes cursory examination by the medical examiners retained by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. To add insult to injury, the attitude of some of the medical examiners is appalling and not what is expected of a public servant. This is totally unacceptable. I know from the Minister's record that she would be the first to acknowledge that the day when this behaviour might be acceptable is long gone. On behalf of a humiliated and suffering segment of social welfare recipients, I plead with her to issue clear guidelines on the kind of behaviour that is and is not acceptable in this area of her Department. An improvement in this alone would be a monument to her compassion and understanding of the difficulties encountered by these recipients of her Department's allowances. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_270">
          <from>Mr. Bradford:</from>
          <p eId="para_643">I also welcome the Minister and wish her well in her ongoing work. I congratulate her on her appointment. I read her regular dispatches across a wide range of local newspapers and hope her weekly exercises in publicity will be matched by resources for those who depend on her Department on a weekly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">Given our system of politics, most Members of the Oireachtas meet their constituents on a regular basis, especially those with difficulties and queries. This gives us an in-depth knowledge of how the social welfare system is working. Every politician is, to some degree, an expert on the rules of the system and we can all make arguments to the Minister on changes and improvements. My colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, and others have addressed the issue of the social welfare increases and the rate of inflation, on which I will not elaborate.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I concur with Senator Kenneally's comments on the carer's allowance scheme. This issue has been raised in every social welfare datable in which I have participated over the past ten to 12 years. While everybody welcomes it, there is a widespread view that it does not go far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The Minister for Health and Children and his predecessors have had to address a number of crises regarding the care of the elderly and doubtless his successor will face similar ones. If properly funded, the carer's allowance and benefit schemes could achieve great results in this area. The solution to the problem is not to confine the elderly to nursing homes. We should attempt to provide a structure where the greatest possible number can be looked after in their home with the help of their family or immediate neighbours. The carer's allowance and benefit schemes can play a major role in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">While I appreciate the Minister's resources are limited, I am disappointed no significant improvement has been made to these schemes in recent years. The change to the means testing limits has not resulted in a significant increase in the number of carers in receipt of the allowance or benefit. I understand approximately 25,000 are in receipt of a carer's allowance, while the number of carers is close to 100,000. Every elderly person forced to move to a private nursing home or district hospital because of the lack of local or domestic care costs the Department of Health and Children far more than the cost of providing a carer's allowance for a family member or neighbour.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I hope the Minister will place an overhaul of the schemes at the top of her agenda. While the structure may to some extent be satisfactory, there is a need to ensure it is extended to all those who provide a level of care for their elderly relations and that elderly people will be cared for at home rather than in a hospital or private nursing home. This will require extra resources. It is a matter of choice. However, it must be recognised that exceptionally good value is obtained for every €1 of taxpayer's money spent on the carer's allowance or benefit. The Minister must divert far more resources to the schemes in an attempt to ensure that each year during her tenure in office the means testing limits are improved and there is a greater uptake in the number of recipients. It is not good enough that if at least 100,000 are providing care on a weekly basis, much of it full-time, only one quarter are in receipt of some kind of carer's payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The question of medical examinations for disability allowance or invalidity pension is another preoccupation raised at the time of the annual Social Welfare Bill. I regularly encounter large numbers of cases involving people who are unable to work and in receipt of disability benefit for years but are refused invalidity pensions. They are told by the Department that they are not permanently unfit for work. On some occasions medical officers deal with them in a manner that suggests they would be out of pocket if an invalidity pension was payable.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">When a person has been out of work for four or five years and has been in receipt of disability benefit for that period, it is extraordinary that in some cases the Department is unwilling to certify that he or she is unfit for work and thereby deny him or her an invalidity pension. The additional cost to it and the taxpayer of the payment of an invalidity pension over a weekly disability benefit is modest. While there are additional advantages attaching to the pension such as free travel and electricity, much misery is being created in an attempt to save a little. I ask the Minister to ensure medical referees and inspectors look more favourably on applicants for invalidity pension where they have been long-term recipients of disability benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The question of farm assist is close to the heart of the Cathaoirleach, who I hope will not be in need of the benefit. The Minister spoke of the need for members of the farming community to contact their local social welfare office if they have problem. I welcome her assurance that their claims and problems will be dealt with in a confidential and discreet manner. Such an approach is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Despite what commentators like to portray, the majority of small farmers do not want to be seen as recipients of social welfare. The take-up of social welfare payments by farmers is probably significantly lower than the numbers who should be in receipt of farm assist. While I compliment the Minister on her efforts in regard to advertising benefits in the press, her weekly message to the nation, via local newspapers, would need to be stepped up in regard to this programme, especially at a time when agriculture is in crisis. If we are to provide assistance and for income maintenance through farm assist, we must ensure every possible recipient takes up the scheme. I ask the Minister to give this issue further attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">There are many other issues we could address. Social welfare is a minefield in regard to queries, anomalies and problems which we will keep bringing to the Minister's attention. Despite her additional resources, every cent and more will be needed. I wish her well in her endeavours to try to loosen the purse strings of the Minister for Finance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Mr. Kitt:</from>
          <p eId="para_654">I welcome the Minister and thank her for what she has said. I congratulate her also on the announcement made in the previous Bill and compliment her, in particular, on the attention she has given to helping the elderly, widows and widowers and those in receipt of child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Other Senators have spoken about the increase in carer's allowance which is very welcome. The respite care grant has gone up by €100 in the budget. The same has been done in regard to the income disregard. I accept the point made by Senator Bradford. We do not want a situation where everybody ends up in a nursing home. Given that there has been an increase in payment rates for nursing home care, we must do our best to improve the carer's allowance. Like other Senators, I would like to see no means test for carers but know from previous argument that a major cost would be involved. It is good to see that the income disregard has been increased and I hope we will move towards a situation where we will have no means test. People have been pointing to the cost of nursing home care and the fact that the subvention has increased. An increase in payment for carers would help to level the playing field.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The respite care grant increase is also welcome. The Minister mentioned that it would rise to €735 later this year and that there would be an increased grant where someone was looking after more than one person. The carer's benefit scheme to which Senator Cox referred is one of great imagination and will prove of great benefit in the years ahead. People have been learning about it in recent years. I ask the Minister to see to it that any red tape in regard to it is done away with.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The Minister spoke about the increases for qualifying children which will now be extended to recipients of short-term benefits such as disability benefit, injury benefit, health and safety benefit, unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. This is welcome. She is also moving on the recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare in regard to the benefit and privilege clause in the assessment of means for those looking for unemployment assistance or pre-retirement allowance. She said that this would start for those aged 29 years or over. This is a great step on which I hope we will build further. There are certainly some imaginative steps in the Bill and I hope we will see even more improvements in the months and years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">One of the issues referred to by the Minister in the previous Bill was the matter of assistance for those returning to school, education or work. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has shown in recent years that great improvements can be made in those schemes. We saw the benefit in the literature we received from the Minister for this year. Mature students get great help from such schemes to return to education. Galway university was a little disappointed by the change in the back-to-education allowance scheme for third level postgraduate students. The university is disappointed that summer payments have ended for allowance recipients. I ask the Minister to examine this issue. She has received correspondence from the NUIG and probably other universities about the scheme. Postgraduate students obviously believe their case should be re-examined. The weekly allowance they receive is €124.80, plus an annual book allowance of €254. Students entered the programme on the understanding that they would be able to complete their postgraduate degree under the scheme. Now they believe they may not obtain their full qualification because they may not have the resources to finish the course. That is disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Senator Kenneally mentioned the student summer jobs scheme which has been of great benefit, particularly in the environmental area. Now that it is gone something else should be put in its place. I think particularly of work done under FÁS which we have been told cannot be done. Students participating in summer schemes often did work with the tidy towns committees or community councils which used the scheme to get students to carry out necessary work. Something should be put in place through FÁS to replace it. The Minister should raise the issue with the Tánaiste.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">Another scheme which needs to be mentioned is farm assist to which Senator Bradford referred. Last year was a difficult one for agriculture. The weather played a role in making life difficult. The Minister has met farming organisations on the issue. In every budget in recent years a certain advantage has been given to recipients of unemployment assistance who have farms. The income disregard is an important element of the schemes. I am glad the Minister has continued her discussions with farming organisations about improvements that can be made. Of all schemes, this is the one in place for farmers. We may go to the European Union and look for help but if it is European policy not to give such help, we will not get it. We can have our own scheme such as farm assist to ensure payments are made to farmers who have fallen on hard times.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The issue of appeals does not fall within the Minister's remit but she is the policy maker. There is a delay in having appeals heard and decisions made. The Minister spoke earlier this year about making funding of €86,000 available to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to reconvene the trade union panel of social welfare appeal assessors and towards the running of the welfare rights unit. I welcome the news that funding is being made available for that purpose. However, it raises questions about the delays in hearing appeals and making decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I would welcome it if the Minister could obtain funding for more appeals officers. We are lucky to have good information on social welfare entitlements and benefits. We are told quickly at local level and by the offices with which we deal – those with which I am in contact are in Galway, Tuam, Loughrea, Ballinasloe or Athlone – about what is happening. I know the appeals office is independent, but it can be slow to deal with appeals. Members cannot raise too many questions about that on the Adjournment here or on Question Time in the Lower House, although we are trying to get results and information for our constituents. I hope the Minister examines that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I congratulate the Minister on the good work she has done in a short period. She has used her experience and brought two Social Welfare Bills before the House this year.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_272">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke:</from>
          <p eId="para_664">I welcome the Minister and wish her well in her work. It is a great privilege to be a Minister at any time, but it is particularly nice to be the Minister for Social and Family Affairs in good times when money is readily available in the economy. It is difficult to provide the necessary funding to give everyone a good standard of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">This morning I asked the Leader, Senator O'Rourke, to request the Minister to come before the House to discuss the back to education allowance as a matter of urgency. There are many schemes in the Department which support the disadvantaged. However, the decision to withdraw the back to education allowance from those on summer holidays and from postgraduates was a retrograde step. Senator Kitt also referred to this issue. I appeal to the Minister to address the difficulty caused by that decision. The back to education allowance gave many people an opportunity of which they did not think they would be able to avail. Many of them have embarked on studies which have given them great pleasure and satisfaction because of their mature attitude and talents.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">On Friday evening last, I met a married man of 47 years of age who has eight children. He left national school when he was 14 years old because his father died. He had a small farm of approximately 35 acres in the west which was poorly resourced. He found it difficult to make ends meet. He had an off-farm job for a few years, which he lost due to bad business circumstances. He joined a FÁS scheme and was re-employed in the community, which gave him a sense of responsibility. He started a project which led him to a third level institution. From the day he entered that institution, he has been successful. He now has a status in the community of which he dared not dream in the past. He was disgusted when he learned that, from early June, he will not have the support mechanism of the back to education allowance for himself and his family. He is also annoyed that he will not be able to continue in the postgraduate scheme. It is a retrograde step that a person of his age and circumstances, who has been through a great deal, may have to leave without his final qualifications. That is one example of the many of which I am aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Last year, 3,679 people received the allowance. That is a small number. It is petty to attack this group and to withdraw that support. Resources should be found for the scheme and the Minister should reassess this decision, which has led to great uncertainty, at the earliest possible opportunity. Many students are despondent because having been encouraged to go back to education in better times, they now feel unwanted. They are disadvantaged because resources cannot be found. It is a tragedy, but I hope the Minister will do something about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I want to bring to the Minister's attention a matter which should not be an issue in the Department. The social welfare officers we contact by telephone are, in so far as is possible, courteous, helpful and understanding. They try to assist people who have difficulty applying for allowances. However, the field officers who go out into the community and carry out reviews are callous. I can provide the Minister with examples, if she so wishes, which can be checked out. They seem to be on a mission to take as many people as possible out of the schemes. That is a tragedy and it contrasts with what happens in the social welfare offices and with the assistance given by other social welfare officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">When I was a Member of the Lower House, I gave the example of cases in Gort, County Galway, where people were asked to meet the social welfare appeals officer who wanted to review their applications. They were asked to wait in the lobby of a hotel, which was the most public area that could be found, despite the fact there were two social welfare offices available in which the work could be done in private. Everyone else in the hotel knew why these people were present when the officers called them. It is time to respect people's privacy and dignity. Despite the fact that they must undergo a public application process, they are entitled to some degree of privacy. The example to which I refer is not an irregular occurrence. Further training may be necessary and I hope that appeals officers who review people's applications will do so with the greatest degree of sensitivity. Social welfare applicants are sensitive and highly dependent on State support. That anyone should be embarrassed is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I endorse the comments of many Senators on the issue of disability and the apparent contradiction in opinion between medical referees and the consultants and medical practitioners who have been dealing with particular applicants and know they are not fit to resume work. I mentioned a case to the Minister last week, the details of which I shall forward to her. There is a need for equality between medical practitioners, on the one hand, and medical referees, on the other. If a person is able to stand, he or she is considered fit to work, the case is dismissed and he or she is denied the allowance. I ask the Minister to ensure that there are no contradictions between medical referees, people representing the Department of Social and Family Affairs and an applicant's medical practitioners. I also ask her to review the position as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Mr. Daly:</from>
          <p eId="para_671">I congratulate the Minister on her appointment and wish her every success in her work. With her experience and background she will make a major contribution to the overall development of social welfare services. I know from the short period I spent in that office that she has available to her the advice of some very professional personnel who have a detailed knowledge of the issues involved and how to deal with them. I reject any suggestion that the officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in any of the areas I have dealt with were callous and I have been a Member for over 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">Perhaps one of the most innovative changes in the welfare area in recent years was the regionalisation of services. Information is now readily available in regional offices. I wish to record my appreciation of the work of the regional office in Ennis and the dedication of its personnel. The regional offices have taken a huge volume of work off Oireachtas Members because of the manner in which they deal with the general public. That is a welcome development.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I congratulate the Minister on extending the respite care grant which has been of enormous benefit to those who receive it. The Bill provides for additional finances for about 25,000 people. I pay tribute to the tremendous work done by the carer's organisation, the Soroptimists in Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">There are some areas in need of special attention which may be dealt with by the Minister who has some overall responsibility for certain of the activities of the Ministers of State and others with, for example, responsibility for children. There is a necessity to deal effectively with the children on the streets of this city who sleep rough. A few yards from the House, children of 12 and 13 years of age are on the streets seeking charity and assistance from passers-by. While this problem may impinge on other areas of responsibility under Departments, it is a serious issue and one that needs to be tackled. The Government took an initiative earlier in the year which indicated the problem would be removed from the streets, but it is not working successfully. The wealthiest cities of the world have failed to deal with this issue. I am not sure it is entirely related to contributions. The reality is that parents are in receipt of benefit for those children who are on the street with baskets and boxes seeking funding and sleeping rough. This issues needs to be tacked soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">It is equally important to take care of the elderly in our community. In rural areas, old people still live in isolated houses without proper sanitary services and with poor facilities. I compliment the Department, the health boards and the local authorities on the work being done in providing for elderly disabled persons and elderly persons living alone, many of whom are without basic facilities and some have poor access to their homes. I ask to the Minister to look at this area because she has available to her, from her Department's records and the regional officers, information regarding the number and the location of elderly persons living alone in isolated areas. In some respects they suffer the disadvantage of not having available to them the basic requirements to live in decent comfort.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I am pleased the Minister made improvements to the after death arrangements, although it will not be any benefit to those who have already died. An issue I have raised on a number of occasions is that in some cases where overpayments were made to people who have died, their relatives still receive demands for outstanding amounts paid because their true income did not come to light until they died. The relatives are left with fairly substantial bills. This problem is common to the broad area of payments from small farmers' assistance to pensions. In all the cases of which I am aware, the relatives were unaware that overpayments were being made. Some provision is being made to deal with this issue and I hope it will be expanded in such a way as to deal with the large number of overpayments especially in respect of small farmers' assistance. Relatives who were unaware that this had happened are left with fairly substantial bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">One of the successes of the Department of Social and Family Affairs in recent years has been the partnership that has developed between it and the voluntary organisations. I recall meeting the various voluntary organisations that made pre-budget submissions and being involved in discussions at ministerial level. This was a most enlightening and useful experience. Sometimes one found there was duplication of work between different organisations that could be avoided. Given that resources will be scarce for the foreseeable future, duplication of services and payments must be avoided and instead must be streamlined in such a way as to get money to the people who need it. Such streamlining would prevent much wasteful duplication of services and the excessive waste of human and financial resources should be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">In this regard, I compliment Fr. Seán Healy who has been to the forefront in advancing the cause of the less well off. In recent days he has indicated that CORI will continue to be part of the new national agreement. It would be damaging for those who have been represented by Fr. Seán Healy and other organisations acting on behalf of the disadvantaged, if those organisations did not get involved with the national partnership and work with employers, unions, the Government and farmers to put a new agreement in place. It is imperative such organisations form a partnership with the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">It would be useful to have regular, organised discussions with the voluntary organisations rather than having one pre-budget meeting. In that way, we could build in their experiences and views on overall policies at departmental level. I know the Minister will not be found wanting in that regard because she brings with her vast experience in this area. I do not think there is anyone who has the same broad range of experience which could be brought to bear in framing a new streamlined package which will ensure the less well-off sections of our community are cared for.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">We must also care for deprived children – whether they are deprived is often debatable. It is not desirable that we have children seeking public support on the streets at night time and we are relying on voluntary organisations to care for them. I compliment those who go out night and assist them. Perhaps the Department could become involved with such organisations to try to deal with this problem which is quite significant in Dublin.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mary Coughlan):</from>
          <p eId="para_681">Gabhaim buíochas leis na Seanadóirí uilig a bhí páirteach sa díospóireacht seo. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil muid uilig ar an taobh céanna ach is breá an rud go bhfuil ocáid agam agus ag mo Roinn éisteacht leis an méid atá le rá ag bunadh an tSeanaid mar gheall ar an Bhille tábhachtach seo. Bhí díospóireacht fada faoi sa Dáil nuair a luadh go leor de na rudaí a luadh anseo.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">My experience at the Department of Social and Family Affairs is short. There has been a recurring theme to what has been said on this issue both here and in the Lower House. This reflects the practicality of politics and those issues which come to the fore when caring for those we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The spectrum of funding provided, the change in the economic climate and the value of what the Government has given to the less well-off are exemplified in one figure. My Department was allocated €530 million in this year's budget with only €180 million in tax concessions being provided for. That is the right balance in the context of the climate in which we now find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Like other Ministers and Members of either House, we would like to have extra money to do more. As we do not, we have to prioritise. One such priority is the support of the elderly which is progressively coming towards the recommendations of the NAPS and An Agreed Programme for Government. Equally, carers are an important element of the programme, as is the elimination of child poverty. We will focus for the next couple of years on addressing the many ideas outlined in the NAPS. This is our first year in operation and God willing we will have more years to deliver. We are moving towards the delivery of our programme and commitments while not taking from existing commitments within the Department. However, we must prioritise.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I regret other Members are not present to hear my comments. There has been much criticism in respect of child benefit increases. When appointed, I said there would be difficulties. It will cost more than €400 million to deliver on the next tranche of the package. My full allocation this year was €530 million. Should I neglect the rest of those for whom I must care? The answer is, "No". I had to prioritise. Following discussions, I decided we would commit ourselves to delivering on the programme but at a slower pace. When we achieve our target, we will have given the greatest increases in child benefit which will address two issues – child poverty and child care. The provision of child care is an ongoing issue and we have not yet been able to come up with the right formula. The universality of child benefit has in many ways addressed issues for the working mother and the mother who remains at home. It is focused on addressing child poverty. There is agreement on all sides of the House that this is the right way forward. It is our intention to deliver what we promised.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">The issue of carers was raised a number of times. My predecessor, Deputy Michael Woods, introduced the allowance. We have increased the income disregard in recent years. There has been a split of opinion as to whether we should invest all our money in removing the means test. It is difficult to say if that would be the right way forward. Senator Cox said those with a great deal of money should not expect the State to care for their ill relatives. This raises issues of morality and equality. We do not provide a payment for caring. I am sure it is the opinion of many Senators that one could not pay anyone to care for another. It is an emotional issue. We make payments in recognition of caring. I hope to be in a position to increase the income disregard in this area to include more carers in the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The respite care grant has been beneficial to many. We delivered an additional €100 this year and intend to increase it further. I am favourably disposed, if I have the money, to looking at the provision of respite care for others who do not receive the allowance. The Minister for Health and Children, my predecessor and I looked at the financing of long-term care. We will need to take a holistic approach to income support and not have the health boards, district nurses, voluntary groups and the Department going in different directions. We must target resources at areas where they will best be spent. Society has changed greatly and couples are having fewer children resulting in fewer people to care for the elderly and disabled. Regardless of which party is in government, it will have to come up with ways to address this important issue which is being looked at by an Oireachtas committee. I will be delighted to facilitate it as much as possible and look forward to the findings of its deliberations which may throw up some practical, poignant points. We will not be found wanting in listening and trying to address the concerns of many.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Many Senators have said that it takes time to organise payment of carer's benefit, a matter we will look into. It is administratively time consuming. One must ensure the person being cared for is eligible. We will raise the matter with employers when discussing delivery of the scheme. People are only eligible for a short time and the scheme is quite structured.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Senator Kenneally mentioned the summer jobs scheme. Responsibility for the scheme was transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, made the decision to end it. The Senator's concerns could be vented towards my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, but I will advise the Minister that the issue has been raised here.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">With regard to why people might be on disability allowance for a long period and not automatically entitled to invalidity pension, that pension has previously involved a definitive decision whereas disability benefit does not. I am concerned about the message we might give out to people who have a difficulty over a certain period, be it with depression or an injury. We should not say to them that they are being slotted into permanent disability through the invalidity pension scheme. Even if there is a change in the Department in that those on invalidity pension have been given an opportunity to have therapeutic work – which is to try to encourage people back into the workforce – I would have concerns with regard to changing disability benefit so that people would automatically move to invalidity pension after one year. It gives out the wrong message.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I appreciate that there are concerns. For some, invalidity pension has its additions such as the free schemes, but it sends out the wrong message. This is particularly true for those in the younger age bracket who may find themselves able to take up a course, for example, and move on to a different type of employment, not necessarily in the area in which they were previously employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">With regard to Senator Ulick Burke's concerns about field officers, I accept that I am responsible for all those who work in the Department. If there is a particular concern, I would be glad to hear it because the Department prides itself on having a good rapport with many of its clients in the area. People sometimes feel, rightly or wrongly, that their rights are infringed upon. I must balance the need to enforce necessary controls and the needs of those who are entitled to and require support. That is an important issue. If the Senator has a specific concern about a particular family, I would like to address that issue on his behalf. He could perhaps give me the details privately after this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Senator Ulick Burke also mentioned disability benefit and medical assessment, an issue to which I referred earlier. I took the opportunity to meet the medical people in the Department. Naturally, there is independence in that regard and I am not competent to challenge the professionals. I appreciate that some people might say they were only present for five minutes and that the relevant professional did not take a good look at them or that two or three consultants had made a decision. That is why there is an appeals process.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">If people have particular concerns, I would like to hear about them. The Department reviews its procedures on an ongoing basis. It was in a position this year to appoint more medical assessors to deal with appeals faster and we are trying to deal with the backlogs that, unfortunately, have developed. There was a meeting last week in the Department and we are moving towards addressing the issue of appeals. I appreciate that people are awaiting a final decision on their entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Senator Daly spoke about the changes with regard to the elderly. These came about because those entitled to benefit were militated against and were not getting their spouse's six week after-death payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The other issue referred to by the Senator was that of probate and people's estates. The Department's view is that it is not the relative, but rather the estate, that would be involved in a repayment to the Department through probate. Naturally, people will see the estate as their own and I appreciate that. However, there has been a huge change in recent years in dealing with these issues. I think the Department can be sensitive to particular circumstances on repayments. If there is a difficulty, the Department can address those issues confidentially with people.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The issue of voluntary organisations was raised. I was in something of a quandary when I lost the voluntary and community side of my Department to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. That aspect naturally blended into my Department's work as a practical approach to service delivery and working with the organisations. In many ways, the Department of Social and Family Affairs has not lost that in regard to its field officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I took the opportunity to meet representatives of the relevant organisations in a pre-budget forum and I try to meet them as often as possible to address the issues they raise on an ongoing basis. I rely on those organisations to put forward their concerns. The pre-budget forum last year was considering spending €3 billion more than was available in the Department's budget, so, naturally, I could not deliver on everything. However, I take on board many of the issues involved. The Department will work in partnership with others in the coming years and will try to deliver on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The question of the back to education allowance has been raised by several Members. Anyone in receipt of the allowance at present, and those in a postgraduate situation, will not be affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">With regard to the payment at work or during summer holidays, many of those on the scheme would have been on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit. If they are not in a position to find work, they will revert to their previous position and would be facilitated within the eligibility criteria for unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit. There will not be a loss to those people if they are not able to find a job during the summer because they will revert to a payment from the Department. I hope to meet the Union of Students in Ireland to discuss this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">Decisions had to be made. I have received many representations on the postgraduate issue from the universities and the students' unions. I looked at the figures and the target, which was to provide second chance education at either second or undergraduate level. It then progressed to postgraduate level and moved on.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan:</from>
          <p eId="para_703">I appreciate that. I have looked at the permutations and the statistics on the second and third level options. The estimated cost for this year is €29.6 million for the entire provision at second and third level. In the main, people were coming from the live register – some were being paid unemployment benefit or assistance while others were in receipt of invalidity benefit. The total number on the back to education allowance for 2002 to 2003 is 6,473 and they have not been affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">I see merit in what the Senator says. The target has always been that a primary degree would be the initial step from which a person would move into employment. One of the reasons this programme was launched was because we had huge concerns about literacy and the difficulties that people faced without formal educational achievements. The target was to get people through the educational process at second level initially and for them to then progress to third level, which was seen as the platform at which a person could move into employment. Of those, some have moved to postgraduate study.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I have listened to the arguments. The matter will be raised in the Dáil on Thursday next by way of parliamentary question. The cost is something which, unfortunately, I cannot carry this year. If I was to allow another group of postgraduate students to commence courses in September, it would cost approximately €4 million. However, I will keep this matter under review and will meet the relevant organisations. University College Galway, in particular, has been quite vociferous in its representations – as would be becoming of the relevant gentleman.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">Coming from the west, I appreciate that. When the educational qualifications and attainments are considered, we would have concerns in regard to the west, the south-east and parts of Tipperary. In those areas, many people have not gone into third level education. This scheme has been helpful in getting people into third level and the argument has been cogently put that the primary three or four year degree has been a platform for many to progress from education to work. If people believe a postgraduate degree is important or necessary, they can do it in the context of also having the opportunity to work. I appreciate what Senators have said and will keep the matter under review.</p>
