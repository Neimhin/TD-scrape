          <p eId="para_1">I have notice from Senator Kitt that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to clarify whether additional funding for disability services will be made in separate allocations to counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, and not on a 3:2:1 basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to insist on the retention of the UCD research farm at Lyons Estate, Straffan, County Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to advance the building programme for Nenagh vocational school beyond phase 1, as this building has not been upgraded since it was built in 1970.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">Later today, the Irish Nurses Organisation will again protest on the streets of Dublin about the conditions and salaries of its members. Many thousands of nurses are flabbergasted that, at a time when they have been asked to work so hard within the acute hospital system, many senior and middle managers within the Health Service Executive, HSE, have awarded themselves such a massive increase in salary, pay and conditions. There must be a sense of perspective in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The chief executive of the HSE has stated that his priority on assuming the job was to build up capacity within the community care services. However, I have discovered that at present, there are seven fewer public health nurses in Dublin than was the case in 2001. This is despite the massive growth in population in the greater Dublin area and the greater pressure which has been placed on postnatal care services and on many existing schemes catering for the elderly. It is horrendous that, at a time when the delivery of quality community care is expected, HSE executives appear to be more concerned with paying themselves fat salaries than with delivering the kind of results Members expected when the Government decided to introduce radical reforms, such as removing politicians from health boards and similar measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Members should debate the manner in which the health service is being administered and governed with the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children before the summer recess, in order to bring some accountability to the system and to ensure value for money and that those people who are working hard will receive their deserved rewards.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_14">Senator Brian Hayes made some serious points with which I agree.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The issue raised yesterday by Senator Minihan regarding the leaving certificate mathematics paper is a good example of how change should not be managed. It is clear, given the concerns raised by third level institutions, that the mathematics paper requires change. However, permitting pupils and students to walk into an examination only to find a completely reorganised and reformatted paper, with a completely new approach is the incorrect way to manage change. This issue has created trauma for pupils, is unfair to teachers and creates worry for parents. Although the Minister would state that this is a question for the State Examinations Commission, I ask the Leader to raise it with her. There is political responsibility in this regard and change should not be managed in this fashion. The House should be informed as to how this could be dealt with in future. If change is required, people must be aware that it will take place to be able to prepare for it and deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I wish to raise an issue concerning the Leader's own constituency. I can assure the House that had a bog fire taken place in County Wicklow, it would have taken over the national media for the past week. A serious and risky event occurred in County Longford last week, namely, a bog fire which ran riot for a number of days. It was extremely serious and necessitated the movement of livestock. Moreover, people were obliged to move from their houses, property was damaged and trees were cut to create firebreaks. I seek reassurances that this cannot happen again, as lives could be at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Apparently, other locations handle such outbreaks better. My understanding is that in places such as Laois and Offaly, a fireman is assigned to each bog to ensure that bog fires are treated and dealt with at an early stage. However, the problem in the Longford area was caused by cutbacks, which meant that a similar approach was not taken and no defence mechanisms were in place. This is one of those issues in rural Ireland which is simply ignored by the establishment. It is a serious issue which could cost lives in future. I seek reassurances that it cannot happen anywhere in the boglands, which extend throughout the midlands.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate as soon as possible on what appears to be the reorganisation of the health services in the north-east region. A report has been completed and is being launched today by the HSE, amid reports that a new hospital is to be built. While what is happening in the north east is primarily of concern to that region, issues on how the HSE organises and delivers services arise in other parts of the country. It is important we have this debate and many Members share my concern that since the abolition of the health boards, and despite the establishment of the so-called regional fora, there is no democratic accountability in the delivery of the health services.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I ask the Leader again to let us know when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is likely to publish his proposals on a press council and media freedom. I would also like to know about the publication of a new set of regulations on crèches.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_22">In recent days we heard of the momentous decision of the Irish Christian Brothers to withdraw from education and to hand their schools over to a trust for the future. This is after 200 years of dedicated service to the Irish nation providing Irish education for Irish children at a time when that was not available, particularly for those who could not afford it. They gave us a sense of self-esteem at a time when the country needed it, they prepared us for careers and made it possible for us to build up the new State.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Most of the staff of the early Civil Service were educated by the Irish Christian Brothers. They were central to the promotion of Irish games and culture. Nobody could express fully the gratitude and appreciation we owe to the Christian Brothers. I raise this issue because I hope the State will not allow this period to pass without acknowledging what has happened appropriately and generously. Future generations and history will not thank us if we do not avail of this opportunity to show our gratitude for how the Christian Brothers helped us to get up from our knees and bring us to our current position.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_24">Last week the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources presented a comprehensive document on energy, the first of its kind produced. It took a considerable period of time and the committee met all the people involved in energy over 18 days. That document is extremely important. Energy is the most important issue we will have to deal with in the near future. Over 90% of our energy comes from fossil fuel, a volatile resource.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The document includes components on wind energy, which we want to increase to 21%. Despite the regulator's reassurance that we will achieve our objective of having 13% of our electricity derived from renewable sources by 2007-08, on the ground I found many impediments to wind energy promoters. I am not sure we have our act together. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister to have a comprehensive debate in this House on that report?</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_26">The House would welcome the news that agreement has been reached on what was always a contentious Orange march in north Belfast. It might be the source of a debate for us in the autumn. This is a hopeful development in that it was brokered by local people, such as councillors, political parties, clergy, the loyal orders and residents. Linked with the meeting between Archbishop Seán Brady and representatives of the orders, it is a welcome sign that people on the ground are beginning to talk and listen to each other and understand each other's point of view. That can only be hopeful.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_27">I support Senator Maurice Hayes because the marching season is often fraught with tension, particularly for the minority community in Northern Ireland, and it shows maturity that they are talking to each other and that these contentious marches are being agreed. That is the way the community should go. Would the Leader request information from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources about a serious subject that was brought to my attention by listening to RTE Radio 1, when Mr. Derek Davis pointed out that we passed legislation in both Houses governing safety in sailing and motor boats and providing for further developments by ministerial regulation?</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Although prepared, these regulations have not been signed. They would include a requirement to have at least a level 2 motor-boat certificate. One does not need a certificate of competence or a licence to drive a boat. Some of them are dangerous and can go at 240 km/h. We have had a series of tragedies over the last couple of years with people using jet-skis, which can be dangerous. There is no regulation and drivers do not even need insurance. If this House passes legislation and the Minister fails to sign regulations, putting citizens' lives in danger, we are entitled to an explanation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_30">At the risk of incurring the wrath of the Chair, the issue riveting the nation is whether any of the Bloomsday ladies in the photograph that was in the national media this week caught Senator Norris. There is growing concern among people west of the Shannon that there is another anti-west lobby on decisions on the re-opening of the western rail corridor. A report was published some weeks ago by the Western Development Commission, the conclusion of which asked why dual carriageways stop approximately where the Shannon separates east and west and why people in the west should not have the same infrastructure and development of services as those in the east. I link that to a perception that there has been a reduction in spending in the BMW region under the national development plan and from EU funding, which continues until 2012 at least.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I accept that the Government, particularly the Minister for Finance, has responded vigorously to this perception in recent weeks. I would like the Leader to consider a debate, if not before the recess then after, possibly in Government time as a motion that would allow this House and the Government to clarify the spend of money in the west on infrastructural development. It might help lay the myths that are growing up about this and would allow Senators on all sides of the House to make a contribution</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_32">A meeting is taking place across the road on the future development of health services in the north east. This was triggered by the tragedy when a 75 year old man bled to death in Monaghan General Hospital last year. We have had a review and a report on that review by Teamwork management consultants. It is daft in the extreme to think that another consultants' review and report on the health services in any part of the country was necessary. I support Senator O'Meara and Senator Brian Hayes on the urgent need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to this House and debate openly whether she is in control of the health service anymore. This is stage 1 of the reintroduction of the Hanly report dressed up in different clothes.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">This is a very serious situation. It may be a case of the HSE chief executive, Professor Drumm, introducing the provisions of the Hanly report by other means and it requires debate urgently. What will be the Tánaiste's input into or direction on this?</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I support Senator Finucane on the urgent need for a debate on energy policy. I have serious reservations on the part played by the energy regulator in implementing what is supposed to be Government policy. Throughout the countryside many individuals and co-operative groups have wind energy projects ready to begin but they are being denied access to the national grid because there is a preservation order on the system. Energy prices affect everyone. Why must we rely so much on imported fuel when we could generate our own electricity through wind energy at less than half the current cost?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">I welcome the proposal for a debate on health services. I recently met representatives of the Brothers of Charity and the Galway Association on funding in the area of disability. It is outrageous that the system is the same as that under the health board whereby in the western region, for every euro Roscommon receives Mayo receives two and Galway three. It is based on a mathematical formula rather than an assessment of needs. A more realistic system should be put in place for the voluntary and disability sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I was told at the meeting that money is badly needed in the areas of occupational therapy, speech therapy and physiotherapy. These organisations have the personnel but need funding to allow these therapies to be put in place in the western region.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">Some three years ago the Human Rights Commission wrote to the Government requesting that it be accountable directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Government did not oppose this but sought to consider the suggestion. Can the Leader find out the position on what seems to me a valid and sensible suggestion? Three years is sufficient time to formulate a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">A British newspaper report this morning indicated it is possible to buy a strain of smallpox on the Internet with total freedom. An initial release would affect ten people and could spread to 2.2 million people in 180 days. I do not know what the answer to this is but it seems ideal for a terrorist who seeks to use the Internet to secretly and efficiently create horror. Smallpox was eradicated many years ago but it is possible for terrorist organisations to access strains of it. I do not know whose responsibility a response to this might be but we should be aware of the situation so that we can take steps to address it.</p>

This is not the first time this has happened. In my own locality people lost their entire crop of turf to bog fires and immeasurable harm has been done to wildlife so people should be very careful. This seems to have happened often in the past but I cannot say what should be done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">On the role of the Christian Brothers in Irish education, I am proud to be a past pupil of the Christian Brothers school in Mullingar. We are talking about the rule, not the exception, and I have fond memories of the Christian Brothers there and around the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Politicians around the country can sometimes feel helpless when it comes to participation in decision making. Many decisions are now made by people within the health service who are answerable to no one. If we are to have a proper health system the people who make decisions like handing out medical cards, allocating beds and moving patients up waiting lists must be accountable and answerable. If politicians behaved in such a way a tribunal would most probably result. The vast majority of people in the health service work hard and fulfil an admirable vocation but some abuse the system, seeming to consider it one big pay cheque for themselves. We should lead the way in ensuring that accountability be introduced. I ask the Leader to invite Professor Drumm to address this House and outline what he intends to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I support the calls from Senator Ó Murchú and Senator Glynn for appropriate State recognition of the contribution made by the Christian Brothers to the development of Irish society over the past two centuries. Many generations of Irish boys would not have had access to an education but for the contribution and self-sacrifice of many within the order. It imbued a love of our island, of being Irish and having pride in ourselves. It also gave us a love of our native sports, hurling and football, and grá for an teanga Gaeilge atá sa chinn. It is very appropriate that the order be recognised at this stage, as it is no longer actively involved in the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I support the comments made with regard to the need for wind energy. I previously called in this House for national guidelines for a national wind energy strategy to emanate from the relevant Department. My understanding is that the matter is now being addressed. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to attend at an early stage to discuss the content of those guidelines. Senator Quinn and others have championed the need for independent energy sources in order to meet our future obligations.</p>

Ireland is one of few countries which has no legislation in place to regulate the industry. If recent newspaper articles are correct, on-line betting is causing major hardship in many households throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Is it the intention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to introduce legislation to regulate the whole area of on-line betting? He has mentioned that he intends to plug the loophole relating to casinos in separate legislation which will be introduced.

I was amazed when I recently learned that almost 3,000 primary schools in the country are not in the ownership of the State. They are mainly in the ownership of different religious orders. They account for approximately 90% of schools, which is a significant proportion. We are vulnerable in one way, as when religious orders leave education, primary schools could be closed down and sold if the orders suddenly began to sell their assets.</p>

It is not until one is immersed in a scenario of a crowded accident and emergency department, or crowded corridors, that one becomes fully aware and appreciative of the problems which exist. We have spoken of trolleys and patients on trolleys, but because so many people speak of it the whole time, the impact is not realised until a situation occurs similar to what happened last night in Letterkenny General Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">My mother was at the accident and emergency department there last night, and a crash victim was brought in. The staff excelled in preparing for the arrival, but the victim unfortunately passed away. After the incident, relatives of the deceased arrived and were mourning the loss amid other patients in the corridor. They were not afforded the dignity to mourn the loss. There was mayhem on the corridors, and the dignity which people should be afforded at that time was not given because of the cramped and crowded conditions.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">Yes. He asked for a debate on the administration and delivery of health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">Senator O'Toole discussed the need for management of change in the second-level school curriculum. He pointed this out with regard to how the higher-level maths papers have gone in the leaving certificate exams. The Senator correctly stated that the Minister will advise that the State Examinations Commission will decide on the issue, but he nevertheless felt it should be more hands-on, and that this kind of curriculum change is not being managed. A curriculum change in any subject is significant for any school.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">The Senator commented on the Longford and Westmeath bog fire. In Laois-Offaly a fire officer is specifically appointed to monitor bogs. There was a strong wind paired with the significant heat last Thursday and Friday, which fanned the fire in question. I take the Senator's point. The incident was highlighted well, and Ciarán Mullooly reported each evening on it. That is not the point. It is a significant rural issue. Many people in Dublin do not know what a bog is, let alone speak of a fire on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Senator O'Meara spoke of the delivery of hospital services as we are to be told today of what will happen in the north-east region of the HSE. If we want change and better services, the country will have to be divided and examined. The Senator wants the issue out in the open, which is an admirable suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The Senator asked when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will bring forward his ideas on a press council. He may have been ready to run with the idea but for other matters intruding. With regard to the regulation of crèches, I have spoken to the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and he stated he would like to come before the Seanad to speak on the matter. I will raise the matter with him again.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Senator Ó Murchú praised the role of the Christian Brothers and indicated that we should mark it in some way. Senator Finucane mentioned the document on energy. We all received it and it looks like a very impressive document. The Senator stated that the appropriate Minister should be invited in to debate the detail of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned that communities had reached agreement on the contentious Orange march in Belfast. That is ground-breaking in itself, and it is a welcome sign.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Senator Norris brought up the issue of legislation on the safety of sailing boats, and ministerial orders arising from legislation waiting to be signed. This raises a much bigger question. Much legislation depends on Ministers signing statutory orders. They are often in the Oireachtas Library having been signed. The Senator indicated such orders are not signed and are urgent.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">Senator Mooney mentioned a debate on the BMW region. We had such a debate two weeks ago with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. The Senator would have been busy with his European duties. We commented on the western rail corridor yesterday, with the issue raised by Senator Kitt. We discussed how the so-called smart media are trying to run down the whole concept, as if the trains would stop at Athlone and that would be the end of the journey west. I have previously stated that when we went into Government in 1987, there was much pressure from the Department of Finance for cuts to be made. One of the cuts suggested was that all trains going west would terminate in Athlone. I was delighted to be there. I wondered whether they would stop in the middle of the Shannon or cross it. As one can imagine, that proposal got nowhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">Senator Ulick Burke raised the issue of the delivery of hospital services throughout the country. The Tánaiste is in control of the health service. Thankfully, she has a good working relationship with Professor Brendan Drumm. The Senator also wanted a debate on energy and the role of the regulator. He stated we appear to have a preservation order on the national grid and one cannot tap into it. We will endeavour to get the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to the House to debate those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">Senator Kitt raised the matter of funding for disability services. He stated that in the western region a mathematical formula is still used, particularly in counties Galway and Mayo, and, to a lesser degree, in County Roscommon. Senator Kitt suggests it should be based on the need for moneys for physical and speech therapies.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">Regarding Senator Quinn's point, the Human Rights Commission wrote to all of us, enclosing documentation and stating it wants to be responsible to the Houses of the Oireachtas, which I thought admirable. I intended to examine that issue and take responsibility to hear from the commission and work through the document.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Easy access to lethal drugs on the Internet must be investigated. Senator Glynn raised the issues of the danger of bogs and the role the Christian Brothers played in education. He asked me to request the Taoiseach to mark their role in Irish education on the announcement that they will move out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Senator Feighan welcomed the agreement on the marches in Belfast. He also requested that Professor Drumm come the House. I imagine the man has enough on his mind and there would be no chance of him coming here.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Senator Browne raised the issue that school sites are not in State hands and the expense involved. Many orders put them in trusts from where they can be accessed. He also mentioned the role of the church in schools. Boards of management may have a lay chairperson. That is the case in many schools and they do an extremely good job. I agree the multidenominational primary education sector does great work.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Senator McHugh raised the issue of the delivery of health services. He told a tale of people having to express their grief and comfort one another in crowded corridors and stated that surely it is a small matter for hospitals to provide a bereavement room where people could gather and talk over what happened. It is a fair point. Some hospitals do so but the disparity in the delivery of services is very significant. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_101">There could be operational circumstances in which a driver of a Garda car, ambulance or fire brigade vehicle would need to use a hand-held mobile phone "in the performance of his or her duties". It is for this reason that drivers of essential service vehicles have limited exemption from the prohibition on holding a mobile phone while driving. The exemption is strictly controlled and only permits a driver to hold a mobile phone when he or she is acting in the course of his or her duties. Amendment No. 2 proposes to remove this condition and if we were to accept it, would result in a general prohibition affecting drivers of Garda and emergency service vehicles. I disagree with this. The subsection, as drafted, provides the right balance between ensuring safe and responsible driving and permitting a driver of an emergency service vehicle to use a hand-held mobile phone in certain circumstances, if so warranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Amendment No. 9 provides that using a hand-held mobile phone to call the Garda or an emergency service is a defence for a person charged with holding a hand-held mobile phone. The Bill recognises that there may be certain emergency circumstances in which a driver needs to use a hand-held mobile phone while driving his or her vehicle. In short, it is for such circumstances that what may be termed a "genuine emergency defence provision" is included in the Bill. If one is apprehended in circumstances that are not deemed to be an emergency, but where one believes they are, it is a matter for the court to determine the merits of the genuine emergency defence. I consider this approach to be fair, reasonable, balanced and pragmatic. I suggest the Senator consider withdrawing his amendments. His proposals would not result in the strong, clear legislation we propose to introduce.</p>

This could leave a loophole in that the Minister is using the word "avoid". There is no need for the legislation to state this and we do not legislate in that fashion. The loophole could be exploited in the courts, as has often occurred in respect of other legislation, because the State is listing a reason in the Bill. I hope the Minister of State will accept my amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_106">Perhaps there is some ambiguity in the thinking but, as far as I am concerned, the proposed section is very black and white. Subsection (4) recognises the need to have a broad, flexible legislative framework to regulate in-vehicle technologies for providing information, communication or entertainment for the purpose of restricting or preventing driver distraction associated with the use of technologies by both drivers and passengers. The broad view is that mobile phones comprise the only in-vehicle technology but there is an exhaustive list with which I want to deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Given the scale of innovation in the technology sector, it is important to give the Minister power to prohibit the inappropriate and irresponsible use of in-vehicle technology without generating the need to introduce primary legislation on each occasion he or she wishes to do so. In giving such powers to the Minister, it is usual for the enabling provisions to spell out the parameters and purpose of the regulatory powers. Section 4 specifies that regulations to control the use of in-vehicle technologies by occupants of vehicles must be for the purpose of avoiding the impairment of, or interference with, the driving capacity of the driver of the vehicle.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">If the Senator's amendment were to be accepted, it would give the Minister broad power to make regulations concerning the technologies in a way he may desire but he would not be required to base them on furthering driver or road safety objectives. An open-ended approach to the making of regulations of this kind is unusual and I have received legal advice that this could be <i> ultra vires</i>. If the amendment were accepted, listening to a radio and using navigational equipment that can be programmed prior to setting off on one’s journey and which can give oral directions could be banned by the Minister. However, the purpose of this type of equipment is to make roads safer and assist drivers. I ask the Senator to consider this and realise his amendment would allow an open-ended approach in the making of regulations, which we want to avoid.</p>

I am a little concerned about subsection (4), which in effect allows the Minister make regulations providing for the prohibition of certain devices. In effect, this subsection allows the Minister to create an offence and I wonder whether legally that is the right approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">The argument over the past year and a half or so was that we needed explicit legislation to enable us to prohibit the use of mobile phones. It appears the same argument might apply to this subsection in that if we are to explicitly prohibit particular types of in-car communication devices, we must explicitly spell that out in the Bill and also the penalties that will apply. What we have said is that the Minister may do that by way of regulation should he or she choose to do so at some stage in the future. However, I wonder whether we need to specifically prohibit it in this Bill rather than give the Minister power to prohibit it at some stage in the future by way of regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">While I am on this issue, will the Minister of State specifically address the issue of whether that subsection could or will be used to prohibit the use of car kits in the future?

          <p eId="para_123">Something which is not in this section but to which the Minister of State might give consideration at a later stage, is the issue of scenic routes, which are now defined through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, or more particularly through the local authority, in terms of their development plans. They are creating and identifying routes as scenic routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The designation of scenic routes and the belief that they can be used for something other than that for which they are designed, namely, as thoroughfares to get from A to B, has the capacity to lead to accidents due to people slowing down in particular scenic spots, not concentrating on the road and, more particularly, looking at the visual amenity in the area. On another level, it is creating major problems in terms of people getting planning permission in particular areas. That aspect should be addressed by the Minister of State's Department in terms of road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">We have many scenic routes in County Clare and the Department must examine, in conjunction with the local authorities, the possibility of providing more lay-bys in particular areas to accommodate tourists and others who wish to appreciate the scenic value of particular areas. There is an exercise between the Minister's Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to move away from the principle of all stretches of road being seen as some type of scenic amenity. It is more important that they be seen as thoroughfares and try to discourage people from gaping over ditches in a way that has an impact on road safety.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">Senator McDowell raised an important question in regard to spelling out the various devices and new technologies that are coming on stream. Many people now use their cars as an office because they spend so much time in them. Perhaps the Minister of State should consider putting a speed restriction on cars driven by people using mobile phones or other devices to ensure they cannot exceed the limit.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">Section 3(4) empowers the Minister to make regulations to restrict or prohibit the use of mobile phones, other communications equipment, and information and entertainment equipment by occupants of motor vehicles. This provision is important because it recognises the need to have a broad, flexible legislative framework to regulate in-vehicle technologies and information, communication or indeed entertainment equipment for the purpose of restricting or preventing driver distraction associated with the use of such technologies by occupants of motor vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">When we consider the scale and pace of innovation in these technologies, the assigning of regulation-making powers to the Minister is prudent and sensible. Technology is advancing so quickly it is important that we should be able to act immediately, if necessary. If a piece of technology is introduced which might have an effect or impair the driver and lead to dangers or distractions, it is important the Minister should have that power.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">Scenic routes are a distraction. I would like the hedges trimmed in some of the most beautiful scenic routes in the country but I am told that can be a distraction for drivers. That is something I will discuss with my colleague in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There should be ample notices in advance of such scenic sites and lay-bys whereby those who want to view our scenery, and we want them to do that, would be able to do so without endangering their own safety or the safety of others.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">Perhaps I did not make myself sufficiently clear. I was looking to explore the difference in approach between subsection (1) and subsection (4). Subsection (1) provides for a specific offence of holding a mobile phone and a later subsection outlines the penalty, but subsection (4) is simply enabling. Why is it being done in an enabling way? Why does he not create a general offence of using an in-car communications device in such a manner as to be dangerous, rather than saying regulations may be made at some stage in the future to deal with these other issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_131">The reason I am pursuing this now is that we were told by the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Callely, that it was impossible to enforce an offence of holding a mobile telephone <i>simpliciter</i> — in other words, if it was not otherwise dangerous — for the last 18 months to two years because we needed to create the specific offence, as we are now doing. That is fine. It seems to me the same argument applies to the offences that are obviously contemplated in subsection (4). Surely we need to explicitly create that offence or those offences if we believe they are to be enforceable. In making the regulations, is the Minister of State contemplating the possibility of prohibiting the use of car kits where the phone does not have to be held manually?</p>

The word "hold" is defined in subsection (9) as "holding the phone by hand or supporting it with another part of the body". This prohibition, it is clear, does not apply to hands-free mobile phones or two-way radios. Accordingly, mobile phone use involving bluetooth technology, where the phone is placed in a cradle, is legal. However, if we find that at some time in the future there is sufficient evidence of infringements by drivers arising from phone use, then the Minister has the power to act under subsection (4).</p>

However, if a Garda inspector, superintendent or someone of higher rank decides there should be mandatory alcohol testing between, say, 17:00 and 19:00 hours, I believe there is sound reason for providing some degree of flexibility. If a Garda testing unit is on the Castlebar-Westport or the Donegal-Ballyshannon road at a time when there is no great flow of traffic, if we stipulate between 17:00 and 19:00 hours, that means the gardaí must remain there during this time. Perhaps when the particular unit is alcohol testing, it should be able to move to another venue, with the approval of course of an inspector or someone of a higher rank. Our legal advisers say that whatever the merits of Senator Paddy Burke's proposal, it would very much tie the hands of the Garda authorities and not give them the flexibility they require.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">Amendment No. 32 calls for a new section to be inserted at page 6, after line 34, specifying that a member of the Garda Síochána "who attends the scene of any road accident, may, and as far as practicable shall, require the driver of any vehicle involved in the accident to provide (by exhaling into an apparatus for indicating the presence of alcohol in the breath) a specimen of his or her breath". I tabled this amendment on foot of a recent report that surprised me. According to that report, there is no legal requirement on the gardaí to take a breath test after an accident. The result is that sometimes it happens and at other times it does not, which is quite an unsatisfactory situation. Perhaps the Minister of State will put me right, but my amendment seeks to close that gap and to place an obligation on the gardaí who attend an accident scene to take breath tests from any driver involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">I put in the words "as far as practicable" to cover the situation in which it is not always possible to take the test, for example, where a driver is severely injured and all the focus is on getting him or her to hospital as soon as possible. That type of situation aside, however, everybody will agree that the gardaí should be required to take breath tests at the scene of every accident. Perhaps I have not read the Bill correctly, but it seems to me there is no onus on the gardaí to do that, and that is the reason for the amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_151">I am responding to amendment No. 32, which is linked, of course to amendment No. 31 tabled by Senator White. Both Senators referred to this matter on Second Stage. I want to refer to section 4 of the Bill, outlining the provisions on mandatory alcohol testing. Both Senators propose that the Bill should be further amended so that a driver involved in a road traffic accident shall be required, where possible, or indeed as far as is practicable, to undergo a mandatory test for alcohol or drugs. The Road Traffic Acts already provide that a member of the Garda Síochána may require a person in charge of a mechanically-propelled vehicle to provide a preliminary specimen where the vehicle is involved in a road collision or where a garda considers that a road traffic offence has been committed or forms the opinion that the person has consumed alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The purpose of preliminary roadside breath testing is to provide the garda with the facility to determine whether the person in charge of the vehicle has consumed alcohol. The Acts provide that a person may be arrested for a drink driving offence without recourse to a preliminary breath test. There may be circumstances, as I referred to on Second Stage, especially in the context of a road accident, where it may not be possible for a member of the Garda to require that a person, who may be unconscious or injured, submit a preliminary breath test. In those circumstances, under the Road Traffic Acts, the gardaí may place an obligation on a person to provide a blood or urine sample in hospital. This applies where an event occurs involving a vehicle which results in a someone being injured or a person claiming or appearing to be injured, where he or she is admitted to or attends a hospital and where a member of the Garda is of the opinion that at the time of the event the person had consumed an intoxicant. An intoxicant can include both alcohol or drugs or indeed any combination thereof. Garda discretion as regards the use of preliminary roadside tests is an integral and indeed important element of the enforcement provisions relating to the laws that apply to drink driving. It is my view that the legislation in place is adequate and I hope that the explanation I have given will satisfy both Senators. The spirit of what they intend is already incorporated.</p>

          <from>Ms White</from>
          <p eId="para_153">I thank the Minister of State for his comments. However, I believe there would be tremendous public support for compulsory testing of people at the scene of an accident, especially drivers. I understand that it would not be ethical to test a person in a life and death situation at the scene of a serious accident, but it should be done as often as possible rather than on a random basis. The public would like that policy. There was almost one death per day last year on the roads. More people were killed on the roads in the past nine years than in Northern Ireland since 1969. I do not know why there is not a bigger hue and cry in here every day about road deaths.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The other point I wish to make is about mandatory testing for drugs. In the UK, studies found that 59% of those surveyed had driven a vehicle after smoking cannabis, while 37% had driven after taking cocaine. I asked a colleague this morning about the effects of taking cocaine. Apparently, one feels invincible. We must keep up to date with other countries and we should put drug testing on the same level as alcohol testing in this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_155">I wanted to explore some of the issues raised by Senator Burke because they are very important, especially the issue of how specific the authorisation needs to be in respect of time and place. At the moment, there is a requirement that specifies an hour and date at which a checkpoint may begin and an hour and date at which it may finish. As the Bill currently stands, there is no restriction on that so it would be possible for a particular inspector to specify that an authorisation could run for two or three weeks, or every Saturday night for the year between 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. There is no specific requirement that a separate authorisation would need to be issued. If an inspector felt that it was reasonable to have a checkpoint close to a pub every Saturday it seems to me, that as currently formulated, it would be possible for the inspector to run off one authorisation to allow that to happen. I do not see any restriction on his or her capacity to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">The Bill is also very loose — maybe that is the intention — in defining the place. It actually states "place or places". If there is a concert in Croke Park, is it possible for a local inspector to issue an authorisation saying that the Garda may mount checkpoints in the vicinity of Croke Park? Would that extend to Mountjoy Square? How precise does it have to be?</p>
          <p eId="para_157">I am not a member of the Joint Committee on Transport and those who are have an advantage over me. The Minister has chosen to introduce a parallel system of breath testing in addition to the current system. He has not chosen to modify the powers that already exist. He has chosen to add on an additional power which can only be exercised under this authorisation at checkpoints. We need to know how this will work. It seems clear under this section that individuals who are stopped cannot ask the garda for a copy of the authorisation. For example, if I am stopped at Artane roundabout, I do not know whether the garda has the power to exercise his powers under section 4. He may be acting under the Road Traffic Acts and he must therefore have a suspicion that I have taken drink, or he may be acting under an authorisation to set up a checkpoint. The individual being tested has no way of knowing that. In those circumstances, we are open to the possibility that authorisations will be issued <i>post facto</i>. If someone is stopped on the Artane roundabout on a particular evening and tested using the powers under that subsection, the garda can go back to the Garda station later and get an authorisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">If we restrict the power to test randomly — that seems to be the intention — we need to be clear how it is restricted and we need to have the restrictions enforceable. On the other hand, if we intend that testing should be random, we should not be going about it by creating a different way of doing things. We should simply change the existing powers.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_159">We believe it is very important that gardaí have flexibility with the time factor. There is nothing in the legislation that states that authorisation should be presented if requested, but there is nothing to stop gardaí from showing an original or certified copy to the individual who has been stopped for a random breath test. On Second Stage, I stated that there would be guidelines from the Commissioner which would assist gardaí in carrying out mandatory alcohol testing.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">It is important that the proposed legislation in the Bill gives a degree of flexibility to the Garda Síochána. If a garda's hands were tied, it would not achieve the purpose of mandatory alcohol testing, for which there is much support. Senator White's idea is the same principle as Senator Quinn's amendment. In the event of an accident, the person involved can be tested. If he or she is seriously ill, the test can be carried out in a hospital. With regard to accidents, I do not believe I have heard of anyone being involved in an accident where there was a suspicion at all of drink being involved who was not tested, except in a situation where one was seriously ill, and of course that can be carried out in a hospital.</p>

This requirement is to circumvent the danger that existed at all times, namely, the suggestion that it was a case of big brother looking on and that it was unconstitutional. I attended meetings at which this issue was discussed. I am advised by our legal people that what is proposed is the one way that this can be addressed.

          <p eId="para_172">This is probably the most important section of the Bill and I am sure we will not give the other sections the same treatment. I assume, although I do not know if this is the case, that the logic behind that legal advice was that the inspector would on some rational basis authorise a checkpoint for some particular reason and, therefore, it would not be random in that sense. I assume that is the sort of advice the Minister of State received.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">If that is the case, the Bill will not achieve random testing. As the Minister of State said, this section is intended to have a wide and general effect and for the testing to be genuinely random. The section does not require the inspector to have a rational basis on which to set up a checkpoint. We may be falling between two stools in that either the testing is random or it is for a specific purpose. The Minister of State appears to suggest that we have a framework which is intended to suggest that there might be a specific purpose for such testing but we do not require a specific purpose for it. The message we are sending to Garda inspectors throughout the country is that they should use this measure widely.</p>

          <p eId="para_174">The implementation of this provision would be a matter for the Garda Commissioner who would delegate authority, and guidelines will be drawn up to assist in this regard. Such testing will be totally random. This is a matter for the Garda. It will have to use its resources to the full. There will be times of the day, weekend or year that the incidence of such testing will be much higher than other times. We should leave flexibility in that respect to the Garda Commissioner, with a view to ensuring this measure would be effective. We are trying to find the right balance.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_175">I wish to continue on this topic. I was surprised some years ago to discover that there was a constitutional problem with random breath testing or any other testing. I can understand the Minister of State's quandary. I am delighted Senator McDowell raised this issue because it appears that such testing is no longer random. Somebody will have to make a decision as to where and when such testing is carried out. There is a constitutional problem with such testing and I hope this provision will solve it. I am delighted Senator McDowell brought this issue to the fore because I was not aware of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Perhaps the Minister of State has explained this point and I did not understand it but am I correct in saying that a superintendent, chief superintendent or inspector will need to have a reason for doing this? If that is so, I do not know to whom the officer would communicate that reason and, if that is the case, the testing would not be random. Given our Constitution, perhaps there is no other way of doing this.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">I wish to deal with my amendment No. 32. The Minister of State said that the Garda "may require" and I was hoping that the measure would be that the Garda would require such testing in the event of any accident. My mind has been put at rest by what the Minister of State said, namely, that he has never heard of a case of an accident in which there was a suspicion of alcohol abuse where a test has not taken place. I may be sticking to the letter of the law on insisting that on every single occasion a test must be carried out. My main reason for requesting that was that such a requirement would act as a deterrent. If everybody knew that random breath testing was in place and that in the event of one being involved in an accident, regardless of the circumstances, one would be tested for alcohol, that would act as a deterrent to drinking or taking drugs and driving. Is there a definite test for alcohol consumption in the event of an accident in other countries, regardless of the cause? The Minister of State might not be aware of that but I would be interested to know if that requirement applies elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">I wish to deal with the point raised by Senator McDowell. What is proposed is a cumbersome way of testing because the dogs in the street will know the location of the checkpoints. How far in advance will a superintendent or other officer make an order authorising the testing and will the officer make it on a daily, weekly or monthly basis, because the officer must specify the location? The provision in the section is rigid because the time and location of the checkpoint must be specified. If the Garda operate outside the remit of this section, there will be confusion because it will have to use another Act to prosecute a person who breaks the law. This is a rigid provision. The Minister of State should accept the amendment I tabled which would give the Garda greater flexibility. The teasing out of this section indicates it will not provide for flexibility in its application.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">To respond to Senator Quinn's point, I do not know the position on compulsory testing at the scene of an accident in other countries. If that is the position, it does not necessarily follow that we would adopt that position. I am satisfied that if one is ill, what is paramount at that stage is the health and well-being of the individual. If a test is required, it can be carried out in the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Senator Quinn appreciates the thinking behind this measure. There is no question of having legislation in place which would allow anyone to escape if he or she was drinking and involved in an accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I wish to make one further effort to deal with the question of the flexibility or rigidity of the mandatory alcohol testing. The whole purpose of such testing is that it must be proportionate to the problem and the question is one of who makes that call. It is not for us to call that in legislation. We must leave that to the discretion of the Garda. The Garda Commissioner will draw up guidelines in consultation with his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">It is not a question of putting it up in red letters that there will be a mandatory alcohol test at some point on the road between Dublin and Naas, between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. The inspector or relevant garda from the rank of inspector can do this at short notice. At times it might be an impromptu decision. If it happens it is because the gardaí in that district or subdistrict feel it is proper to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The legislation should be enacted by the summer and I hope not too many will suffer as a result of this. This will be a major deterrent to the too many people who drive having consumed alcohol. When the system is in place its deterrent effect should result in fewer people being caught. This will prove its effectiveness and that people are observing the rules. Hopefully, this will lead to a drastic reduction in the excessive number of fatalities we are experiencing. Many of those fatalities are the result of drink driving.</p>

Refusing to give the sample is an offence and one can be brought to court and may lose one's licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">If Senator Paddy Burke, or any other Senator, is stopped and asked to submit to a mandatory alcohol test, when he knows there is no alcohol in his system, he may still be taken to the Garda station and asked to provide the necessary sample. If the alcohol level does not exceed the prescribed limit one cannot be disqualified but can suffer the penalty of a fine or imprisonment. There is a belt and braces here, namely, that if one refuses to give a sample it does not mean that one can simply roll up the window and drive on. One can be taken to the nearest Garda station and tested in the traditional way.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Lest there be any misconception, the mandatory alcohol test is not alone sufficient to prosecute, even when the gardaí stop a driver and show that he or she has exceeded the limit.

          <p eId="para_188">Senator Paddy Burke has raised an interesting issue. The Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong in saying that the current legislation provides that if somebody refuses to give a sample, the penalties mirror those which would have applied had the person been over the alcohol limit, which include disqualification. In that case one can be disqualified if one refuses to give a sample. The Minister of State, however, seems to suggest a two-tier approach whereby if one refuses on the roadside one can be fined or imprisoned, but one is then brought to the Garda station where, if one refuses again to give a sample, one can be disqualified on prosecution of that offence. This is a clumsy way of dealing with the problem. Why create separate offences of refusal on the roadside and in the station, with different penalties?</p>

          <p eId="para_189">One is disqualified only on refusing to submit to an evidential test. There is no disqualification for refusing the mandatory alcohol test. I cannot conceive of a situation in which the gardaí would dismiss one for refusing to submit to a mandatory alcohol test on the side of the road. They would bring one to the nearest Garda station and ask one to provide the blood or urine sample which would be a full evidential test. A refusal to undergo that would trigger the fine or disqualification.</p>

If the Minister of State envisages that in all circumstances when one refuses at the side of the road one will be brought to the station where the additional penalty of disqualification is available, why create an offence of refusal at the side of the road?</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Perhaps I am not making myself clear. At the moment we are saying, in theory, that somebody could be prosecuted twice, for having refused at the side of the road, at the checkpoint, and again for having refused in the station. On the latter offence one can be disqualified but not on the first offence. Why is that necessary? I cannot imagine any circumstances in which a person would be prosecuted for those two separate offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I do not see much that is new in this provision. The only new feature is that in the past if a garda decided to apprehend one he had to form the opinion that one had consumed alcohol. The garda does not have to form that opinion now but can ascertain this by way of random testing. In extenuating circumstances when one does not comply with the test, and the test on the side of the road indicates one has not exceeded the limit, that is the end of the matter. If, however, the test indicates that one may have exceeded the limit there is the opportunity to give a further evidential test. The purpose of doing this is to create a deterrent to those who in the past have taken risks.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">While I do not disagree with the Minister of State, I do not understand why there is this two-tier level of offences. The subsection under discussion prohibits non-co-operation and provides for a penalty of up to €5,000 and possible imprisonment. As I understand Senator Paddy Burke's amendment, he says if one is guilty of that offence one should also forfeit one's licence because that is what happens now. If one does not comply with any of the requirements the penalties are exactly the same as they would be had one taken the test and failed it. That is fair enough because otherwise there would be an incentive to refuse to take the test.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I appreciate that the Minister of State says one can take a further evidential test in the station but if one has the option of a fine or imprisonment, and theoretically one does not lose one's licence for refusing on the roadside, one could decide that, rather than take a test and fail, one would not take the test but simply pay the fine. Why should we bother having this additional offence if the real offence will be committed in the Garda station?</p>

          <p eId="para_195">Amendment No. 25 proposes that in addition to the fine or term of imprisonment, a convicted person could be disqualified from driving for a period not exceeding two years. This proposal would mean that a court would have the discretion to apply either of the penalties or the disqualification as it saw fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I will refer to the Road Traffic Acts which include a number of provisions to deal with disqualifications that result from convictions for the commission of specific offences. Consequential disqualifications which are an immediate consequence of a conviction are applied to a specific number of serious offences through provisions in the Acts. The courts, however, are free to apply disqualifications in respect of any other traffic offence and such disqualifications are referred to as ancillary disqualifications. Section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 which was subsequently substituted by section 10 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 and amended by the Road Traffic Act 2005 provides current arrangements under which a person may be required to submit to a preliminary roadside breath test and if the person fails to submit to that requirement, he or she will have committed an offence and can therefore be arrested and subsequently be subject to a blood or urine evidential test.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Therefore, a conviction for an offence under section 12 of the 1994 Act does not attract a consequential disqualification. This is because the test to which the section relates does not establish any evidential basis to the effect that the driver has consumed a particular amount of alcohol. However, where the subsequent evidential test establishes that the person has consumed an amount of alcohol that exceeds the limits set in the Acts, a conviction results in an automatic or consequential disqualification. The corollary is that if the person did not have alcohol in his or her system or was not above statutory levels, there would be no disqualification. However, if we accepted this amendment, there would be automatic disqualification for a person who did not agree to the mandatory alcohol test and that is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">The approach we are adopting in respect of both preliminary roadside testing and evidential testing will apply equally to the new system as proposed in the Bill and in the case of current arrangements. It is for those reasons that it is not possible to accept these amendments, particularly amendment No. 25.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">We have all heard that in our public lives. I have been approached by many people making such a case. It is against the law to be drunk in charge of a vehicle. One does not necessarily have to be driving while drunk. It would be unusual for a person who wants a rest to sit in the driving seat. One would imagine that a person who wants to sleep would sit in the back seat or the passenger seat. I am not being facetious when I say that. I have outlined the position in that regard.</p>

The Garda Síochána can make a decision in that regard when it is drawing up the guidelines. I do not want to impose my views on the Garda as this is a matter for the force. If it is well-known in a local pub that mandatory testing is taking place down the road and that people should not move their cars, the whole purpose of these new provisions will be defeated. If we ensure that there is a degree of randomness in the testing system, it will be very effective. We can refer the proposal to provide for booze buses to the Garda.</p>

The Australian authorities are quite happy if such people do not drive. They do not try to trap people with random breath tests after they get into their cars. They go out of their way to advertise that testing will take place so that the public begins to see it as a deterrent. In such circumstances, people choose to take taxis rather than to drive home. The aim is to deter people from drink driving rather than to trap them.</p>

I am sure people in every pub who wish to act responsibly but cannot avail of a booze bus are capable of lifting the telephone to get a taxi to take them home. When the Garda starts to implement this new measure, it will have a major deterring effect. The provision of booze buses is very sensible. We are all familiar with very responsible publicans who do not allow drivers who have consumed alcohol to drive their vehicles. In such circumstances, publicans will drive the people in question home or arrange for them to be brought home in taxis. The Australian approach, which involves booze buses, seems to be working in that country. Perhaps the Garda will consider it when they are drawing up the guidelines.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">This amendment seeks to provide for the index-linking of fines. As fines should be index-linked so they do not go out of date, I suggest they should increase gradually each year in line with the annual inflation rate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_218">While I am not accepting the amendment, I believe it has a great deal of merit. I have suggested in this House on numerous occasions that we could deal with matters of this nature by introducing a fines Bill. I understand it is proposed to introduce such a Bill at some time in the future. Such legislation would deal with problems involving the fines provided for in many Acts. The level of fines should be linked to the consumer price index or some other index. Section 5(4) of this Bill states that "the fixed charge" to be applied under the Bill in respect of certain drink driving offences is €300. It is an enabling provision that allows the Minister to prescribe some other amount in lieu of the amount of €300. If a fines Bill has not been enacted in three or four years' time, the Minister of the day will be able to increase this fine to a realistic level. The provisions of section 5(4) of this Bill are standard features of various areas of the Road Traffic Acts, which give the Minister discretion in the timing and determination of the level of the fixed charges which apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">While I agree with the principle of index-linking with the rate of inflation, as set by the European Central Bank and automatically updated on 1 January each year, I do not believe it would be appropriate to depart from the standard practice I have mentioned by accepting this amendment. When the Minister of the day decides that a fine of €300 is not adequate, he or she will have the power to increase it. If a fines Bill is introduced by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the meantime, it will deal adequately with this matter by providing that it will be necessary to have a statutory regulation if fines are to be increased. If it is clear that the Minister of the day is not satisfied that the penalty fits the crime or that the rate of inflation is such that it causes a fine to be increased sufficiently on 1 January each year, changes should be made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or by means of the fines Bill that I hope will eventually be introduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">Amendment No. 35 basically proposes that section 5(5) should state that "the person shall be disqualified from holding a driving licence" rather than "the person shall be disqualified for holding a driving licence". The terminology proposed in the amendments in this grouping is contrary to the terminology used since 1961 in the Road Traffic Acts, which refer to a person being disqualified "for" holding a licence, or being disqualified "for" applying for a licence. This form of terminology has stood the test of time. I am advised that it is the correct legal terminology. When licence holders are disqualified from driving, they are disqualified "for" holding the licence but are not disqualified from the entitlement to the licence, as it is returned to them after the period of disqualification has elapsed, when they again become entitled to the licence. If I were to accept this amendment, there might be a suggestion that people are disqualified "from" holding a licence and that it might not be possible to return it to them. I have been informed by the legal advisers that the correct terminology is being used.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I support the important amendment tabled by Senator Paddy Burke. My understanding of the system as set out in this section is that one will be served with a fixed charge notice and will be informed subsequently that one has been automatically disqualified. Obviously, this measure is intended to be more lenient than a normal prosecution and, consequently, one is only eligible to be so treated if one has not been convicted of an offence during the previous five years. I assume the form which will inform people that they may pay €300 will state that they are only eligible to do so if they have not been convicted within the past five years, and that if they do so anyway, they will be liable to much greater penalties, which are set out later in the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Senator Paddy Burke is correct. Many people will simply not read the form. Most people, on receipt of a form stating they must pay a fixed penalty of €300 and will be disqualified for six months, will not appreciate, and probably will not bother to read, that they are ineligible for such lenient treatment if they have been convicted of an offence during the previous five years. In such circumstances, the onus should be on the authorities to know whether people have been disqualified or convicted of drink driving in the past five years and to be able to tell such people that, consequently, they are ineligible for the more lenient treatment outlined in this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">It is wholly unreasonable to inform someone who receives a form stating that he or she must pay €300 that arising from the operation of this section, about which he or she is unaware and which he or she is unlikely to read, if he or she pays the fixed fine of €300, he or she could be landed with a fine of up to €5,000 or €10,000. This is unreasonable, as most normal people will not know enough to avoid stumbling into committing an offence under this section.</p>

          <p eId="para_246">Before I make a final decision in this regard, I should state that the section provides that where a motorist has been detected with a level of not more than 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood, or the equivalent levels in urine or breath, he or she will be offered the opportunity to pay a fixed charge of €300 and to accept a driving disqualification of six months. However, as the Bill stands at present, a motorist who has been convicted of a drink driving-related offence within the five years before the date of the alleged offence, will not qualify. The person who is in the best position to know whether this is the case is the individual himself or herself.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">It is a question of making it clear to people that if they have been convicted in the past five years, they do not qualify. This will not be in small print on the relevant document. Hence, such individuals should know themselves whether they have been convicted. The onus should not be on the State to raise this issue at the time. However, given the Senators' views, while I do not wish to give the impression that I will try to escape from this matter, I will consider the issue. Although I do not have any preconceived views and am prepared to examine the issue, Members should not hang a noose around my neck if I do not accept it on Report Stage.

          <p eId="para_248">Might it be possible for the Garda to ask the person in question, or to make the Bill's provision known to the person in question? The Garda do so when issuing general cautions. Might it be possible to suggest that a garda could first raise the question with the individual concerned, asking him or her whether he or she had been convicted within the previous five years and on receiving a negative answer, proceeding with the issuance of a fixed penalty, as outlined in this section?</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Obviously, in a case where the individual concerned stated that he or she had not been convicted, and was subsequently found to have been so convicted, the onus would be placed back on such a person. The points raised are valid, although the State should not be expected to maintain a database for the purpose of notifying people, to the extent of leaving itself open to challenge at a later stage. As the Minister of State has suggested, the onus should be placed on the driver concerned. However, this could be achieved by asking a simple question as part of the defined language used generally by gardaí in the course of issuing a caution.</p>

I refer to a person who has been found, after being tested on the side of the road and further evidential tests, to be under the level of 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. It would be somewhat impractical for the State to be responsible for this. However, I favour such information being included on the written notice or at another stage.

I refer to the amount of information available at any given time about disqualified people. Are there local databases or a national database which contain such information? If so, how recent is such a database and how much is known? It is important that the Garda should have a database available to it which would inform it whether a person had been disqualified. As the computerisation of the functions of the Garda Síochána occurred relatively recently, it is possible that such information does not extend back five years. However, it seems reasonable to expect that in a few years' time, there should be a national database, which can be checked by gardaí relatively easily, to ascertain whether a person has been disqualified at some point in the preceding five years. What is the present status regarding such information?</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_264">In page 8, subsection (13), line 38, to delete "€1,000" and substitute "€3,000".</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Both amendments seek an increase in the fine. I put forward amendment No. 51 because the existing wording does not recognise the full seriousness of the offence. This subsection imposes a penalty for an offence under the preceding section which applies to the requirements for a person whose licence has been suspended to surrender his or her licence to the licensing authority. We have read in the press that many people get around the suspension by failing to hand over their licences. This allows them to continue driving and if they are stopped for a routine inspection there is nothing to show the inspecting garda that the licence has been suspended. That is a serious offence and to impose a maximum fine of €1,000 is no more than a slap on the wrist. We need to show people that we mean business about taking away their licences and following up on the procedures involved. I therefore propose that we increase the maximum level of this penalty to €3,000, which is still a small amount. As I mentioned here some time ago, I was impressed in Finland recently that the fines are related to one's income. A senior executive in one of the telephone companies was fined approximately €200,000 for a motorbike offence because he happened to have high earnings that year. Somebody else might have been fined only €30 or €40. A fine of €1,000 is not sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Amendment No. 91 proposes replacing €2,000 with €3,000 on page 16, line 24, similar to amendment No. 51. I propose this amendment because the penalty in the Bill is not appropriate to the gravity of the offence of not having a valid driving licence. The subsection provides for a reduced fine where the person has had a valid licence but failed to renew it during a period of 12 months after it expired. The penalty in that case is a maximum of €1,000, which should be an effective deterrent that would encourage people to be diligent about renewing their licence. That situation aside, the offence is of not having a licence at all. A maximum fine of €2,000 is not in proportion with the seriousness with which we should regard that offence. I admit that driving without a licence is not as serious as driving without insurance, which should result in the vehicle the person is driving being impounded. However, given the importance we attach to driver testing and the difficulties in that area, it is not sensible to regard the offence of driving without a valid licence as anything other than serious. That is why I suggest we raise the maximum fine in this case from €2,000 to €3,000. The Minister spoke about the fines earlier and I was interested to hear that there is a separate fines Bill that will probably relate this to inflation. However, in both these cases €1,000 is not a heavy fine and I urge the Minister to consider increasing them to €3,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">I appreciate Senator Quinn's motives in bringing forward these amendments and I was interested to hear about the situation in Finland where fines are related to one's income. It may have some merit, not today but in the future. On the proposed fines of €3,000 in amendments Nos. 51 and 91 we should take other factors into consideration. They are disproportionate to the range of fines for other road traffic offences set out in this Bill and in the road traffic codes generally. There is a proposed fine of €1,000 for failing to surrender one's licence and €2,000 for letting one's licence lapse for more than 12 months, which also attracts penalty points, the effect of which is difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Therefore, the fines do not stand alone. The penalty points are provided for in section 16. The fines in the Bill are adequate and I hope a future Bill will deal with inflation.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">This covers the issue of a person driving while disqualified. This amendment creates a separate offence for a person driving while disqualified and sets out the penalties. It also allows for the extension of the disqualification period and a fine. It is worth considering in view of the serious situation in which a person who is already disqualified takes to the road. Such a person deserves rougher treatment than he or she currently receives.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">The proposed new subsection (13) would have the effect of disqualifying a person in advance of a date specified in a notice under subsection (11), which is 14 days from the date of the notice. As the date of disqualification would be dependent on receipt of the notice, such a provision would be difficult, if not impossible, to enforce, it would be unwise to include it in the Bill. The Bill is stronger as it stands. On the proposed subsection (14), the penalties for driving while disqualified already provided for in section 6(2), which provides for a mandatory disqualification of at least one year, and section 12(<i>b</i>), which provides for a fine of €5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both, meet the objective of Senator Paddy Burke’s amendment. There is little difference between our positions and, having explained this, I hope Senator Burke might consider withdrawing his amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">This is an ancillary issue to Senator Burke's amendment that relates to the same general area. Under subsection (13) there is an assumption that the onus is on the individual who pays the fine to prove that he or she has done so and that is reasonable. However, the onus is also on the person who claims never to have received a disqualification notice to prove that this is the case and this is problematic. How can one prove one did not receive something? It is reasonable in such circumstances that the person who served the notice be responsible for proving that he or she did so.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">It would be a pity to allow this section to go by without some debate, even if that simply involves me expressing my concerns. This section aims to provide for a quick form of prosecution for people who have had a few pints. The limit of 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood equates to two or three pints, roughly, for the average male of reasonable stature. I understand that there are people, perhaps quite a few, who can drink a pint and a half and be totally incapable of driving. The bulk of people caught by the use of this section will have consumed a relatively small amount of alcohol, by the traditional Irish social definition. I am not saying they should not be prosecuted, I merely think we should keep our eyes wide open.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">It is my understanding that, generally speaking, this offence is not prosecuted in large numbers at the moment. There are few prosecutions of people who have driven a vehicle with 80 mg to 100 mg of alcohol in their blood. I do not know why this is the case. It could be that the Garda is taking a pragmatic view and does not want to prosecute for such a level of alcohol consumption. It has been speculated that the techniques of measurement are not sufficiently sensitive to allow it be argued in court that a person has 85 ml, rather than 75 ml, of alcohol in his or her blood.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">This Bill should be based on analysis and evidence. I would like to know the number of accidents that occur largely because of the consumption of this level of alcohol. How many people who have driven after drinking two to three pints have been prosecuted? We could have a more informed debate about the wisdom of providing for this sort of quickie mechanism if we had this information. This information has not been in the public arena heretofore and I have a funny feeling we will not get it in the near future. If this is the case then we should publicly acknowledge that this is a far more rigorous approach to the consumption of a level of alcohol that many people regard as normal and acceptable and that this is being done without evidence that this amount of alcohol causes many accidents. I know it impairs judgment and that some people can be very drunk after very few beers but I am not convinced that we should introduce this level of strict liability for what are, largely, exceptional cases. I appreciate that this is not the politically correct thing to say, but it is a view, perhaps not articulated as often as it might be, which is very common in Ireland and which should be reflected in these Houses.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_287">The Garda did not make a conscious decision that those who were at a level of between 80 mg and 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood should not be pursued. In the past, legislation stated clearly that a garda had to form an opinion on the level of alcohol consumed. I do not know of any cases of people who were not pursued at the level suggested, however, perhaps Senator McDowell does through his profession. I have no statistics relating to this but if they are available I will circulate them.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">This Bill ensures that those driving with between 80 mg and 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood may now be stopped by way of mandatory alcohol testing and the new administrative sanction will be another deterrent. It may be said that six months off the road may be too long for an offence where very little alcohol has been consumed, but I believe it is quite lenient. One drink is too many and one of the aims of this Bill is to catch people who drive with between 60 mg and 100 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood in their systems where it is not obvious from their behaviour and the garda cannot form an opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">This is an interesting issue. The practice heretofore, as I understand it, is that after a person has been disqualified for a certain period, he or she could get the licence back. This was the normal practice in most District Court areas and District Court judges were inclined to give back a licence if there were any reasonable causes to do so. I applaud what the Minister of State is doing, as he is at least setting out some restrictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">A person still does not have to back up an application or state that it is for a particular reason. That is, of course, the practice. The person must go in, indicate that the required period is over and ask for the licence back. With the manner in which this is written, it is almost as if the licence is given back for good behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">What is the rationale for providing early return of licences? As Senator Paddy Burke has indicated, if a person is disqualified for six months, a year or two years, and most people assume drivers would be disqualified for two years, these drivers are not, in practice, disqualified. Why are we deliberately creating a regime where the period of disqualification is shortened? It does not seem to be a logical or sensible action to take. On the one hand we are increasing the period of disqualification but we are at the same time acknowledging that a licence can be returned early for no particular reason.</p>

The Bill provides that a person to whom this section applies may at any time, following the completion of half the period specified and taking into consideration the previous conditions mentioned, apply to the court which made the order for the removal of the disqualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Senator Paddy Burke's amendment proposes that those making an application for the removal of a disqualification would be subject to a proviso that "there are extraordinary and exceptional circumstances to justify such an application". It would be inappropriate to insert a provision such as this in legislation. It is a matter for the courts to decide the appropriate circumstances in which the disqualification may be reduced. They would decide any extraordinary and exceptional circumstances of the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">There has been a practice over the years that after a period, a person who has been disqualified may apply to the court which handed down the disqualification to apply again for the licence. In general, the licence may be returned. The judges did not take such decisions lightly, and it would have depended on the case made by the lawyer in question. The interpretation should be left to the courts and the discretion of the judges.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_324">There is a link between this amendment and the previous amendments. Proposed amendment No. 59 in the name of Senator Paddy Burke represents a fundamental change to the current provision for an applicant to apply for the removal of a disqualification. The Bill has made it more difficult to get a driving licence back after disqualification by ensuring that such disqualification is at least equal to two thirds of the period of disqualification rather than half, which it has been in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The Senator proposes this period to be increased to three quarters. Considering the approach in this Bill is reasoned and balanced, increasing disqualification to three quarters of the period of disqualification could be seen to be unreasonable. Subsection (3) allows the court to take into account the character of the applicant and his or her conduct after the conviction, as well as the nature of the offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The court may decide not to return the licence. There is no obligation on the court to do so, be it after 50%, 66.66% or 75% of the prescribed time. The Bill addresses the principle of the proposal of a counsel at work. The only difference between us is a question of whether two thirds or 75% is appropriate. In the past the portion was 50%. Two thirds is a reasonable balance and a compromise. Regarding amendment No. 60, I consider that 14 days is a sufficient period to contact the Garda.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_332">"(3) Where the Executive makes an application pursuant to <i>subsection (2)(c)</i>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_333">(i) at least 28 days' notice shall be given to the patient in question and/or, as appropriate, to the patient in question's next of kin, and</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_334">(ii) the patient in question and/or, as appropriate, the patient in question's next of kin, shall have the right to be heard at, and to make submissions to, the hearing of the Circuit Court in whose circuit the hospital or other institution, as the case may be, is situated,</p>
          <p eId="para_335">in respect of any such application.".</p>
          <p eId="para_336">The amendment concerns the fact that the patient has a right to know if the Executive is to take money from his or her private property account.  I recently received a query concerning a constituent's elderly mother in a nursing home.  She was told that money would be taken from her account to buy her a wheelchair or crutches.  Will the Minister of State clarify the position that obtains in such cases?  While I understand it may be necessary to take money from accounts every so often for various reasons, I believe it is not warranted for the purchase of an aid or appliance for a person who might only avail of it for a year or two and then leave it behind when he or she passes on.  I am concerned that section 9 of the Bill is open to abuse and it is very important that the Department monitor the system to ensure that, where the HSE is removing money from patients' accounts, it, the executive, has clear guidelines determining how much it should remove and the reason therefor.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Patients and their families should know exactly what they are paying for.  As far as I was aware, aids and appliances such as wheelchairs and crutches were exempt from the charges.  My amendment seeks that patients or, in the case of their being incapacitated, their next of kin will be given 28 days notice if money is to be taken from their accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">I second the amendment.  This is a rather grudging Bill.  None of us wanted to delay its passage because it has taken so long to introduce it and deal with the issue.  Those who have had money taken from them for years, not through the fault of the Minister of State but through that of various Ministers and the Department over the years, should be in a position to know what is happening and be given plenty of notice.  The Fine Gael amendment goes some way towards ensuring transparency regarding this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">It is very disappointing that so little money has been paid to people since we recognised it had been taken illegally.  The children of those who are no longer alive may not pursue claims but we have a great responsibility to ensure that those who are alive are informed properly and not treated like children.  It should be recognised that they have a right to know what is happening to the accounts.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_340">I am not in a position to accept the amendment because, in certain instances, it may prove difficult to identify and contact the next of kin of the individuals concerned.  As an alternative, the Bill stipulates in subsections 9(4)(<i>a</i>) and 9(4)(<i>b</i>) that an account holder will be informed in writing of the intentions of the HSE and that the HSE will place an advertisement in a national newspaper outlining that it intends to apply to court to expend moneys on behalf of patients residing in a certain institution.  It is open to any person who so wishes to make an application or submission to court in respect of any such application by the HSE.  The court, after considering the matter, will give a direction that the judge considers to be in the best interest of the patient.  Section 9(4) is deemed sufficient for this purpose.  Deputy Twomey tabled an amendment similar to that of the Senator but it was rejected following much consideration in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The HSE has already begun to examine the regulation of patient private property accounts and has established a working group in this regard to deal with their administration.  The main function of the group will be to ensure that the administration of the accounts meets all legal and regulatory requirements; operates in the best interest of patients in as responsive a way as is practical; takes appropriate account of the input of patients' relatives and friends in so far as this is practical; and is consistent with best practice in respect of financial controls, transparent accountability and corporate governance arrangements.  It should be efficient and represent value for money in the use of scarce staff and other HSE resources.  The HSE will be providing the guidelines, which will be ready pretty soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">We must be sensible about the scheme.  It is not possible to make any payments until the Bill is passed.  I appreciate the support we received from Members on all sides in progressing the legislation.  As a goodwill gesture, we made an <i>ex gratia</i> payment, of which just under 11,000 people availed.  It is not a matter of the Government wishing to delay payment because it is important that it put in place proper safeguards to ensure the money is given to those who deserve it and from whom it was wrongly taken.  I hope the announcement of the independent company involved in the administration of the scheme will be made later this week and that the whole process can be completed shortly thereafter.  We will see the repayments being made as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">This relates to the fund accruing on foot of the forfeiture of compensation due to one as a result of one's donating it to the HSE. Fine Gael is concerned that there is no time limit on the spending of this money. In reality, it is most unlikely that it would not be spent but we are specifying that it be spent within a three-year period. It should not be syphoned off for different projects over time. If part of a fund remains three or more years after its establishment, the Minister should make a determination on whether the fund should remain in existence. I propose a time limit on spending the money in the fund.</p>

          <p eId="para_349">I do not accept the amendment because it is the intention that not only those who are due repayment will be able to donate money to the fund but that others will also be able to do so. Any money donated to this fund will not be subject to capital acquisitions tax liability. Reports on the operation of the fund will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. The amendment as proposed would lead to practical difficulties if any money remained in the fund after a period of three years. This fund can accept moneys other than those donated through the repayment scheme and it would not be practical, therefore, to discontinue the fund if money remained in the fund at the end of the three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">It is envisaged that the fund will be administered by the Health Service Executive, which will include managing and assigning the moneys and accounting for and reporting on the fund. If it is not practicable to assign funds to a specific unit, funding should be ring-fenced for the same service in the same area. The HSE intends, as soon as possible, to establish a working group incorporating representatives of the service areas and finance to agree the criteria for selecting the service improvements that will benefit from the disbursement of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">We are setting up the fund but one would need a magic wand to predict the type of funds that will be made available. We are offering the opportunity to the people making a donation to the fund to express a wish as to the way they would like the money spent and we will try to facilitate that request as far as is possible.</p>

I thank also my colleagues, Senators Browne and Henry, for their contributions and the responsible manner in which they applied themselves to the passing of the Bill. It is important that a situation that has obtained for some 30 years and beyond would be corrected and this Bill seeks to do just that.</p>

I hope the people who had money taken from them illegally will be in their health to receive it although, regrettably, a number of them will not. I hope the money that goes to relatives will be put to some good use. As somebody who worked in psychiatric services for many years, I applaud the people who regularly visited their relatives and I exhort those who have not made it a practice to do so. Such visits are very important for the mental health and general well-being of these people, although I accept that in some cases relatives cannot do that. I appreciate the support and co-operation of my colleagues on the other side of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">I thank Senator Glynn for his comments and the Minister of State and his officials for their help and explanations during the debate on the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I welcome the passing of the Bill, although I have reservations about some aspects. We will all watch with keen interest the outcome of the court cases concerning those who were forced to go down the private route, who tried but were unable to get a bed in a public nursing home. In one respect I hope they are successful and in another I hope they are not because I am aware of the bill that will arise from that. I hope we have all learned from this experience. This issue has been going on for the past number of years. There was ambiguity over it and we finally have closure on it. It is vital, however, that the money is given to those who are owed it. The State is very quick to take money from anyone who claims an overpayment and it is only fitting that the State would pay back the money overcharged.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">It is vital that the Minister examines the issue of nursing home charges to ensure patients are fully aware of what they are liable for in that regard. When one gets a call from a nursing home to say it is taking money out of one's elderly relative's account, be it a father, mother, uncle or aunt, for a particular aid and appliance, one is in a vulnerable position because one must assume the nursing home is telling the truth. We do not want a scenario to arise where people must give back money they should not have been paid and then subsequently cases arise where money was taken out illegally on top of that. We must be careful to monitor that.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I hope this private company — we do not yet know its name — gets the work done within the two years. I still have not received a reply to my freedom of information request. I hope it will be cheaper in the long run, that it will get all the work done within the two year period and that we can all move on. I hope also we will not follow the line of the Army deafness claims, the redress board or other cases where budgets were overrun and timeframes extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the Bill. I would have preferred to see various changes in the Bill but at least it is a start. I hope the private company involved, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children will ensure that those who are owed money get it as soon as possible. Unfortunately, many of them are now deceased but those who are still alive can put it to good use.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_359">I congratulate the Minister of State on bringing the Bill through the House. I have many reservations about it; I am sure we will get many complaints and court cases will arise out of it. This process should be a lesson to us in that the Government and Departments can take money from people quickly and easily but it is very difficult for people to have that money repaid to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">This is not the only area where this happens. I had an experience in the not too distant past where, having been undertaxed for years, which I was unaware of, I was asked to repay thousands of euro. I was able to pay up but there are people who would not find it quite so easy to pay up. They would have spent what came in to them over the years and then find themselves in a very difficult position. I mentioned it to a woman who told me she had a similar experience and it has taken her 18 months to pay back a much smaller sum before she could get a pension. It is very difficult when money is demanded from one at short notice by a Department. I am not complaining about my case but it would have been nice if they had sent on the pension when they got the cheque from me months ago. These things happen, however, but this has been a very slow procedure for those who had money wrongly taken from them in the past. I hope, as Senator Browne said, that the firm chosen to get involved in the distribution of the money gets into action promptly and these people are repaid the money taken from them illegally as soon as possible. I congratulate the Minister of State and his officials on bringing the Bill through the House.</p>

Much of the work involved in drawing up the legislation and much of the consultation that had to take place before the legislation was drawn up goes on behind the scenes and people are not aware of the effort that goes into it but I thank them most sincerely for the hard work they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Government made a promise, following the Supreme Court decision, that we would repay the money and it was a question of trying to work out the best system to use. The main priority was that, apart from giving the commitment to repay the money plus interest, we would try to introduce a system that was a simple as possible and that people would feel happy making their application. It was clear that the whole application process should be straightforward and we would have as little red tape as possible. We set up a helpline which people could contact to put in their applications and register. We also had the <i>ex gratia</i> payments. We have many of the details on it, therefore, and we are anxious that the moneys be paid out as quickly as possible. We made a promise following the decision of the Supreme Court. I am delighted we are honouring that promise. The legislation has not gone through as quickly as we had hoped, but a number of issues had to be dealt with and it was important that we put in the appropriate safeguards to protect those who might not have the functional capacity to manage their financial affairs. I am quite happy that those safeguards are contained in the legislation. As the Bill is now passed, the legislative hurdle has been cleared. It is now a matter for the processing of the applications to commence. I hope the repayments will be made in the near future. I thank everyone for their assistance in making it all possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_366">Is cúis áthais dom bheith ar ais arís chun freastal ar an Teach iontach seo. This Bill amends the European Communities Act 1972, to allow certain parts of the treaty providing for the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union become part of the domestic law of the State as soon as Ireland ratifies the treaty. The Bill is in line with earlier amendments of the European Communities Act 1972, through which previous EU treaties were given domestic legal effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">The Bill enables Ireland to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into the EU family. Their entry will complete the fifth enlargement of the EU, which is the largest and most far-reaching yet. It began with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the popular overthrow of unrepresentative communist regimes in central and eastern Europe. The long and complex process these countries underwent in order to join the EU had none of the drama associated with their impressive transformation from totalitarianism to democracy. Nonetheless, EU membership is proving to be central to the success of the democracies of central and eastern Europe, whose economies are already benefiting from the opportunities of membership. They have pinned their national aspirations firmly to the EU mast.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Ireland has promoted this enlargement from the outset. In April 1990, the Irish Presidency, under the leadership of the then Taoiseach, the late Charles Haughey — go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam uasal dilís — hosted a special meeting of the European Council in Dublin to consider the peaceful revolutions in central and eastern Europe. Mr. Haughey was a staunch advocate of Ireland's participation in the European project. His successful running of the Presidency in 1990 earned him the admiration of his EU colleagues, in particular that of the then President of the EU Commission, Mr. Jacques Delors.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Under Mr. Haughey's chairmanship, the meeting in April 1990 agreed the first step towards EU membership for the emerging democracies of central and eastern Europe. Almost a decade and a half later, on 1 May 2004, the Irish Presidency oversaw the final step and welcomed ten of those countries into the EU. The same Irish Presidency also made significant progress on the accession negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania. These negotiations ended in success shortly afterwards and on 25 April 2005, the accession treaty for Bulgaria and Romania was signed by the acceding countries and the EU member states, including Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">To enter into force, the treaty must be ratified by all signatories by 31 December 2006. Bulgaria and Romania have already ratified the treaty, as have 17 member states. All other member states have confirmed that they will ratify it before the deadline. It is important that Ireland should also live up to its obligations towards the EU and its two incoming member states. The Bill before the Seanad today represents one of two necessary steps towards Ireland's ratification of the treaty. The other step was successfully completed on 24 May 2006, when the Dáil passed a motion approving the terms of the treaty. Once all the signatories have ratified the treaty, the path will be clear for Bulgaria and Romania to join the EU on 1 January 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">However, under the accession treaty, the European Union has the power to postpone the accession of one or both countries for a further year. This would happen should the Council, on the advice of the Commission, decide that either country is unable to fulfil the requirements of membership in 2007. The final decision on the date of accession will be made in the autumn, after the Commission updates the Council on the remaining issues affecting the accession of Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The Commission issued comprehensive monitoring reports on both countries on 16 May 2006. The reports commended Bulgaria and Romania on the transformation of their political and economic systems in line with EU membership requirements. On the downside, however, the reports also identified problem areas in both countries. There is still time for both countries to resolve these inadequacies. Provided this is done, the Commission has stated that both Bulgaria and Romania would be able to join the EU on 1 January 2007. Furthermore, the accession treaty provides for action to be taken in sensitive areas, even after accession, in order to protect the proper functioning of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I welcome the Commission's conclusion that the date of 1 January 2007 remains feasible. I am sure that both Bulgaria and Romania will do everything they can to meet the criteria for accession on that date. While we await final confirmation of the actual date, we should remember that the substantive issue of accession by both countries is not at stake. Ireland and all the other member states have already agreed to accept Romania and Bulgaria into the European Union. Since last year, both countries have been participating in almost all EU activities and making a valued contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">We should not underestimate the effort required by both countries to meet the criteria for EU membership. In its May report, the Commission explicitly acknowledged their considerable achievements so far. Both countries have significantly reduced the number of areas that need to be addressed before accession. Bulgaria has reduced the number of "red flag" issues from 16 to six while Romania has reduced the number from 14 to four.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Some problem areas are common to both countries, especially putting in place the necessary arrangements for the disbursement of EU funds. In the agricultural area, both countries need to set up a proper, integrated administration and control system. There is a need to build up rendering, collection and treatment facilities. While both countries need to sustain their efforts in reforming the judiciary and fighting corruption, Bulgaria has been singled out as needing to devote urgent attention to this area. According to the Commission, Bulgaria needs to show tangible results in investigating and prosecuting organised crime networks, in the more efficient and systematic implementation of laws for the fight against fraud and corruption, and in intensified enforcement of anti-money laundering provisions. Both countries also need to step up their efforts to combat human trafficking.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">While our focus at this stage is necessarily on what remains to be done, we should not forget the remarkable progress Bulgaria and Romania have already achieved. Within a matter of years they have wiped out decades of economic stagnation and totalitarian oppression and created functioning democracies and market economies. They took on the challenge of meeting the exacting membership requirements of the EU and made the best use of available resources to implement the necessary reforms. The speed and the depth of their progress towards EU membership is a credit to the determination and perseverance of the peoples of Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Ireland will continue to support both Romania and Bulgaria with their preparations for EU membership. In an EU context, we were involved in approving an increase in the amount of EU financial assistance to Bulgaria by an average of 30% in the period 2004-06. During that time, Bulgaria received around €500 million per year, representing close to 2% of its GDP. The total volume of pre-accession assistance available to Romania is substantial and increasing, totalling around €952 million in 2005. This represents a very important financial resource for Romania, comprising around 1.4% of its GDP. Approximately €1.2 billion will be allocated to Romania in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">It is more than 30 years since we joined the EU and we have sought to share with our future EU partners the reservoir of knowledge and experience built up over the course of those years in this country. To this end, Irish officials have advised their counterparts in the acceding countries on the optimum use of Structural and Cohesion Funds. Ireland's bilateral assistance programme to the accession countries, now in its fifth year, has allocated €1.49 million this year for training and assistance, some of which has been to the benefit of Bulgaria and Romania. This support was timely and of real benefit to those countries. This investment, however, has also been to Ireland's gain. It is important in nurturing new contacts within those countries, which will help deepen our engagement with them as we work together in future as full members of the enlarged European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Our bilateral relationship with Romania and Bulgaria has flourished as both countries have advanced towards EU membership. New embassies were opened in Sofia and Bucharest last year and bilateral trade with both has grown impressively. For example, trade between Ireland and Romania increased from less than €5 million in 1992 to more than €175 million last year. Trade between Ireland with Bulgaria has meanwhile multiplied more than eight times since 1994. Last year alone, trade with Romania increased by 75% while that with Bulgaria showed an 11% increase. The number of Irish tourists travelling to Bulgaria doubled in 2005 and that trend is set to continue. It is obvious that as long as our economy continues to grow and the European Union continues to expand, the capacity for Irish trade and economic growth to increase on a consistent annual basis is sustainable and advantageous for us into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The figures clearly show that we have made good strides in developing economic ties with Bulgaria and Romania, but there is scope for further advances in that direction. I fully expect the economic opportunities to increase once these two countries attain full EU membership. I am confident that our trade and business interests in both countries will advance further within an EU framework. There is every reason to believe that Ireland will continue to prosper in a European Union of 27 member states in the same way as we have done with each succeeding EU accession, including the most recent enlargement in May 2004 when ten new countries joined the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Further testimony to the strength and resilience of the Irish economy is the fact that we were one of only three countries that fully opened up our labour market to the EU-10 at the time of their accession. We have welcomed the subsequent decision by four more member states to follow the lead set by Ireland, Sweden and the UK and allow free movement of workers as of 1 May 2006. We hope that other member states will soon feel able to do the same. We believe it is politically and morally responsible for them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Following our decision to allow the free movement of workers, the number of EU-10 nationals that took up employment in Ireland rose to an estimated 2% of our workforce according to the EUROSTAT labour force survey and to around 3% according to the Central Statistics Office. The variation in these two figures can be accounted for by their use of different methodologies. A rise of such proportions was especially noticeable in a country like Ireland where net immigration is such a recent phenomenon and a total change for this country. However, the overall proportion of foreign nationals in our workforce is in line with that of other EU countries — Ireland has merely achieved the same level in a shorter time. Most important, we should remember that this inward migration has helped to boost employment in our economy. We continue to enjoy historically low levels of unemployment throughout thecountry.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The flow of workers from the EU-10 has helped Ireland sustain our strong growth rates. It has done so by alleviating our shortage of skilled and unskilled labour across a wide range of sectors, among them, information and communications technologies, health care, construction, hospitality and engineering. This is borne out by the European Commission's findings that Ireland, Sweden and the UK all experienced better employment performance than those member states that maintained labour restrictions. The Commission also concluded that workers tend to move to a country because there are job vacancies there and not simply because they do not need a work permit. In other words, migration within the EU is demand driven and workers will not move unless there is an employment opportunity for them and economic wherewithal available to them. It is only then that they will consider moving.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I have made it clear in earlier Oireachtas debates on this legislation that while Ireland decided in favour of the free movement of workers in 2004, this does not prejudge our decision in regard to Bulgarian and Romanian workers after their countries' accession to the European Union. This decision will be made closer to the date of accession. It will take into account all relevant considerations, among them the prevailing labour market trends and the intentions of other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">On 31 May the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment brought forward an amendment to the Employment Permits Bill 2005. This is an enabling provision to permit the Minister to exercise one of three options with regard to labour market access for Bulgarian and Romanian workers. These three options are as follows: to grant these nationals access to the labour market without the need to acquire an employment permit; to grant permits without a labour market test on foot of a job offer; or to continue to require nationals of these states to obtain employment permits from the date of accession.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">It is easy to fall into the trap of zero-sum thinking when we consider the complexities of economic growth. On a very basic level, it seems logical that if one country gains, another must lose out. However, part of the beauty and success of the European project is that it has shown that economic benefit can be widely and consistently spread on a continuous basis. European integration has not created any losers. It has been a win-win situation for member states and for Europe as a whole, which has enjoyed an unrivalled period of peace and prosperity during the 50 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome in 1957.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Ireland could be a textbook case in how enlargement can benefit old and new member states. When we joined the then European Economic Community in 1973 we were the poorest Community country. That is a strong statement and one on which we should all focus. Few would disagree that our membership of the then European Economic Community, later the European Union, was essential to our subsequent transformation into a successful modern European economy. The extent of our economic success is such that we will soon complete the transition from net beneficiary to net contributor to the EU budget. It is our hope and belief that EU membership will act in a like manner for Bulgaria and Romania in their future development.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The Irish example is not unique. Last month, the European Commission presented a paper to the European Council which detailed how all member states have benefited from the last enlargement. The paper shows how the stability provided by accession has helped multiply trade and investment between the EU-15 and the EU-10, creating a win-win situation for all involved. Companies enjoy more investment possibilities, while consumers benefit from more choices and greater opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The European Commission's paper also addressed the fear commonly held in the EU-15 that companies would choose to relocate to the new member states in search of cheaper labour. The European Commission concluded, however, that this kind of job displacement in the EU-15 was very insignificant. Moreover, in many instances outsourcing part of their business to a new member state helped a company in one of the EU-15 to strengthen its competitive edge and subsequently take on more workers. Overall, the paper shows that the net effect of the most recent enlargement is a stronger and more dynamic European economy. Together, the EU-25 are better equipped to face stiffening global competition, not least from the rapidly growing economies of Asia.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The benefits of enlargement have not been confined to the economic domain. EU enlargement has created a politically secure and united Europe that benefits its entire citizenry. Europe has become a much better place in which to live than it could ever have been during the Cold War when much of the Continent lived under the shadow of communism or military dictatorship. This experience blighted the lives of two European generations. While Europe has recently experienced political upheaval in the Balkans, the EU is now playing a significant role in promoting peace and stability there. In that region we can see how the incentive of EU membership can be a driving force for greater peace and security.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">It is easy nowadays to forget the fears and uncertainties we faced when we joined the European Union more than 30 years ago. Success dulls the memory and it can make past decisions seem more simple and straightforward than they actually were. Similarly, we tend to gloss over the difficulties with which the EU has had to contend in past times.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We should not allow a rose-tinted view of past EU achievements to stop us from putting current problems and setbacks into their proper perspective. The EU has been a success and remains essential for Europe's future. No one has any incentive for turning the clock back. We cannot do that and should never try to do so. Nevertheless, the EU's future evolution cannot be taken for granted. There is work to be done in determining the EU's future course.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Some naysayers took great delight in writing off the European Union last year. First, there was the rejection of the EU constitution in France and the Netherlands and then the June European Council failed to agree on the European Union's budget for 2007-13. The fifth enlargement of the EU, it was argued, had been misguided, and it was now bringing down the whole of the EU. However, one year later we can see that such dire predictions were premature. Last December, the European Council agreed a budgetary package amounting to over €860 billion over a seven-year period, showing that the enlarged Union has the budgetary resources to support its key policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">There are testing times ahead for the European Union. The challenges include many that are not confined to Europe, such as the threat of terrorism, the energy crisis and the growing economic power of China and India. It would be wrong to make a casual link between these issues and EU enlargement. They are separate issues with which we must contend, irrespective of the direction in which our enlargement policy takes us.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">It is inevitable that we will turn our attention to outstanding commitments as we near completion of the fifth enlargement, the merits of which some Europeans understandably question. The fifth enlargement has been a considerable undertaking and we are seeing it through to its successful completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">A key factor in the overall success of the EU-10 accession was the meticulous preparation made before the accession date. Similarly, any future decisions on EU enlargement will require a comprehensive understanding of all the implications. The public must be persuaded that any future expansion of membership will bring with it the promise of a further strengthening of the European Union and its capacity to deliver real benefits to all the citizens of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The EU treaty states that any European country that respects the values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law may apply for EU membership. This does not mean that all European countries will apply or that their applications will be automatically accepted if they do so. We have started accession negotiations with Croatia. The other countries of the western Balkans have the perspective of eventual EU membership although this is still a long way off. Negotiations are also under way with Turkey, although it may take a decade or more for it to meet all the criteria for EU membership. The decision to offer a membership perspective to any other European country must be taken unanimously by all member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Another factor bearing on the Union's enlargement strategy is the institutional capability of the Union to handle further expansion. The European Union started out with six members. A Union with more than four times the original membership would need to undergo structural change to continue to function effectively. To achieve this the governments of the member states agreed the EU constitution after comprehensive negotiations. The Government's position is that the provisions of the EU constitution remain the best option for the Union as it addresses the challenges of the future including further enlargement. From a pragmatic point of view, we see no alternative structure that would command greater support from the EU member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">For now our priority is to complete the fifth enlargement of the Union and to welcome Bulgaria and Romania into it. We have a responsibility to ratify the accession treaty by the end of this year. This deadline applies regardless of whether the date of accession is 1 January 2007 or a year later. The Bill before the House today enables Ireland to ratify the treaty and will help pave the way for a Union of 27 members. Bulgaria and Romania have made remarkable progress towards full EU membership. Ireland looks forward to welcoming them as full partners in the Union. We are confident that both countries will benefit from membership and will contribute to the Union as Ireland has done over the past 33 years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_204">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_400">I welcome the Minister of State to the House, and the Bill he brings for our approval. In summary, the Minister of State said that the greatest evidence for this Bill is that to date the enlargement of the European Union has been a win-win situation, for the countries joining the Union and for those such as Ireland which are already members. The move to allow Bulgaria and Romania in is a positive step forward which will benefit every citizen of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Minister of State said that we tend to forget what Ireland and Europe were like in 1973 when Ireland joined the then European Economic Community. When I joined this House in 1987, Europe was very different from what it is now. Bulgaria and Romania were tightly sealed satellite states of the old Soviet Union. Bulgaria was one of the more cold and frightening members of the Soviet bloc, which we associated with KGB espionage, double agents and infiltration of Western countries. Romania was a somewhat freer country within the old Soviet bloc but had no democratic structures and was beholden to Moscow. It appeared to have very little future to offer its citizens. That changed in the autumn and winter of 1989. One of the great television images of that time was the upheaval in Romania, the overthrow of the Communist Party dictatorship there, and the brutal and swift end meted out to those leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">We must look to the future. Every citizen of Bulgaria and Romania is eagerly looking forward to joining the larger European family because the European Union is the biggest political success story of the past 100 years. Only the integration of the United States can match the European Union's economic and political success. I look forward to these two extra countries joining the club and benefiting from the European project as we will benefit from their membership.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Minister outlined certain issues that the Bulgarian and Romanian administrations need to address before being allowed to join the Union. There must be strict rules and guidelines for accession. No matter how strongly we wish them to join, the internal politics and economics in those countries must reach a certain standard before they can join. Their governments need to assure us that they will tackle the problems with certain criminal elements there domestically, and in conjunction with their future European partners. We need further evidence that democratic institutions have bedded down locally and nationally in those two countries which come from a tradition of centralised dictatorship where democracy cannot flower overnight. After 15 or 16 years of democratic progress in the old Soviet central and eastern Europe we must try to see that democratic structures are well established there.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">We also need further reassurance that all impediments to market economies in Bulgaria and Romania are dealt with and that fully fledged market economies are in place. The market economy structure has been the linchpin of the political, economic and social development of the European Union of families. We must also ensure that the two countries will show the ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. No doubt they will aspire to and meet those criteria; the sooner the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Minister of State is aware we have had numerous debates in this House over the past two or three years on the future enlargement policy of the European Union. A significant minority of people are concerned about the pace of enlargement and wonder where it will end. They wonder how far east we can go in building the EU. I hope we will continue to be ambitious and reach out to try to spread the politics of democracy, social inclusion and economic freedom that the Union is all about. I agree with the Minister of State that as the Union expands we must ensure the structures are in place to allow it to operate fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I acknowledge disappointment that the European constitution has not proceeded as we would have wished. Much work was done in the House and by the Government internationally to try and put the constitution in place. However, the referendum results in a number of countries appear to have put the "slow" sign on the project. We must recognise, however, that the European constitution has been ratified in a number of countries. In the majority of countries where a decision needed to be taken, a decision was taken in favour of it. I hope we continue to push forward the European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Are we still going through the famous period of reflection whereby we are supposed to reflect on where we are going and on how and when we will get there? It has been in place for some time and we need to mark progress and examine the current state of play. Too much has been invested in the concept of the new constitution for Europe to allow the issue stay on the backburner. If the two new countries are to join and there is to be further expansion, we need a newer type of political and administrative structure to run the show. The European constitution was charting the way forward in that regard and it is, therefore, important that we keep that issue at the core of our debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">There was almost unanimous agreement in the House and broad political agreement in the country in favour of a European constitution. That support needs to be reiterated and we need to declare our ongoing desire for progress on the issue. The enlargement of the Union from 15 to 25 countries is not the end of the road as far as project Europe is concerned and nor should the enlargement from 25 to 27 be the end. The future of a number of other countries will be best secured through membership of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The Minister of State spoke about a win-win situation. From the economic and political perspective, the bigger the club, the better we all succeed. The statistics on employment levels in the Minister of State's contribution knock on the head the argument made by some small-minded people that the flow of immigrant workers into Ireland is bad for the country. Nothing could be further from the truth. These people are part of the new Ireland. They are helping to build our economy and they contribute in various sectors and industries. Without them our economic growth would not be as strong.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The more we enlarge the European Union and the European economic club, the better for all of us and that is the reason I welcome this legislation. I hope that at the earliest possible date, Bulgaria and Romania will be deemed to have matched the necessary criteria. The criteria may be difficult, but that is as it should be. The two countries are moving in the right direction and offer a beacon of hope to other countries considering accession to the Union. I welcome the legislation and look forward to seeing Bulgaria and Romania as part of the Union. It is tremendous that countries that were under the cosh of the Soviet empire for so long and whose people could see no future for themselves can now move forward with us. They are moving towards a more open, democratic and fair society. I look forward to the day they join the Union. Their accession will be good for Ireland, Romania, Bulgaria and all of Europe.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_205">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_411">I welcome the Minister of State, a committed European, who comes, like myself, from a part of the country that has benefited greatly from European subsidies and which now lives under a new dispensation. It would be no harm to put in a little plug for the BMW region here. The Government is vigorously defending its record against naysayers who suggest the region is losing out, but those of us who come from the area will continue to monitor progress and ensure we get our fair share.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">To present a scenario, I feel a little like a client in his dealings with a representative of the oldest profession in the world in that the substantive issue has already been agreed and the only haggle is over the price. In terms of this legislation we have essentially been presented with a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Government has taken a decision in line with several other member states that it will support the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, the Dáil has already approved this legislation and it is now our turn. However, this is also an opportunity for Members of this House to express their opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I do not totally share the rosy picture presented, although it was tempered with realism by the Minister of State. Listening to my friend and colleague, Senator Bradford, I was beginning to think enlargement of the European Union is the greatest thing since the sliced pan, but it raises serious issues and problems that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Minister of State gave a number of reasons as to why we should support the legislation. He said, "The public will have to be persuaded that any future expansion of membership will bring with it the promise of a further strengthening of the EU and of its capacity to deliver real benefits to European citizens". This statement sums up the situation because it describes exactly the deliberations taking place whenever the people of Europe discuss its future. This situation was articulated and reflected not only in the results of the Dutch and French referenda on the constitutional treaty but in the fact that member states — to respond in a limited degree to Senator Bradford's query about the period of reflection — cannot get together on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">They know there is a real problem with regard to the treaty. The most recent statement to emerge from the Council of Ministers is to the effect that they want to ditch the term "constitutional treaty". It would be right to ditch it because it sold a particular perception of Europe that scared people. It scared them into thinking some Big Brother was operating in Brussels and Strasbourg who would make their decisions for them. Despite the best efforts of the political elite in Europe — Commissioners, Members of the European Parliament, national governments and Members of Parliaments in member states — the general public does not seem to be convinced the route the EU has taken and the manner in which it has done so, especially with enlargement, will bring real benefits. I will not question in any way the European Commission's statistics, which have been cited by the Minister of State. The only response I have to the statistics is "Well they would say that, wouldn't they?"</p>
          <p eId="para_416">It seems to me that those who want to expand the EU for ever and a day are engaging in a big sell. That is fine from an economic perspective, as it is absolutely clear that this country is benefitting. However, it is salutary to reflect on the Taoiseach's reminder, which was reiterated by the Minister of State in this House today, that the Government has not yet taken a decision on whether it will give the same <i>carte blanche</i> to workers from Bulgaria and Romania, which are about to accede to the EU, as it has already given to workers from the ten countries which were involved in the 2004 enlargement.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The average percentage of the population of this country that comprises citizens of the enlargement states is higher than in any other country. Approximately 9% of the working population of Ireland is from those countries, which is an extraordinarily high figure. It is quite possible that the extent of such immigration will start to level off, like waves lapping against the coastline as the tide changes. The level of such arrivals will recede as soon as other EU member states start to change their labour policies, which is something that the Minister has strenuously and robustly demanded at meetings of the Council of Ministers. The Government's stated policy is to try to get other countries on board in this regard. I strongly supported the Government's original decision to give workers from the accession states unfettered access to our labour markets. The benefits of that decision, which was also taken by the Governments in the UK and Sweden, are there for all to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">We are talking about an economy and about economic issues, but a social issue that is presenting real challenges has not yet been addressed. The challenges in question have to be faced by Irish society, which is changing so dramatically that we are finding it hard to take a breath and to keep pace, and also across Europe. I have not heard anything from the Commission or any other part of the EU concept that helps to address these issues. This matter does not just relate to the demographic changes which are taking place in Ireland, or to the large number of foreign nationals who are working here. It also relates to social upheaval in France, for example, which is a serious issue, and to issues which are affecting the EU, such as immigration and the threat of terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">I compliment the Minister of State on his speech, which pushed all the buttons. I do not think anything was left out of his presentation, although it seemed to me that he glossed over some of the challenges and difficulties we face. He accentuated some of the more positive aspects of this matter, although it is in our nature as politicians to do so. I would like to think we could have an ongoing debate about some other issues. It is not just a question of "the economy, stupid" — it is also a question of the type of society that the people of this country want. We continue to have a sovereign right to make decisions of that nature, although it is being eroded on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">If other EU member states rapidly adopt the labour policies which have been adopted by Ireland, the UK and Sweden, we might be able to have a better period of adjustment. Polish people living in Warsaw, Krakow or Poznan will not want to travel halfway across Europe to Ireland if they can get jobs on their doorstep in Germany. The Germans understand that, which is why they have closed their borders for seven years. There may be a levelling out in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I accept that the arrival of workers from the accession states has been good for this country. The most recent report on the alleged displacement of Irish workers, to which the Minister of State referred, claimed that the level of such displacement has been minimal. However, my anecdotal experience, which is shared by many people from other parts of the country, is that some displacement of Irish workers has taken place. I know of qualified Irish professionals in the various crafts who have left this country to go to work in England. While there is anecdotal evidence of that nature, the statistics indicate that everything is hunky-dory, everything is fine, the country is booming and there are no problems with our rate of economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I do not want to sound like a prophet of doom. I reiterate my earlier comment that I recognise and acknowledge the immense benefits which were brought to this country by the most recent enlargement of the EU. However, I am seriously concerned about Bulgaria and Romania. This matter has been discussed by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, and Senator Bradford. I am sure other speakers will do the same. There is a growing gap between the opinions of the ruling EU elite — the European Commission and the European Parliament — and everybody else in this regard. Those who are in favour of further enlargement argue that everything is fine and everything will be wonderful. There is concern across Europe about the accelerated rate of EU enlargement.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">There is political instability in Bulgaria, whether we like it or not. Not only have there been inconclusive election results, but the Government that is currently in place could fall at any time. That instability has allowed criminal elements to influence the commercial and political life of Bulgaria. Irish investors who are buying property in Bulgaria off the plans should take note of my comments in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Much greater progress has been made in Romania. I have been one of the most bitter critics of Romania, which I have had the pleasure of visiting on four or five occasions as a member of the Council of Europe. I have observed the quite traumatic changes which have taken place there. Senator Bradford rightly said that Romania was a totalitarian and authoritarian dictatorship that was ruled with an iron fist by Ceaucescu. When he was done away with by his own political elite in 1989, clones of him ran the country for the next ten or 12 years. There was very little fundamental change.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">My experience of Romania in the early part of this century was that nothing had changed in rural areas, whatever about Bucharest. A new President has taken power in recent years, following a change of Government and political dynamic, which has focused the minds of the Romanian political elite, especially in its relationship with the EU and the enlargement commission. Romania is going a long way towards addressing many of the fundamental issues. It has yet to deal with the fundamental question of how it intends to put in place structures to distribute agricultural subsidies. Those of us who know about the importance of such subsidies to the Irish economy over many decades consider that the fact that the great bulk of the Romanian economy continues to be based on agriculture is a fundamental problem that has not been satisfactorily addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">I spoke earlier about society. I do not want to give the impression that I am somehow being parochial in my views. People who say that nationalism is "the last refuge of a scoundrel" should try telling that to those attending the World Cup who are flying their flags and supporting their countries. If football fans are allowed to demonstrate a sense of patriotism and nationalism and be proud of who they are, I do not see why we should apologise for doing likewise. Of course we should embrace our multicultural society, but I would not like this country's Irishness to be somehow diluted in a mad rush towards the Holy Grail of economic success. Everything should not be about money.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I understand why we are scared that we will go back to what we were less than a generation ago. We want to ensure that what we have, we hold, and that we progress further, but there is a price to be paid. I would like the Government to consider the manner in which we manage our economy and our society as a whole in light of the new environment in which we find ourselves. It is not just an issue for the Government — society in general should see it as a challenge rather than as a disadvantage. We are still trying to grapple with the dramatic changes which have taken place over the last seven or eight years.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I will conclude by speaking about my recent visit to the Hague. A Dutch historian told me that in the 16th century, when approximately 175,000 people were living in Amsterdam, over 300 artists with patrons were flourishing there. Holland, which is one of the regions of the present-day Netherlands, was one of the most affluent parts of Europe at the time. It had a developed infrastructure, including a water and sewerage scheme and a built environment, more than 300 years ago. We are trying to achieve within ten years what it has taken the Netherlands 300 years to achieve. That puts the challenge faced by society, as it tries to come to terms with all these realities, into perspective for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I do not suggest that we should not continue the enlargement process by embracing and welcoming countries which want to gain membership of the European Union. I am totally supportive of that process, in principle, but I do not want us to lose sight of the fact that society is changing rapidly. It is not just about increasing growth rates and keeping unemployment levels down. It is about the wider question of what kind of society we want within the European Union family.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_206">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_430">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House and I also welcome the European Communities (Amendment) Bill 2006. I am glad the Minister of State mentioned the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who died yesterday. It is right that he acknowledged the late Mr. Haughey's contribution to the European project and his enthusiasm for it because Mr. Haughey put a huge effort into the meeting of the Council of Europe that took place in 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">We are all enthusiastic about the European project. While Senator Mooney is quite right to warn about the difficulties we face, I still believe that people in Ireland want to go forward. In the past 15 years, one of the best things to have happened to Ireland has been the enormous decrease in unemployment. The steps taken by the Government, in common with the Swedish and British Governments to allow the free movement of workers on the accession of the ten countries from the Baltic and eastern Europe, has not caused any further trouble with regard to employment. The unemployment rate has remained virtually the same, and those workers have been of great benefit to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">I am glad the Minister of State also noted that the benefits of being within Europe have not simply been economic. When one thinks of Europe this time 70 years ago and recalls what was happening in Germany, it is incredibly important that it is, as the Minister of State noted, politically secure and united. The European Union has been enormously beneficial for Ireland, in terms of the establishment of a social and psychological framework of such dimensions that I cannot envisage it going backwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Moreover, the social problems which have arisen in some other member states of the European Union have not been due to migration of workers within the Union. In general, such problems appear to have arisen in respect of non-EU workers and immigrants in some specific regions, particularly if such people have been ghettoised. However, there are non-EU workers in some parts of Ireland. Some, such as the Brazilian meat workers in Gort, are concentrated in particular locations. They have successfully integrated and Members will have taken pride in listening to them talk about the Brazilian team in a recent radio broadcast. Hence, Irish people should be as optimistic as possible because if one asserts that a particular matter will become a problem, it will do so rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">To date, the instincts of all Governments with regard to the European Union have been correct. On the arrival of Romanian and Bulgarian workers, Ireland should continue in the manner in which it has treated workers heretofore. While I realise this issue must be examined closer to the date of accession, I hope the Irish economy will be performing just as well then as it is at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">However, I ask the Minister of State to reconsider the exclusion of such workers from social welfare entitlements for two years. Apparently, some problems are being encountered and a small number have ended up homeless. Members will not wish to see such a development. They may recall an appalling situation involving a young Ukrainian woman in Northern Ireland last winter who, while sleeping out of doors, contracted such severe frostbite that she lost her feet. I would be grateful if the Minister of State were to ask the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to re-examine the situation regarding social welfare entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Most people who have come to Ireland from the Baltic states and eastern Europe are at work. One cannot enter a shop in Dublin without encountering Poles, Latvians or Lithuanians, all of whom make a contribution to society. I feel rather sorry for the Baltic states in particular with regard to the brain drain from those countries. Earlier this year, I visited Latvia where there is some dismay that it is losing people in their 20s in particular, many of whom are well qualified. They are just the sort of people who would come here, form relationships with Irish people and settle here. I was told that some villages and towns in Latvia have lost a considerable number of people to Ireland in particular, as well as to Sweden. This has caused them the kind of distress which used to be found here when so many of our young people went to the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">It would be nice if some of the young people in question came here, improved their potential for careers in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and so forth, and returned. Members must hope there will be good economic progress in those countries in order that such people will not always be obliged to come to Ireland to improve their situation and that they will be able to return to their countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Today, the House is addressing the issue of the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria. In recent times, both countries have experienced terrible troubles. I visited Romania when Ceaucescu was in charge and it was utterly appalling. Women suffered dreadfully and all were obliged, if possible, to produce approximately five children. The maternal mortality rate was shocking and, as a hangover from those times, Romania's perinatal mortality rate is still the worst in Europe. As Members know only too well, enormous numbers of children were left in orphanages by married couple who could not afford to bring them up. The parents were obliged to have the children, who ended up in orphanages. It was a most pathetic situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">However, the former kingdom of Romania was once very prosperous. Romanians are bitter about what they feel was the theft of many of their assets by the Soviet Union. One hopes the situation will improve again. I visited Romania subsequently and, like Senator Mooney, I formed the impression that matters were improving dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">In ancient times, Bulgaria was the seat of the ancient kingdom of Thrace, which rivalled Greece with its culture and wealth. It is important that Members should remember its background. I am sure that by the time Bulgaria enters the Union, it will have made the requisite efforts in respect of organised crime which apparently is still a serious problem there. Recently, I was depressed to hear a Bulgarian archaeologist talking about how the legislation regarding looting from ancient historic sites in Bulgaria is so cumbersome and slow, that looters always get to such sites before the archaeologists. Moreover, the gold of Thrace is coming onto the international market at a most unacceptable rate, given that one is not allowed to export such wonderful items of heritage from the country at present. This is an important issue which must be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">People from both countries already work in Ireland, some of whom are professionals. One such person, who is a colleague of mine in the Rotunda Hospital, has given great service to this State in a medical capacity for many years. Members must remember that musicians in orchestras, choirs and so forth have also made an important contribution to this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The Minister of State noted that the Government will consider the situation regarding the freedom of movement of workers closer to the date of accession, which seems reasonable. However, it is important that employers who bring people to Ireland with work permits should try to make more of an effort to ensure that such workers learn English. Some people get jobs in which they learn very little English, which keeps them isolated. This should be taken on board by places of employment. Some hospitals have tried to do so in respect of nurses from abroad who are filling in the serious nursing shortage. They try to guarantee that such nurses get English classes, to ensure they do not simply speak English at a basic level but can also address the concerns of patients and their relatives. It is important for them to make progress in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The situation for older women coming to this country from abroad who do not work outside the home can also be difficult. Decades ago, when I worked in America, I recall encountering Hungarian and Polish women who had been in the country for decades and who still could not speak English. If this happens here, we could also have women in the home who are unable to become part of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">At the end of his speech, the Minister of State mentioned that there was consternation last year on foot of the refusal of two countries to ratify the proposed European constitution. I was not surprised, as it was so complicated. It was quite difficult to understand, even though much of it was discussed in this House. I will refer to the French vote in particular. One man in Paris told me that taxi drivers had not been allowed an increase in fares in February last year, which was very important. Moreover, while driving across France at the time, I saw a big placard propped up against a bale of hay in a field which read, "<i>Votez non à l’EU de Tony Blair</i>”. Can the Minister work that out? I could not. The French have their own reasons for voting no. It is amazing how we weathered it. It was predicted that terrible confusion would strike the EU but everything has gone on smoothly and I am sure we will address these issues, as the Minister said, in the future. I wish him luck with this legislation, which will benefit the Irish, Bulgarians, Romanians and the EU.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_207">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_445">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. I welcome his speech because, while the Bill is straightforward and brief, significant questions are associated with it. To his credit the Minister has this afternoon addressed some of those wider questions on the European project, its achievements and its direction. It is appropriate for us to consider enlargement, the adoption of the constitutional treaty and the entire EU project in the context of this Bill. The Bill is important and I welcome it. Ireland needs to ratify it for treaty purposes. I welcome the prospect of the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU. It will be of benefit, as has been the accession of the most recent member states. I and my party, the Progressive Democrats, have always been enthusiasts of the European project, although, in common with many, not uncritical of it. Our country's interests are best served by taking a full and constructive role in the EU and its institutions. In the past it has been too much of a one-way street. In the early days we looked to what the EU could give us without thinking about what we could give back or our responsibilities regarding the assistance we received. That has changed for the better. Ireland's historical orientation since we joined the EU has been to be full and constructive members. The Minister referred to the role of the late former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, in 1990. There have been examples where the country, in its Presidency, has played a key role in the enlargement of the Community and progressing accession of the new member states. There have been one or two logjams when, but for the role of Irish Governments and officials involved in the EU Presidencies, the project would not have proceeded with the speed it did. That must be recognised.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">My party has always resolved to work to ensure Ireland is an active and enthusiastic contributor to the development of EU policies and democratic structures. The country has played its part with positive benefits both for us and the EU. Non-member states have observed the experience of Ireland and other states and have been keen to join up. Our recent economic success has been an inspiration to newer member states. I was in Estonia recently with members of the Committee on European Affairs and they were enthused and interested, as were the people of the Czech Republic, at how Ireland had benefited so much from the EU. I was in Tallinn, Estonia, on 9 September 2001 and it is extraordinary to see the transformation of that country in the short period since then. It is much more self-confident and open and the fabric of the country has improved in terms of housing and public buildings. It is obvious that money has gone into the country and it has been beneficial.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Apart from some of the benefits the Minister of State mentioned, enlargement benefits Ireland as a trading country and one of the most open economies in the world by providing a bigger market for our products. Enlargement has been about trade, among other matters such as democracy. Ireland has been at the centre of the European project since our accession in 1973, and especially since the fall of communism, which has been referred to. These events have precipitated the scenario where Romania and Bulgaria, 25 years later, are approaching accession to the EU. We have played a significant role in the enlargement process, as I stated earlier when I referred to what took place in 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The recent Irish Presidency accepted ten new member states and we must remain open to enlargement. The benefits, such as trade, have accrued and stability, which has been referred to, has also been important. The EU was built from the ruins of Second World War Europe, from which Ireland was removed. From that catastrophe came the determination embodied in people such as Robert Schumann, Paul-Henri Spaak, Konrad Adenauer and Jean Monet to ensure it could not happen again. It is an extraordinary achievement that after centuries of conflict between European states we have come to the point of such stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The Minister has stated that the accession of neither country is in doubt and the question is when rather than if. He mentioned some of the red-flag issues, and it is encouraging to see that they are reducing. There is a perception that accession is a casual process and that membership is automatic but nothing could be further from the truth. Countries must overcome many hurdles before becoming members. There are criteria on democratic structures, respect for human rights and rule of law among others. There is also the question of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, a large body of work to which the applicant countries must accede before they can become members. It is not a casual decision made by the leader of a country with the agreement of the people. The European Council will decide, based on the recommendation from the European Commission, which in turn will base its findings on the comprehensive monitoring reports of Bulgaria and Romania, whether the countries are ready for accession and when it should take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">The question of workers has been raised and no decision has been made on Bulgarian and Romanian workers having access to this country on accession. There was a positive response in Estonia, the Czech Republic and elsewhere when Ireland decided to take workers from day one. Selfish interests were involved. The Irish economy needed workers. Senator Mooney was incorrect to indicate that we have been overrun by immigrants. The numbers are modest by European standards in proportionate terms. The speed with which it has happened has caused some difficulties. It would be ironic and wrong if, given our experience of building some of the great countries such as the US, we could not understand that when we are successful, people want to come here and contribute to our success. They should be embraced and their culture, religion and ethnicity should be accepted and accommodated in the country. That is the lesson from France. The problem was not that the workers came, but that there was no attempt to integrate them into the country and the ghettos were allowed to develop to the north of Paris and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I am glad Romania and Bulgaria are continuing their democratic and economic transformation and we have been alerted to the intention to focus on some important areas where further reform is required. That cannot be stressed enough. The EU has to deal comprehensively with citizens' concerns. That is the lesson from the constitutional treaty and enlargement and in that respect I agree with Senator Mooney, that in the past there has not been enough regard for the concerns of the citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">There are serious concerns regarding crime and contract killings in Bulgaria. There have been media reports of corruption among the judiciary, failure to sentence convicted criminals and alleged bribery at high levels. These are serious allegations. Then there is the question of the rights of people with disabilities. Senator Henry has spoken here about children in orphanages and I have a friend who has first-hand experience of these matters and I know it is an appalling situation. Irish agencies are doing their best to improve matters but improvements must be made in standards before accession can take place seamlessly and flawlessly. It is easy to list these issues and embed them in the minds of citizens but they cannot be disregarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">The Commission has called on Bulgaria to take urgent action to obtain tangible results in investigating and prosecuting organised crime networks and has also called for a more efficient and systematic interpretation of laws in the fight against fraud and corruption. If Bulgaria fails to do these things the Commission may delay accepting Bulgaria as a full member which would send a very unfortunate message to people in that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The Government of Romania has had some positive results in fighting high level corruption and reforming the judiciary, though some problems remain regarding a computerised tax collection system, food safety and setting up agencies to pay and monitor EU farm subsidies, something that will resonate with us. Overall, commentators have said that institutional reform standards are comparable in Bulgaria and Romania but that the committed attitude of the Romanian Government is what makes the difference. From that point of view Romania has an advantage.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Both countries have some way to go. Along with the Soviet Union, Albania, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland they were blighted because of post-war divisions, the Cold War and the flaws of communism. Membership of the EU has signalled the final throwing-off of the shackles of the past for other former eastern bloc states and the accession of Bulgaria will make complete the enlargement of the EU since the fall of the Iron Curtain. It is noticeable that Estonia has many young people at senior levels of the civil service and public administration which has transformed the country and brought great energy to the institutions of state which were moribund under the communist regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The Minister of State made reference to the relocation of labour and the perception that there will be a move eastwards to the lower labour-cost economies. The key to stopping this is productivity. This may not apply to traditional manufacturing industries which are difficult to stop from relocating. In high-tech industry we can offer high productivity. I met a senior executive from Intel a few years ago, by chance, while on holidays and I asked him why the company had not relocated to China or elsewhere. He said it was because the cost per unit is lower in Ireland than it would be in an economy with low-cost labour because productivity is so high here. This relates to competitiveness and is something on which the Government must focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">In progressing from six member states to 25, the EU has shown itself capable of dealing with institutional pressures. I therefore hope we will soon welcome Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union and that they will contribute as much as I hope we have over the past 30 years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_208">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_458">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome this legislation on which we are all in agreement. Membership of the EU has been of great benefit to Ireland at every level. We have reflected on the career of the former Taoiseach Charles Haughey over the past few days and considered, in that light, how life in Ireland has changed since the 1960s and in a similar way one can review how Ireland has changed since we joined the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The support we received from our friends and colleagues in the EU has been a major factor in Ireland's economic and social transformation. Ireland is a very good example of a small country that joined the EU poor and disadvantaged in many ways, but took advantage of what investment was available, especially investment in education, infrastructure and agriculture and used it to its advantage. We should be grateful to those who invented the concept of the EU initially and were so generous in extending the hand of support and friendship to us. There is something to be repaid and there is an onus on us to be generous to new entrants to the EU and ensure countries that meet the entry requirements are given full support by the existing member states. This cannot be seen as an elite club.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Following the fall of communism the EU has opened up to and embraced former eastern European states and this has advanced the cause of peace and prosperity, and the world, to a great degree. This has been a great opportunity and I believe it will show itself to have been a success. From Ireland's perspective this means the arrival of migrant workers from eastern Europe. This is a positive development, but one which has happened with considerable speed causing concern in some quarters.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">In Roscrea, approximately 20% of the town's population is from eastern Europe, which creates an extraordinary situation. We are all used to meeting such workers on a regular basis, particularly from Poland, but also Latvia, Lithuania and other countries, in shops, on farms, in factories and some people have them come work in their homes. I did a small survey in Nenagh to establish where eastern European workers were working, for the most part. I discovered that what was occurring was not displacement, but rather replacement. Most workers were based in factories which, in some cases, attract an unskilled workforce. In other cases workers with specific skills are needed, such as butchers and glass cutters, though these workers were coming here before the expansion of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">Since 2004 those sectors of the economy that have experienced a labour shortage due to Irish workers moving on have often recruited eastern European workers. Irish workers may move to the computer sector, like Dell in Limerick which draws workers from north Tipperary and Limerick, leaving vacancies in the less skilled and lower paid areas. As a result there are clusters of eastern European workers in the lower paid sectors, which is a cause for concern. Only time will tell how they integrate or whether they do as many Irish did and spend a short period of time abroad to build resources or send resources home. They may come as young workers and then go back when they get married and have children. Otherwise, they may stay and integrate fully. Only time will tell if that will happen. It is an issue which is here to stay as long as our economic prosperity continues. We should recognise that these people are contributing to and are part of our continuing economic prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">We should not fool ourselves on the future of the great European project. We know the problems which have occurred with the failure to get the necessary level of support for the proposed European constitution. Significant lessons should be learned from this, particularly by people like us, who may at some level take support for the European Union for granted because we clearly see what it is. Other people do not.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Many of our citizens do not see for themselves a benefit, and they may see the project as a disadvantage. This may be linked to factors which are not caused by or even directly associated with actions of the European Union. We are all politicians and we know that when people are voting, many factors come into play. There is clearly much work to be done to ensure that the man and woman in the street — to use a cliché — are constantly fully informed on what the European project is about and the associated benefits for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The benefits are not just economic, although we have spoken much about them. Other benefits include legal frameworks. It has often been stated in this House that certain rights have been put into Irish law, particularly relating to women, which would not have come about if it had not been for the EU showing the way. It would have overcome resistance which may have naturally been there. That is also to be applauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">These legal frameworks, the fundamental basis of equal human rights and the European social charter, are not fully seen as the extraordinarily positive and beneficial documents which they are for all the citizens of Europe. For that to be available to a wider population is an action which should be supported and applauded.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Like others, I would have concerns regarding Romania and Bulgaria. The Romanian population has a dreadful reputation across Europe. I remember going to Germany as a student and people would talk of Romanians as if they were dirt. Some people really hated them. That is dreadful to observe. The Romanian Government will have to overcome many such obstacles.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">This is indicative of how we must take a long-term view. Participation in the European Union accelerates the process towards a standard to which I hope the Romanian people would aspire. Through participation in the European Union, these people are supported in raising legal, governmental and environmental standards, for example, just as we have had to do ourselves. The support exists to do this, and participation in the European Union allows countries such as Romania to do it. A carrot and stick approach and a balancing act must be properly executed.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I congratulate the Minister of State on his work in this regard and commend him on his commitment to this project. We have shown we have a significant role to play which includes leadership. As we have risen to our current position in the European Union, we have much more to contribute than we had in the past. That is indicative of the possibilities and potential of the European project.</p>

        <speech by="#DonLydon" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. Lydon</from>
          <p eId="para_470">When the Minister of State began his contribution he referred to the late Mr. Haughey, God rest his soul, who was a staunch advocate of Ireland's participation in the European project. He was a prince among men when it came to the European project. Mr. Haughey was sometimes referred to as Machiavellian. If Mr. Haughey was a prince, he was not a Machiavellian prince, but was almost certainly a Medici.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Many people have referred to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, stressing the negative aspects. I would like to refer to some of the positive aspects. The Minister of State has indicated that the number of red flag issues has reduced from 16 to six. The accession incentive has resulted in a raft of reforms in Bulgaria.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The Bulgarian economy has been completely transformed with market-based principles and is characterised by stability, prudent fiscal policy and growth. The main economic indicators include an average annual GDP growth of between 5% and 6%, low inflation and a fiscal target of 3% GDP surplus in 2006. In line with the strong economic growth, employment grew by 2% in 2005. Trade expanded with an acceleration of volume growth to 18.4% for exports and 26% for imports, due mainly to strong imports of investment goods. The trade deficit is balanced by a surplus in the service balance, mainly in tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">With regard to restructuring and liberalisation, 90% of all assets earmarked for privatisation have been privatised. The financial services sector has been completely privatised and further progress has been made in the liberalisation and restructuring of network industries. The railway liberalisation is well advanced and concessions for the operation and upgrading of ports and airports are being granted to private operators. The opening up of gas and electricity markets continues in line with the envisaged timetables. In the telecommunications sector, a third mobile operator started services in November 2005, improving the conditions for effective competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">In its monitoring report of 16 May 2006, the Commission concluded that Bulgaria is a functioning market economy which has maintained macroeconomic stability and advanced structural reforms. It indicated that the continuation of current reforms should enable it to cope with the competitive pressures and market forces within the European Union and accomplish the target of accession to the European Union on 1 January 2007 by resolving outstanding deficits.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Bulgaria accepted the recommendations and the Bulgarian Government discussed in a constructive manner how to address remaining challenges and consolidate ongoing reforms, particularly in the so-called red flag areas identified in the Commission's report. On 8 June the Bulgarian Government adopted an action plan comprising concrete measures and associated timetables. It intensified efforts to achieve tangible results to fully prepare Bulgaria for accession. The measures include consolidation of the framework for combating corruption and organised crime, further fine-tuning of the system to prevent money laundering and strengthening of financial controls for future use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">In the area of transparency, the recent process of full publication of the declaration of interests and assets by members of parliament, Ministers, high-level public servants and magistrates and political parties has begun. It is shortly expected that the current system for public access to the data will be significantly enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">A unit for the fight against corruption and organised crime, directly subordinated to the prosecutor general, was set up with specialised prosecutors to deal with specific cases. The structure of the Ministry of the Interior was significantly improved, avoiding any overlap between various divisions and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The intensive work of the prosecutor's office and the Ministry of the Interior has produced concrete results evidenced in the charges the prosecutor's office recently raised against symbolic figures in the criminal fraternity. There is also sustained progress in prosecuting cases of corruption at all levels. The independent criminal assets commission was strengthened and recently brought several cases to the respective courts, thus targeting the economic background of the persons involved in criminal activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The co-ordination mechanism for the fight against money laundering has been enhanced. A specialised anti-money laundering unit was set up at the prosecutor's office. Further strengthening of the competent structures is envisaged, aimed at better co-ordination in tackling these challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">With regard to the judiciary, following the third major constitutional amendment early in 2006 and the overall enhancement of the legal framework, work is now concentrated on strategic assessment of results and identification of any needs for further fine-tuning of the system. The enhancements included amendments to the penal procedure code and the civil procedure code, as well as the adoption of the new administrative procedure code.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">With regard to the functioning of the courts, efforts are aimed at completing the introduction of the system of random distribution of cases in all Bulgarian courts. With regard to financial control, Bulgaria pays particular attention to strengthening the existing structures and enhancing the co-ordination mechanisms. Specialised training for officials at all levels of the competent bodies is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The co-ordination council for protection of the European Community's financial interests was also strengthened. It comprises representatives of the relevant authorities and co-ordinates the work in this area. Integrated administration and control systems in the area of agriculture is another area of concern. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has concentrated its efforts on completion this year of the aerial photography required and on the opening of new rendering plant construction and completion of the border inspection posts.</p>

        <heading>Use of Irish Airports: Motion.</heading>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_483">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_484">That Seanad Éireann, in light of:</p>
          <p eId="para_485">—developments in Iraq;</p>
          <p eId="para_486">—the recent publication of the Council of Europe Report on CIA Rendition Flights; and</p>
          <p eId="para_487">—the confusion surrounding the legal status of any Garda attempt to investigate the nature of these flights,</p>
          <p eId="para_488">hereby calls for the establishment of the select committee on the use of Irish airports to investigate the use of Shannon by American military authorities, especially the CIA, for which preliminary preparatory meetings have already been held.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">This is an important motion. It is a subject I have pursued for a considerable time. I was probably the first person in either House to raise this issue. I have with me a selection of what I stated on the matter during the past few years. I am sorry to state they have been proved right. I am particularly pleased my colleague, Senator Henry, will second the motion because on a notable occasion she extracted from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a clear statement about what the attitude of the Government is on any process akin to extraordinary rendition.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">One of the horrifying things that has happened during the course of the Iraq war is the constant debasement of language, such as the phrase "extraordinary rendition", "shake and bake attacks" in which people are incinerated by illegal phosphorus bombing and suicides in Guantanamo Bay described as a "publicity stunt". This is unconscionable. Language has been devalued by the American Administration by removing from it all its moral content.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">I put down this motion in light of the report by Senator Dick Marty, which made the subject topical. It has been rendered even more topical by the admission by the United States authorities that they transferred a chained and shackled prisoner through Shannon Airport in a civilian aircraft last Sunday without the required notification to the Irish authorities. This places a grave question mark over the assurances given to the Irish Government by the US authorities concerning their use of Shannon. These assurances were never legally binding anyway. It is a requirement of international law that they should be legally binding. They never have been and the Government knows this.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">However, even if one accepted their assurances, one must look beneath these legally meaningless forms of words and understand this American Administration has departed drastically from the norms of international law. Torture has been redefined to the point where apparently the only proof a subject has been tortured is if it results in death or permanent injury. Practices such as waterboarding, in which the victim is half-drowned, revived under medical supervision and subsequently subjected to interrogation, a technique initiated by the Gestapo, is defined as not constituting torture.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">No doubt, the piratical practice of kidnapping persons who may be either citizens of the US or third countries and transporting them to regimes which the Bush Administration publically holds in distaste so they may be tortured in the presence of CIA agents, is regarded by the current incumbent at the White House and his associates as being perfectly legal.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Regrettably, spokespersons for the Government appear to have been infected by the linguistic practices of our American cousins. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in a statement issued no later than yesterday, stated we will not facilitate and have not facilitated extraordinary renditions and that is and remains our policy. Perhaps it remains a publicly-stated policy but it is and will remain totally untrue. I call on the Minister to withdraw it.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">It has been demonstrated beyond any possibility of doubt that by refuelling aircraft such as the notorious "Guantanamo express" we have incontrovertibly facilitated the noxious practice of extraordinary rendition. We in old Europe and many in the United States know this degradation of international standards of decency does not, and should not, be allowed represent the typical values of the democratic world.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Throughout this debate there has been constant obfuscation and indulgence in what the Taoiseach would no doubt describe as "waffle". Serious questions have been asked but never answered. The Minister for Foreign Affairs confines himself to answering questions which have not been asked but for which he believes he has a mollifying answer. He defends the Government against accusations which have never been made while never replying to those which have.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">There has been a tendency in Government circles to dismiss the Marty report. The language, we are told, is emotional. I would not have respect for anyone who did not become emotional at the prospect of human beings, in some cases subsequently proved totally innocent, being snatched off the streets or intercepted in airports, their clothes surgically shorn from their bodies, drug suppositories inserted in their anus, unceremoniously clothed in nappies, then shackled to the inside of a CIA plane disguised as a civilian aircraft and transported to destinations they know not where for the purposes of being tortured.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">This is all done in the name of <i>realpolitik</i> to maintain American investment in Ireland. This is a short-sighted and mercenary view of morality and never served the Government well in the past. Senator Mansergh in this House last Thursday, if one unpicks the diplomatic language, was surprisingly frank on this issue, stating the conduct of foreign policy and our relations with other countries often involves striking difficult balances, taking into account both our values and interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Striking that balance wrongly can have serious long-term consequences. This is virtually what I was told by the Fianna Fáil benches when I was a lone voice opposing Irish beef deals with the Iraqi army. I well remember the phrase which emerged from the foreign affairs spokesperson on the other side, when I was told what I advocated might well be the moral position, but could Ireland afford it. We still have not resolved the question as to whether Ireland can afford to act morally in international relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">I have some direct questions for the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and I would appreciate some direct answers. If, as the spokesperson suggested, there is nothing new in the Marty report, why has comment not been made on the clearly proven fact that Ireland has been involved in facilitating rendition? The Minister of State is shaking his head but it is perfectly clear. A man was snatched off the street, he was taken to Egypt, he was tortured and we refuelled that aeroplane on the way back. That facilitates rendition. At least, I know what the meaning of language is, does the Minister of State?</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Does he accept that, as I stated, the flight in June 2003, almost exactly three years ago, in which Abu Omar was abducted in Milan, illegally flown to Egypt where he was tortured, was refuelled at Shannon Airport with the consent of the Irish Government on its return journey during the same flight schedule? Does he accept this is clear evidence, and would so be accepted by an international criminal court, of Ireland's collusion with the United States in the practice of extraordinary rendition?</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Does he accept that only for the action of cleaning staff, who boarded the aircraft at Shannon last Sunday, a blind eye would have been turned to this incident also? Does he accept that had the aeroplane, which had just dumped Abu Omar in Egypt for the purposes of torture, been inspected in Shannon the modifications made to that aeroplane for the purpose of transferring prisoners would have been noticed and reported?</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I was one of three people who made a complaint to the Garda Commissioner concerning these flights. In response, he appointed two detective inspectors to interview me. I arranged to be accompanied at that interview by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. We checked our recollections of that meeting and we can both state independently that we were told on that occasion by these senior representatives of the Garda Síochána that because of the way in which international treaties were incorporated into Irish law, they lacked the power to make the type of investigations sought at that time. This is in clear and direct contradiction of what both the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs told the Dáil and the public. In reply to a question by Deputy Sargent in the Dáil yesterday, the Taoiseach retorted that Deputy Sargent was not a garda. This is quite true but neither is the Taoiseach. I, at least, have the advantage of having spoken to the representatives of the Garda Commissioner. Will the Minister of State outline precisely the legal status concerning such investigations? This is exactly the kind of area that the abortive committee, whose terms of reference had already been agreed by an all-party committee of the Oireachtas, could have investigated had it not been squashed by a combination of interest groups operating in the undergrowth of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Arguments were made that Senators were lobbied by local councillors from the area around Shannon Airport. It is a sad day that Seanad Éireann should be ruled from Clare County Council. I would have thought councillors would have learned by now that it can be dangerous to mix money and morality. In any case, American business is peculiarly hard-headed. Despite all the obsequious lickspittling, it was announced a week ago in the newspapers that a large proportion of these commercial military flights is being transferred to other European destinations which are more convenient. Shannon Airport will and must survive but it should not and must not survive on blood money.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">There have been attacks on the Marty report, on its use of language and its reference to a "spider's web". However, I have a map showing the flight paths and if it were shown to any child, he or she would describe it as a spider's web. Shannon Airport is right at the centre of this network of shame.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_506">It is not at the centre.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_507">We have been named and shamed in the Marty report as being in "category A". We have been asked to do something about this by the human rights section of the United Nations, the Irish Human Rights Commission and Amnesty International — I could go on and on.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The practices to which I have referred are gross in the extreme and I would like to put them, as determined by the Marty report, on the record. Reference was made to the lack of evidence but there is plenty of clear, cogent, factual evidence, itemised point by point in the report. Detailed observations, flight patterns and climatic conditions are all included. The report makes an absolutely cast-iron case about rendition and it describes what is known as the "security check" as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_509">i. it generally takes place in a small room (a locker room, a police reception area) at the airport, or at a transit facility nearby.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_510">ii. the man is sometimes already blindfolded when the operation begins, or will be blindfolded quickly and remain so throughout most of the operation.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_511">iii. four to six CIA agents perform the operation in a highly-disciplined, consistent fashion- They are dressed in black (either civilian clothes or special ‘uniforms'), wearing black gloves, with their full faces covered. Testimonies speak, variously, of "big people in black balaclavas", people "dressed in black like ninjas", or people wearing "ordinary clothes, but hooded".</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_512">iv. the CIA agents "don't utter a word when they communicate with one another", using only hand signals ...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_513">v. some men speak of being punched or shoved by the agents at the beginning of the operation in a rough or brutal fashion; others talked about being gripped firmly from several sides.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_514">vi. the man's hands and feet are shackled.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_515">vii. the man has all his clothes (including his underwear) cut from his body using knives or scissors in a careful, methodical fashion; an eye-witness described how "someone was taking these clothes and feeling every part, you know, as if there was something inside the clothes, and then putting them in a bag".</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_516">viii. the man is subjected to a full-body cavity search, which also entails a close examination of his hair, ears, mouth and lips.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_517">ix. the man is photographed with a flash camera ...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_518">x. some accounts speak of a foreign object being forcibly inserted into the man's anus; some accounts speak more specifically of a tranquiliser or suppository being administered per rectum — in each description this practice has been perceived as a grossly violating act that affronts the man's dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I do not have time to read the full description into the record but I hope I have read enough to shame all of us in this House. Deputy Michael D. Higgins stated in the Dáil last night that these practices are "in breach of every single principle of international law, namely, the manner of apprehension, the manner of transporting, the issue of <i>habeas corpus</i>, the right to legal protection, delivering a person inhuman treatment and the delivery of a person through enforced disappearance into an ill-defined and indeterminate place of detention”.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">This is the mess we have gotten ourselves into. If only the Government had listened several years ago when I and my colleagues on this side of the House, and many decent Members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, referred to these practices and tried to stop it from averting its eyes from the horror in which it was rapidly enmeshing itself and becoming complicit, we would not be in this mess tonight.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_213">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_521">I second the motion. It is a great honour to be asked to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">On 23 June 2004, on Fifth Stage of the Transfer of Execution of Sentences Bill 2003 in this House, I stated the following to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_523">As one who has long been concerned with the rights and treatment of prisoners, I welcome the Bill. It is extremely useful. I wish to raise with the Minister a matter which has been of great concern to the House. Can he assure us that untried and unsentenced people are not being brought through Shannon from goodness knows where to Guantanamo Bay? We raised this issue in the House several times and it has been a cause of real concern to us because many Irish citizens would not like to think that was happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Minister replied:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_525">Obviously, I have no notice of that issue, although, apparently, the Senator has raised it on other occasions in the House. Any person who is on the soil of Ireland is entitled to the protection of our Constitution. No person can be brought through the soil of Ireland in the custody of any other state except in accordance with international law. If the Senator has reason to believe any person has been transited through Irish territory, in unlawful custody, particularly to Guantanamo, I would be interested to hear it because I would respond to it immediately. We have our Constitution and the right of the freedom of the individual is not confined to citizens; it applies to all persons. Therefore, it would cause me grave concern if I thought people were being smuggled through Irish territory in circumstances that amounted to unlawful detention in Irish law or in international law for that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">If we do not look for people being smuggled through or if we continue to collude in our dealings with the aeroplanes on which they are smuggled, how on earth can we afford them the benefits of our Constitution?</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The report on rendition, produced by Senator Dick Marty of Switzerland, shows that Shannon has been used by CIA aeroplanes to render people to third countries on a continuing basis. Last Sunday's exposé by cleaning staff of a manacled person on a civilian aeroplane demonstrates that we must be sceptical of US assertions that our hospitality towards its aeroplanes is not being abused. It is odd that there is no protocol in place to deal with discoveries such as that made by the cleaners, whose actions I applaud.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">Torture, both physical and psychological, has been employed on people who have been sent to third countries for rendition. There are plenty of reports on this. Torture is a barbarous practice and we all prefer to avoid thinking about or discussing it. There is avoidance on the part of the victim and denial on the part of the perpetrator, his or her helpers and society as a whole. This denial is extensive and allows the practice of torture and its effects to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I applaud those at the Centre for the Care of the Survivors of Torture, North Circular Road, on their courage in caring for those who were tortured in other countries and subsequently came to Ireland. I doubt I would be able to do it myself even though medical publications, particularly in the United States, are increasingly telling medical personnel that they must address this issue. I refer in particular to a recent article in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine:</i>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_530">The Geneva Convention's definition of torture can apparently be ignored by those who have invaded Iraq. What is torture? In the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 1984, it is defined as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_531">Any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The people who are directing the rendition flights are acting in an official capacity. Physical torture may include suspension, beatings, electric shock, removal of nails and/or teeth, deprivation of food and water, sexual abuse and forced ingestion of chemicals. Other types of torture which are primarily psychological include solitary confinement, threats, witnessed torture or execution — this is particularly serious where the one tortured is a member of someone's family — sham executions, deprivation of sleep and monopolisation of perception.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Regarding the effects of torture on the victims, survivors of torture often suffer from a combination of physical and psychological effects. Physical effects may include scars, broken bones, muscle swelling, stiffness or atrophy, chronic pain, headaches, deafness, blindness and loss of teeth. Victims often suffer from psychological symptoms such as lack of sleep, nightmares, problems with concentration, anxiety, depression, irritability, adjustment disorders, impotence and feelings of powerlessness, shame and guilt.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Anyone who has read the sufferings of the young Canadian man who was wrongly taken while transiting through the United States of America to Syria and there tortured will understand that these effects are ongoing and deprive people of what can be described as a normal life.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">When I marched against the invasion of Iraq I felt sure that the proposed war would go badly but I did not think it would go as badly as it has done. Death and the destruction of Iraqi citizens is everywhere and displacement of communities on a sectarian basis is now following. Life is intolerable for many people, women in particular being singled out for rape and kidnapping. The Chaldean Christians have mainly fled the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">In the Seanad I have called for the release of two women scientists, Dr. Huda Ammash and Dr. Rhab Taha. The former obtained her doctorate in Missouri University, the latter in East Anglia. These women were portrayed as high profile producers of biological weapons of mass destruction and members of the infamous "Pack of Cards" by the discredited people in the Pentagon who had decided they were important members of Saddam's regime. Calls for their trial or release were ignored. Dr. Ammash had breast cancer. Surely she could have been released on humanitarian grounds. Even when their release was sought by those insurgents who kidnapped and subsequently beheaded Ken Bigley, a British hostage, it was ignored. Perhaps their release would have helped in securing his release. After two and a half years, they were quietly released six months ago but did anyone see that reported widely? No, because it was not.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">What has all this done to the standing of the United States in the world? It has diminished it greatly. In a recent survey, 60% of people questioned in the United States and in Europe felt the invasion of Iraq and its consequences had made the world more dangerous. Under-Secretary Karen Hughes is touring the world in an attempt to improve this serious change in the view of the citizens of the world of the United States. She has an uphill task.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The war has also diminished Americans themselves. When I was there last autumn, I met a woman who told me that as the mother of a young serviceman, she feared for what this war is doing to America's young people. What does it do to young people to be told they are to run down children in the path of one's truck in case they are slowing the trucks for a roadside bomb? The effect on the people of America will be horrific too.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_545">——as were many of my colleagues within the Fianna Fáil parliamentary group but that is a separate issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Having said that, the carefully constructed building the Government presented to the Irish people and that I supported was destroyed in the dust of Shannon Airport last Sunday morning by, I understand, a flight crew member and not a cleaner — that has since been clarified — who reported the matter to the duty manager at Shannon Airport who, in turn, contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">In the past decade we talked in this House and the other House about building trust. The basis on which this Government has operated since 1997, and the new Administration in 2002 between the two parties, has been built on trust. The relationship between Ireland and the United States of America has been built on trust. I strongly suggest that as a result of what happened last Sunday, that trust has been seriously eroded. I regret to say that because I am, and always have been, a strong supporter of America. I am not a supporter of the Iraq war. I believe it was a mistake and that subsequent events have proven that but that is not what this debate is about. The fact that the USA breached Irish law last Sunday, either inadvertently or deliberately — we do not yet know which — is a matter of grave concern. I am grateful that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern — I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will address this issue in his reply — has immediately taken action by calling in the US ambassador and explaining to him, I believe in robust terms, the unacceptable nature of what happened last Sunday in Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">It is rather ironic that in doing some research for this debate I selected an article in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Independent</i> by John Clarke, a writer on security issues and a contributor to <i>Jane’s Defence Weekly</i>, the leading and very credible defence magazine in the world. Reading the article now it is somewhat ironic to read some of the quotes he used to suggest there would be no reason the CIA would use Shannon for prisoners because it does not make any sense when the UK, a NATO member with secure military bases, is close by. In light of what happened on Sunday, some of the quotes have a certain resonance. For example, he states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_549">Do people really think we Americans are that stupid? Why would we use Shannon for transferring prisoners? It doesn't make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">They have been stupid or else they are being conspiratorial, and that is a matter for this Government to investigate and establish the reason. It makes it even more serious in light of what was written in the article in justifying why there would not have been any rendition of prisoners through Shannon Airport. He states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_551">[For a start], look at the proximity of Shannon to the UK. Why would the CIA use a civilian facility in a neutral, albeit friendly country when, a short hop away across the Irish Sea, they have access to secure military air bases used by the US Air Force? The UK is a fellow member of NATO, fully signed up to Washington's "War on Terror", and America's most important ally among the multinational forces in Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I might add that there is one element of the article with which I agree and which perhaps might be worthy of reflection. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_553">. . . CIA [agents] use private jets nowadays like other people use taxis, just to get from A to B. Uncle Sam has deep pockets, and is pulling out all the stops in the "War on Terror". Those aircraft are likely to be carrying intelligence agents on various missions, or security guards being transported to carry out protection duty at some US installation abroad, rather than prisoners.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I have to accept that in most cases, and perhaps in all cases up to Sunday, that is the case but it does not necessarily follow that because it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it is a duck. What has plagued this debate on both sides for the past while is that there is an absence of specific evidence. I am aware that those who are proposing that the Government should have taken a more proactive role have been reinforced by the events of last Sunday. I am pleased that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, in the course of a radio interview yesterday evening, said that in bringing proposals to Cabinet on what happened on Sunday, that left open the question of random checks by the gardaí on aeroplanes landing at Shannon. I would welcome that. I have never been opposed to that view. All I ever suggested was that as the United States Administration had repeatedly and consistently said, not just to the European Union, as the Minister again pointed out yesterday in the contextual history he presented of this whole issue, but to the Government in response to specific questions from it, namely, whether they were in violation of Irish law and indulging in extraordinary renditions through Shannon Airport or other Irish airports. The answer was a resounding "No". In view of the close relationship between this country and America I was very happy to accept that. To have accepted otherwise would have been seen as a hostile act by a friendly nation. In light of what happened on Sunday, however, I now fully support the Government if that is the role it wishes to take — to carry out random checks not just on US aeroplanes landing at Shannon Airport but on all aircraft coming through that airport where there is any question of a violation of Irish airspace. That is what has happened in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">According to the article by Mr. Clarke, the law on transit applies to a prisoner being transported on a private jet, which it was in this instance, which lands in an Irish airport for refuelling, which it did. He said that without permission the detention of the prisoner on Irish soil would be in violation of Irish law. The law also applies to the transport through an Irish airport by another state of a prisoner on a military aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">In light of this and because of my genuine concern that there should not be any dismantling of the strong and close relationship between this country and America, which allows us to be critical among friends, I would hate to believe that what happened last Sunday was the tip of the iceberg and that, in fact, this was just the latest in a series of violations of Irish law and airspace, which happened to have been discovered by chance by a flight crew member.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_561">I want to reiterate that this call for the establishment of a select committee to examine the use of Irish airports to investigate the possible misuse of Shannon is a very modest and reasonable request, one that we have debated in this House on previous occasions. We had almost reached a point where an all-party group in the Seanad was about to be established on this issue. Some preliminary meetings had taken place, it appeared to have the support of all sides and we felt that such a committee would serve a very useful purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">At the very core of the argument about Shannon, rendition, the use of Irish airports and the knowledge or lack of it by the Irish authorities, there is serious doubt and grave concern. I concur with what Senator Mooney has said as regards absolute clarification being urgently required. The Council of Europe report needs careful study. I attended the first session of the Council of Europe where Senator Marty presented his interim report. On that occasion he conceded that there were as many questions as answers. He has now come forward with further work and serious questions are raised. We look forward to the next meeting of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in a fortnight's time for a full debate on that report on rendition.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The practice of rendition is something about which we must express serious political objections, on moral and political grounds, and I am sure it is opposed by every Member of this House. That can be stated without fear of contradiction. The issue before the House, however, is the question of setting up a select committee, which was a source of political debate and division among the Government parties in House on the previous occasion. In light of the most recent events, however, it is in everybody's interest to have a full and clear picture of what is happening in Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">Senator Mooney is correct in saying that in these types of issues it is important that we can lodge our complaints, concerns and where necessary, our objections, to the American Administration. A very close political relationship has always existed between the United States and Ireland and hopefully will continue. It is in our mutual interests that this should be so. However, where practices occur to which we fundamentally object, there is no point in Ireland hiding its head in the sand. We must call a spade a spade. When there is serious doubt as regards what is happening at Shannon, there is an obligation on the Government to investigate and react. It will certainly be supported by all Members of this House. That is why, as a first step, we need to have our own sources of information. The Marty and other reports, including rumoured reports, statistics, etc., are helpful, but it would be very useful to us, politically, if a committee of this House was able to launch its own investigation and use its resources to try to get the answers we seek.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">If there is evidence, as appears likely, that Shannon is being used for rendition purposes, we must be profoundly concerned. The use of rendition and the practice of torture is unjustifiable and immoral. It is in every respect counter-productive in the long-run. There was a debate earlier in the House today about the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the European Union. A number of speakers made the point as regards the type of society Romania and Bulgaria were previously, under totalitarian communist rule. It is our desire that this type of administration, rule or society should not exist any longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Unfortunately, practices such as rendition and torture have more in common with the old Soviet Union than what one might expect from the standards of the United States of America. It is of major concern to us all that practices seem to be occurring, arising from the war in Iraq, which are unethical, immoral and illegal. Our Government must be prepared to speak out against those practices. If there is any possibility of a resolution to the enormous problem in Iraq, if there is to be progress in the Middle East and if those types of political flashpoints in the world are to have their problems addressed, the United States has a significant role to play. The credibility of the United States, however, and its usefulness as an arbitrator of international disputes are severely lessened when questions such as rendition and torture are being discussed and even more worrying, practised. We need to clarify these issues urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The select committee would have a useful role to play, in investigating, asking questions, being prepared to seek the truth and to reach a conclusion. I appeal to the Minister of State in his response to take on board the events of recent weeks. A Government response was given four or five months ago, but matters have moved on, not just as regards the Marty report and other pieces of evidence, but in the context of the events of last weekend in particular. It requires a new response, fresh thinking and flexibility on the part of the Government to allow this House of the Oireachtas, a senior part of Irish public life, to play an investigative role, which it is more than willing to do if given the opportunity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_226">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_568">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and the contributions of other Senators. This is an issue that often gets debated in this House. Sometimes it is fraught with more hysteria than fact. I can understand that because at times we all become concerned about the issues as we perceive them. Coming from County Clare, it can also be an emotive issue, not just in monetary terms but also because there is a focus put on our county and on our airport for all the wrong reasons. I do not refer to anybody in this House, but people seek to make political capital or public comment on the back of what we believe is a very good piece of infrastructure and a benefit to the west of Ireland. They do so in a way that commingles fact with fiction, involving a level of hysteria, misinformation and downright lies at times.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">There is no doubt that what happened over the weekend has focused many minds on this issue. I have done the best I can to come to terms with the facts, based on information that I have tried to gather over the last few days. In doing so, I have ignored the statements from all sides and tried to talk to people on the ground at the airport. It seems to me that there is not a major crisis, although others might say that I would say that. My understanding was that a member of the cleaning staff became concerned when she saw someone on the aircraft in the company of police officers, while others had disembarked. In reporting that to a supervisor, a decision was taken to contact the American Embassy. The embassy was quick to establish the facts of the situation and ascertained information from personnel at the airport. I believe it got the co-operation of airport staff in trying to establish the facts. I welcome that and the pro-active manner in which the embassy dealt with the situation. It is a difficult issue for a foreign mission, dealing with what it sees as a war situation, the army, intelligence agencies and their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">A further mitigating fact was that the civilian airline flying these soldiers home does not normally transit through Shannon Airport, but through Frankfurt-Hahn in Germany. That airline has done a deal with Shannon Airport to fly the troops via Shannon during the World Cup and in doing so, may not be as clear on the protocols in dealing with the Irish situation. That does not relieve the US Government of its obligation to observe the laws of this land, which we as legislators are proud to enact. The efforts made by the embassy to acknowledge the fact and to try to deal with the information deficit that was there has been welcome. That does not take from the fact that it was unacceptable that our laws were ignored, albeit inadvertently in my view.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">There has been an effort to mix this information up with Senator Marty's report released last week. It was unfortunate that the two issues collided. I believe that his report is largely baseless. It is devoid of hard fact and in my view is biased. Senator Norris stated that we were categorised as "category A". The use of a term such as "category A" denotes a level of seriousness in our involvement, but it is quite the inverse. Category A represents a group of airports that only have a minor involvement as a refuelling stop on the return journey from these so-called "missions". There was no major evidence provided, albeit that there is a map that does not look like a spider's web in my view, but more like the map that Ryanair has on its website.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">My concern is that there has been an effort to confuse Ireland with being involved in the worst category. The lowest category, D, is where the greatest complications take place, if weight is to be given to that report. I know that many people in this House have spoke on this issue in a genuine way, but I am concerned that an effort is being made to damage the name of Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">A point was made on how we came to our views as part of the Fianna Fáil Party in the Seanad on the establishment of such a committee. I share the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Mooney, as I too have come to my own view on this. I also share the views of the Clare councillors on this issue and I help to inform their attitude from time to time as they look to us for our views as national legislators. We meet regularly and we discuss a range of issues and topics. We agree on some of them and we do not agree with others. They will make their voice heard on issues with which they do not agree. Anybody that has an ongoing relationship with county councillors will recognise that it is often difficult to satisfy their issues on all occasions. We form our own views, but their involvement was helpful in highlighting what they perceived were problems. It would be unfair to suggest that local representatives should not have the right to talk to their national parliamentarians, after all, they are the electorate of the Senate.</p>

It is ironic to discuss it in that context when one considers that Germany was very opposed to the war in Iraq, yet it is now receiving more troops than any other country.

They are backed by the UN Security Council Resolution 1637, which was passed on 8 November.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_580">We had an interesting debate on Iraq last November. I am on the board of an organisation in the US and when there in December, I found myself talking to a number of Americans about events in Iraq. I was surprised that they did not seem to understand that the steps they were taking were working against their long-term interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I admire Senator Mooney for what he said today and we are both friends of the US. When I spoke last November, I spoke as a friend of the US, even though I was very critical. In January, I circulated that speech to Americans and many of them came back to me to talk about it. They were surprised at the strength of feeling I had expressed. However, I found that many of them were supportive of what I would regard as torture. That surprised me because my memory was that they would not have done so before. One of them sent me an article to which I will refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">What happened last Sunday at Shannon Airport has shaken me, because until then I believed the Americans. I believed what they said, although some other Members of this House did not. I was surprised by what was discovered last Sunday. I am shaken by that. If a person lets me down by misleading me once, I will give him or her a second chance but if that person misleads me a second time, he or she loses my trust. The Americans are in danger of losing our trust because they seem to have misled us about what was happening with those aeroplanes that were passing through Shannon Airport in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I was surprised by the lack of understanding among Americans that they have no chance of winning this war on terror by using the same tactics as those used by the terrorists. Their only way of winning it is to change the hearts and the minds of those terrorists, but instead they seem not only to be losing out on the fight to change the hearts and minds of those terrorists but to be creating many more who have become associated with the aims and objectives of those terrorists.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">When I circulated a copy of what I had said on that occasion, I was surprised by those who came back to defend the areas of torture. One of the comments made was as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_585">It didn't take long for interrogators in the war on terror to realise that their part was not going according to script. Pentagon doctrine, honed over decades of Cold War planning, held that 95% of prisoners would break upon straightforward questioning. Interrogators in Afghanistan, and later in Cuba and Iraq, found just the opposite . . .</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_586">In particular, torturous interrogation methods, developed at Guantanamo Bay and Afghanistan in illegal disregard of Geneva protections, migrated ... [later to Iraq] and were manifest in the abuse photos [that we saw].</p>
          <p eId="para_587">It appears that this was binned on with the approval of very high ranking Americans. Chris Mackey a co-author of the book "The Interrogators: Inside the Secret War Against al Qaeda" wrote a gripping account of the interrogation methods used in Iraq. I will refer to one of two of them, one in particular caught my imagination. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_588">Battlefield commanders in Afghanistan and intelligence officials in Washington kept pressing for information ... The frustrated interrogators constantly discussed how to get it. The best hope, they agreed, was to re-create the "shock of capture" — that vulnerable mental state when a prisoner is most frightened, most uncertain, and most likely to respond to questioning. [However, it was not working for them.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_589">The question was: Was such treatment consistent with the Geneva Conventions?</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_590">President Bush had declared in February 2002 that al-Qaeda members fell wholly outside the conventions and that Taliban prisoners would not receive prisoner-of-war status — without which they, too, would not be covered by the Geneva rules. [I had not been aware of that.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_591">What emerged [from this] was a hybrid and fluid set of detention practices. As interrogators tried to overcome the prisoners' resistance, their reference point remained Geneva and other humanitarian treaties. But the interrogators pushed into the outer limits of what they thought the law allowed, undoubtedly recognising that the prisoners in their control violated everything the pacts stood for.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">This is what frightens me. It seems the American are now defending the steps they took. They say the terrorists do not stick to the rules, therefore, why should they do so. They treat the soldiers who fight them on a battlefield differently because they could receive the same treatment from the soldiers, but they say the terrorists act differently and, therefore, they do not have to adhere to the Geneva Conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">The reason I have gone to some pains to outline this is that I believed the Americans were not involved in torture other than those who had stretched the limit beyond what they should have done. When we heard the outcry against the Abu Ghraib prisoners and we saw those photographs, we said that was not acceptable, and we thought it was not acceptable to the Americans. However, now it seems that is not correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I am not sure that the proposal in the motion to establish a select committee to investigate this matter is the correct way to address it, and I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on this. I notice that the Government has not tabled an amendment to the motion and, therefore, I assume it is likely to accept Senator Norris's proposal to establish a select committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Perhaps there is another way to deal with this matter, but it seems the Americans abused the reception opportunities we allowed at Shannon Airport. There was no doubt as to whose side we were on when the war commenced in Iraq. I was opposed to that war, but on the day it started there was no question as to whether we were on the side of Saddam Hussein or on the side of those who had gone into Iraq. We had hoped the fighting would be over as quickly as possible, but that did not happen and it appears highly unlikely it will happen. However, we must now help the Americans who invaded Iraq to get out by way of some mechanism. The manner in which we can do that is by urging them to change the hearts and minds of the terrorists and of those who support them and not to begin acting like terrorists.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">A step taken which ignores the Geneva Convention is unacceptable. It is unacceptable if Shannon Airport has been used in some form or other in that respect. To take up Senator Dooley's point, I read Senator Marty's report and there is little doubt that the category A level is the very least objectionable of the levels, but it still is beyond what we understood was happening. I hope the Minister of State will give serious consideration to accepting this motion tabled by Senators Norris and Henry.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_597">I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the House. I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak again on this important topic. It is less than four months since this issue was the subject of a Private Member's motion in this House and the reality is that not much has changed in that time. What is new is the publication of the Council of Europe Report on CIA Rendition Flights, referred to in the Independents group's motion. That report and the motion's reference to the establishment of a special committee are the two elements on which I will focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Before doing so, I wish to mention the incident at Shannon last Sunday, when a serving marine and US citizen, subject to military law, tried and convicted of an offence, was being transported back to the US to serve his sentence. Although it has no connection with allegations of extraordinary rendition and, thus, this motion, it is right the Government treated even an inadvertent administrative error as unacceptable and with the gravest concern. The Minister correctly summoned the US ambassador and left him in no doubt as to Ireland's position on the failure to inform and secure consent.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Importantly, in the context of this evening's debate, the Government did two things. First, to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent any recurrence of the incident, the Government is to engage with the US authorities on arrangements for notification and information sharing, and the strengthening of verification procedures, as necessary. Second, the Minister took the opportunity to reiterate the consistent position of the Government that no aircraft can use Shannon for extraordinary rendition and that Ireland will not facilitate and has not facilitated extraordinary renditions. That is, and remains, the Government's policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The Minister made it crystal clear that if the Government at any stage receives hard evidence of extraordinary rendition it would act upon it and expect the Garda Síochána to act upon it also.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">Returning to my two points on this motion, I said in the House on 8 March last that DickMarty's report for the Council of Europe was very careful and precise in its use of language. It is fair to say that Dick Marty's decision to adopt the metaphor of a global "spider's web" for his report represents a regrettable move away from careful and precise use of language. Speaking as he does of "a web that has been spun out incrementally over several years, using tactics and techniques that have had to be developed in response to new theatres of war" in my view does little to help any argument he wishes to make.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">In any event, my first point is that Dick Marty found no evidence of terrorism suspects being "rendered" through Shannon. I am not surprised. I do not believe that the US would use Shannon for such activity. Senator Norris may have strong views on the US military but I do not think he would think it stupid in this regard. I draw attention to the sensible questions posed by the media in this regard and questions that I posed here previously. Would the United States be so stupid as to use a civilian facility in a neutral, albeit friendly country when across the Irish Sea, it has access to secure military airbases used by the US Air Force? Would it be so stupid as to use a civilian facility when its air force has no shortage of long-range aircraft with mid-air refuelling capabilities that can travel around the globe or stay in the air for extended periods without landing for refuelling at Shannon or anywhere else?</p>
          <p eId="para_603">I have often wondered, as a former officer, what military principles would be going through the mind of a commanding officer who would risk such activity at Shannon, when there is the possibility of a technical fault, bad weather or numerous other reasons which would ground the aeroplane and risk uncovering activity he or she needs to keep covered, when there are NATO bases a mere skip away in the United Kingdom or Germany.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The Independent Senators' motion mentions the establishment by this House of a select committee to investigate the use of Shannon by American military authorities, especially the CIA. May I remind them of the words of Dick Marty, to whom they refer to with great admiration. He stated, "It is paradoxical to expect bodies without any real investigatory powers to adduce evidence in the legal sense". This House could fit into that category. He goes on to state, "a lack of willingness and commitment on the part of national institutions that could, and should, have completely clarified these allegations which from the outset did not appear to be totally unfounded".</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The Government co-operated fully with the Council of Europe investigation, and its explanation of its law and practice to the Council of Europe was one of only nine, out of 45 received, that the Secretary General of the Council of Europe judged to be sufficiently comprehensive not to require further clarification. This exemplifies the "willingness and commitment" of our Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">As for the "willingness and commitment" of this House, I was delighted to work on drafting the terms of reference for a proposed select committee. I made this point in March but obviously must make it again: the reason for not convening the select committee was that a majority in this House did not support it, not that a majority thought there was nothing to examine, or any other surreptitious reason. It was not my wish that the issue end in that manner. Pursuing so far and so publicly a process towards establishing such a committee did this House no service.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I am not inclined to undermine this House by proposing defiance of its determination, the will of the majority. One should be careful about where one's logic leads. I refer to the claim that Ireland colludes in rendition, that aircraft landed at Shannon after rendition operations, and that Ireland colludes by allowing an aeroplane to land at Shannon, that has transported a person illegally, or may do so. Our logic may be applied only to the use of the aeroplane while it is in the country. Were Ireland to cease engagement with entities or operations that in any way facilitate the running of a military operation, that could have serious and unforeseen consequences. Do we ask Intel, Hewlett Packard and Microsoft to cease operations here because armies employ their technology, microchips, computers and operating systems? Should we ask Pfizer, Abbott and Wyeth, all the pharmaceutical companies, to pack up because soldiers in combat situations might use their medicines?</p>
          <p eId="para_608">I welcome the raising of this issue by the Independent Senators, notwithstanding my two main reservations. Everyone must be concerned about military action, capture, transportation, torture, the abuse of human rights, or any dilution of what every right-thinking person considers to be torture or inhumane treatment. We cannot suspend our reason or logic. That would serve neither this House nor any belief, no matter how passionately held.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome and support this motion tabled by the Independent Senators. Last March the Labour Party tabled a similar motion with cross-party support on this side of the House, which Senator Norris seconded. We likewise proposed an appointment to a select committee of Senators, one of whose main purposes was to establish what mechanisms are in place, and whether our laws and practices ensure adequate safeguards to prevent a breach of the various international human rights instruments to which we have signed up, and our own laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Ireland, like other European countries, has a responsibility to make sure that use is not made of our airspace because of our obligations under national and international law, including the European Convention on Human Rights. During that debate in March, the Minister of State said the Council of Europe was looking into this and the European Parliament had set up a committee. I made the point that the document establishing the brief of the European Parliament committee foresaw that there would be national parliamentary committees set up with which the European Parliament committee would liaise. I am glad that Senator Minihan seems to support the idea of the establishment of this type of committee. The Seanad would be the ideal forum for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">The Government has put its head in the sand on this issue. In the last report of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis said that accepting diplomatic assurances was not enough but that is what the Government has done.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">While I am aware that there is no evidence as yet that Baldonnell Aerodrome has been used for this type of activity, general points made by the Council of Europe apply to it. We must establish that the procedures for overseeing the use of Baldonnell, Shannon and other airports for the various aircraft are sufficient to make sure that we are meeting our obligations under international human rights law. An Oireachtas committee would establish what we need to do and what procedures should be in place. There is plenty of documentation available for it to examine. We can examine our procedures and our legislation.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_613">Senator Marty found nothing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_614">That is not the case. Senator Marty found plenty of evidence that on the balance of probability we should be taking greater care than we have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The Council of Europe report and Terry Davis, the Secretary General of the Council, concur that laws will need to be put in place. For example, we may need to introduce a criminal offence covering the process of extraordinary rendition. I read on the Council's website that Mr. Davis issued a report today detailing further information. He will soon make proposals for action to the committee of ministers of the Council of Europe on the legislation that needs to be put in place, including in Ireland. This applies to all member countries of the Council. Hungary is the only country he specifies because it has the strongest oversight measures. He will make proposals in terms of legislation we need to put in place and the European Parliament will look for information on what we are doing. That is the reason we need a committee. We need it so we will have the information available to hand as to the mechanisms we have in place and those we need to put in place to bring about improvement and as to how we can use our current laws better and whether we need to introduce new laws. A committee would help us deal with these matters and help us use our sovereignty to work with the Council of Europe and the European Parliament committee to do what is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">There is no point in waiting for the bad news or for the announcement that we have not been dealing correctly with the matter. We should not just wait like Senator Mooney suggests until we are told "Here is the evidence." We should be proactive on the issue and be ready to do whatever is necessary and implement whatever laws are required. It is not about waiting to be told we are not dealing correctly with the matter like with the recent Supreme Court judgment and then panicking. We must try and do something now. We must get as much information as possible and do what we can to improve procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">It is clear from the incident at the weekend that we do not have even the basic procedures in place to deal with the issue. We would not have heard the different stories about what happened at Shannon at the weekend, if we had proper and adequate procedures in places. There is much preparatory work we can do now to deal with these matters.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_618">I was a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for a number of years and a member of its legal affairs committee and a colleague of Senator Marty. I am aware of the concern in the Council of Europe and the European Parliament at the practice of extraordinary rendition and of the objections to it by various people. I am also aware of the publicity surrounding the issue which was initiated by Human Rights Watch, <i>The Washington Post</i> and other concerned commentators and correspondents several years ago when the initial reports on the practice of extraordinary rendition were raised by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I recommend that people interested in the matter read Senator Marty's report in full. He makes it very clear that in so far as we in Ireland are concerned, Shannon's involvement was merely as a stopover for aeroplanes which had been used in rendition flights in Europe. He made it very clear that we should not lose our sense of proportion in this regard. He stated clearly in his report that of all the investigations he had carried out, he was talking of extraordinary rendition in only ten flights in all over a period of years — not thousands or hundreds of flights. Those ten flights involved 17 prisoners in total, all of whose cases were fully examined by the Senator and detailed in the report. We should not lose sight of the fact that none of those cases was in any way even remotely connected with Shannon or Ireland. If we lose our sense of proportion, we will confuse the public and create enormous confusion generally on the issue. The objective should be to find ways in which pressure can be brought on the United States and governments involved in the practice of extraordinary rendition to desist from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Senator Marty's report focused also not so much on flights but on allegations made that certain countries in Europe had secret detention centres. Romania and Poland were singled out in particular. It had also been suggested there might be similar detention centres for the carrying out of torture in other member states of the Council of Europe. Senator Marty's report confirms there is no factual evidence to link either of the countries mentioned as having secret detention centres and there was no formal evidence that any such detention centres were established in any member state of the Council of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">The Senator also makes it clear — the Parliamentary Assembly had already unreservedly shared the view of the United States Government — that there was a determination on the part of the US and all countries in Europe to combat international terrorism. International terrorism which is now highly mobilised and avails of modern telecommunications and technologies is a major threat to the international community. Therefore, there is a responsibility on all of us to work with the United States to end international terrorism, an example of which we saw on 11 September 2001 in New York.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">That event did not involve just ten flights carrying 17 people, but involved the indiscriminate slaughter of thousands of people by the activities of some of the people who would be loudest in their condemnation of rendition flights. They have no hesitation however in organising, through their cells and networks throughout the international community, renegades who are prepared to indiscriminately bomb, kill, slaughter or take any action they think necessary to undermine democracy and civilisation. Let us not forget that.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">In the conclusion of his report, Senator Marty quotes the Parliamentary Assembly. He makes it clear that in so far as the responsibility of the international community is concerned, it has an equal responsibility with the United States to find ways to combat international terrorism in order to put an end to the type of situation we saw in New York on 11 September 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">It is important to recognise that both the European Parliament and the Council of Europe are continuing their work in this regard. In light of this, it is totally unnecessary for the Seanad to get involved in a committee to deal with matters that are being dealt with at the highest level of Government. Those matters have been dealt with through the Council of Europe, through the legal affairs committee under Senator Marty and through the European Parliament. These have sought the help and assistance of European satellite communications and international aviation regulatory authorities, such as the Irish Aviation Authority and other authorities throughout Europe. In that situation, it would not be useful for us to become involved in the type of activity that is already being dealt with at high international level.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">The Parliamentary Assembly will also debate this matter. Senator Mooney is a member of the Parliamentary Assembly and the matter will be debated at the end of the month in Strasbourg.</p>

          <p eId="para_627">It is only a draft report. However, the draft report makes it very clear that while there is concern about rendition, we all oppose the use of the type of rendition described in it. Senator Marty describes it vividly and does not paint a pretty picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">There is another picture of which we must take account and we must not lose sight of some of the objectives some of us have, namely, to work through the international community to find ways to combat international terrorism, because nobody is immune from its activities.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_629">I support the motion that has been proposed by the Independent Senators. I thank Senator Norris and his colleagues for giving us another opportunity to discuss this matter, which we debated at length some months ago. On that occasion, I joined my party's spokesperson in outlining Fine Gael's position on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Fine Gael strongly believes that a select committee of this House should be established to investigate this matter in line with Irish constitutional and judicial practice and to ensure that a report is laid before both Houses. The argument that was made by the Government the last time we considered this matter, in opposition to another motion that was supported by Senator Norris, his Independent colleagues and others on this side of the House, was that we should wait for either the draft or finalised versions of the reports of two outstanding investigations, which were being concluded by the European Parliament and the Council of Europe at that time, before we reached any ultimate considerations. A more dangerous side of that argument was that there was no need for us to engage in any investigations, given that other bodies were engaging in investigations. That seems to be the tenor of the opposition that has been expressed to this motion this evening, but I reject it.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">As a sovereign Parliament, the Oireachtas should determine for itself, by means of an investigation, the level of disquiet that exists on this issue in Shannon and elsewhere in this country. This House has sought for many years to redefine its role, to make itself more relevant and to become more attuned to what the ordinary people of this country want. If ever there was an issue that necessitated the establishment of a select committee to report to this House and this sovereign Parliament within a set timeframe, it is this issue. I reject utterly the argument of those who oppose this motion that we cannot investigate this matter because other interests are investigating it. This is an important issue in Ireland and in many other EU countries. We should not leave it to others to investigate it or to come to conclusions on it. I am quite surprised that the Government has not proposed an amendment to this motion, setting out explicitly its reasons for rejecting the proposal to establish a committee of this nature, given the extent of the public disquiet that exists on this issue and the level of debate that followed the initial publication of both reports, one of which has been published in draft form.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">Senator Daly is absolutely right when he points out that, as a democratic society that is friendly with other democratic societies, we have a responsibility to counteract the fanatical form of terrorism that now exists throughout the world. We should do whatever we can to ensure that justice is brought to bear in these circumstances. There is no set of circumstances in which the war on terrorism can conceivably be won by those who are using illegal practices such as extraordinary rendition. There is no doubt that such practices have been allowed in the United States and other friendly countries for far too long.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">Countries like Ireland which have a long and historic tradition of friendliness and cultural ties with the people and Government of the US have a responsibility to be upfront and honest on this issue. I have said previously that I reject the Bush Administration's new approach to dealing with these matters. I refer to its blatant attempts to put to one side the legitimate concerns of many countries about the war on terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The great success of the US in the years after the Second World War was that it built a genuine multilateral approach to problems of this nature. The US and other countries helped to reconstruct Europe from the ashes of the Second World War, to establish the United Nations and to put in place an international code of law on the issues of human rights we are debating this evening. That code of law was fundamental to the development of a new world order after the Second World War. We should state honestly that there has been a reduction in such standards over the past seven years. All democrats who believe in an international order need to oppose that reduction strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I understand that the Government is in a difficult position on this issue for economic, commercial and other reasons. We are far too slow to express to our friends in the US Administration that we have concerns like those which are outlined in this motion. Such concerns relate to many aspects of US policy in Iraq and other parts of the world over recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">We now have an extraordinary opportunity to bring the issue of Seanad reform to centre stage. We can show the relevance of this House by quickly coming to a conclusion on an investigative matter about which Irish people are concerned. The House should demonstrate that it can respond quickly to such issues rather than divvying them up among the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. Things that happen on Irish territory are matters for Irish sovereignty. That is the issue which is at the heart of this debate. We will be in dereliction of our duty if once again the Government fails to allow us to conduct an investigation of the type that is described in the motion tabled by Senator Norris and his colleagues.</p>

They have been exceptionally forthright exponents of human rights in this House.

          <p eId="para_642">I have always maintained that the invasion was illegal, unnecessary and immoral. I am not interested in saying "I told you so" but one cannot deny that I have been proved right. Nobody can suggest that the terrorist threat is any less now than it was just after the terrible and tragic events of 11 September 2001. It can be argued, in many ways, that such terrorism has been exported throughout the world. As I said on the Order of Business yesterday, we have seen many excesses in Iraq and other parts of the world where pre-emptive strikes have taken place. A number of countries now subscribe to that approach, which seems to be commonplace, and many other countries have suffered as a result. I honestly do not believe we have gained any understanding, support or empathy from the latter group of countries — the opposite is the case. Diplomacy has absolutely and utterly broken down.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">One can only wonder what the future holds for us as a result of the damage which has been done. It was terrible and disastrous of one or two countries to ignore and undermine the United Nations, the unity of which had built up over the years and was so important to world peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The reason for some of this action has now been proved to be incorrect as there were no weapons of mass destruction. While I am aware that this point has been made 1,000 times, it must be made continually because this was the given reason for going to war. As there were no weapons of mass destruction, the premise on which the unilateral action of going to war was taken, which has endangered and engulfed the entire world in some ways, did not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">This means that at present, when I hear a statement coming from those same sources, my first reaction is disbelief, caution or doubt. In itself, this constitutes a danger, because it is vital for credibility to be part of any engagement or justification on behalf of people whom we would regard as our friends. I have nothing but admiration for America, which I know to be a sister nation. I am aware of the relationship which has built up. Members are aware that the relationship is not simply emotional or sentimental, but is much more pragmatic than that. As I noted on the Order of Business yesterday, it is unfair to criticise the people of America for the actions of their Administration.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">However, instead of considering such issues, Members must consider that Ireland has always been an honest broker in the world and has always been looked up to in this regard. Although I do not state this merely because I am a member of a Government party, Ireland has always acted honourably since the days of Frank Aiken. I have read Deputy Cowen's address to the United Nations repeatedly, in which Ireland took a stand. Moreover, Charlie Haughey, go ndéanfaidh Dia trócaire air, took a stand on Gibraltar. Ireland has always taken a conscientious stand for what is right, to give a voice to the voiceless, because this was also needed in its own history. Hence, I have always found it difficult to state that the Government has ever done anything that in any way justifies what is happening in these war-torn countries at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I have chosen to speak in this debate because some discussions took place on the Order of Business with regard to the committee which was to be established and it was suggested that Members were got at. I know that Senator Norris did not mean that in any derogatory sense, because he is extremely passionate about these issues, as are Senator Henry and many other Members. However, as for the issue of the committee, no one got at me. I was not aware of what was happening with regard to this committee until I heard that Members had been approached to join it, which surprised me.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">As I stated at the outset, I am glad this motion was tabled because I believe that whatever is done should be done on the floor of this Chamber. I am not in favour of the committee because it would detract from this Chamber. It would detract from the Seanad as a House of the Oireachtas and above all else, it would sideline and minimise it. What would be the committee's job? Would it be of an investigative nature? Would it be equipped to investigate? Would it be independent? Would it bring forward its own ideas and views? I do not support the idea of a committee and if Members are to have a debate, it should take place on the Chamber floor.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_659">I thank Senators Norris and Henry for tabling this motion. I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I look forward to his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">As for the issues raised by Senator Ó Murchú, I concurred with him until the final two minutes of his contribution. The Senator raised some valid points in an honest fashion. However, I refer to the point made earlier by Senator Brian Hayes, that this proposal is intended to adorn and give added value to the work of the Seanad. This proposal is what Members envisaged when discussing Seanad reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Senator Ó Murchú's point was that Members should not take this course of action because it would devalue and detract from the work of the House and that the debate should be conducted in the Chamber. He asked what the committee should do and whether it would be investigative. The answer is that as we speak, five hard-working Members are sitting on a committee, which was set up by the House to deal with a particular issue by sifting through the evidence and bringing the information back to it. I am the only Member who questioned whether this was an appropriate way forward and certainly no Government Member had a problem with it. I refer to the Committee on Article 35.4.1° of the Constitution. It is examining the evidence available and will present it to the House, where it will be discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">This is precisely what is proposed in this instance. It is not in any way different as it is concerned with collating information. What are Members afraid of? Information is being sought. A number of Members, including Senator Ó Murchú, made a point with which I agree. I do not know whether there is anything wrong going on at Shannon Airport. However, as Senator Mooney noted at the outset, my trust and confidence in what is going on there was demolished in his words, "in the dust of Shannon Airport last Sunday morning".</p>
          <p eId="para_663">How should the allegations be answered? Neither I nor any other Member can do so, although they can entertain suspicions or be in favour or against a particular opinion. The way to deal with a problem is to accumulate as much information as possible. In this case, and I find myself in complete agreement with Senator Brian Hayes, rather than asking someone in Switzerland or anywhere else to do it, Members should examine what is taking place in their own backyard and should assemble the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">A Government majority could be nominated to the committee, as this is not an issue. If evidence was put in front of them, I trust that all Members would make their own minds up. However, no Member in this debate has indicated why this proposal would be a bad thing. The issue of how people in the United States of America might react has been adequately dealt with by Members from all sides of the House. This proposal is not an indictment of the citizens of the United States, although it certainly denotes a questioning of its leadership. At the very least, a question mark exists in this respect, The events within Abu Ghraib took place within the past two years. Moreover, the House debated the International Criminal Court yesterday. For a long time, Members have been aware of the attitude of the present United States leadership towards the United Nations.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">These are issues on which we have held different points of view and we need to remind ourselves of that. Although this opinion might not be shared throughout the House, any self-respecting public representative in a democracy must question what is happening in Guantanamo Bay. We need not question the guilt of the people, but the arrangement by which they are exiled onto foreign soil to ensure they have no access to the human and civil rights of the home state. I have a question about that. I do not expect people to agree with me. We know what has happened in the past week. If somebody tells me that people who go on hunger strike or die do so as a publicity lark I do not have trust and confidence in that suggestion. While I do not know what is happening in Shannon, there is doubt in my mind what I would like to have filled. There is a vacuum of information, and nature abhors a vacuum. I would like us to put the information together and have it available.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Another issue is that of military law. I listened to Senator Minihan's statement. What is the appropriateness of having two systems of law in a country? I followed closely last week's trial of members of the Irish guards in London and I conclude that the civil rights of soldiers, as citizens, are not being properly observed in the courts martial to which they are subject. Some military people feel they are in a parallel universe to the rest of a democracy and that they can run a different system of rights. We have always understood that to be the case in a war situation where people have to engage and summary justice has to be dealt. However, where we are examining the rights of people and how they are to be judged, military law is inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">In Senator Norris's mild and simple proposal we are asking to establish a committee to put as much information together as we can and after this to do what Senator Ó Murchú suggested, namely, bring it here and make our minds up. It is an intellectual exercise to come to the conclusion that it is better to make decisions based on information gathered by people we trust and know, our people, than to try and do so in a vacuum. I cannot answer the question.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I have been careful and have disagreed with Senator Norris on many occasions about Seanad business. I have listened to Senator Dooley and others talk about it from another point of view and I have not agreed with them either. I am in the middle. However, I know the issue raised here is appropriate in a democracy and would put together the process by which we would gather information to allow us to come to our own conclusions. Although we may not agree on these conclusions, it would move us forward. When we deny ourselves access to information it seems people see information as a Pandora's box, which is not always the case. When we have the information it will illuminate the problem and allow us to come to a conclusion. While I would trust Senator Ó Murchú to come to a conclusion no different to my own if he had the information on this issue, I cannot allow the House to vote to deny itself the opportunity to gain information and come to a conclusion. I support the motion.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_669">I welcome this opportunity to address the Seanad again on this issue. As Senators may recall, in March I had the privilege of addressing this House on the subject of extraordinary rendition. I wish to place on record once again the Government's opposition to the practice of extraordinary rendition. This has been the Government's constant position since the existence of this practice was revealed. It has been made clear to the US authorities on numerous occasions, including at the very highest levels. As stated by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, in Dáil Éireann last night, the Irish Government was the first government to raise this matter with the US Government, just as he was the first Minister to raise it with our EU colleagues last autumn, under the British Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">Extraordinary rendition is a subject in which Ireland has taken a leading, proactive role. We are in an unparalleled position regarding the unqualified, categorical assurances that we have received from the US authorities on this matter, both in terms of their specificity and of the level at which they were given. The United States authorities have declined to issue similar blanket assurances to most other member states. We are one of only three countries in this position in Europe. Those who speak of the Government's doing nothing wilfully overlook the fact that we acted swiftly and decisively to confirm the realities of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">Before addressing the substance of the motion before us, I wish to emphasise one important fact. Since I last spoke in the Seanad, no new evidence has emerged to implicate Ireland in any way in this practice. A number of investigations are being carried out in Europe into this matter, analysing flight patterns, satellite photographs and other sources of intelligence. Nothing that has been unearthed suggests that prisoners may have been transported through Ireland as part of an extraordinary rendition operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I reiterate the point made in Dáil Éireann last night, that in his recent report Senator Dick Marty makes no claim that prisoners may have been subject to extraordinary rendition through Ireland. It is encouraging to see that Senator Marty follows the approach of the executive director of Amnesty International in Ireland, Mr. Seán Love, who wrote in February last that those who "continue to focus their debate about ‘extraordinary renditions', on whether or not prisoners have been or are being transferred through Irish Airports...are missing the point".</p>

          <p eId="para_678">In opposing the motion before this House I will, in particular, address two points. The first is the publication of a recent report which is not, as is suggested by the motion before this House, of the Council of Europe, but of a rapporteur of one of its committees, Senator Marty. I will then address the State's fulfilment of its positive obligations to prevent torture and other abuses. In so doing I also hope to clear up the misunderstanding that has led to the erroneous suggestion made in the Private Members' motion that there is confusion about the Garda Síochána's right to investigate these aircraft.</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_680">I agree that, despite the pervasive lack of hard evidence, aspects of Senator Marty's report are deeply disturbing. In particular, detailed descriptions of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners make harrowing reading. The Government is, of course, completely opposed to torture, but that is not the issue. Senator Marty's report produces no evidence to implicate the Government in the practice. As was noted in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> over the weekend with respect to Ireland, “there is no proof of anything”.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">On top of the lack of evidence, there is a lack of a clear chain of reasoning. Instead there are cursory assertions, including one that Ireland "could be held responsible for collusion" for being a "stopover" for flights, involving the unlawful transfer of detainees. On behalf of the Government I reject this assertion, which seems to be based, as I will go on to explain, on an implausible, ill-founded analysis of what might conceivably have been possible for us to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Senator Marty fails to take account of our opposition to extraordinary rendition and the categoric assurances which we have received that it does not take place through Ireland. To allege collusion without addressing either of those points is grossly unfair. To compound this, neither Senator Marty nor anyone acting on his behalf approached the Government or our representatives on this matter. As I noted at the outset of my speech, the Council of Europe committee on legal affairs has not adopted Senator Marty's report. Senator Norris clearly implied that category A was the worst category.</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_695">It has been the Government's consistent position that we will consider carefully with partners any specific and workable recommendations that may be made by either the Council of Europe or the European Parliament in this area. We have made this quite clear on every occasion. I anticipate that much of what both bodies will have to say will require coordinated action at a European level, if it is to be effective. The Government will, of course, maintain its position at the forefront of efforts to ensure that international law is adhered to in all aspects on this matter, and that any gaps identified in the existing regulatory regimes are filled with utmost urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Some commentators, including some in this House, have claimed that every type of diplomatic assurance is now suspect or insufficient. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs explained yesterday, such a development would represent a revolution in international relations. In the Government's view, it is wholly unwarranted.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">In its response to the questionnaire circulated by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr. Terry Davis, the Government outlined in very considerable detail its view of our international law obligations relating to our positive obligation to prevent torture. In his preliminary analysis of the responses received, the Secretary General made no indication that he had any objection to our Government's position on this matter, though it was clear from his analysis that he had read our response fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">In essence, as Deputy Dermot Ahern made clear in a letter earlier this year to the Irish Human Rights Commission, it is the Government's view that there is a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the relevant international case law. This does not in fact deal with assurances generally but rather, and explicitly, with assurances given about the treatment of particular individuals, extradited or expelled from one state to another.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Contrary to what has been asserted by some, the European Court of Human Rights has never held that a factual assertion by a state on a matter directly within its full control cannot be relied upon. It is highly relevant in this context to note that the court has stated its respect for the comity of nations, and has also held that the convention must be interpreted in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Suggestions of collusion and failure to fulfil positive obligations may have some basis when applied to states which wilfully ignore potential illegality on their territory, but that is clearly not the case with Ireland. We were the first Government, when rumours of extraordinary rendition emerged, to raise concerns about the matter with US authorities. We were the first Government to demand assurances that our territory would not be used for such purposes. To speak of a failure to act, which is the essence of the charge on positive obligations, against such a background of pro-active intervention, is simply unreasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Government cannot agree with the suggestion that our positive obligations under international law may require that searches of aircraft be carried out. It has repeatedly been made clear that the Garda Síochána has the powers it needs to investigate all reasonable allegations of illegal activity. There is no legal bar to searching civilian aircraft of the type allegedly involved where there is a basis for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Regarding suggestions of deliberate ignorance and wilful blindness the issue of rights of search provides a useful example. Those who oppose the Government's position on this matter have suggested that no right of search exists, and that the Garda authorities have been instructed not to search aircraft. They suggest this despite having been provided with long and detailed documents outlining the relevant powers of search and in the face of Garda and DPP investigations into complaints that have revealed nothing. Their issue is not, if the truth be told, with the procedures used to investigate, but with the results.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Regarding the practicalities of search, identification by NGOs and the media of aircraft that are alleged to have been involved in extraordinary rendition has been possible only months, at the earliest, after such operations are said to have taken place. Furthermore, civilian aircraft of the type in question are not, under international law, required to apply for permission to land, meaning that a transited country may have very little notice of the arrival of such an aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">In this context, a regime of random search and inspection would be of very limited value in achieving the desired goal. Moreover, given that at worst the allegations are that such aircraft passed empty through Ireland, it is impossible to see how even if such aircraft were to be identified and searched, the outcome of such searches would shed any light on the matter. It is far more effective, and in the Government's view better fulfils our positive obligations, to have sought and received specific factual and unqualified assurances in the manner that we have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The Government's approach to the subject of extraordinary rendition is one of continued engagement with the United States. This approach has allowed us to raise our concerns early, both bilaterally and in an EU framework, to receive considered responses, and ultimately the Government believes, to fulfil our obligations under both international and domestic law in the most comprehensive manner possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I would like to brief Senators on a recent, quite separate, incident at Shannon and on how the Government has reacted to it. The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed Dail Éireann yesterday evening that the Department of Foreign Affairs was contacted by the US Embassy and informed that last Sunday, 11 June, a civilian aircraft landed at Shannon for a technical refuelling stop <i>en route</i> from Kuwait to the United States. Among other unarmed military personnel, the aeroplane was carrying a US marine convicted of a minor breach of the US military code. He was in military custody and was wearing military fatigues.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">While the transfer of such a prisoner would have been lawful under both international and domestic laws, it requires the consent of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The US authorities did not seek such consent and this failure, though inadvertent, is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The US ambassador was summoned to Iveagh House, where the Minister outlined our very grave concerns. The ambassador confirmed the sequence of events and made clear that the failure to seek consent arose from an administrative error. He conveyed his deep regret for the breach of procedures and undertook to urgently advise his authorities in the US of the Government's views. He also confirmed his willingness to review the situation immediately, with a view to ensuring that there is no recurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The Cabinet discussed the matter yesterday, and it was decided to make public our grave concern. We have asked for a full written report from the US Embassy. In addition, to ensure that appropriate steps are taken to prevent any recurrence of this incident, we will engage in further discussions with the US authorities on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">While I would reiterate that this incident is unconnected to allegations of extraordinary rendition, it is essential, not least in the interests of public confidence, that the Government take appropriate steps in response to such a breach. My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, already announced measures in this regard yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I have listened with interest to the debate and Senator Norris has already quoted from the Marty report. His quotes from that report regarding the inhumane treatment of prisoners are not connected with any incidents in this country. I share all Senators' views on reports of inhumane treatment and torture of prisoners. This Government abhors such practices and has made that clear regarding the use of extraordinary rendition. This point has been made in this country, in the US, in Europe and at the UN and other international fora. We are proud to do so and we are consistent on this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The Government's consistent and long-standing position on the issue of extraordinary rendition is quite clear. We utterly condemn it, in no way do we facilitate it, and looking to the future we are willing, with our partners, to consider any practicable and specific proposals which the Council of Europe, the European Parliament or any other body may make to reduce the possibility of future cases occurring.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">We utterly reject any allegation of collusion in this practice. Indeed we reject any suggestion, which I have shown by the facts, to be groundless, that we have failed to meet our obligations. Ireland's efforts in this area have been prompt, timely and effective. I urge the Senators to reject the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_720">The Minister of State also made a comment which is deliberately, clearly and demonstrably untrue. Just five minutes ago he stated there was no single case in the Marty report which had any connection with Ireland. That is absolute tripe.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I present the case of Abu Omar. Senator Marty's explanatory memorandum to the report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_722">At midday on 17 June 2003, Hassam Osama Mustafa Nasr, known as Abu Omar, an Egyptian citizen, was abducted in the middle of Milan. Thanks to an outstanding and tenacious investigation by the Milan judiciary and the DIGOS police services, Abu Omar's is undoubtedly one of the best-known and best-documented cases of "extraordinary rendition". Via the military airbases at Aviano (Italy) and Ramstein (Germany), Abu Omar was flown to Egypt, where he was tortured before being released and re-arrested. To my knowledge, no proceedings were brought against Abu Omar in Egypt. The Italian judicial investigation established beyond all reasonable doubt that the operation was carried out by the CIA (which has not issued any denials). The Italian investigators likewise established that the presumed leader of the abduction operation — who had also worked as the American consul in Milan — was in Egypt for two weeks immediately after Abu Omar was handed over to the Egyptian authorities. It may safely be inferred that he contributed, in one way or another, to Abu Omar's interrogation. The proceedings instituted in Milan concern 25 American agents, against 22 of whom the Italian judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants. Abu Omar was a political refugee. Suspected of Islamic militancy, he had been under surveillance by the Milan police and judicial authorities. As a result of the surveillance operation, the Italian police were probably on the verge of uncovering an activist network operating in northern Italy. Abu Omar's abduction, as the Milan judicial authorities expressly point out, sabotaged the Italian surveillance operation and thereby dealt a blow to the fight against terrorism. Is it conceivable or possible that an operation of that kind, with deployment of resources on that scale in a friendly country that was an ally (being a member of the coalition in Iraq), was carried out without the national authorities — or at least Italian opposite numbers — being informed? ... There has recently been a significant new development in the investigation by the Milan prosecuting authorities, however: an agent belonging to an elite <i>Carabinieri</i> unit has admitted taking part in Abu Omar’s abduction as part of an operation co-ordinated by the SISMI, the military intelligence services.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">With regard to what was said about assurances, they are not worth a damn. Both the Minister of State and I know that. The Minister of State knows the definition of torture given by Condoleezza Rice, even with regard to the case of Guantanamo, where there is a degree of visibility, was that hooding, white noise and sleep deprivation were used. The Minister of State should be ashamed to sit there as a member of Fianna Fáil and a Government which took the United Kingdom Government to the European Court of Human Rights on those three grounds exactly and tried to defend it.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">It is a shame on this House. I am disgusted. There is a case for reform of the Seanad. The reform should involve removing these rotten constituencies whose candidates are elected by fewer than 1,000 county councillors. We should have some real democracy, as is evident with the university seats. We are elected by a real number of real voters without vested interests.</p>

Paragraph 233 of the explanatory memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_730">The principle of trust has been invoked by other governments. This is the case with Ireland, for example: the government has stated there was no reason to investigate the presence of American aircraft, since the United States had given assurances.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">I wish to explore the matter of the recognition of foreign driving licences. Section 8 sets out a process whereby driving licences issued in other jurisdictions can be exchanged for Irish driving licences. I was surprised when I read this. I am not clear on the background and perhaps the Minister of State will help me with it. My understanding was that European Union issued driving licences were recognised in Ireland without a need for exchange. Will the Minister of State explain the purpose of the section? Is it intended purely for those who hold driving licences issued outside the European Union? Must one exchange licences in any event?</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Having teased that matter out we can move on to the more important issue as to the recognition of penalty points and offences committed in other jurisdictions. It seems this issue is becoming much more important in terms of enforcement. As the numbers of foreign drivers and foreign cars on the road increase, it is important that we be in a position to exchange information with the authorities in other jurisdictions on offences committed in those jurisdictions. It is important that we be in a position to recognise the equivalent of penalty points and disqualifications imposed in other jurisdictions. What is the purpose of the section? Having recognised the validity of foreign licences, are we in a position to recognise disqualifications imposed by foreign courts?</p>

          <p eId="para_793">Senator McDowell raised very important points on the licensing arrangement for foreign drivers in Ireland. Will a reciprocal arrangement apply to Irish drivers in other parts of Europe, be it in England, Germany, Spain or France?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_794">Section 8 recognises foreign licences and provides that the Minister may, by order, recognise a driving licence issued by another country for the purpose of exchanging it for an Irish one. This does not happen automatically. Driving licence exchange arrangements operate in respect of licences issued by member states of the European Union and European Economic Area. These arrangements are based on provisions of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">On the issue of exchange arrangements pertaining to licences issued by states outside the European Union, a number of countries, such as Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, South Korea, Japan, Jersey and the Isle of Man, have been declared recognised states for licence exchange purposes by order under the regulations. It is now considered that the power in the regulations to declare such countries as recognised states may be <i>ultra vires</i> and require primary legislative provision and therefore section 8 is included in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Foreign licences are only recognised for exchange purposes where the licensing system in the foreign country in question meets the standards required by the EU directive on driver licensing and where there is reciprocal recognition of Irish driving licences in that country. It is interesting to note that Great Britain and Northern Ireland do not have a reciprocal arrangement with Ireland in respect of penalty points. We are in discussions with the United Kingdom at official level to bring one about and I have discussed the matter with my UK counterpart. There should be a reciprocal arrangement and it is important that it includes both the Republic and Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The recognition of penalty points throughout Europe is very much at the embryonic stage and the Minister and I would like to see further developments in this regard. If a foreign licence is exchanged, the licensee then holds an Irish licence but a licence issued in another member state does not attract penalty points awarded on Irish roads. We are anxious to pursue this and I hope some progress can be made at European level.</p>

It is very restrictive to legislate for the fee one can charge because there are different standards and levels of driving instruction. I hope all instructors will be teaching the same skills but some driving schools will have single operators while others will operate on a national basis. Some will feel they must charge more than others because they believe they are operating to a higher standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The Minister of State should accept my amendment because the requirement that all instructors must charge the same fee, as implied in the existing provision, is anti-competitive.

          <p eId="para_821">Paragraph (<i>p</i>) outlines the fees licensed instructors may charge for such courses of instruction. This enables the fees to be charged by driving instructors for compulsory courses of instruction to be regulated. The main purpose of the provisions in the previous paragraphs (<i>m</i>), (<i>n</i>), (<i>o</i>) and also (<i>p</i>) is to provide for the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motor cyclists. That is not an unreasonable provision to include in the Bill as it seeks to control a charge which will be levied on an individual to meet regulatory requirements. I recognise, however, that there may be concerns that the imposition of such a control may dissuade service providers from offering the necessary training. I will consider that aspect before Report Stage tomorrow and come back to the Senator on it. I see the danger of such a control being dissuasive, which is not what we want to achieve. We want to entice people to do this. I will consider the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_834">A licence is a very important document to each and every individual. I appreciate the Senator's concern that licence holders may not be aware that their licence has expired and that they should receive reminders from local authorities. Arrangements are now being made with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which holds and administers the national driver file to which we have access, to have renewal notices issued to licence holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">It should be noted that a significant number of licence holders will have changed address in the ten-year period of their licence and will not receive the notice if they have moved. If they have moved there is an obligation to advise the local authority of their new address. If an amendment along the lines proposed by Senator Burke were inserted, people who had let their licence lapse could plead that they had not received a renewal licence and that would weaken this provision considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">We have catered in the Bill for what Senator Burke is proposing in that licences will issue but it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure they have a current licence. To accept this amendment would put too great an onus on us when we are making arrangements with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to issue notices. That goes part of the way towards catering for the principle in Senator Burke's amendment.</p>

As I explained, arrangements are being made with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which holds the national file, to have renewal notices issued to holders. I am sure they will receive those but if they have changed address there is an obligation on them to inform the relevant local authority. If they do not do that and the licence is not received, they could use the defence that they did not receive it through no fault of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the local authority or the file. Only those who change address, therefore, would have a difficulty. If they were waiting on a cheque from a Department they would readily inform the relevant Department. It is only a matter of them informing the local authority that they have moved, and I believe we are talking about a very small percentage of people.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_843">13.—The Principal Act is amended by the insertion the Principal of the following new section after section 55:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_844">"55A.—(1) A person shall not park a vehicle—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_845">(<i>a</i>) whose weight unladen exceeds maximum permitted weight,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_846">(<i>b</i>) whose weight laden exceeds maximum permitted weight, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_847">(<i>c</i>) any part of which transmits to ground greater weight than maximum permitted weight.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_848">(2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_849">(<i>a</i>) in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding €80, or</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_850">(<i>b</i>) in the case of a second or any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding €200 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months or to both.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">This amendment makes it an offence to park in an area in which weight restrictions are in place. For example, lorries above a certain weight should not be allowed to park in a housing estate. Amendment No. 98 seeks to increase the number of penalty points for vehicles driving in weight restricted zones. Amendment No. 99, I believe, is based on amendment No. 85.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">There should be restrictions imposed as regards some areas, for example housing estates, as I have outlined, where vehicles above a certain weight may not be parked. The amendment makes provision for penalty points to be imposed where such an infringement occurs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_853">I want to speak to amendment No. 98, which is tabled in my name. The Minister of State will be aware that in the suburban settings of large cities such as Dublin, Cork, or wherever, the local authorities are regularly asked by community organisations whether three-tonne weight restriction areas, for instance, may be put in place. The local authority establishes a committee, gets Garda advice and a decision is taken. Let us say a three-tonne weight limit zone is put into a residential area to prevent heavy goods vehicles and lorries driving through a locality where ostensibly there are houses and communities. I am asking the Government, in this amendment, to apply penalty points for a heavy goods vehicle above a certain weight if it is found they are encroaching on an area. It is evident the Garda does not enforce this.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Penalty points would at least be a significant arm of enforcement in terms of a commercial company. The drivers, in effect, would not be receiving the penalty points, but the company. It is important to do this, not just from an enforcement, but also from a community viewpoint. The community looks to the local authority to enforce the law in this regard, but it is not being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">I ask the Minister of State to give consideration to this, to extend the penalty points for this specific area, so that if heavy goods vehicles and lorries are rattling through housing estates over traffic calming measures, barriers, etc., where children are playing, there should be very strict enforcement. The way to do that is through penalty points. It has been put to me by one organisation in my area and it has asked me to seek to get it incorporated into the legislation. If it is not possible by way of this amendment, perhaps the Minister of State might give the matter some thought and come back to it in the other House. Nonetheless, it would be a sensible extension of the role of the penalty points system. It would put pressure on the Garda to enforce the law once the local authorities had established three-tonne weight limit restriction areas.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_328" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_856">I am dealing, first of all, with amendment No. 93 in the name of Senator Paddy Burke. It proposes that a new section, section 55A, be inserted in the Road Traffic Act 1961 to provide that a person shall not park a vehicle whose weight exceeds a maximum permitted weight and to specify the penalties to apply on conviction on the grounds of a contravention of the parking prohibition. The present position is that in respect of the use of a vehicle or a combination of vehicles on a public road, the Minister for Transport has regulated under section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, specifying the maximum permitted unladen weight, the maximum permitted laden weight and the maximum permitted weight to be transmitted to ground by any part of a vehicle. It is an offence for any person to contravene the permitted maximum weights prescribed by the Minister. If he or she is not the owner of the vehicle, such owner and the person shall each be guilty of an offence. A section 12 contravention is scheduled to be a penalty point offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The offence of using a vehicle that exceeds the maximum permitted weight in any of the circumstances regulated for is scheduled in the First Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2002 to attract one penalty point on payment of a fixed charge and three penalty points on conviction in court. Amendment No. 98 in the name of Senator Brian Hayes relates to the First Schedule to the Road Traffic Act 2002, which sets out the offences to which penalty points can be applied and proposes a change as regards the existing provision in respect of offences under section 12 of the Road Traffic Act 1961. At present the three offences under section 12 of the Act of using a vehicle that exceeds the maximum permitted rate are scheduled to attract two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge and three penalty points on conviction in court. Senator Brian Hayes proposes in this amendment two penalty points and a charge or four penalty points on conviction in court. We both agree and accept the principle. We both agree that it should be two penalty points on payment of a fixed charge and otherwise three penalty points, whereas Senator Brian Hayes says it should be four penalty points. In line with the principle involved, I believe that the three penalty points will be effective.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_858">I ask the Minister of State to give serious consideration to Senator Brian Hayes's amendment. As an urban representative, I believe this is more prevalent in cities than in rural areas. As an urban representative, however, as with Senator Brian Hayes, seeking to have these permits or bans put into local areas, the Garda seem to ignore the problem for some reason and local residents do not even phone anymore to complain that vehicles over the limit are parked in their areas. Oftentimes they park in playgrounds or adjoining tennis courts and they take up large areas. These are often articulated vehicles which are parked for entire weekends in play areas and cause grave inconvenience. They will have gone by 6 a.m. on a Monday, having arrived at 8 p.m. on the previous Friday. I believe the present system is not working adequately and I ask the Minister of State to seriously consider Senator Brian Hayes's amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_330">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_859">The key problem is peak traffic time for those vehicles going through areas. As Senator Morrissey has said, there are other problems, associated with people parking those vehicles over a weekend or for a day or so. We need to send out a very strong message in the legislation that this is not permissible. Businesses, wherever they operate, have a responsibility to abide by the law. The way to get the message through to businesses which continually flout the law in this area is to indicate that it will come down heavily on them. If their drivers are caught in residential areas they will be fined, receive penalty points and the law will come down hard on them. That is the only way they will take any notice and that is the message the Bill needs to send out. I ask the Minister to examine the matter again rather than giving the House a definitive view on it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">It is interesting that there was some disagreement in what I had heard from the Department and from our own people on this issue. It has now been clarified that penalty points exist, but I believe they are not enough. We need to come down heavily in this regard. We are not coming down heavily on drivers because they are working for a business. However, they cause enormous encroachment in large-scale residential areas, particularly around peak-time. They know the rat-runs and the short-cuts and they use them to best effect. They go over speed bumps and will use whatever roadways are available even though, as Senator Morrissey said, the roads may be beside play areas. It is not acceptable in this day and age that large articulated lorries can be allowed to go through residential areas. I ask the Minister of State to give the matter further consideration.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_331" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_861">Perhaps it is a fixed charge we should be looking at. If the companies are prepared to pay the fixed charge, both Senator Brian Hayes and I are at one on this, two penalty points plus a fixed charge. For those who are not prepared to pay the fixed charge, I believe in this regard that it is a matter of enforcement and that the two penalty points and a fixed charge should have the desired effect. I fully agree that these areas should not be used as rat-runs. We are all familiar with the sign that states that the maximum weight is 3.5 tonnes and that there is no entry for these vehicles, except in certain circumstances, such as pick-up points for furniture removals. I appreciate that is not the point being made by the Deputy. They should not be going through residential areas where children are playing, nor should they park there overnight or at weekends.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">It is at the discretion of the Minister to increase penalty points. If it is required to do that, I will recommend it to the Minister, but there is very little between us on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_868">The Minister for Transport has power to declare offences to be fixed-charge offences for the purpose of enforcement under section 103 of the Road Traffic Act. The purpose of these amendments is to amend section 14 of the Bill to extend the range of offences that can be declared to be fixed-charge offences, and to provide that offences under the Road Transport Acts or any statutory instruments implementing certain European legislation can now also be deemed to be fixed-charge offences, subject to regulations being made by the Minister. These offences relate to road haulage and passenger transport sectors. This would enable departmental transport offices — soon to be part of the Road Safety Authority — to issue fixed-charge notices to hauliers or bus operators who are stopped at checkpoints and are found to be breaking road transport licensing laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I intend to table two further amendments to this section on Report Stage.

          <p eId="para_885">This amendment relates to the NCT test. We have heard much about this test in the past 18 months. If a driver does not have an NCT disk on his or her car, he or she currently does not receive any penalty points. However, the driver may be brought to court where he or she can receive five penalty points. These amendments will provide that the driver can receive two penalty points before going to court, or four penalty points in court. The current enforcement of the letter of the law is very severe and this amendment would be more appropriate.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_886">The purpose of the inclusion of Part 8 to the First Schedule to the Road Traffic Act is to make the offence of not having a valid certificate of roadworthiness for a commercial vehicle a penalty point offence. Part 8 removes the anomaly in this offence, as the equivalent offence for not having a valid NCT certificate for a car has been listed as a penalty point offence since 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The penalty points regime to apply under Part 8 is identical to that which is already in place for the NCT certificate offence. Failure to have an NCT certificate or a certificate of roadworthiness for a liable vehicle is a serious offence. A person convicted of not having an NCT certificate for a car on two occasions within a period of three years will, in addition to the normal penalty — a fine of €1,500, a prison term of up to three months, or both — be disqualified from driving a vehicle for six months. Given that a disqualification from driving could arise as a direct consequence of being convicted for failure to have a valid NCT certificate, the fixed charge payment arrangement does not apply in regard to that offence. As the penalty points regime applying to cars and the consequential driving disqualification has been extended to goods vehicles and buses by this Bill, it would not be appropriate, for the reasons previously mentioned, to apply the fixed charge payment arrangement to this new category of penalty points offence, which Senator Paddy Burke proposes in his amendment No. 102.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">Amendment No. 103 which proposes that the number of penalty points on conviction for not having a valid certificate of roadworthiness should be four instead of five, as provided for in this Bill, would introduce an inconsistency between cars and other vehicles for penalty purposes for what are essentially identical offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_897">Council Directive 96/96/EC specifies clearly the categories of vehicles liable to testing, the minimum frequency of testing of vehicles, the times they must be tested and the arrangements for testing. The directive requires that a vehicle liable to roadworthiness testing must be tested in the member state in which it is registered and that proof of passing a roadworthiness test issued by that member state must be recognised in other member states. The requirement that it is tested in the member state in which it is registered would preclude the Minister from making foreign registered vehicles subject to compulsory roadworthiness tests here.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Motor vehicles brought into Ireland from abroad, other than those brought in temporarily by visitors, must be registered with the Revenue Commissioners by the end of the next working day following their arrival in the State. Once a vehicle is registered by the Revenue Commissioners, it then becomes liable to roadworthiness testing in accordance with Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">These amendments will strengthen the enforcement arrangements in regard to compliance with compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing by foreign registered vehicles using Irish roads. The inclusion of these amendments and this section in the Bill will be beneficial because, as the Senator is aware, many of the vehicles involved in accidents and the far too many fatalities that occur here involve foreign registered vehicles.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_900">This provision is an interesting and important innovation. Section 19(<i>a</i>)(<i>b</i>) is broadly phrased in that it allows a vehicle to be impounded if, in the opinion of a garda, it is being used without a roadworthiness certificate having been issued in the country where it was registered. I take it from that there is no obligation on foreign drivers or drivers of foreign registered cars to display the equivalent of an NCT certificate. This section appears to allow a garda to form an opinion that, for example, a car that is registered in Poland appears to be a wreck and that he or she will impound it without any evidential requirement beyond that. Perhaps that is a good and necessary measure, but I wonder why the paragraph is phrased in that fashion.</p>

          <p eId="para_901">I am advised it is a matter for each member state to decide on its own practical arrangements. A sensible arrangement is in place here whereby the certificate is required to be displayed on the windscreen of the vehicle, but if that is not the practice or law in another member state, we cannot compel foreign motorists to do that. However, a motorist must have such a certificate in his or her possession and be able to present it to the Garda. When such a certificate is displayed on the windscreen of a vehicle it is easily recognisable and it is in the interests of motorists to do so. We appeal to the citizens of other member states residing here who are not compelled to display such a certificate on the windscreen of their vehicles to do so voluntarily until such time as there is consistency across the EU in this regard.</p>

Section 24 of the 2003 Act was commenced with the establishment of the Commission for Taxi Regulation and the amendments to section 36 will have effect on the date of commencement of the relevant provisions of the section, under the Taxi Regulation Act 2003. It is the first step towards giving full effect to the provisions of section 36, as amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">An order has been made commencing subsections (2)(<i>a</i>), (3)(<i>a</i>) and (4) of the section with effect from 25 May 2006. The measures in these subsections give existing licenceholders or applicants who had been convicted of specified offences an opportunity to apply to the courts in advance of the full commencement of section 36 to be allowed to apply for a licence under such terms as a court may direct.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">One of the amendments to this Bill is intended to clarify that in dealing with such applications the court may have regard to the person's conduct since conviction and his or her suitability to hold a licence. Further consultation will be required before a decision is taken to commence in full the provisions of section 36 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 as amended by section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 2004. The commencement date will be determined when all the necessary arrangements have been settled in consultation with the Commission for Taxi Regulation, the Garda, the Courts Service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. An appropriate period of advance notice of the proposed commencement of the section will be required to allow persons who may be affected by the provisions in particular existing licence holders to clarify the position with the courts, if at any stage they have not already done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The relevant commencement order will be made under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, and it is expected later in the year to make the necessary order to commence the provisions of the sections of the Bill. For that reason it is not possible to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for coming into the House. He takes a particular interest in disability. I met the Brothers of Charity Services and the Galway Association last Monday regarding issues they brought to my attention, chiefly, what they describe as serious emergencies in their region. They pointed out that as many as 75 people with urgent needs, whom the HSE rates as critical and requiring service immediately, cannot be offered those services under the 2006 budget. I hope this issue can be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">I am disappointed that in recent years the former Western Health Board tended to divide its money in the ratio of 3:2:1 between Galway, Mayo and Roscommon, respectively. This arose in many areas, for example, special housing aid for the elderly, in respect of which the money was underspent in Mayo for two years. Mayo gave €300,000 to Galway, which must pay it back. It is a ridiculous mathematical formula and I am sure the Minister of State would prefer to see assessment of needs as the criterion for allocating funding, whether in respect of housing aid for the elderly or disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">There is also a problem in regard to occupational therapy and physiotherapy. The associations to which I spoke have the personnel but need funding. They asked whether funding could be provided for their associations out of the dormant accounts fund. Western Care also does good work, particularly in County Mayo. Significant numbers of people help these associations through fund raising. In my parish and in many parishes in east Galway there are church gate collections every year to help them with their excellent work. They may have been forgotten somewhat under the health boards, but I hope that separate allocations will now be provided for each county and that these will be based on the assessment of needs rather than any mathematical formula, a method which is out of date and no longer acceptable. I thank the Minister of State for his attendance and hope he has good news for me on the allocation of funding for this year.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_918">I hope I can assist Senator Kitt in this matter of great concern to him. I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Tim O'Malley, Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children. I will outline to the House the position regarding the additional funding provided for services for children and adults with disabilities in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">Under the multiannual investment programme 2006-09, which is part of the national disability strategy, additional funding amounting to €51.5 million has been provided by the Government in 2006 to meet costs associated with the provision of certain specific high profile disability services. With regard to services for persons with intellectual disability and those with autism, this includes 255 new residential places, 85 new respite places, 535 new day places and the continuation of the implementation of the transfer of persons with intellectual disability or autism from psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">In addition to the aforementioned services, further additional funding of €22.5 million has been provided for 2006. This has been allocated to enhance the multidisciplinary support services for children and adults with physical, sensory and intellectual disabilities and those with autism and to address core underfunding and core staffing issues in services for people with disabilities provided by the voluntary sector. Capital funding amounting to €45 million has also been provided in 2006 to put in place the infrastructural supports associated with the aforementioned developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">The Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes the provision of additional funding for disability services in the counties referred to by Senator Kitt. I am advised that the Health Service Executive's distribution of disability development funding is based on population considerations and on contractual arrangements entered into by the executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">I suggest that the Senator should obtain confirmation of this from the executive in light of the matter he has raised. If he does not obtain satisfaction, he would be more than entitled to persist on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">In these circumstances, decisions on the exact distribution of funding between areas of counties are a matter for the Health Service Executive.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_924">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to the House. This motion seeks that the Minister for Education and Science insists on the retention of the UCD research farm at Lyons Estate, Straffan, County Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">I ask this because the Lyons Estate has provided extensive research and development for agriculture since it was first purchased in 1962 by the agriculture department of UCD. The 1,300 acres of the estate were used for agricultural research and development. Unfortunately, some years ago over 800 acres of the farm were sold, resulting in a downgrading of research and development on the estate.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">This has occurred at a time when agriculture needs are changing rapidly. The greatest need we have in the agriculture area now is for research and development of new techniques and production and new crops, etc. The very opposite is happening in the agriculture department in UCD. The great fear is that the department will move from the Lyons estate to an urban area. As the Minister of State represents a Dublin constituency, he should be aware there is not much opportunity for agricultural research in the Dublin urban area. In fact, the UCD agriculture department was in Glasnevin for a while, but it moved from there because of the inability to conduct worthwhile research there.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">I will give an example of what happened previously in the agriculture research department of UCD. It made a great advance in the production of maize animal feed and pioneered a development in this area. Due to our shorter growing season for maize as animal feed the agriculture department pioneered the idea of sowing it under plastic. Many countries, particularly countries of northern Europe, have come here to study and copy what was developed here through the inventiveness and research of the UCD agriculture department.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">If we allow agricultural research decline at UCD, we will no longer have a college providing a pure agriculture degree. UCD is the only university here providing such a degree. If we allow the UCD agriculture degree to become purely academic with no research or practical on-the-ground element, we will have nothing more than a science degree in the agriculture area. That would be a failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The need has never been so great for the development of agricultural products such as biofuels. The beet industry has been eliminated here and growers have been told they must develop new crops. We cannot develop new crops here unless we have research and development within the faculty of agriculture. It is tragic that Teagasc has failed in this area also. It has sold out. Many of the Teagasc research farms throughout the country have been sold off, even properties where tuition took place. The Department of Agriculture and Food has also sold out. In Athenry, County Galway, it sold 80 acres of its prime research and development agricultural land.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">There is a great fear among the staff of UCD, particularly in the agriculture department, that we are downgrading agriculture. This is happening at a time when we should be spearheading the development of new crops, feeding stuffs and husbandry techniques.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The Higher Education Authority is now the organisation that will decide on these issues. If it decides on the sale of the Lyons Estate, we will see the demise of agriculture within UCD. That is not good enough. It will affect the personnel in the agriculture department and destroy the rapport between them. Other elements within UCD feel it is right to sell the property now to get resources for other projects in the college. That would be a travesty.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">We should consider what was put into the Lyons Estate over the years. It was a Galway man, the late Professor Ruane, who had the initiative and foresight to purchase the Lyons Estate. He developed it against the odds at a time when resources were scarce in the university sector. He reclaimed the land and installed buildings for all areas of animal husbandry research. The research that has been done there by people like Dr. Crosby, who is involved in the sheep sector, has stood the test of time in terms of its importance to agriculture. Perhaps we should not pay much attention to rumours, but this rumour is based on practices which have been noted previously. When the Minister directs those who will make the final decision, it is important for her to make a real and determined indication that practical agriculture needs to be retained within the current structure. The research farm in question was never needed more than it is now because we are competing with cheap food products from other areas. We have been told we have to offer a greater quality of produce, such as organic produce or other food developments. My final plea to the Minister of State is to ensure that we preserve the farm so that agriculture does not become an academic science subject without any practical input.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_933">I thank Senator Burke for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I will respond to him on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science. The Senator is well aware that the Lyons Estate belongs to University College Dublin. The day-to-day management of UCD, which is an autonomous body, is a matter for its governing authority. The college authorities are free to dispose of lands and property acquired prior to the passing of the Universities Act 1997 without recourse to the Minister for Education and Science. They are, however, required to agree terms with the Minister to reimburse Exchequer funds which were used to acquire lands and properties after the passing of the 1997 Act. As the Lyons Estate was acquired in the 1960s, the college authorities are free to do what they want with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">As Senator Burke said, the Lyons Estate was acquired to provide a field experiment and teaching facility for UCD's faculty of agrifood and the environment. The estate originally comprised approximately 1,200 acres, including Lyons House. The college authorities disposed of the house and approximately 620 acres of land in the early 1990s. Since then, the research farm has provided research and teaching facilities for the faculties of agrifood and the environment and veterinary medicine. However, most faculty teaching and research activities are based on the main UCD campus at Belfield, where there are additional laboratories for food science, computer equipment and a modern lecture theatre. The primary responsibility of UCD's governing authority, which was established under the Universities Act 1997, is to guide the strategic direction of the university. The university has consolidated most of its activities at Belfield in recent years. The school of veterinary medicine was relocated to the Belfield campus in 2003. A 90-acre horticulture facility, which is located between Lucan and Leixlip, was sold to a local authority in 2004 to be incorporated into its programme of general amenities for the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The future of Lyons Estate is being reviewed within the college of life sciences as the next step in the UCD strategic planning process. The governing authority approved the initiation of the review at its meeting on 21 March last. It is intended that the review will consider the appropriateness of the current scale of the farm as a centre for teaching and research, the accessibility of the farm to the students, who are entirely based at Belfield, and the impact of the new veterinary school at Belfield, which incorporates a fully operating veterinary hospital and significantly increased state-of-the-art animal holding facilities. Most important, the review will consider the changing focus of undergraduate teaching programmes, particularly in the school of agriculture, and the altered physical facilities required as a result of the new directions being taken by research in these areas. The university has developed the view that it can be impractical to operate an institutional farm facility in an area of rapidly increasing urbanisation. Senator Burke might be glad to hear that the review is expected to take approximately 12 months to complete.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">Any decision to dispose of part or all of Lyons Estate will be made when the review findings have been approved by the governing authority. In line with best practice, the review will be conducted by the university, which will be guided by international experts in the relevant areas. The brief for the review body will require it to consider the need for the university to retain access to suitable field facilities for agriculture and veterinary science on a continuing basis. It is expected that the implementation of the review group's findings will be realised in the medium term. It should be noted that the university is fundamentally assessing its priorities, developments and facilities in the sciences, in accordance with the Government's policy in this area. I have given Senator Burke as much help as I can this evening.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_942">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for coming to the House to discuss this important matter. I see him looking at the clock so I will not delay him further. The vocational school in Nenagh, which is a substantial school, has not been refurbished or upgraded since it was built in the early 1970s. We know how long ago that was. The building is not up to the standard that is needed if the school is to provide the services required of it. To give a practical example of the problems being faced, there are not enough sockets in some of the rooms. It is almost impossible for all the school's computers to work at the same time because the building cannot cope with the level of power that is needed to make that happen. Such a level of demand was not envisaged in the 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">The school has applied to the Department for funding for a refurbishment programme and has been told it is at phase 1. The estimated cost of the refurbishment programme was €3.5 million a few years ago, but it is not possible to estimate now what it will cost. The school authorities are frustrated because the project has been moved on and off the list of projects to be pursued. It was on the building programme list at phase 1 last January. It is as if it is stuck at phase 1. As someone who is familiar with the school, I assure the Minister of State that it is in need of complete refurbishment. It is catering for 275 second level students, as well as 100 adults who are doing full-time adult education courses, including courses in child care, an issue that is dear to the Minister of State's heart.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">It took 35 years to get the funds to put a fence around the school. I have raised this matter on the Adjournment because the school authorities are frustrated about the project being stuck at phase 1. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House to respond to my concerns. The teachers, the board of management and the families who are sending their children to the school are anxious about the future. The school has made and continues to make a significant contribution to the community of Nenagh and the entire catchment area. The principal and the rest of the staff are very committed to the future of the school. I would like the Minister of State to outline the Department's plans to pursue the building programme for the vocational school in Nenagh.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_945">I thank Senator O'Meara for affording me an opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's position on the proposed building project at the vocational school in Nenagh, County Tipperary. The modernisation of facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task, given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area and the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Since the Government came into office, it has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum. Evidence of this commitment is the fact that approximately 1,300 building and modernisation projects are active in our primary and post-primary schools this year. Over €490 million is being spent on primary and post-primary projects throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Nenagh vocational school was listed, among 124 schools that were announced in April 2005, as a project to be furthered through the architectural planning process. The brief for this project is the refurbishment of current accommodation and an extension to provide appropriate accommodation for a long-term projected enrolment of 400 pupils. Officials of the Department of Education and Science visited the school in November 2005 and consequently revised the schedules of accommodation which were issued to the VEC authorities in a letter dated 21 November 2005. In the letter, the Department instructed the VEC authorities to request their design team to amend the stage 1 application, site suitability and design options, to reflect the impact of the revised schedules on the design options as presented in the original stage 1 application dated January 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The Department of Education and Science has subsequently received the requested information from the VEC authorities and on completion of a review of the submission, officials of the Department will be in contact with the school authorities with regard to furthering their project. Progression of projects to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme, 2006-10.</p>
