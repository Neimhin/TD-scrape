JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas don choiste fá choinne an cuireadh anseo inniu. I thank the select committee for giving me the opportunity to attend to assist in its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate which has been requested for my Department. The requirement is for an additional amount of nearly €182 million which comprises two major elements. On the expenditure side, there is provision for €147 million in additional expenditure to meet superannuation costs. There is also a contingency provision in the order of €35 million for European Social Fund receipts. I will oultine briefly the reasons for both elements of the Supplementary Estimate. The committee will be aware that my Department has sought Supplementary Estimates to meet superannuation costs a number of times in recent years. They resulted from the gap between the allocation made to meet pension costs and actual expenditure to meet ongoing pension costs and pension gratuity payments. This issue has also affected other parts of the public sector. There has been an upward trend in the overall number of pensioners in the education sector. In 2014 pensioner numbers in the sector were estimated as being in the order of 42,500. Next year, we expect the figure to be closer to 49,000. As the committee is aware, it can be difficult to predict with absolute certainty the number of retirements in any particular year. This is primarily because teachers account for the vast majority of retirements in the education sector, but only a very small percentage of teachers retire on compulsory age grounds. The specific number of teachers who will retire in any given year will vary, but the trend has been broadly constant for a number a years. I will outline the position in 2018. The amount we were allocated in budget 2018 would have provided for pension gratuities and pension costs for some 773 retirees in schools and 76 retirees in the institute of technology sector. The Supplementary Estimate will provide for the cost of an additional 1,319 retirements in the school sector, bringing the overall number to 2,092, and 143 in the institute of technology sector, bringing the overall number to 219. The Supplementary Estimate will provide for ongoing pension costs, where there is also an under-provision. I am pleased to say that, following significant engagement between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, €147 million in additional funding is to be provided in 2019 to meet superannuation costs in the education sector. This figure has been calculated with reference to actuarial forecasts and will mitigate the need for a Supplementary Estimate to meet pension costs in 2019. The second major element of the Supplementary Estimate is a contingency provision for European Social Fund receipts. My Department's original Estimate for 2018 included a conservative forecast that some €34.7 million would be received in receipts related to a European Social Fund claim due to be paid in 2018. The Department made this claim to the relevant European authorities in November and our expectation is that it will result in receipts of €109 million which will be brought to account by the Department of Education and Skills by the end of the year. When dealing with amounts of this scale, it is obviously necessary to take a highly prudent approach. Given that at the time the Supplementary Estimate was being considered by the Government, we had not yet received this funding in the Department's accounts, it was considered appropriate to provide for a contingency in the unlikely event that the money was not received until next year. I want to make it clear that it is purely a technical exercise related to the timing of claims and recoupments and necessary to avoid any risk of an excess Vote. My Department is confident that we will receive the €109 million in this year of account and that it will be remitted to the Exchequer. In the highly unlikely event that we do not receive the funds until next year, it is important to stress that it is merely a timing issue and that there will be no loss of funds to the State. I again thank the committee for its consideration of the Supplementary Estimate. I am happy to take questions.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Jan O'Sullivan raised the issue of teacher supply. She will be aware that there is a working group on teacher supply, which is chaired by the Secretary General at the Department. We are working on a number of measures, including some we can take straight away such as, for example, changing the rules on teachers returning from career breaks. We are also looking at outreach opportunities focusing on teachers young and not so young working in the south east of England and in the United Arab Emirates. We are launching a promotional and marketing drive over Christmas, and intend to roll out several such campaigns. Teacher supply is a big issue. On the specific issue of retirees, the combined figure for retired teachers working in primary schools and secondary schools in the year 2017-18 was 1,342. That figure highlights the nature and the scale of the demand and the pressures on the system. There are constraints and challenges in the capital city and different constraints and challenges in rural areas but overall, there is a big demand for teachers, as the Deputy pointed out, and we want to keep the focus on this issue. I certainly want to keep the focus on it. I am also engaged with the Teaching Council. Deputies, Senators and different school groups can sense a frustration when we are trying to register teachers. While there are reasons for that as well, it is an area on which I am working very closely with my officials to ensure there are ways in which we can speed up the response to that major issue. The Deputy has knowledge of the superannuation issue from her previous role. We had Supplementary Estimates, and they are contained in the information pack provided. Totals of €40 million, €30 million, €37 million and €71 million were provided on the teacher side in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Those figures do not include the institute of technology sector. To dovetail into Deputy Thomas Byrne's questions around this type of practice, I am reliably informed that it is not an accounting trick. Having researched this matter myself and having asked the question as to why we end up in this situation - which does not only affect this Department - I have found there are legacy issues, given where we were and the constraints on resources in recent years. I have been assured that this figure will mitigate against having to provide a Supplementary Estimate. I am on public record on that now. Although nobody knows where we will be this time next year, I am convinced that the work being done by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will ensure that this issue does not arise every year. In fairness to the Department, there was no miscalculation of numbers. Those figures are too wide, given where we were a couple of months ago and where we are now. I accept the fact that we are coming from a position where there were great challenges on our resources and choices had to be made in 2011, 2012 and 2013. It also highlights the enormous challenge we face in terms of pensions, not just in the Department of Education and Skills but throughout the public service and Civil Service. We will have to find extra resources, and decisions will have to be made in that regard.  As for the issue of the Department's spending and whether there has been an increase or decrease, if one looks back over the figures it is clear that they fluctuate over the years. My personal commitment, the commitment of the Government and the commitment of the Oireachtas to education is front and centre stage at all times. It is the third biggest departmental spend and €10.8 billion will be spent in 2019. There is always an issue with extra resources, but as an economy grows and improves and as demographics in counties such as Dublin, Wicklow, Louth, Meath and Kildare change, the pressures change. I have asked for figures on the growth in those places where populations are growing. We have to respond to that. We are not, however, just looking at what is happening next year or in 2020. This must fit into the ten-year capital plan and how we gauge population growth in those areas. The officials in the Department and I are committed to ensuring that we continue to fight for our fair share of the distribution of funding at budget time. That will continue to be the focus. Cross-collaboration between Departments must also be pointed out. Each Department must look after its own funding but much work is taking place on a cross-collaborative basis as well. Education does not work in a silo and never has. It has always worked with industry. Even in the projects I have visited in my capacity as Minister in recent months, including the IBM project at Larkin community college or the work being done with Microsoft at Dublin City University, there is much cross-cutting work going on in the education sector. It is a creative space. I certainly will be focusing on keeping up with technological advancement as well, but that is a discussion for another day. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will address Deputy McLoughlin's questions first. He asked about the numbers of projected pensioners and additional retirees. There is an actuarial estimation of 703 in the primary sector and 450 in the secondary, community and comprehensive sector. The figure will increase over time. There will be resource challenges in the future and decisions will have to be made in that regard.  With regard to the Chairman's question about why teachers retire and why some retire young, some do not. Some do a specific number of years and then decide to stay on for one reason or another. There is a question around - let us call a spade a spade - the pressures of the job and the stresses that go with it. The committee has done a lot of work in terms of well-being and anxiety focused on pupils and students but it has also focused on the teachers. It is an all-school well-being model. There are extra pressures and demands. On the creative side, there is more flexibility, even within the junior certificate curriculum, to allow more bottom-up, locally-led projects empowering teachers and students to have more control over the curriculum. It is an addition. It is a changed world. It has changed since when I taught in 1993, 1994 and 1995. The classroom is not just a room of instruction any more. There are many aspects to it in terms of looking after and caring for students, motivation and dealing with wider issues, including family issues. The Chairman also asked what we have done about pensions and she compared it with the Army. The Department has carried out a similar exercise as that carried out with the Army pensions. Conversations have gone on within the Department and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. There have also been conversations at a cross-departmental level. The Chairman asked how confident we are that we will not be in the same position again next year looking for another Supplementary Estimate. I see the former Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, smiling. Perhaps she has been in the same position as me. The commitment I have been given is that because of the intense work that took place with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department wants to get into a position where it is not under-calculating it. I have just been handed a note that says €147 million in additional funding has been provided for superannuation costs in the education sector in 2019. It has been calculated with reference to actuarial forecasts and it will mitigate the need for Supplementary Estimates on pension costs in 2019. We are all working together in terms of the information we are being provided with. I am confident the information I have been provided with will ensure we are not back in this position in 2019. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy asked how these figures are arrived at. The Department cannot guess exactly how many retirees there will be at the end of June. They cannot make that estimate. The fact it has bounced to three times the projected figure tells me there was a question of trying to ensure the Department worked within an overall figure. This is where they fit in. I have asked my officials to ensure that whatever the figure is when we arrive at it pre-budget that it is evidence-based. There is confidence among my officials that they will know exactly and will have narrowed it down in order that we do not come back here every year. I am not making excuses for the accounting practices within which the Department of Education and Skills must work because it is an annual thing. It is the same as other Departments. We are constitutionally bound and so on but we are looking at the budget from year to year for the school year from September to June, that is, in the middle of that cycle. The information and advice I have been given on this is we will not be back in this situation again next year.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No. It is general.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The committee will have information on the range of programmes provided through the ESF in areas like upskilling, labour market mobility, social inclusion, combatting discrimination, youth employment initiatives, education and training, and lifelong learning. I worked in a Youthreach centre a good while ago. These programmes are ongoing. Youthreach programmes that are funded under the ESF need to have receipts of expenditure. Many of these programmes involve programme expenditure. They are not necessarily about paying regular items from week to week. Obviously, there are items and budgets that need to be spent towards the end of the year. My consideration of this is the same as that of the committee. It will be good to get it in as early as possible. There is confidence here that the money will be paid. It is a question of timing. If there is a way of making that easier next year, for example, by trying to get the receipts in at as early a stage as possible, we can consider it. It is difficult to do that because of the ad hoc nature of many of these programmes. Many involve one-off events and many programme costs require receipts. Obviously, that has to be factored in. My officials would prefer to be in a position in which this could be done earlier than November, but there are constraints around that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can state categorically that we are confident this will be paid before the end of the year. The Chair also asked about risk. There are no risks because this involves programme work that has happened. Obviously, there is buy-in. The nature of the funding mechanism that is done through Europe means that we have to ensure everything is in line and is done properly. I believe there is no risk. It will be paid before the end of the year.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The question of upskilling certainly comes partially under the ESF, which is used to promote the attainment of sustainable and quality employment through relevant upskilling measures and to support labour mobility, etc. I have read out the list. I believe that if we are looking at the progression and professional development of the workforce and the labour force, adult literacy has to be an important component of that. When 3,000 workers in my own county lost their jobs as a result of the closure of Fruit of the Loom, and when Unifi in Letterkenny closed a few years after that, we faced the massive challenge of getting the local workforce reskilled and reinvented. Adult literacy was a big part of our approach to personal development. Our adult education sector took a hand-in-glove approach to that. In this specific example, people in a particular sector were able to retrain and regroup. There was an emphasis on adult literacy as part of that regrouping and redirection.
