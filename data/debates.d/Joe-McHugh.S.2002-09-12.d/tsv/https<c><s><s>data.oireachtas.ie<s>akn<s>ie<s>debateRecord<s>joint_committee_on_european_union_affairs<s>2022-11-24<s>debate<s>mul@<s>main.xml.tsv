JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh Mr. Didier Reynders, an Coimisinéir Eorpach Dlí agus Comhionannais, go dtí an cruinniú inniu. Tá a chomhghleacaithe, Ms Geneviève Tuts agus Ms Barbara Nolan leis fosta. Tá Ms Nolan, ó oifig an Choimisiúin i mBaile Átha Cliath, ar ais linn arís. Tá fáilte roimpi. You are all welcome. I extend a warm welcome to the Commissioner to the joint committee. We look forward to having a discussion. We engage on deliberative basis. We appreciate this opportunity to engage with the Mr. Reynders and we welcome his team. Our discussion will focus on several areas ranging from data protection and rule of law to hate speech and the war in Ukraine. Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members are aware of the constitutional requirements around participation in public meetings and being in the Leinster House complex. They know the drill there. I invite the Commissioner to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive overview. It was very helpful. We will begin as I know he is under a time constraint. We will begin with Deputy Richmond, followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Senator Lisa Chambers wants to come in with an attachment to this question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I invite the Commissioner to reply to those two interventions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We still have not got to the question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being rude but the Commissioner has to leave at 12:45 p.m. and I am thinking about other members. I will take Deputy Seán Haughey now as well. We will take both of these in directions because we do not have time to go over and back.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Commissioner may respond to both interventions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I take it all back - Deputy Ó Murchú asked questions which the Commissioner was able to decipher. We are getting good comprehensive answers. We are grateful for that. I call Deputy Troy, who will be followed by Senator Martin. I ask them to be brief.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. Our final contributor is Senator Martin. As an introduction Commissioner we are delighted that he is here because he is wearing two hats today. He sits on the Joint Committee on Justice as well as this committee.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner and members. I know the Commissioner is under pressure time-wise. There is a submission here from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. We do not have time to get into it but I will get the clerk to the committee to pass it on to the Commissioner, if that is okay. I thank the Commissioner and his team, including Ms Tuts, Ms Nolan and other colleagues. I congratulate Mr. Reynders on Belgium's opening game in the World Cup. It could be the start of things. I am conscious all his staff may not be supporting Belgium but we wish the Commissioner well in this role and we are really grateful-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	A win is a win. I thank everyone.
