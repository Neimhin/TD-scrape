JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Burke for raising this issue. An overarching principle of our health service is to provide patients with the most appropriate care and service in the most appropriate location provided by the appropriate health care professionals. Patients should not have to attend hospital unnecessarily, with all the added stresses and possible complications that such attendances involve. It is preferable that patients receive treatment in the community where this has been clinically approved. As part of the phased implementation of the principles outlined in the primary care strategy, a number of national priorities have been set for the development of community-based services. One of these priorities is the development of community intervention teams. The main focus of teams is to reduce hospital attendances and admissions and to facilitate early discharge from hospitals. A community intervention team is a nurse-led health professional team. The team provides a rapid and integrated response to a patient who becomes acutely ill and needs enhanced services, or acute intervention for a defined short period of time. This may be provided in the community or the home, as deemed appropriate. Community intervention team staff liaise with hospital and community clinicians. They provide services in the person's home and in public and private nursing homes. The community intervention teams provide a safe, cost-effective health service to patients in their homes that would ordinarily require hospital attendance and, in most cases, hospital admission. In 2014, more than 14,600 patients were treated by community intervention teams. At any one time, to date in 2015, approximately 220 patients are being managed at their place of residence. The service the programme provides to its patients includes but is not restricted to the following: intravenous cannulation and administration of intravenous antibiotics at home; acute anticoagulation care; acute wound care and dressings, including negative pressure dressing; enhanced nurse monitoring following fractures, falls or surgery; care of patients with central venous catheters; urinary-related care; care of patients with a respiratory illness, including nebuliser care, peak flow measurement and intermittent pulse oximetry; bowel care, including ostomy care; short-term older person support and care; and other medication management and administration as part of the patient's acute intervention package. The community intervention team programme has met with representatives of Nursing Homes Ireland and is working with them in developing direct referral pathways for nursing home residents. There are currently nine teams in operation, in Dublin north, Dublin south, Galway, the mid-west, which includes Limerick, Tipperary and Clare, Carlow and Kilkenny, Cork city, Wicklow, Kildare and Louth. The Wicklow service was established in 2014 and the services in Kildare and Louth both commenced in January 2015. There is clear and strong evidence from various studies and bed utilisation reports demonstrating that a cohort of all hospital admissions can be treated in a non-acute setting, many through services provided by community intervention teams. The strategic priority is to realise national coverage and to make a community intervention team service available to every person in the country if needed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue today and I am pleased to outline the Health Service Executive's position on the person concerned. I understand the person has a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome and suffers from associated anxiety. He was offered temporary use of a vacant HSE property, known as Caridas, in Drumconrath a number of years ago when he became homeless. Caridas was an unused former group home. It was in a state of disrepair. The former residents were moved to more modern accommodation. The HSE has informed the Minister's Department that the individual has lived in the property independently without residential staff. He was, however, receiving a small amount of home support while at Caridas. He was informed by representatives of the HSE on 19 January this year that he would be required to move out of the property by 20 March. He remained in the property until that date. Renovation works were being undertaken in the house. The individual was informed and aware that he could stay only until these works were complete. The HSE and Meath County Council have been working in the meantime to source alternative accommodation for him. Meath County Council was willing to offer him tenancy of an alternative council owned property in Drumconrath. However, he was not willing to complete the relevant application forms. Unfortunately, that property is no longer available. The Meath County Council settlement officer and a representative of the HSE Meath disability services have met the individual. They explained to him the necessity of completing the application forms in order that he would be eligible for rent allowance for alternative properties. The HSE has informed the Minister's Department that he has commenced this process. A section of the roof of Caridas collapsed recently. Thankfully, the individual was not injured. The HSE carried out an inspection immediately. The property was deemed unsafe for habitation. The individual moved to local guest lodgings. The HSE has informed the Department that officials met him, in the company of his sister, on 13 March 2015. He was informed that he could not return to Caridas. The HSE paid for guest lodgings for him to provide the opportunity to source his own accommodation. The HSE Meath disability services continue to provide health related supports to him to support him to live independently. He had availed of up to four hours of home support per week while living at Caridas. He has been offered additional home support hours to assist with his transition to new accommodation and attendance at hospital and dental appointments. While the HSE Meath disability services provide group homes for people with moderate and severe intellectual disabilities, this type of accommodation is not suitable for him. The HSE has assured the Minister's Department that it will continue to work with the individual and relevant housing authorities to provide the appropriate health supports to assist him to live independently.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that the Senator did not want to raise this issue publicly. If he contacted the HSE or local authorities formally, a response is the least he should have received. If that did not happen, that is not acceptable. I suggest that he could sit down with local representatives from the HSE and the local authorities. It is a very sensitive case. I will convey the Senator's strong words to the Minister. I appreciate and share his observations on the support systems available for people who are unable to fill out forms on their own.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá mé buíoch don Seanadóir as an ábhar seo a ardú inniu. Faoi na scéimeanna a bhíodh ag an Roinn go stairiúil, bhíodh deontais chaipitil ar fáil chun muiroibreacha sa Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt, chun bóithre sa Ghaeltacht a fheabhsú, agus chun áiseanna ar nós hallaí pobail, páirceanna imeartha agus áiseanna eile a chur ar fáil nó a fheabhsú. Trí fheabhsú an bhonneagair, bhí sé de chuspóir ag na deontais seo cur le saol sóisialta, cultúrtha agus eacnamaíoch na Gaeltachta chomh maith leis an Ghaeilge a neartú mar theanga pobail sa Ghaeltacht. I 2004, leanadh leis an gclár oibre seo agus mar gheall ar na socruithe úra a bhí aontaithe ag mo Roinn ag an am leis an Roinn Airgeadais faoin gcreatlach infheistíochta caipitil, bhí mo Roinn ag an am in ann phlean oibre dhá bhliain a chur i bhfeidhm leis na húdaráis áitiúla chun bóithre, céanna agus bailte Gaeltachta a fhorbairt. Rinneadh é seo sa bhreis ar an infheistíocht a dhéanann na húdaráis áitiúla agus Ranna eile agus is cúnamh faoi leith a bhí ann d'fhorbairt an bhonneagair sa Ghaeltacht. Bhí scéim na mbóithre áise agus scéim na mbóithre portaigh ach go háirithe ag mo Roinn ag an am. Bhí na scéimeanna seo á bhfeidhmiú chun cuidiú le pobal na Gaeltachta feabhas a chur ar bhóithre áirithe a bhí mar áis rochtana dóibh. I gcás na mbóithre áise, bhí sé mar choinníoll den scéim go gcaithfeadh an bóthar a bheith ag freastal ar theach cónaithe amháin ar a laghad ina mbeadh buanchónaí ann agus ar ghabháltas amháin ar a laghad nach le húinéir an tí é agus a mbeadh rochtain chomh fada leis ag brath ar an mbóthar amháin. Cé go bhfuil sé deacair tomhais a dhéanamh ar an tionchar a bhí ag na scéimeanna bóithre ar an nGaeilge, meastar den chuid is mó gur beag tionchar a bhí acu ar neartú na Gaeilge mar theanga pobail sa Ghaeltacht. Nuair a fhoilsíodh an Staidéar Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht i 2007, ba léir nach leor an cur chuige forbartha réigiúnda gur ghlac an Stát chuige féin chun dul i ngleic le ceist sochtheangeolaíoch sa Ghaeltacht a thuilleadh. Mar atá a fhios ag an Seanadóir, tá mo Roinn i gcomhar le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta ag forbairt an phróisis pleanála teanga sa Ghaeltacht faoi Acht na Gaeltachta, agus beidh deis ag pobal na Gaeltachta díriú isteach ar na riachtanais atá acu ó thaobh buanú agus láidriú na teanga ina gceantair féin. Tá súil agam go dtuigfidh an Seanadóir mar sin nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag mo Roinn maoiniú a chur ar fáil do scéimeanna bóithre sa Ghaeltacht i gcomhthéacs an tosaíocht atáthar ag tabhairt don phleanáil teanga sa Ghaeltacht.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá mé ar thaobh an Sheanadóra maidir leis an ghá atá ann an pobal a choinneáil beo. Beidh gá mór ann le haghaidh infheistíochta a mhealladh isteach sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Mar a bhí an Seanadóir ag rá faoi na deiseanna a bhaineann le Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin, tá deiseanna móra ann agus beidh go leor tráchta ann freisin agus beidh brú mór ann ar na bóithre sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá na ceantair Ghaeltachta ag croí Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin. Aontaím go bhfuil fadhbanna agus deiseanna ann agus beidh mé i dteagmháil leis an Aire, an Teachta Paschal Donohoe. Tá dualgas air faoi na bóithre a chosaint. Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir freisin go bhfuil cúrsaí eacnamaíochta ag feabhsú. Tá fadhbanna ann, cinnte, ach tá rudaí ag feabhsú agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil acmhainní breise ann. B'fhéidir go mbeidh deiseanna ann anois airgead a chur isteach sna ceantair Ghaeltachta agus sna ceantair iargúlta. Chaithfinn an t-airgead dá mbeadh sé agam. Táim freagrach mar Aire Stáit as an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus na limistéir agus líonraí pleanála teanga a chur i bhfeidhm. Táim freagrach as an teanga a choinneáil beo ach aontaím leis na rudaí atá ráite ag an Seanadóir inniu agus beidh mé i dteagmháil leis an Aire amach anseo. Bhí mé i dteagmháil leis an Aire Iompair, Turasóireachta agus Spóirt cheana. Bhí sé i dTír Chonaill cúpla seachtain ó shin agus d'ardaigh mé ceist na mbóithre i gceantair Ghaeltachta atá i gcroí Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin.
