JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Minister on getting out of the traps extremely quickly in respect of this sector.  His experience and his passion for this subject will be of assistance to the industry.I wish to raise two points.  The first relates to the fact the Minister has inherited a Department which is paralysed by fear.  This is the case as a result of the European Court of Justice's 2007 decision to penalise Ireland for being in breach of the birds and habitats directive in the context of the aquaculture industry.  There are possibly upwards of 700 licences which must be expedited.  I have spoken about this matter to the Minister on a private basis and I am of the view that some form of public timetable is required.  There must be a meeting of minds between him and the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Deenihan, who has responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, in respect of this matter.  A timetable must be placed in the public domain in order to instil confidence among those in the industry to the effect that a roadmap exists and that there are potential investment opportunities in this area for entrepreneurs.  Such a timetable must be drawn up by the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Tourism, Culture and Sport.My second point relates to the disaster involving Arranmore Island, which has placed the entire debate on area 6A in context.  I had an in-depth discussion about this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy McGinley, this morning.  The fishermen on the island were completely dedicated to the lobster and crab industry, which has now been totally wiped out.  Their hands are tied because they cannot, for example, sail out to catch bait.  Neither can they catch the lesser spotted dogfish, pollock or other whitefish.  The reality is that area 6A is an example of how the system is not working.  Donegal, most particularly its coastal communities, voted "No" to both referenda on the Lisbon treaty.  This is a significant matter which must be examined.I request that the Minister examine the research currently being carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in respect of the possibility of catching the lesser spotted dogfish within the mixed fishery of area 6A.  The cod recovery plan is in place but everything else is being penalised as a result of this plan.  Fishermen who want to catch lesser spotted dogfish are not catching cod and neither are those who want to catch pollock.  As already stated, therefore, we must examine the research being carried out by BIM.  A good and in-depth analysis has been carried out locally as well as nationally.  I hope the Minister will give serious consideration to the research to which I refer.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the short time available I will focus on aspects of fishery, which is point four on the motion.  Statistics indicate that the world's population will increase to 9 billion by 2050.  There will be a consequent increase in demand for agriculture products and we must place ourselves in a strong position by setting out our stall to promote and sell our brands.  We must ensure the quality that has been inspired by many in the agriculture and fisheries sectors will continue to grow positively.Many farmers have bought into the cross-compliance and traceability agenda.  While prices are coming back a little, we should ensure their commitment is a two-way street.  We can reciprocate that by ensuring quality is rewarded by pricing.The old Chinese proverb has it that without fish, there is no dinner.  I am glad we are joined in the Chamber by the former Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries, Deputy John Browne.  In his time in the Department, he would have known that there are many historical challenges in the agriculture sector.  There is also a mindset of possible paralysis within the Department as a result of the 2007 European Court of Justice ruling which found that this country was in breach of the birds and habitats directive.  Since then, there has been a lack of confidence in trying to drive the marine agenda forward.We must examine the added value potential by advancing our domestic processing capacity.  We should look at examples such as Spain where in Zaragoza alone there is a 76,000 sq. m factory dedicated to fish processing.  We must also address anomalies that exist in the licensing of processing, especially within the aquaculture sector.  We have tremendous potential advantages for shellfish, including mussels, oysters and scallops.  In addition, we are exporting in excess of 12,000 tonnes of salmon per annum, but Scotland exports more than 100,000 tonnes annually.  That is an example of how we are not realising our potential by using our comparative advantage to drive the agenda.In Donegal, we have people working at the raw material end with good processing units.  However, we cannot realise the full potential owing to Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food regulations.  There are good people working in that Department but there is also a mindset that needs to be challenged.  The Department should take risks in the interests of sustainability and conservation.  Without stepping over the obvious parameters, we must still take risks because we can fish our way out of the recession.  It is not all about big boats and deep water fishing.  It is also about realising the potential of inshore fisheries.  Scallops, mussels and oysters are being exported raw to France and elsewhere.  We must examine the processing capabilities and potential in order that shellfish can be exported to India and China.Unfortunately, the country's busiest fishing port at the moment is Cork Airport in Deputy Noel Harrington's county.  It is a sad indictment of our fishing industry when we are importing packaged fish products from as far away as Vietnam.  That is the challenge we are facing and it is why we should not lose our focus.
