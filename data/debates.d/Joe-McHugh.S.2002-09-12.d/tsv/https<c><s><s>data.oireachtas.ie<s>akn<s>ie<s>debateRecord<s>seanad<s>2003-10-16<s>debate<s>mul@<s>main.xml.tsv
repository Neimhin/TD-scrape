JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Regarding the sentiments expressed yesterday by Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú on illegal Irish immigrants in the US, post September 11 these people, who have been there for perhaps ten or 15 years, or even longer, without green cards are living in fear of being returned home. They cannot come home to weddings and they live in fear of their parents getting sick or dying because they cannot go home for their funerals. We owe something to the people of that wider diaspora and we have an obligation to try our best to facilitate them. As one person expressed it to me, and this is a sad thing to say, they feel that Sinn Féin is the only one looking after them. That is a horrible state of affairs. I know it is a cynical Sinn Féin propaganda effort, but, at the same time, we are neglecting our wider diaspora in America. It is not through local authorities going over to St. Patrick's Day parades that anything will be done. We need the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to come to the House and make a statement on how we will facilitate dispensations for these people in America to enable them to receive green cards.Our argument on the use of the Shannon stopover was based on the proposition that we owed the Americans on the basis of their investment in this country, which is a fair point. The Americans owe the Irish, who built their country. A special dispensation must be introduced and we need, as a matter of urgency, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, in this Chamber making a statement to that effect.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The OECD report has to be broadly welcomed and congratulations are due to those in our excellent teaching profession who have to work under certain stresses in terms of limited resources in some situations. A major factor in the mathematics score being so low is the large class sizes at primary school level. In an ideal world, a class of 12 would be appropriate, but we should aim towards classes of 15 at primary level.Professor Coolahan from St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, attributed the success of the high score in literacy levels to the hands-on role of parents in the home, but, unfortunately, not every primary school student has the luxury of having the help of their parents in the home. They are in an educational trough.Rather than focusing on the positive aspects, and the report is broadly positive, it should be remembered that 20% of the student population are falling through the system on the basis of socio-economic disadvantage. The way to tackle disadvantage and social exclusion is to socially include children at pre-school and primary level. That can be done through lower pupil-teacher ratios at primary school level and also through an initiative introduced by the Labour Party in Britain in its manifesto in 1997, namely, homework clubs in a community setting. Those have worked on a random pilot basis throughout Dublin and other urban areas. We must encourage volunteerism in terms of homework clubs and after-school support to help students who cannot get help at home. As Professor Coolahan said, after school help with homework is important in attaining high literacy levels. That is something on which we should focus.We have a poverty industry in this country where people are making a lot of money talking about social exclusion and people who are socially excluded and outside the system. The way to include people in the system is to give them their entitlement to a primary education and to keep them in the system. I know social exclusion at an educational level is a separate issue, but it is something on which we should focus.
