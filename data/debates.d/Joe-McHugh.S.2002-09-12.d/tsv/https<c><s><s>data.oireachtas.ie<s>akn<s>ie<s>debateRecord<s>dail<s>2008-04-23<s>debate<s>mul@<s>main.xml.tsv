JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of information, I did not quite catch the number of MANs programmes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	How many of the 90 are complete?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We must be realistic about this argument concerning MANs and the overall deployment of broadband.  MANs will eventually be a solution.  I do not have the specifics today but many MANs have fibre optics underground and are not live.  Some of them certainly do not have backhaul or backbone driving them.  That is a serious issue and I require specifics on how many MANs are live.When MANs become live, they will be a solution for our urban areas.  How are we competing in light of international standards already set with respect to next generation broadband?  For example, Singapore, Finland and Sweden have up to 50 megabit services in their broadband deployment solutions.  How do we compete in terms of public policy intervention?  There is public policy intervention in the UK and Ofcom has realised there must be public policy intervention.I am somewhat disappointed the Minister noted in his preamble that broadband is a matter for the private sector.  Broadband is not completely a matter for the private sector and the public sector is also relevant.  If we do not have public sector policy intervention, we will never have broadband in rural areas.I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his patience.  Simply put, what confidence can the Minister instill into the Irish electorate, who are trying valiantly to get broadband in rural areas, that the new national broadband scheme which the Minister has massive confidence in will service rural areas?  MANs are not the solution.On a final note——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In fairness to the Minister, he knows his subject area.  Not unlike the Liverpool football team, which I follow, it is a good thing on paper.  Much of the Minister's theory is very good on paper.Getting down to the basics, we are discussing next generation broadband but we are in the business of playing catch-up with countries I mentioned, such as Finland, Sweden and Singapore.  My fear and that of the public is that the company which wins the tender for the national broadband scheme will resort to using outdated broadband technologies to act as a solution for 100% coverage.Is now not the time to ensure we are aiming for next generation broadband?  The Minister referred to the technicalities, as it will be a new type of system.  In what way is that stipulated within the tendering contract?On the original question, of the 90 MANs, how many are live or running with backhaul?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Continuing in the same vein as Deputy McManus but bringing it to a local level, let us consider a small dispersed community with a small population, outside the unbundling loop and for whom fibre optic technology and wireless solution is not available.  This is not hypothetical; I refer to places such as Meenletterbale, Leckemy and places like north Inishowen.  Will there be a facility within the national broadband scheme to ensure that communities that are not profitable for a satellite solution are part of the 100% access?  Hypothetically, if Eircom does not win the contract, will it be favourable to unbundling the exchanges?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is it likely to?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yesterday I visited Termonfeckin in County Louth, joined by the esteemed Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, to attend a meeting of the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the ICA, as it is more familiarly known.  It is good to see this debate is taking place.  I commend all the organisations that are taking the initiative and encourage other organisations within the voluntary and community sector, and even State bodies, to show initiative and get the debate going.  I welcome the fact there is a "No" camp because it certainly adds fire to the debate.  If the debate really gets going, the facts will emerge.  I also welcome last weekend's announcement by a high profile businessman of his "No" candidature.The complexity of the document is and will continue to be an issue for many people.  However, the issue is complex.  We are talking about 500 million people, institutions, politics and 27 independent states trying to work in harmony towards greater gain on policy issues.  At the same time, we are trying to hold onto our individuality and independence, which is enshrined in our Constitution.  The biggest myth in this debate is that we would lose independence, which is a nonsensical argument.  There is a view that we will not be able to have a referendum on another European treaty.  That is nonsense because it is sacrosanct in the Constitution that we are independent on this issue.I have come across many people who are indifferent towards politicians in the "Yes" camp who advocate all that Europe has done for us.  It reminds me of the question in the film "The Life of Brian" when someone asked what did the Romans ever do for us and the reply came that they built the roads and bridges and provided sanitation.  We could also ask what Brussels or Europe has ever done for us.  There is a mindset that they did not do anything for us but the reality is that much has been achieved, yet the only aspect the public are tapping into, and I am being reflective of my own neck of the woods in the north western corner of Europe, is that there is a degree of imbalance in terms of European funding spend on infrastructural projects.  One only has to travel to Dublin to see the European investment in the M50.I realise it is a chicken and egg situation in that investment follows critical mass but the people living in the west argue that the only way to build critical mass is to invest money in the region.  An issue the people in the west will acknowledge when they vote in June is whether we have got our fair share of the pie from Europe.  The danger is that they will blame Europe, but Europe did not design our policy.  This is national policy.  It is an issue about which we should be upfront and the people in the "Yes" camp should acknowledge we have not distributed the fair share of infrastructural spend throughout the country.On another element, we must acknowledge the positives in terms of the social inclusion measures including, going back to our joining of the EEC in 1973, the social economy project and in later years the empowerment of women projects, the active social inclusion measures for people with disabilities and people who are on the margins.  We have to acknowledge that much of that came from European policy and it is something we should advocate.  We should not be arguing in the past.  We must make ground in the future because inequities and imbalances remain.  We only have to consider the different wage scales.  Women are still not on a par with men when it comes to top industrial wages and the top jobs.  We must continue to explore those issues and by being part of Europe and buying into this Lisbon treaty we can achieve more in terms of creating more equality.Regarding disabilities, we are still not complying with our own legislation in terms of inclusion in the labour market.  At local authority and Government level and throughout our State mechanism we must put up our hands and acknowledge that we are not complying with the 4% requirement for people with disabilities in employment.  That measure stemmed from Europe and it is an issue on which we should keep a sharp focus within the Lisbon treaty.Regarding our international duties as a European Union, we have a role in that regard.  It is unique that an Irishman, Pat Nash, is leading the peace troops to Chad.  It is important that we get across the point that Irish people are not in the business of going to war for the sake of it.  There are displaced people and people who are hungry who need help.  They need the independent forces to give them some sort of assistance and there are no better people to do that than the Irish because of our history over 800 years, going back to colonisation, of achieving peace.  We are in the business of being peacemakers.  We are not in the business of going to war.  The argument that we will not have a say in terms of an EU army is nonsense because it is enshrined in the Lisbon treaty that there must be unanimity and an opt-out clause.I referred earlier to regional development.  The element in the Lisbon treaty about subsidiarity stemmed from the Committee of the Regions and the Assembly of European Regions where regions have to get autonomy.  We must bring power back to the regions.  That is enshrined in the Lisbon treaty and something I welcome.  It is something we must aspire towards.  The Minister of State, Deputy Devins, will be aware that Sligo got a range of new carriages and rail services, which I very much welcome.  It is great for the region but Derry city, for example, is the fourth largest city but there is no direct rail connectivity with Dublin and there are no plans to have direct connectivity for rail.  Government on both sides of the Border agreed to an integrated transport strategy through the Good Friday Agreement.  They bought into that but in the policies North and South there is no mechanism or policy to consider connectivity between Derry city and Dublin up to the north west region.  We must examine that issue because by being part of a workmanlike European Union they will assist us to ensure that happens.Regarding enlargement, there is a serious issue in terms of our peripherality.  We are moving further away from the centre of Europe.  With the eastern European bloc we are more on the periphery now than ever before from a geographical point of view.  That is something that is settling into the psyche of the Irish electorate.  They can feel that distancing and that we are further on the periphery, but that does not mean we should opt out.  We may be further isolated but we will still have a pivotal role in terms of the United States and an enlarged European Union.  We cannot take our eye off the ball in that regard.  We must be careful in setting ourselves up in terms of competitive standards.  There is a role for us to play in terms of a working collaboration between the United Kingdom and Ireland.  From his experience in the British-Irish committee, the Minister of State is aware that goodwill exists.  Deputy Brady is a member of the British-Irish committee now and we are looking for a mechanism for that British-Irish committee to evolve.  We should examine that collectively because in being part of that grouping we will be a more formidable force in terms of increased competition.The EU is too bureaucratic.  There are too many layers of bureaucracy and the Lisbon treaty will try to peel back those layers.  I welcome that and the fact that a citizens' charter will give more democracy to the people.  There is provision for a direct petition for 1 million signatures.  I am aware those in the "No" camp are disregarding that but it means something.  It is direct access to Europe on particular issues.It is important we do not take our eye off the ball on this issue.  I do not know about Members on the other side of the House but I meet many people from Donegal who say they will vote "No".  They are not yet convinced and will vote "No" at this stage.  They will keep an open mind but we must keep the campaign going in terms of information and clarity on this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As Deputy O'Mahony said, we are not here to score political points.  We are facing a crisis.  Almost 800 pharmacists have submitted letters tendering their resignation.  In addition, there is fear among the people on the drugs payment scheme and the medical card scheme.We must provide a solution to this impending disaster.  Why did a senior official from the HSE pull out of the Oireachtas joint committee meeting tonight?  The answer to that question will not be in the Minister's script but an answer is required as to the reason the official did not turn up to that meeting today.The pharmacists are in a corner because the HSE will not negotiate with their union representatives.  They will not allow union representation in any negotiations.  There has not been a level playing field in that regard from day one.  The IPU has always indicated it is in favour of cost cutting and has put forward its own proposals.We need a quick intervention.  There is fear among the public.  Pharmacists are in a corner and the intimidatory mechanisms used by the HSE in issuing High Court injunctions will not solve the issue.  We are facing a crisis and something must be done about it soon.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is 800 as of today.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are two parties in the process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are two parties in the negotiations.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is fuel to the fire.  Negotiations are ongoing.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is this before or after they get the High Court injunction?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is ridiculous, this is not even an answer.
