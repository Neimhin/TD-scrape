JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	A quick succession to the Chair happened during that contribution. I have been listening attentively to Dr. Deane and Mr. O'Donoghue and I thank them for their solid, if somewhat sobering, presentations as regards the grim reality we are all facing. I will not delay. I thank Deputy Ó Murchú for chairing in my absence. I call Deputy Troy.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. O'Donoghue and Dr. Deane.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I would like to take up Deputy Haughey's first point in relation to the UK relationship. Mr. O'Donoghue mentioned that there are sensitive discussions regarding the solidarity within the European Union. It would help in my understanding of what is the supply chain between the UK and Ireland. I thought that we were almost totally reliant on gas coming from the UK. How do we fit in, as a European Union member state, with that solidarity?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	One final supplementary from Deputy Harkin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Dr. Deane and Mr. O'Donoghue. Senator Martin and Deputy Harkin have stolen my final contribution quite expertly, and I would like to thank them for that. Go raibh maith agaibh as ucht bheith i láthair linn inniu. Thug sibh eolas agus comhairle chuimsitheach dúinn gan dabht, ní hamháin ó thaobh na deacrachtaí nó na fadhbanna atá i gceist ach thug sibh réiteach gearrthéarmach agus fadtéarmach dúinn fosta. Cloisim bhur dteachtaireacht go soiléir agus tá dualgas orainn uilig anois. Tá dualgas ar an Rialtas maidir leis an bplean uaillmhianach agus solúbtha atá de dhíth san am atá romhainn. I thank Dr. Deane and Mr. O'Donoghue once again. We are very grateful. They did not just give us the problems. We all know where the problems and the difficulties lie but they gave us the solutions for the short term and the long term. I want to be associated with the comments of Senator Martin and Deputy Harkin.
