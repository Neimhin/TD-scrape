JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade	2002-09-12	None	I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta fá choinne an cheist seo a ardú. The EU emergency trust fund for Africa was launched in November 2015 at the EU-Africa summit on migration in Valletta as a response to the development challenges in migrants' home countries. These challenges are mainly in the Lake Chad - Sahel region, the Horn of Africa and North Africa. The fund is an important element of a wider EU approach to tackling the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration in these regions of Africa. This also includes a new partnership framework between the EU and Africa which, to date, is focusing on finalising migration compacts with a number of countries and a new ambitious external investment plan. The trust fund is implemented through establishing economic programmes that create employment opportunities, support resilience in terms of food security, livelihoods and basic services for local populations, improve migration management, including by combatting human trafficking and smuggling and support improvements in overall governance. Ireland’s commitment of €3 million to the trust fund over the period 2016-20 is earmarked for the Horn of Africa region, which includes Irish Aid partner countries Ethiopia, Tanzania and Uganda. It also includes Eritrea. To date no proposals specific to Eritrea have been approved under the trust fund. There are serious concerns about human rights violations in Eritrea, to which the Deputy referred, and which are highlighted in the latest report of the UN Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea. Ireland has consistently condemned these violations at the UN Human Rights Council and in EU discussions. A policy of non-engagement, however, can often inhibit progress and lead to more suffering for the vulnerable groups that could benefit most from development assistance. In line with this, any EU development funding to Eritrea is based on key principles of engagement, notably on improvements in human rights.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I share Deputy O'Sullivan's concerns about where the debate is at. Yesterday I met with a number of NGO chief executives, including Peter Maurer from the International Committee of the Red Cross, and everyone is having the debate on the best way forward. Critical to that debate are the people on the ground, especially the NGOs, but they also feed in to a multi-lateral platform which includes the engagement of the EU and the compact countries. I will illustrate one statistic specific to Eritrea. Some 5,000 people per month leave Eritrea, with the majority going to Sudan and Somalia under refugee status. It is a massive challenge. For example, 25% of all migrants into Italy are from Eritrea. The way to go to the core of that challenge is economic stability and looking at the root causes and reasons behind the displacement. The overarching focus when finance is being delivered is that human rights must be to the forefront.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In some instances, there are concerns around how one distributes the money. In these particular countries, we are talking about going to the NGOs or collaborating with the UN and NGOs, such as the Red Cross. We also must ensure that money does not go through government, so transparency must also be to the fore. We have to build the capacity at local level. The NGOs are at the forefront there with their ideas and I am very conscious that one cannot separate humanitarian work from development work as they are interlinked. It is about keeping a focus on the development also.  I will cite as an example one NGO in Eritrea called Vita, which works in partnership with the Irish State agency Teagasc, and I have met the Eritrean Minister for Agriculture. It is working on irrigation schemes and on dairy and potato issues. This is an example of capacity building at local level where we can work directly with communities under the directorship of NGOs on the ground. It is important that we still focus on the important elements, including capacity building at a local level, irrespective of the major challenges inherent at a human rights level. If development funding is going into an area, then we must stay focused on human rights which, has to be an overall objective.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am seriously concerned about the growing humanitarian crisis in north-eastern Nigeria, following seven years of Boko Haram violence. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 14 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, as the Deputy correctly pointed out. More than 4.4 million people are in urgent need of food assistance and up to 400,000 children could suffer from severe acute malnutrition over the next 12 months if adequate assistance is not received. Earlier this month, our ambassador to Nigeria, Sean Hoy, visited Borno State to assess the security and humanitarian situation. He met representatives from various UN agencies and NGOs in Maiduguri. The ambassador visited a number of camps for displaced people. Following the visit, on behalf of the EU, the ambassador briefed the United Nations special representative for west Africa and the Sahel. Our embassy in Abuja continues to consult with the Nigerian Government, at senior political and official levels, on the humanitarian emergency. Ireland and our EU partners are providing significant humanitarian assistance. In 2016, Ireland has provided €3 million in direct response to the crisis in the region. This includes €325,000 for Irish Aid's NGO partners, €1 million for the work of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the UN and €1 million for the International Committee of the Red Cross. Under Ireland’s rapid response initiative, six rapid responders were deployed this year to work with our UN partners. We also airlifted 110 tonnes of emergency relief supplies into north-eastern Nigeria and to Niger to help displaced Nigerian families. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely and to assess what further humanitarian assistance Ireland might provide.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree and I am glad the Deputy has raised the issue because there are many forgotten crises. In recent days along the Lake Chad border there has been an eruption of violence. When we consider that 9 million of the global displaced population of 65 million in Chad are displaced it gives an indication of the scale of the issue. Efforts at EU level and whatever collaborative approaches need to be carried out in this region need to be continued. I will have an opportunity next week, along with our colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, to go to Kenya. We will be very focused on looking at root cause, mediation and conflict resolution. We must have a renewed focus across all levels, at European level and UN level, looking at how we address the underlying causes of a lot of these difficulties that are emerging, be they in eastern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa or the Horn of Africa, where there are enormous challenges.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Looking at the global figure, the EU has pledged €50 million in support of the multinational joint task force which supports 8,700 troops. The European Commission has also provided $52.4 million in funding towards humanitarian situations. We have the money and it is about how best we use it, given the nuances around culture, what is needed and what is best for specific regions. We must work very much in tandem with local leaders in these countries. This goes back to the issue of trying to address root cause and getting to the bottom of the conflict situation the first place. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.
