JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A plethora of anomalies has been raised regarding non-principal private residences, including, for example, the position of parish priests who have bought retirement homes but whose primary residence is the parochial house.  Advice has been sought on this matter from the Attorney General who is working flat out providing information on the matter.  Given the large number of anomalies arising from the recently enacted legislation, does the Government intend to introduce an amending Bill?Many of those who live abroad, having left Ireland in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, have an ancestral home in their county to which they return for perhaps one or two weeks every year.  Are such persons liable to the levy on second homes?  Will amending legislation be introduced to address these and other anomalies?
