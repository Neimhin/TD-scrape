Tuigim go maith gur cuid thábhachtach d'oidhreacht an Stáit iad na hoileáin mhara. The islands and their communities represent a dynamic resource in a developing Ireland, embodying an extraordinary repository of language, culture and heritage and constituting a unique element in the fabric of society. A key objective of the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is to provide support to ensure the social, cultural and economic development of the inhabited offshore islands and thereby ensure that they survive as viable communities. Population decline in the islands is similarly reflected by demographic trends in many parts of rural Ireland with young people moving to large cities to experience greater economic opportunities and city lifestyle. The Government, through the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, has put in place a range of measures to support island communities. In 1996, there were just three passenger ferry services, one cargo and an air service route in receipt of financial assistance from the State. The total cost at the time to the State for these subsidies amounted to just £893,910. In contrast, by 2018, the State subsidised 14 passenger ferry routes, nine cargo routes and two air services. The total cost of these services amounted to more than €6.5 million. The increased investment by the State in these services has supported the sustainability of the island communities by underpinning critical access for island life all year round. In 2018 alone, this support translated into 500,000 passengers and more than 27,000 tonnes of freight being carried on services subsidised by the Department. Government, in conjunction with local authorities, has also provided support for the development of harbours, which help to provide safe year-round access to the islands. An annual programme of island road and other small capital projects has also been in place for more than 20 years, which has enabled the development and maintenance of island infrastructure. To date, more than €100 million in funding has been provided towards completion of harbour infrastructure for the islands. Three major harbour projects have been included in Project Ireland 2040, namely, improvement works to piers on Inis Oírr, Inis Meáin agus ag Machaire Rabhartaigh, serving Toraí agus an bád farantóireachta sa phlean fosta go dtí Toraí. Tugann an Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta aitheantas faoin tábhacht cultúir fadúda an teanga Ghaeilge, ní hamháin ar an mórthír ach ar na hoileáin uilig fosta. Faoin bpróiseas pleanála teanga, tugtar deis do phobal na Gaeltachta fá choinne an phleanáil teanga a ullmhú agus a chur i bhfeidhm ar leibhéal an phobail agus tacaíocht a bhaint amach as an Stát fá choinne an teanga a úsáid sa phobal uilig agus an teanga a neartú. Tá tacaíocht de suas chuig €100,000 ar fáil fá choinne achan plean agus beidh suas chuig €150,000 ar fáil ar na trí oileán Árann. Beidh na pleananna éagsúla á gcur i bhfeidhm trasna seacht mbliana. Chomh maith leis sin, fuair Údarás na Gaeltachta aitheantas breise i mbliana fá choinne chultúr agus fhorbairt pobail sa Ghaeltacht. Is é an méid iomlán atá i gceist ná €3.85 milliún. Tá an cuidiú sin fá choinne na ndreamanna éagsúla ar na hoileáin uilig agus rinne mise cinneadh mar Aire Stáit i 2015 fá choinne na hoileáin gan stádas Gaeltachta. Bhog an dualgas sin go dtí an Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta. I ndiaidh sin, bhí cumarsáid chuimsitheach idir na comhlachtaí forbartha áitiúla ag gabháil seirbhísí iontacha tábhachtacha ar na hoileáin. Tháinig an t-airgead trí Chomhar na nOileán agus anois tá an dualgas agus an fhreagracht leis an eagraíocht sin fá choinne an t-airgead sin a bhaint amach. Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas a ghabháil leis an dream sin fá choinne an dualgas sin a bheith aici thar na blianta.The challenges that affect island communities, while similar to those in the rest of rural Ireland, tend to have an extra dimension owing to their separation from the mainland. Issues such as the provision of housing, the delivery of education and healthcare and employment opportunities are magnified on the offshore islands. There is also the added challenge brought about by an ageing population. While a number of policies have been developed across government on an ad hoc basis in the education and health sectors, for example, with the HSE producing a report identifying many of the issues affecting island healthcare services, the Government recognises that an all-of-government approach is required in order for island communities to reach their full potential.  In 1993 an interdepartmental committee on island development was established with a remit of reviewing and prioritising development strategies and recommending actions to ensure a co-ordinated approach to all aspects of island development. The report of the interdepartmental committee which was published in 1996 aimed to set out the strategic framework within which future action related to the islands would be pursued. A major programme of State investment followed in several areas which resulted in issues surrounding access to and from the islands largely being resolved, as alluded to.  Arising from the ongoing consultation with local island communities, island representative organisations and Oireachtas Members, it is acknowledged that it is important to re-establish an interdepartmental committee for the islands to inform the process of developing a new, cross-government policy. Additionally, if the introduction of legislation is seen as a necessary component of this process, such legislative proposals as may be required will be brought to the Government for approval. Rinneadh cinneadh ag an gcruinniú Rialtais i mí Iúil i mbliana, agus gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Seán Kyne, fá choinne an chinnidh sin. At the Cabinet meeting held on 25 July in Glencolmcille the Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Kyne, informed the Cabinet of his intention to form and chair an interdepartmental committee for island development. An invitation has been extended to all relevant Departments, including my own which is committed to this approach and will be a full partner at the table. I want to see more partnerships, synergy and creativity, based on some very good examples. I refer, for example, to Sherkin Island where there is a partnership between the Technological University of Dublin, TUD, and the local community. I want to see more of this and already conversations are happening on initiating something similar on Tory Island. This initiative will require co-operation and an input from all relevant Departments and their agreement on the policy. Following on from this work, an action plan will be developed that will comprise defined measurable actions associated with various parties, with timeframes set out to ensure the roll out of these actions. To allay the concerns of Deputies about island representation, I stress that there will be an ongoing and comprehensive consultation process with island communities to ensure island voices will have a high level of input into the deliberations of the committee on various aspects of island life, including, among other issues, housing, health, energy, waste management, climate change, education, communication, employment and transport. The consultation process will include ongoing meetings with relevant stakeholders, including bilateral meetings with Departments and agencies and island representative groups, as well as public meetings. While much of what is stated in the Private Members' motion as proposed by the Opposition is to be commended, the work carried out by successive Governments since 1996 to improve services for the islands should be acknowledged, which is what the Government's amendment to the motion seeks to do.  I conclude by commending my colleague on leading to ensure we will have a common-sense approach through an interdepartmental committee. This important committee will build on the good work that is already happening on the islands. There is a lot of innovative work ongoing. On Árainn Mhór, for example, almost 50 students from the mainland are being ferried to a secondary school on the island on a daily basis. That is a massive change. I acknowledge all-island communities for their industry, innovation, initiatives and díograis during the years when there were many challenges, some of which persist today. The only way we will ensure progress is through an interagency and interdepartmental approach in partnership with island communities. I know that colleagues on all sides of the House will not be found wanting in that regard. Deputy Connolly raised an issue related to an island school. I will get the details and respond to her directly.
