JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to follow on from Senator Ulick Burke's concerns in regard to Hanly II. We have grave concerns in the north west because of the new alignment of the health constituency base which extends from Malin Head to Thurles in County Tipperary. The people of the north west are not convinced this is a natural region and the matter needs to be examined.Any health board review has to take into context the natural hinterland with Northern Ireland. We talk the talk of all-Ireland bodies and North-South ministerial councils. In that area we have Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, a hospital in Letterkenny and a hospital in Sligo. That is a natural region. If Hanly II has to take into consideration a decentralised service or cutbacks, we have to look at an all-Ireland health strategy, not just a Twenty-six Counties strategy. It is common sense for us to look across the Border regarding an all-Ireland strategy.
