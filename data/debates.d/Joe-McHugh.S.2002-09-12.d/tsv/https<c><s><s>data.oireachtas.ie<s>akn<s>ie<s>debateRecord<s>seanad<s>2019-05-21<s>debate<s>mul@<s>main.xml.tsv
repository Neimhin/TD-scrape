JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I was briefed on the meeting last night and I want to put on record my apologies to the staff and students for not being in a position to go as I had a prior engagement that was arranged last October. I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to provide an update to the House on the current position regarding Moville community college, a building project that is critical in providing for the needs of the local community. Under the Project Ireland 2040 plan, Moville community college will be provided with 4,500 sq. m of new space through a stand-alone extension. This will allow for the expansion of the college to accommodate 550 pupils. The new extension will include 13 new classrooms, science labs, engineering and technology rooms, a new library, a general purpose room and dining facilities, as well as a PE hall with ancillary space and a 550 sq. m special needs base.  Delivery of the project to which this matter relates has been devolved to Donegal Education and Training Board, DETB, under a service level agreement finalised in January 2017. While it has taken longer than expected to reach the current stage of development, I assure the House that DETB has been progressing the project as effectively and efficiently as possible and has been liaising with officials in the Department of Education and Skills, as appropriate. This was one of the first items discussed at the initial meeting with the building unit when I was appointed as Minister The House may wish to know that, in accordance with its terms of engagement, DETB has served a notice of termination on the existing architect. No new appointment will be made until the notice of termination takes effect. In the meantime, work is continuing on the project with the remaining members of the design team. The project is currently at stage 2a - pre-planning design. DETB and its design team met my officials on 12 February in respect of that matter. A number of design issues were raised at said meeting and in correspondence with the DETB since. These are being addressed. I am satisfied that DETB will progress the project as quickly as possible with its new architect, once appointed. Once the issues to which I refer are addressed and a new architect is in place, approval will be given to DETB to lodge a planning application for the new extension. It is expected that a planning application will be lodged with Donegal County Council for the project in September or October. Subject to any issues arising during the planning process, the project can then be expected to proceed to tender. Separately and independently as a stand-alone project, I am aware that a number of issues with the existing building have been brought to the attention of officials in the Department of Education and Skills by DETB officials. I am conscious that this is a cause of concern for the students, staff and parents of the school. However, I can assure the House that officials from the Department of Education and Skills have been in regular contact with DETB, which is working diligently to address these issues. In that regard, the Department has recently received two detailed reports on the matter from DETB. On foot of these, it has approved the completion of a number of surveys and some essential works to be carried out over the course of this summer. The outcome of those surveys will determine the further action required to address these issues. In addition, DETB has been liaising with Departmental officials in respect of disability access issues, as well as the condition of the current prefab block of accommodation on site. On the latter, I am conscious that the existing prefab accommodation requires refurbishment. I am pleased to be able to inform the House that approval has recently been given for that refurbishment to take place to ensure that it provides for the needs of the school until the stand-alone extension is completed. The works on the existing building and the prefabs will take place under one contract during the summer, and delivery of these works is also devolved to DETB. I am aware from last night's meeting that there is a fear that this refurbishment work will not go far enough. I have asked my officials to provide me with photographic evidence of examples of where this work has been carried out before. I am happy to send those images on to the Senator, and he can share them with his contacts. I do not want to force a decision that the school is not going to accept. It has to buy into the project, and we should try to provide evidence of how good this work is. I am conscious that if we go for new prefabs, they will require planning permission and the project will be delayed even further, possibly until the following summer. I do not feel that is good enough. I have been in the school and in that home economics classroom. I share the concerns of the Senator. This is, and will remain, a priority for me.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is absolutely no problem. I agree with everything the Senator said. It is important to reassure members of the public in Inishowen, in particular in Moville, and the student body, that we will work together on this. I put in timeframes that I want to see met. I do not want to delve too much into the termination of the contract of the architect because it is not finalised yet but once that happens we will appoint a new architect. In the meantime the design team is still in place. It will continue its work and we will have a submission ready for planning. I am happy to keep the Senator posted at every stage. I acknowledge the input of Mr. Paddy Kelly from the education and training board, ETB, whose expertise will be critical in ensuring we move forward on this. I also acknowledge the input of the local county councillors who have been working very hard on this issue, and I will keep them in the loop as well. I acknowledge the frustration of the teachers in the staff room. I met them and we considered potential options. We discussed potentially replacing the prefabs and considered what would be the best option. The advice I got back is that in order to do an effective job in a tighter timeframe, what is required is not simply replacing a roof, rather the electrics will need to be done and a full refurbishment to ensure there are a proper safety standards in place in these prefabs for the students and the teachers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this issue on which we are intensively working. We have a budget of more than €1.9 billion for special needs and a Department budget of €11 billion, which represents quite a substantial injection of money.We have 1,500 SNAs. We got an additional 950 this year. Special classes have increased from fewer than 500 to approximately 1,500 since 2011. There has been enormous progress. However, I agree with what Senator Lombard said. The piece of work we are doing at the moment is how we can do better at pre-planning and forward planning and how we can improve communication channels with parents. It is not right that parents have to go around to schools or be given a list. That is something I have brought up with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, when I had a meeting with it last week. I will continue to meet with it on that. Timing is another issue in terms of when enrolment for special needs purposes happens. I am happy to keep the Senator up to date in that regard. The NCSE has a statutory function to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs and consultation with the relevant education partners and the Health Service Executive. This includes the establishment of special classes and special school placements in various geographical areas where there is an identified need. In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and available school accommodation both current and planned. The council ensures that schools in an area can between them cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. As I outlined, they have increased from 548 in 2011 to 1,459 this year. Provision in special schools has increased from 6,848 placements in 2011 to 7,872 this year. When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school, the school can apply to the Department for capital funding to reconfigure existing spaces or to construct additional accommodation. Similarly, special schools can apply to the Department for capital funding to accommodate additional placements. Notwithstanding the extent of the investment, issues remain. In some parts of the country increases in population and other issues have led to shortages in capacity in the school system. I assure Senator Lombard that this issue is being taken very seriously. The NCSE formally advised the Minister for Education and Skills that there is insufficient special school and special class capacity in Dublin 15 and in Kildare. The formal notification was sent to me in recent weeks. The letter is a formal activation of a process under the admissions legislation under which ultimately a ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. The NCSE and the Department are actively engaging with education service providers in order to encourage them to address the shortage of places. I am encouraged that, to date, those efforts have resolved the issue in Kildare and resulted in progress in Dublin 15. Engagement with schools, patron bodies, parents and others is continuing in Dublin 15 to bring the required additional special class and special school placements on-stream. The NCSE will keep in regular contact with the parents of the children concerned to advise them of progress and to identify placements as they become available. The NCSE and officials from the Department of Education and Skills hosted a briefing session for Oireachtas Members in Leinster House on Tuesday last to advise Members on the approach being taken. I again thank Senator Lombard because we have embarked on a very ambitious journey for special education inclusion and ensuring that special education is at the heart of the education system, but like any journey it is an ongoing and evolving one and I am happy to work with him along the way.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have been working on a school inclusion pilot project for Kildare and Wicklow and parts of south Dublin that will involve 75 schools and preschools.That understanding of need at an early stage is critical. Regardless of whatever resources are needed in the aftermath, it has to be done in a comprehensive way whether it involves speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, complex medical need, behavioural support or whatever. This pilot will start in September. It has a budget €4.75 million. We will look at the pilot as a potential forerunner of a national roll-out. We are looking at integration involving the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Health and Education and Skills in order to identify how we can more effectively work on the issue of inclusion raised by the Senator. I acknowledge the officials in the respective Departments. I know that officials can get a lot of negative attention when things go wrong but in politics, it is important to acknowledge creativity. There is a creative approach to this school inclusion model that I believe will be very positive in the years ahead.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to provide an update to the House on the current position regarding the external precautionary measures remediation works of Ardgillan community college, part of which is closed since last October, following the identification of significant structural issues. No doubt the House will be aware that, in October and November last, my Department carried out initial assessments of 42 schools that were built by a contractor using the design and build programme of delivery and which includes part of Ardgillan community college. The House will also be aware that of those schools, 22 required precautionary measures to enable continued safe occupation. Ardgillan community college is different from the schools with precautionary measures in place in that the nature and extent of the issues there are such that the building assessed was required to close. The school remains operational in another building on site. The safety of pupils and staff has been and remains our first priority. Following on from the initial assessments, which were based on sample opening-up works, my Department initiated a second phase of detailed investigations for the schools on 18 January last. This next phase of the programme focused initially on the 22 schools that have precautionary measures in place and at Ardgillan. The purpose of these investigations was to determine the nature and scope of any permanent remediation measures required in each individual school and, from the technical information gathered by the appointed structural engineers, to design permanent remediation solutions where these are needed. In line with the update published in January, detailed structural investigations have now been completed in all the 22 schools with precautionary measures in place and at Ardgillan community college. In tandem with the investigations, significant work has been undertaken by my Department, supported by the National Development Finance Agency and an appointed multi-disciplinary team, to design and plan permanent engineered remediation solutions for each of these schools. An individual work plan for each school will flow from this body of work. These plans will feed into an overall time-tabled programme of remediation works for the schools which will commence during the summer months. All efforts remain on track to achieve this objective. When the works programme is available, the details will be first shared at meetings with the patrons and the schools involved. Arrangements are being put in place for such meetings with the patrons and the school authorities of the 22 schools, including Ardgillan, to be scheduled in June. In parallel with this work during the summer months, detailed structural investigations in 17 schools built by the same contractor without precautionary measures in place will also proceed. A schedule for those detailed investigations issued to the 17 schools involved and their patrons last week. The intention is that any remediation works that may be necessary in these schools will be carried out from 2020 onwards. I again acknowledge and thank the principals, staff, parents and pupils for their patience and co-operation as my Department works its way through this complex process. Specifically, regarding Ardgillan community college, I thank its leadership - Mr. Michael O'Leary, who has shown excellent leadership throughout this process, and his team - and also the students. The scheduled detailed investigation phase has been undertaken and a programme of works to remediate the building is being put in place for implementation. This is an education and training board school. Pending the delivery of the remediation work, my Department will ensure, in continued consultation with the ETB, that any interim accommodation needs at the school are met. In this regard, two additional temporary classrooms, a woodwork room and preparation area together with a disabled access toilet have been approved for September 2019.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would be hoping that we are in a position to have the vast majority of those 22 schools completed by September. Given the significant impact on Ardgillan community college - it was the only school where they had to decamp on a permanent basis - I certainly will ensure that it will be prioritised and ready for September, if possible.Some works in the 22 schools may continue into October but everybody will be back in school. Nobody will be decanted. I hope that we will have a solution ready for September for Ardgillan.
