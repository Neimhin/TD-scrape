JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation from Inishowen and commend Deputy Sheahan on organising this meeting.  He made a commitment in Moville one wintry evening to have this meeting.  That he followed through on it after moving on to a different portfolio deserves commendation.I am aware of the many issues and complications on the Foyle.  The delegation's presentation highlights how it sees solutions and coexistence with the mussel industry.  Mr. Liam Farren's point about going back to basics must be welcomed.The most crippling element for all fisheries is regulation.  Ten years ago fishermen, who are natural battlers against the elements, would have been angry and tried to fight the bureaucratic system.  These days this has turned to apathy and they have given up the fight.  The Council fisheries meeting on 13 and 14 December will see the closure of fishing in Areas VIIA and VI.  This blanket ban will wipe out the whole industry.In the case of the Foyle oyster fisheries, they are having to deal with double regulation.  Therein lies the problem.  Not to defend the Loughs Agency over our marine Department, but there are two Departments working in this area and it is leading to complications.  It was suggested by Mr. Liam Farren that the fisheries should come under the control of a local structure driven by the people instead of a consultation process, a byword for keeping people happy.  Legislation has been passed in Dublin, London and Brussels on establishing the umbrella group of the Loughs Agency.  Unless a local government structure is put in place in the Foyle fisheries, these problems will not be solved.Similar problems will emerge in other areas.  In the Swilly, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has suggested there may be a blanket ban on mussel dredging, even at microlevels, to counteract damage from large-scale dredging.  We need to get back to basics and have people working around the table to come up with solutions.  I know this issue has been around for 15 years.  I am sure the mussel fisheries sector wants to work in coexistence too.I thank Deputy Sheahan for organising today's meeting.  As he pointed out the Loughs Agency comes under the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I am glad this matter will be referred to the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.Where will Ireland get the revenue stream to pay the 5.8% rate on its EU-IMF loan?  We are going to have to get back to basics.  Ireland will have to become a maritime nation again in which aquaculture will be the driving force to produce the local revenue stream needed.  For every job at sea, Mr. Liam Farren can create seven on land.We also have to look at the four year plan.  Within the plan is an acknowledgement that there is going to have to be value added as regards the food processing sector.  We as politicians, as well as the industry, have to challenge this deal to see whether we will get grant aid from Europe for factories, more assistance in terms of licensing applications and licensing approval.  If we have the forthcoming EU Council of Ministers saying it is going to close all the areas, how are we to buy into a four year plan that is to provide additional value added in terms of processing within the seafood sector if we are not allowed to fish?
