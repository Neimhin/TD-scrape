JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I seek the adjournment of Dáil Eireann under Standing Order 32  in light of diverging taxation policies of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alastair Darling, and the Minister for Finance to discuss a matter of critical national importance, namely, the failure, in respect of current fiscal strategy, to observe responsibilities under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement to integrate the two economies on this island.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know the Minister does not have available the cost benefit analysis as of yet and I appreciate the fact it will be made available.  If a cost benefit analysis is done on any public service infrastructure in a county such as Donegal or Kerry, the more one moves away from the core obviously it will cost the State more and if one examines everything from education to public servants and other Government services of course it will show that it will cost the State.  This is why we subsidise flights to Carrickfinn and have a public service obligation arrangement for Derry city airport.  We must have these arrangements.  The argument that there is no socio-economic impact is not good enough.  The president of Letterkenny chamber of commerce strongly articulated that these measures will impact on the amount of money spent locally, for example.  In the past eight years, €1.3 million has been invested in the barracks at Lifford and Rockhill.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of a compromise solution?  I realise this has been debated within the Minister's own party.  Is there not a compromise solution?  Two stations have been cherry-picked in north Donegal, which is a unique area.  Is there not a compromise solution that might involve either one or the other station, because it is affecting the area on a socio-economic basis?  There are also security issues which I will raise at a later date.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share my time with Deputies Durkan and Doyle.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are interested in equity on this side of the House.  It will be done in an equitable manner.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate.  I propose to highlight two problems in the constituency Deputy Blaney and I represent.  I refer to the continued mass exodus of shoppers across the Border and the difficulties encountered by small businesses in County Donegal as they try to survive.  There is a false economy in the region.  As businesses try to hold things together without having to lay people off, they find in most instances that they are unable to get credit from the banks.  They are trying to hang in there.  I share Deputy Blaney's optimism that we will get out of this crisis eventually.  We need to do something in the meantime, however.  In the United States, ambitious proposals are being made and political leadership is being shown.  Similar action is being taken, rightly or wrongly, across the water.  The unprecedented times we are experiencing are economically dangerous.  Nobody has the authority to say he or she knows what is going to happen.  The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Alistair Darling, has decided to reduce the rate of VAT in the other jurisdiction on this island to 15%.  The two jurisdictions that are side by side have separate economies, which can lead to anomalies.  The major anomaly relates to the two different tax bands that exist.I would like to mention something I raised last night.  I will not spend too much time on it.  We have an obligation under the Good Friday Agreement.  I am aware that Deputy Blaney is the chairperson of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  We need to examine the anomalies that are being created.  Two things are happening.  People from Donegal, Dublin and other parts of the South are travelling to Northern Ireland for a so-called "shopping experience", but they are not getting it.  While I accept they are getting reduced prices, and many people are happy to go for price, they are getting something else as well.  It is predicted that many stores in the Border areas of Northern Ireland will have to close this Saturday morning because they will be unable to cope with the level of demand.  There are similar issues on this side of the Border, where businesses may have to close their doors because there is not enough demand.  We need leadership.  The Government should do something.  We need the Minister to come up with some kind of solution to try to stimulate the economy.  This country's economy needs some form of stimulation or injection.  We will not trade our way out of this problem if we continue to increase indirect and stealth taxes.  We need to trade our way out of our economic difficulties.  That is something the Government should focus on.I heard indirectly this morning about a discussion that took place in a public house in Letterkenny last night.  I was not present for the discussion, naturally, because I was in this House.  The proprietor of the public house told me that a man summed up the present difficulties by comparing the Irish economy to a boat off the coast of Tory Island — it is rudderless and it lacks a captain.  We need somebody to take charge and control.  Both of the economies on this island — the regional economy in Northern Ireland and our own economy here — are faltering.  Both of them need some form of stimulus.  Petrol and diesel prices on either side of the Border will always increase and decrease over time, which will lead people to cross the Border.  The economy in Northern Ireland is in as much trouble as the economy in this jurisdiction.  The difference is that the authorities there are doing something about it.  They are getting customers, etc.  I wish to mention something of which this country should be cognisant.  There is an Asda store in Newry and another on my doorstep in Strabane.  Asda is a subsidiary of Wal-Mart.  It is not called Wal-Mart, but it is part of the same corporation grouping.  Its outlet in Strabane has the highest turnover of any Asda outlet in the United Kingdom.  The revenue being accrued at that store is being lost to our Exchequer because of the 30% differential in this country's pricing structure.  We have failed to attack our high cost base.  We are not protecting our small and medium sized enterprises.  We have hammered them by introducing more red tape and bureaucracy.  We have not assisted them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Some small and medium sized enterprises in this country are surviving.  They are working in the global market.  They will continue to survive.  We should be supporting small business, at the discretion of the Minister.  If a small business is thriving, we should give it incentives to help it to take people off the dole and into work.  Perhaps we could make grant aid available to help small businesses to expand.  That is just one way of making progress in this regard.  As people lose their livelihoods, they become insecure, which is the last thing this country needs.  We are all responsible for nurturing the type of democracy to which we all aspire.  We need to do something quickly.  I emphasise that economies in other parts of the world, including the United Kingdom and the United States, are doing something about these problems.  I appreciate that we are affected by international factors.  The effects of the troubled economic climate are even being felt in Dubai.  As I said earlier, the Irish economy is like a boat off the coast of Tory Island — it is rudderless and it lacks a captain.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need somebody to steer the ship.  The Ceann Comhairle might have to take a sabbatical from his comfortable Chair and return to his former pasture.
