JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  This is an important forum, but it is also a very important issue and I am glad to hear that rare diseases are being discussed here today.  While we have certain services dotted between the United Kingdom and Ireland, some of us will be aware that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare disease and at the moment, up to 12 boys are going to Newcastle and are receiving an excellent service.  It is not just the expertise.  There may be people with similar expertise in Dublin or Belfast, but it is about the range of care packages, experience, knowledge and the coming together of minds.  The real debate has to be about whether we look at the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland on an east-west basis, or whether we concentrate our minds on a North-South basis to share services.  If these services are being provided in Newcastle, do we automatically try to replicate those services on the island of Ireland, in Belfast and Dublin, or do we try to learn from the experience and expertise over a certain period of time and set out a map to replicate it in the future?I say all this for the following reason.  The boys who are going to Newcastle at the moment are used to going there.  They are receiving an invaluable service.  If that option was not available, which is a possibility in the future, they will not be comfortable with a service that is not being provided here at the moment.  I propose that we learn a lot more from the services that are being provided throughout the United Kingdom, be it Scotland, England or Wales, and try to harness that knowledge through a proper communications system.  Due to budgetary constraints and so on, we do not have a roadmap for this.  It was very interesting to listen to Mr. McCarthy's personal story.  Where is the roadmap for intervention, care, follow-up and communicating all these different services?  We need to start a conversation on an east-west basis as well as a North-South basis.I am Co-Chairman of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, and I am glad Mr. McCallister, Mr. Wells and Deputy Conway are present today, as they sit on this body.  In the spring we will have a discussion on rare diseases and the sharing of knowledge and services on an east-west basis and this will be on the agenda as a priority item at the plenary session.  I will be asking that we work closely with your committee, Chairman, to forward what you are trying to do here, which is very laudable.  I would like to work closely with your committee before and after the assembly meets, because we will be feeding this back into the Dáil after the plenary session for the first time.  That has been confirmed, so proposals that come out of the plenary session will go back to the Dáil.I am delighted to have this range of expertise present.  We can work on a common agenda.  We have already done great work on a North-South basis.  Mr. Wells mentioned the issue of Altnagelvin Area Hospital and I am delighted that the Chairman has received confirmation from the Minister for Health on funding.  I commend the work of the delegation's Minister, Edwin Poots, MLA, on his proactive work.  It is not just a meeting of minds, because there is also much rolling up of the sleeves that needs to be done behind the scenes.  That has been taking place, which is welcome.Let us call a spade a spade.  There are cultural barriers when accessing services on a North-South basis.  People are not used to it.  We need to take cognisance of those cultural barriers.  The access issue for radiotherapy in Altnagelvin Area Hospital and the 30% threshold for Donegal patients needs to be in place, and I welcome that.  However, we should also have a conversation about cultural barriers and cultural challenges.  I wish the committee well in its work and I look forward to engaging with the Members from Stormont.
