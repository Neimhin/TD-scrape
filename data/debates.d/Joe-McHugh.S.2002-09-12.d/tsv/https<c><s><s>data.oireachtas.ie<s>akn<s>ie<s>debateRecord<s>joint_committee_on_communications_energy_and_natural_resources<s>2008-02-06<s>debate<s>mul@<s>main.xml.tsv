JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  Last week, we discussed the issue of storage, to which Senator O'Toole referred.  While I do not want to go over old ground and I accept that we should focus on the link from County Meath to County Tyrone, Bob Hanna appeared to rule out the pump storage option last week.  What added value would a pump storage plant provide the grid in terms of its ability to cope with large amounts of renewable energy given that we have a renewable energy target of approximately of 6,000 MW?  This is a wider issue but I ask for clarification on this matter.I welcome collaboration between EirGrid and its counterpart in Northern Ireland and the decision to have 80 km of line in the North.  Has there been consultation with Northern Ireland Electricity on extending it further?  At the end of the 80 km, will it tap into a 400 kV line in Northern Ireland or will there be a missing link in terms of this type of voltage?  I ask this question not because Derry city, the fourth largest city in the country, is the ultimate destination but because much of the urban sprawl from Derry is spreading into east Donegal, which comes within EirGrid's remit.  Have consultations taken place on the issue of extending the line into County Donegal, which has a weak 110 kV system?The Minister indicated that an independent report will be made.  The report must have the widest possible terms of reference.  There is no point allocating a budget for the report if parameters are set for it.  Deputy Johnny Brady referred to the possibility of using disused railways.  Will dialogue take place between various Departments and between EirGrid and Iarnród Éireann regarding the link between Navan and Kingscourt?  Will Eirgrid consult the Department of Transport regarding ongoing surface area works on the M3?  Discussions must take place on all aspects of the issue.  Deputy McManus referred to best practice in Sweden where underground work is being carried out along railway tracks.  We need this type of integrated approach to service delivery.If there is to be proper terms of reference, the group campaigning in favour of underground provision should be involved in the study.  EirGrid will contribute an expert opinion on international best practice but the independent report must facilitate the campaigning groups from counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan.
