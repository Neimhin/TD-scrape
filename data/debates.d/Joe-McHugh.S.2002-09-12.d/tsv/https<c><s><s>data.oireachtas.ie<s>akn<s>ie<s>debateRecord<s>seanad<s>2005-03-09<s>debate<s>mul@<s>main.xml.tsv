JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A health and safety audit has been carried out on a national basis in most general hospitals over the past two weeks. The main objective of this audit is to determine whether hospitals are in breach of health and safety guidelines. Can the Leader ask the TÃ¡naiste on what basis these hospitals were selected? Why was Letterkenney General Hospital not selected? I have a sneaky suspicion that, as a result of overcrowding in the accident and emergency unit in the hospital, one Department would hold another Department in breach of the health and safety guidelines.We are sometimes very critical of RTE on its programming of cultural events. There was a very good programme on RTE last Sunday on the culture of south Donegal fiddle playing and its connection with Scotland. However, it was broadcast at 9.30 a.m. RTE needs to get real with the timing of its programming. That would be a good programme for evening viewing.
