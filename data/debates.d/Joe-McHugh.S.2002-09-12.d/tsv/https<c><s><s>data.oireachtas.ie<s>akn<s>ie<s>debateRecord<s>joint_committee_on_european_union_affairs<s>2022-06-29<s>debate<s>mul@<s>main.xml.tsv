JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Today we will engage with Mr. Filip Vurm, deputy head of mission at the embassy of the Czech Republic in Dublin, on the Czech Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte romhat, a Uasail Vurm, agus roimh do chomhghleacaithe go dtí an cruinniú inniu. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Vurm and his colleagues to the committee meeting today and we look forward to the dialogue on all things Europe, international and geopolitical in this challenging time. The most important thing for this committee, and it is certainly the focus of our committee, is to continue with engagement. Yesterday I met the Dutch ambassador and I met the Ukrainian ambassador at the weekend. This committee is very keen to keep all lines of communication open. We are absolutely delighted Mr. Vurm is here today to keep that conversation going. Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. I would also like to remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I would ask any member partaking by Microsoft Teams, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, that they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I on Mr. Filip Vurm to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Vurm. I will take Deputy Brendan Howlin, followed by Deputy Seán Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will just come in on that question. We have a history of joint purchases of vaccines but do you have anything else in mind? Are we talking possible fuel joint purchasing or maybe just-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay, thank you.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Vurm and now call Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. I call Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	For the first time in a long time, we have an opportunity for supplementary questions. I am going to show a lot of latitude today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge our historic ties. There is a Franciscan monastery in Prague that goes back to 1607 and the Flight of the Earls from my county. I have read online that a new survey by The Good Information Project has found as a nation Ireland is largely supportive of the EU but is unsure how it works. Will Mr. Vurm enlighten us on the feelings of citizens in the Czech Republic towards the European Union as a project? His contribution was very much focused on Europe being a consensus-building community rather than being an orchestra for the rest of the world, which comes from Václav Havel's philosophy. Will Mr. Vurm elaborate on the attitude of Czech citizens towards the European Union and their participation in it?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le Filip Vurm agus leis an gcomhchoiste fosta fa choinne na díospóireachta inniu. Rachaidh mé ar ais go dtí an Teachta Calleary agus an Seanadóir Keogan anois and we are all good. I thank Mr. Vurm for his time. We appreciate him coming before the committee today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Good luck with the Presidency and we look forward to future engagements.
