JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Clune and Crawford.I welcome the Minister to the House and concur with my colleagues on this side of the House in their scepticism.  We are handing part of a Department to the Department of Transport, run by the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and this does not instil confidence regarding competence and future direction.An array of experiences in the recent past also informs my personal scepticism.  The Department of Transport has formulated great plans on paper, but, similar to Chelsea Football Club, on the field it is a different story and we need only look to Transport 21 for evidence of this.  Even when Deputy Martin Cullen was Minister for Transport and I was a Member of the Seanad I asked parliamentary questions through my colleague, Deputy Dinny McGinley, regarding consultations with our colleagues across the Border seeking to bring about joined up thinking and joint strategies.  This drew a blank because the harsh reality is Transport 21 is built on foundations of sand and does not go into the long-term strategic thinking needed for our roads.There are regular announcements made regarding non-regional roads in the Border areas.  Prior to the recent general election the Taoiseach flew to Letterkenny in a helicopter to announce that there will be a motorway from Dublin to Derry.  That was a beautiful announcement when his party faced losing two of three seats in Donegal north-east and unfortunately it worked because Fianna Fáil held on to two of those seats.  Fortunately I squeezed in.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I struggled through and this incident exemplifies the approach to joined up thinking.  We are discussing non-regional roads but sharp focus is necessary when considering towns and villages such as St. Johnston, Muff and Carrigans.  These rural areas suffered considerably, both economically and socially, during the 30 years of the Troubles.  These are the forgotten areas that have not featured in mainstream thinking in regard to infrastructural development.  We politicians tend to focus on the grandiose announcements regarding motorways and dual carriageways.  I hope the Minister will look after these Border roads within the new framework.  Their condition is an absolute disgrace.  The EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and its successor, PEACE II, have filled a vacuum in funding in the past ten years.  In terms of long-term strategic thinking, however, we cannot expect local authorities to meet the maintenance costs involved.  We must adopt a strategic approach to developing these routes.Consideration must be given to the provision of railway services in the region.  Donegal County Council presented a document to the strategic committee in recent days putting forward the case for opening up a former railway route to St. Johnston from Letterkenny and though Strabane.  I am disappointed that the Minister is being sidetracked from transport issues.  He is generally subjected to a barrage of criticism, but I had faith in him in this regard.  It was galling to hear a spokesperson for Iarnród Éireann saying on RTE Radio 1, with reference to the Sligo-Dublin route, that the number of rail passengers is continually increasing.  This is something we must tap into in terms of long-term strategy.Other types of infrastructural projects also require funding.  I put a question to the Minister for Transport as to whether there will be a funding mechanism for the continuance of the ferry route from Magilligan to Greencastle in north Inishowen.  The response was that the Department has no responsibility in this regard.  This points once again to the lack of joined up thinking in respect of public service provision.  The north west is a peripheral area and the lack of railway infrastructure means we must rely entirely on the transportation of goods by road.There is much talk of centralised decision-making, and we must look at that as an opportunity.  The National Roads Authority receives funding for the improvement and maintenance of national primary and secondary roads.  However, there has been an absolute deficit in terms of broader vision.  The NRA must give up the notion that a particular road project is a stand-alone one simply because it happens to be a national primary or secondary road.  Linkages can be created.  Some of the finest regional roads can be as good as, if not better than, some national secondary roads.I call for a broadening of thinking in terms of the strategic linkage between our national primary and secondary routes, on the one hand, and our non-national and regional roads, on the other.  I am sceptical about the purpose of this legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Shatter, on tabling this motion.  This is a national issue and the Minister of State does not require Opposition Members to inform him of this.  The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party had a robust debate on this issue and the Minister of State is aware that many of his colleagues are against the proposed new intervention and the new subvention scheme.  However, the sad reality is that the Minister of State's parliamentary colleagues will back him tomorrow night in voting down the Fine Gael motion, which has been welcomed nationwide.I attended a meeting in Letterkenny last night at which more than 200 service providers and parents were present.  As the Minister has been involved in this game for much longer than me, the last thing he needs is some advice from a novice like me.  However, as a rural Deputy or Minister of State, I advise him to take heed of developments.  If this proposal is implemented on 1 July, this issue will be brought onto the streets.  A campaign is being formed at present and the proposed changes are not going down well.  I advise the Minister of State to intervene at this early stage.The wheel was not broken, in that a bottom-up approach was in place whereby parents got together on a voluntary basis to work with service providers.  Incidentally, those service providers worked on a voluntary basis at preschool for years as best they could under difficult circumstances.  The advent of this scheme meant they could be rewarded for their work and could receive a wage.  The devolved wage system that has been in use for the past six years worked and provided some credibility to the projects.  In tandem with increased capital funding, there have been significant improvements in the manner in which young people are treated at a preschool level.However, the Government proposals will take this away and will pull the carpet from under a working scheme.  The scheme allowed children to sit side by side, whose parents were in receipt of family income support or social welfare benefits or whose parents were working at different levels of the income stream.  We were getting rid of the stigmatisation of those who felt inadequate.  Children were ready to enter primary school, where the sons and daughters of parents who were working would sit side by side with the sons and daughters of those in receipt of family income support and social welfare benefits.  The Government's proposals will begin a process of segregation.  A beautiful integration project was in place that operated on a bottom-up basis, was community and family-led and used the best possible practice.  Young people with proper qualifications and training were involved and this scheme was working.  However, the Minister of State is pulling the rug from under it.Last September, as soon as I raised this issue, the Minister of State appeared on my local radio station one Friday evening to accuse me of being preposterous in my insinuation that the proposed scheme would not work.  He came out with some sort of nonsense to the effect that funding would be increased by 16%.  If this issue is considered at an economic level, there will be an increase in certain areas.  However, how will such an increase take effect if, as my colleague, Deputy Sheahan, has noted, there will be white elephants dotted across the country?  Such white elephants will lack both service providers and young people.  This matter should be taken seriously and the Minister of State should heed the contributions to the debate from this side of the House.
