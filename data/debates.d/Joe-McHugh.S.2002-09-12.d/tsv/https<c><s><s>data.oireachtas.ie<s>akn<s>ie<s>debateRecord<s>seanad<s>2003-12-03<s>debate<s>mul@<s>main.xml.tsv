JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As today is budget day, which will involve considerable debate on both sides of the House, I do not want to go into this matter yet. However, the staff at Letterkenny General Hospital are experiencing a serious work overload. The nurses there are working at 110% of capacity. For the past two days they have had to close the day care unit because they do not have 40 beds which were promised by the Department of Health and Children. Rather than asking for the Minister to come to the House, I ask for the Leader's indulgence in trying to contact somebody in the Department. The nurses went public yesterday to express their concern about not only the staffing problems, but also patient care.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While I agree this might be suitable for discussion on the Adjournment, it is serious. Even if money is thrown at us following today's budget, it will not solve the problem. There is an infrastructural deficit concerning beds that should have been provided. I call for the Leader's intervention.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá failte roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Bhille seo. Tá brón orm nach labharfaidh mé as Gaeilge inniu ach tá mé ag dul go rang seachtainiúil. B'fhéidir go mbeidh tuilleadh muiníne agam an bhliain seo chugainn.I welcome the Minister and this timely Bill, with which my party has no difficulty. I also welcome the fact that the Minister spoke as Béarla. I know that he holds a Gaeltacht portfolio, but his use of English makes matters somewhat easier for Members who do not speak Irish.I wish to digress to a certain extent and discuss the definition of island, particularly as it relates to Inch Island off the coast of Donegal. The Minister has probably received numerous representations from his colleagues in respect of this island. Transportation to the island is not a problem and emergency transportation can gain access through the road network. However, there is another side to this story, namely, the infrastructural deficit that exists on the island. There are still 300 people living on the island who continue to refer to themselves as islanders. There is a small fishing industry on the island but there is no road leading down to the existing pier, which is almost devoid of the up to date facilities required to land a fleet.I presume the Minister is already well aware of this matter. However, I would welcome it if there was anything that could be done by way of changing the legislative detail. The place in question is called Inch Islanders and the people who live there refer to themselves as islanders. The Minister referred to the culture that exists on the Aran Islands and Inisbofin. The people to whom I refer have the culture and way of life of an island community. At present, a land mass must be completely surrounded by water for a particular period each year to be classified as an island. However, some provision must be made in terms of considering the cultural and infrastructural aspects.I have no difficulty with the Bill. Anything which can help people to travel to and from the islands, particularly Tory Island, is welcome. We must keep our eye on the ball, however, and ensure that the existing ferry services are not adversely affected.I visited the Aran Islands in 1990. They were, to an extent, commercialised at that stage. People involved in business on the islands have stated that they are now becoming even more commercialised. It is a question of sustainability. The Minister is correct with regard to the direct and positive contribution made by the Aran Islands to the economy of Galway. The same can be said of Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, which is visited by many people each year. I visit Arranmore once or twice a year and bring some friends of mine from Dublin whose lives in the city are hectic. They visit Arranmore in winter to get away from commercialism and everything else. I accept there is an argument that islanders must still be in a position to make money. However, we must achieve a balance without making it completely commercial and focus also on the area of protection.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There were problems before the rainbow coalition came to office.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is outrageous behaviour.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	From a health point of view.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is why they brought in the chemist.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator should mention Deputy Perry also.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. It is appropriate that he will respond to my comments, as he pays attention to matters in County Donegal as part of his national brief. I would like to discuss the difficulties being experienced by St. Mura's national school in Buncrana and Monreagh national school in Carrigans.St. Mura's national school in Buncrana has been waiting for funds to be allocated so that it can be refurbished. There are great plans to redevelop the school. An extension to the school is planned because there is a lack of space there at present. Its principal has to conduct her office work in a classroom. The old-style two-room school in Buncrana was built in 1930. The school authorities are waiting for an announcement on when the building programme will be enacted. There is some confusion in this regard, as it has been suggested that construction will commence in 2004. I ask the Minister of State to commit to a date in his response. The parents of the pupils at St. Mura's are being punished for keeping the school up to scratch on a voluntary basis. The school should not be punished because it does not fall into the grant assistance category for developing schools. It should be kept on the list.The case of Monreagh national school in Carrigans is somewhat different. It was built in 1853 and celebrated its 150th anniversary last weekend. The school authorities in Carrigans have asked for a new building. They would like the Government to commit to when the land acquisition deal will be signed. The board of management is embarrassed because it has engaged in fund-raising, in which parents have been involved. Those associated with the school want to know why the construction has not started, when it will start and if it will start. The board of management is seeking a commitment in this regard and I hope the Minister of State can provide it.I welcome the increase of €30 million for primary and secondary schools in the budget. The small schools to which I refer are the 19 pupil school in Monreagh and the 40 pupil St. Mura's primary school in Buncrana, which are a microcosm of the education system. In that context, one must consider that €7.5 million is required to build one national school in Ennis, County Clare. I have serious reservations about where this money will come from for an overall national strategy. The boards of management of these schools do not want any more false promises or commitments. The board of Monreagh national school wants a start date for land acquisition so that the school building programme can proceed and the board of St. Mura's seeks a commitment as to when it can proceed with refurbishment.
