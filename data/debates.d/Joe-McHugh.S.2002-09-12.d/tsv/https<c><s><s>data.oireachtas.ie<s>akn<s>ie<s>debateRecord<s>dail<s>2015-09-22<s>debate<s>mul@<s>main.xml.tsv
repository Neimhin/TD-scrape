JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his question. The post office network plays an important role in serving the needs of business and domestic customers alike. However, the postal sector is undergoing systemic change, with migration towards electronic communications resulting in significant core mail volume decline year-on-year. It remains Government policy that An Post remain a strong and viable company. In recognition of the changing commercial environment the Minister established the post office network business development group, of which I a member, earlier this year. The group's remit is to examine the potential from existing and new Government and commercial business that could be transacted through the post office network. The group presented its initial report to the Minister in May 2015 and outlined, in summary, that the future of the post office network would be best secured by seeking out opportunities in the following areas: financial services, including basic banking for the unbanked, Government services, social capital and enterprise, and white labelling of financial and other products. To gain further insight into these areas, a public consultation exercise was held from 16 June to 28 July. Interested parties were invited to submit their views on the initial report. A total of 16 responses were received, and a summary of these responses together with the initial report is published on the Department's website. It is clear from the responses received that there is a strong public desire to maintain the nationwide network of post offices. While An Post remains a trusted brand, with 1,132 active company- and contractor-operated post offices as well as 125 postal agencies, it needs to further diversify into areas such as financial services and continue to develop attractive products and services that customers want and need. The consultation responses will assist the group in identifying opportunities that can benefit the post office network and will inform the final report, which I expect to be submitted to the Minister later in the autumn.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We had the debate in the House regarding the letters that went out. I believe we were in unison in that regard. The option of the banks was difficult-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There was a difficulty, and it was expressed on both sides of the House. The social welfare contract is the kernel of the matter and is critical to post offices at the moment. We have to look at the broad spectrum, including services that are available in other departments within counties. Let us consider the consultation process. Deputies can see all the submissions on the Department's website. We should listen to the post office people themselves. A campaign is under way at the moment as part of which post office proprietors are inviting politicians in. I have met a number of them. In one particular town a postmistress came up with the idea of having a one-stop shop and tourism information outlet along the Wild Atlantic Way. We have to look at all the options. We have to look at footfall, but we have to look at the bread-and-butter issues as well, and the Government contracts are critical to that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, is clear on this. A communiqué went out in the aftermath of the sending of the letters. She has been clear in saying that no further letters will go out. That answers the first question. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, will be looking at all legislation that comes before him in this House. No doubt we can have a conversation at that time.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to providing 40% of its electricity energy, 12% of its heating energy and 10% of its transport power from renewable sources. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, especially in the heat and transport sectors. Meeting our renewable electricity targets will require the delivery of critical grid infrastructure and the construction of additional renewable electricity generation capacity. To further support the use of renewable electricity and heat, the Department launched two separate consultations on 31 July 2015 on support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed renewable heat incentive. While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme. Subject to Government approval and state aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes will become available in 2016. Ireland aims to meet its target for renewable transport mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels. Increasing usage of electric vehicles will also make a contribution. Further increases to the obligation rate in the biofuels obligation scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target. The Minister, Deputy White, intends to initiate a consultation on this over the coming weeks. The Minister is finalising a White Paper on energy policy, which will be published by the end of the year. The overall objective of the White Paper is to provide a coherent joined-up policy statement aimed at ensuring that Ireland has a modern, sustainable, secure and cost-effective integrated energy system which will support the transition to a largely decarbonised society and economy by 2050. The White Paper will be set in the context of broader EU energy policy, as recently articulated in both the Energy Union strategy and the EU 2030 climate and energy framework document for coherent climate and energy policies.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I share Deputy Colreavy's concerns on the need for joined-up thinking and the need to put a plan in place. My predecessor, the former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, worked very hard on a bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom that did not come to fruition. It is off the agenda now. A good deal of focus went into that at the time. Anyway, the White Paper is an opportunity to pursue the agenda of the three main pillars, namely, security of supply, competitiveness, and - this relates to Deputy Colreavy's second point - self-sufficiency over a period. As I have said before, we have to learn from the mistakes of the past.Mistakes were made in the approach by the private sector regarding what went on in the midlands, such as the forward planning announcements of vast numbers of turbines without consulting the community. If any lesson can be learned from that, it should be that we should be big and mature enough to put up our hands. If we are to have an energy supply challenge, we will need to develop the grid in a mature and responsible way, in consultation with communities.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On possible new schemes in 2016, following consultation, there will be the possibility of funding schemes for SMEs and households for things such as renewable heat incentives. Once those proposals and policies come to the fore, we will be in a position to elaborate further on them. On tensions between Departments, I do not see what happened as a tension. There is ongoing engagement and it is important to note that all of the experience of the past has to be part of the conversations on new guidelines.  On whether we can put a moratorium on any type of development between periods of time, there are inherent challenges. The biggest lesson we can learn has two fronts. First, the community has to be pivotal in the conversation and local authorities can play a major role in that regard. Second, there is a great opportunity for communities to have self-sustaining energy production. I was in a secondary school a number of months ago which has an electricity bill of around €10,000 a year. If it had the option of generating and providing its own electricity, it would be a win-win from community, security of supply and affordability points of view. A lot of very concrete and competent submissions have been made to the White Paper at a community level. That is where we must have a focus.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. The national broadband plan draft intervention strategy which was published on 15 July 2015 sets out a series of detailed proposals by Government in respect of the proposed State intervention. It sets out the key elements of the intervention, what services are proposed and how they will be delivered. It outlines various aspects of the proposed intervention, including the type of network envisaged, the minimum speeds envisaged, the length of the contract for services and whether the network should be public or privately owned. The draft intervention strategy has been developed following intensive engagement with industry and wider stakeholders. In addition, the European Commission has set out detailed guidelines on what is required to obtain state aid approval for Government interventions in the broadband sector. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has followed these guidelines when formulating the proposed intervention strategy. Through ongoing commercial investment, most of our cities and towns will benefit from high speed broadband over the coming years. The areas that are not covered by commercial investment are the target for State-funded investment.  Last November, the Minister published a national high speed coverage map for 2016, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. The map shows Ireland with two colours, blue and amber, and was developed based on the most up-to-date information available at the time of publication. The areas marked blue represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services by the end of 2016. The areas marked amber represent those areas where the State intends to intervene to ensure those areas will have access to high speed broadband services and this includes all the offshore islands.  The Department is currently in the process of updating the map, taking into consideration any new information received or operator announcements made of any new plans. It is expected that an updated version of the map will be published before the end of this year. The national broadband plan's ambition is to achieve 100% access to high speed broadband by the end of 2020, with 85% of all premises covered by 2018. I assure the Deputy that communities in offshore islands will be served either through commercial investment or State intervention.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not disagree with any of the Deputy's points on ensuring that we provide mobile phone or broadband coverage on the islands. This debate is important because the national broadband plan will go to public procurement by the end of this year. As part of that intervention, it will target the 30% of Ireland, including the islands, that is not commercially viable. The winning bidder or bidders in the procurement process will be in a position to provide that service. No decision has been made on where we start or which areas should get broadband first. It is important to have that debate and this is an opportunity to highlight the potential of the islands.  As the Deputy knows, the islands are an integral part of the Wild Atlantic Way along the west coast. Given that hundreds of thousands of people intend to visit the area and will need broadband services when they are on holiday, we should include it in the debate. It is an important area which needs priority broadband intervention.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy again for raising this matter. It is important to point out that 85% of the 30% intervention area will be completed by 2018, but this work will start next year. In the Deputy's contribution she spoke about the potential on the islands and those living on the islands. To give a particular example, I met a person last week who works in Scotland and on Arranmore Island, who is looking for direct connectivity between Glasgow and Donegal and Arranmore Island. She highlighted the absolute need for broadband in the work in which she is involved. I completely take the Deputy's point and her proposal or suggestion to engage with the islands on the issue. This engagement has started because there has been much public discourse coming from the islands. The Deputy also mentioned education. The Department funds an art course on Sherkin Island and broadband is a prerequisite for that course.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The provision of mobile telephony services is subject to a requirement to secure access to the required radio spectrum by way of licence. The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, as amended. Licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on mobile network operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations. However, given that mobile services are a radio-based technology, services can be affected by several factors. These include topography, the capacity of the network and, more generally, the level and quality of access customers have to mobile phone antennae. Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennae due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers. In terms of improving the quality and coverage of mobile services in all areas throughout the country, there are various initiatives under way to achieve this aim. The commercial telecommunications sector is investing approximately €2.5 billion in upgrading and modernising both fixed and mobile networks. This includes some €850 million invested in acquiring spectrum under the 2012 multi-band spectrum auction run by ComReg. Since then, the mobile operators have all continued to invest in rolling out 4G and enhanced 3G services nationwide. These investments are improving both the coverage and quality of voice and data services throughout the country, although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrading mobile services nationwide. Local authorities also have an important role to play in terms of facilitating the siting of necessary infrastructure such as masts and antennae. The Telecoms and Internet Federation, TIF, which is part of IBEC, has been quite proactive in seeking to meet local authorities and public representatives to discuss fully the various issues around mobile coverage and the factors that can impact on the quality of service consumers experience. I encourage all local authorities and public representatives to engage with the TIF on these important issues.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. There is no point saying there are no problems because it is a difficulty. One hears many reasons. When the Deputy made the point yesterday on the radio, he heard technical reasons it is not happening, but the texts coming in from the public were in support of the Deputy's point that coverage has deteriorated. There are all sorts of reasons and I will not waste the Deputy's time or the public's time on whether it is because data gets priority over phone calls or whether it is because of an increase in data being communicated. There are antenna challenges. I take the Deputy's point on doing an audit of mobile phone coverage on a national basis. It is something about which we cannot be complacent. Mobile coverage is as important as broadband. People do business on their hands-free kit on the road. There is nothing more frustrating than dropping a call, and it does happen. It happened to me a couple of times today on the way to Dublin from Donegal. It happens quite regularly in Northern Ireland also. Perhaps we could widen the debate. I will certainly speak to my colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, who is Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to see whether different factors are involved in Northern Ireland, whether it is looking to do things differently and whether there is something we could learn together. The same sequence of dropping calls happens there as it does in the South when I am en route to Dublin.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will certainly pass on the Deputy's sentiments to the Minister, Deputy White. There is a critical mix of stakeholders, be it the industry or local authorities. We can look at what did not go right in the past, when we built new motorways, and if there was enough engagement between the Government and the National Roads Authority, NRA, in the building of antennae beside motorways. We can look at what went wrong but the critical issue is to move forward. We should do anything we can as a Department to increase the engagement with different providers in the private sector. In my constituency, where there have been gaps, lapses or an unwinding of the service in certain areas, representatives of the private sector have met people in the community. We need to do more of that and I encourage service providers to let people know what is planned in a particular area and, if there are deficits, we need to meet them head on.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am aware of these concerns and I have received documentation from individuals. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I fully appreciate the fact that the emergency call answering service, ECAS, has been operating to an extremely high standard, with the dedication of the operators and the quality of the service they provide being a major contributor to this. The ECAS operators handle calls effectively and efficiently, often in response to stressful and distressing situations for citizens. The service answers more than 2 million calls annually and has one of the fastest emergency call answering times in Europe. BT Ireland has operated ECAS on behalf of my Department under a concession agreement since July 2010 and is responsible for the conditions and resourcing of the service. BT Ireland employs a third party contractor, Conduit Ireland Limited, to provide operators to answer calls. Operators at ECAS call answering centres in Navan, Ballyshannon and Dublin process emergency calls and forward these to the appropriate emergency service as quickly and effectively as possible. BT Ireland uses an industry standard model to determine the number of operators required across each centre. It forecasts the number of operators required to meet the necessary operational requirements on a monthly basis and notifies Conduit six weeks in advance. BT Ireland has a health and safety policy of having a minimum of two operators on each site at any one time. This facilitates appropriate breaks, ensures the work environment is safe and allows operators time to recover if they have taken especially stressful calls. In addition, BT line managers directly answer calls if required. The number and cost of operators is assessed annually by the Commission for Communications Regulation as part of its annual review of the cost of the ECAS service. An expert report commissioned by ComReg is appended to this review. The latest expert report was appended to a decision on costs by ComReg published in January 2015. The expert report states that ECAS "is run effectively against the service targets and quality requirements and overall is approaching 'leading practice' from a performance perspective". Furthermore, ComReg's review concluded that an increase to the operator’s hourly rate was reasonable and notified BT Ireland accordingly. This is a matter now for BT and Conduit and I understand that discussions between the two companies are advanced, with a view to addressing ComReg's findings. I hope, therefore, that the matter can be dealt with quickly, given the important service that ECAS operators provide.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy again for raising this important issue. In the correspondence I have seen, as the Deputy has correctly alluded to, people use the two words, "dignity" and "respect". I am hopeful that the ongoing conversation between Conduit and BT Ireland will lead to a conclusion to this that will be favourable. I am not in a position to say whether this will happen or what will be the outcome, but I am hopeful that when people are talking and engaged in the matter, we will get an outcome that can be accepted by the workers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am in danger of repeating myself. I am clearly not involved in negotiations or conversations between BT Ireland and Conduit but I am led to believe that conversations are ongoing. I am hopeful there will be a successful outcome. The Deputy asked if the Minister can intervene if that is not the case. At this stage we must focus on a successful outcome, which is important from the workers' perspective. It is also important because we are talking about a stressful environment and these people are at the coalface. They receive phone calls that can be very stressful from time to time. It is important we highlight this. The Deputy has raised this issue publicly and I encourage BT Ireland and Conduit to take the issue seriously. I have no doubt they are doing so. I hope we can have a favourable outcome for the workers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A similar question was asked before this one. I could read the prepared reply into the record for the Deputy's benefit or speak to the issue in general.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I sat on the business development group and Mr. Bobby Kerr was very sincere and genuine in his approach to pulling together all the various stakeholders. The Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, and I are on the group so there is political input. There are other representative groups and stakeholders as well. From day one, Mr. Kerr was consistent in saying that he wanted outcomes and proposals to go directly to the Minister.Later in the autumn, after all the consultation input has been collated, we will be making proposals that will not only be going to the Minister, Deputy White's desk, but to Cabinet. Within that, as we discussed with Deputy Moynihan earlier in respect of social welfare and other Government contracts, there are bread-and-butter issues with the post office which needs these contracts to survive. That has been the focus and has been very much the way Bobby Kerr has steered this. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Bobby's role in this. It is not finished; there is still a lot of work to do. It is not about convincing the electorate that things might happen. Key commitments must be given by various Departments, whether the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, where there are services through local authorities that could potentially help post offices. The Deputy's raising of this question today helps to feed into this process and I thank her for that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I share Deputy Mulherin's concern and that of all the Deputies. Whether one is on Tory Island, where the postmaster has told me that is where people meet on pension day, where they talk and congregate, or in Letterkenny, Castlebar or Westport, one will be meeting people in the post office and that must be the focus. The bread and butter issue in respect of the service providers, the postmistresses and postmasters is keeping the offices open. That does require Government contracts and we must keep the focus there. As I said earlier, a certain person who runs a post office suggested to me that there is a role for the Wild Atlantic Way. As a Mayo person, Deputy Mulherin can think of post offices along the Wild Atlantic Way, in small villages and towns, which could be information points for people coming in and wanting to know about the services in a particular area. Ideas like that are critical in forming the basis of Bobby Kerr's report and it is important that we continue to feed into it as legislators and remain vigilant. We have to look at other countries too. I saw a photograph recently of a post office in Australia, which was a hub, a place where people congregated, no different from in Ireland. It is the same the world over, but we have to ensure their survival through continued Government intervention.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will take the Deputy's first point about the tourism. I must say, I admire that, as a Clare man, he is looking to spread the tourism outwards.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Hopefully he will send a few upwards, because I heard a projected figure of 1.2 million tourists visiting the Cliffs of Moher this year, so they are doing well. I compliment everyone in the tourism sector in County Clare in that regard. He is right that there are opportunities. I am glad he made that submission as well. That is a proactive way of doing that. I do not think there are any obstacles to providing the card. When we think of providing a card for a post office, we do not have to be looking at the possibility of an ATM at a post office because if a person has a current account and has a card, they can use it anywhere, in any other banking outlet. There is work going on in respect of that. Key discussions about financial services and opportunities are happening. To instil confidence in the public, we have to ensure that this agenda stays live.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Sorry, on tourism?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, I raised that because it was a submission made by a postmistress in Dunfanaghy, County Donegal, and I am glad to see that Dunfanaghy is on the same wavelength as County Clare.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Strategy for Financial Inclusion, which is being led by the Department of Finance, called for the nationwide launch of a standard bank account as a first step in promoting financial inclusion. A pilot project for a standard bank account was completed in March 2013 after a nine-month pilot period. A total of 205 accounts were opened during the pilot. The report of the working group on the pilot project noted a number of reasons for the low level of take-up, including the view of stakeholders that one of the key elements required as part of the preparations for a successful national roll-out of a standard bank account is greater involvement by An Post and the credit unions. The Department of Finance is currently transposing the payment accounts directive, which requires that all consumers legally resident in the EU must have access to a payment account with basic features, regardless of their financial circumstances. The directive must be transposed by September 2016 and the Department of Finance is considering how to make progress on this issue in light of the experience of the standard bank account pilot project. The initial report of the post office network business development group was presented to the Minister in May 2015. The report identified the provision of financial services, including those for the unbanked, as fundamental to the future viability of the post office network. There are several advantages in offering basic banking services through the post office network, including the trust factor and the community focus of the network. Successfully aligning these advantages with the provision of suitable basic banking products has the capacity both to support financial inclusion and enhance the role of the post office network. While it is too early to indicate the contents of the final report, financial services will be an important component of it. I expect the final report to be submitted to the Minister later in the autumn.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To take Deputy Pringle's last point on a uniform response, my confidence lies in the fact that this business development group's report will land not only on the Minister, Deputy White's desk but in front of the Cabinet. It will be subject to discussion by Cabinet which will also discuss acceptance of the proposals. It has to be uniform, united and proactive. Otherwise, there would have been no point doing this in the first place. I am not here to be part of a business development group which is not serious about what it intends doing. There has to be an outcome, be it financial or through Government intervention. The Deputy referred to trust in banking. Credit unions and post offices are in the community. Those in the banking sector, including many who are retired, would speak of the lack of community engagement today whereas bankers knew their communities 15, 20 or 25 years ago. The credit unions and the post offices know the people in their communities and they are now at an advantage in terms of winning the trust of the public. What we have got to do is build on that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government is committed to the retention of the post offices. That is why we have a business development group and why Mr. Bobby Kerr was appointed. However, there is no point having a group if one does not do anything with it. Mr. Kerr and all the members of the group are intent on putting proposals to Government, because it has to feed back in and those proposals must be tangible. Deputy Pringle is correct that the letters issuing from the Department of Social Protection eroded confidence in the future viability of post offices and created difficulties, and we need to be united. It needs to be a Government approach. The Government commitment is there and it is about following through on the commitment. That can only be done by having proposals, listing them and stating where we will follow through. That is also subject to procurement. Government cannot provide all these services merely by stating it is providing them. There are difficulties, and the House will be aware of the difficulties that arose with a certain service that is being rolled out at present.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for 2014 show that 8.6% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy. More specifically, the SEAI has calculated that 22.6% of electricity, 6.7% of heat and 5.2% of transport were met from renewable sources. While the progress to date is encouraging, significant challenges remain, especially in the heat and transport sectors. Meeting our renewable electricity targets will require the delivery of critical grid infrastructure and the construction of additional renewable electricity generation capacity. Regarding renewable electricity, the Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, REFIT, schemes underpin the development of a range of technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. These schemes will be closed to new applications at the end of this year. In terms of renewable heat, in addition to existing measures such as Part L of the building regulations, the 2014 draft bioenergy plan recommended the introduction of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources. On 31 July, the Department launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed renewable heat incentive. While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September 2015, there will be two further opportunities to contribute at key stages in the design of any new scheme. Subject to Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission, the new schemes will become available in 2016. As regards renewable transport, Ireland aims to meet its target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels. Increasing usage of electric vehicles will also make a contribution. Further increases to the obligation rate in the biofuels obligation scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target, and the Minister intends to initiate a consultation on this over the coming weeks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy is correct in her observation about our reliance on fossil fuels and the statistics back up that observation. We import coal from Poland. We import coal on ships from Colombia. That is the reality of the world we live in. With the price of oil being so low at present, the consumer-led consumption of that product from an economic point of view is great in that it is cheaper for consumers, but at the same time we still must keep the focus on renewables. That is why we must be as proactive as ever, through the university sector, in the progression of offshore wind, hydro and tidal wave. While that research and development is going on within the universities and they work closely with industry, we must up the ante. I note one particular submission to the White Paper is looking at floating turbines off the west coast. We must be ambitious. A big focus of this House over the past four and half years has been on the economy and trying to get us out of the mess we were in. We must look at new technologies, how quickly technology is changing, and be ambitious and creative around that engagement between the university sector and industry. Government must support that in whatever way possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy's last point about urgency and creativity.We must be bold at a European level, and while we were unsuccessful in the bilateral between the UK and Ireland, France is also an option in terms of linking into the European grid. If we can provide offshore floating wind turbines, as an example, we should be examining and harnessing that potential. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is in fisheries, and there are proposals around Ireland's ocean wealth. Within that there is the ongoing research, urgency and creativity around what we can use off our west coast, and off our east coast, for that matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We dovetailed into this question in the previous one.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources	2002-09-12	None	Two creative minds are a dangerous thing in the House. I thank the Deputy for the question. The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. A well-balanced fuel mix that provides reliable energy, minimises costs and protects against supply disruptions and price volatility is essential to Irish consumers. While fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix as we transit to a largely decarbonised energy system by 2050, significant progress is being made in increasing the share of renewables in the mix. Provisional figures provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, for 2014 indicate that energy import dependency fell to 85% in 2014. This was driven by lower demand for coal, oil and gas coupled with increased indigenous production of energy. The bulk of the increase in indigenous energy was from renewable sources and the remainder from peat. In summer 2014, the European Commission, under the European energy security strategy, carried out stress tests in the event of a Russia-Ukraine gas disruption. This stress test was co-ordinated for Ireland by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. The results showed that Ireland was likely to be one of the countries that would be least likely to be adversely affected. The results also showed that, in the event of such a disruption, gas prices would be likely to increase. The European energy security strategy also proposes to increase energy production in the EU and to diversify supplier countries and routes. Energy security is a key pillar of the European Commission's recently published European energy union strategy, which Ireland strongly supports. In Ireland we have a policy framework that is incentivising both an increase in indigenous renewable energy and the exploration and production of indigenous non-renewable fuel sources. Both of these energy sources contribute to reducing import dependency. Meeting our renewable electricity targets will require the delivery of critical grid infrastructure and the construction of additional renewable electricity generation capacity.

 There are a number of other important measures which also enhance our energy security such as EU funding for infrastructure, EU legislation that promotes co-operation on energy security, energy demand reduction measures, good emergency planning and oil storage reserves.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ireland is not in a position to solve all our energy issues in isolation and we have no intention of doing so. We are part of the European Union, a collective grouping of countries with the same sense of responsibility. Whether it is EU funding for infrastructure or EU legislation that promotes co-operation on energy security or energy demand reduction measures, we must work together. It is critical that we continue that co-operation and we cannot be exposed. Although I am very conscious that we are an island, we are also connected in other ways, be it at European Commission or European Parliament level. My colleagues in the European Parliament are very focused on energy security issues. There is an electorate in this country that is very genuine, sincere and passionate about climate change and, politically, we must tap into that new energy - pardon the pun - and vibrancy in a young, smart, intelligent electorate that wants to contribute to meeting the challenge.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can blame myself for introducing climate change into the question. The Deputy is right. It is important and it is a wider context within the climate change Bill, which will be discussed in this House and the Seanad. There must be an integrated departmental approach. I recently met a group in Letterkenny regarding climate change and energy security. As legislators, we are faced with difficult decisions. We must use our place at a global level, and Ireland can do it, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, at a UN and European level. We are doing it, and we must use our strong voice in these different corridors to push for an overall global, European approach to these very challenging issues.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has broadened his question. I will take the broader aspects and then read into the record. We are not putting the costs down in this phase of the conversation. As the Deputy knows, it will go to a public procurement process. There will be money available for this Government intervention. The Department would not have spent time contacting the European Commission to ensure all the t's are crossed and the i's dotted regarding State-led intervention without having the backup, and the Government is committed to it. There is no plan yet as to which areas will be done first. While 30% of the land mass is not commercially viable, this could change over the next six months if operators decide to intervene in particular locations. If the likes of Eircom - now known as Eir - or other companies come in and propose to provide broadband to certain towns, it is important that there would be a commitment there. My officials are working very hard and very closely with the operators that announce that they will provide broadband in a particular town and there must be the question of responsibility at a private intervention level and at Government level.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Slightly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps the Deputy has extra information, anecdotal or otherwise, on the Australian experience. I do not doubt that my officials have done their research and examined the best possible solution. I know that under the SIRO solution in towns, houses are being connected in Cavan at the moment. There are plans for large towns like Castlebar, Westport and Letterkenny. The Deputy is correct when he alludes to the age-old core-periphery argument about whether services should always go into more populated areas in the first instance and what happens rural areas in such circumstances. No decision has yet been made on how this will be rolled out in the 30% of areas that are de facto rural areas. That decision will probably be made in co-operation between the Department and whoever the preferred bidder or bidders, or successful company or companies, will be. Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised issues relating to the importance of the islands. These are big questions that keep being raised. As a Sligo man who also represents a large rural population in County Leitrim, Deputy Colreavy wants to ensure there is equity and balance. I take his points.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of its energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heating and 10% of transport power from renewable sources. On 31 July last, the Department launched two separate consultations on new support schemes, one for renewable electricity and one for a proposed renewable heat incentive. While the initial phase of both consultations closed on 18 September last, there will be two further opportunities to contribute to this. Ireland aims to meet its renewable transport targets mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels. Increased use of electric vehicles will also make a contribution. Further increases to the obligation rate in the biofuels obligation scheme will be required in the context of achieving our 2020 target. The Minister intends to initiate a consultation over the coming weeks. The details requested by the Deputy concerning the sources of renewable electricity generation projects that have been developed, or are in the course of being developed, are available on the EirGrid and ESB Networks websites. Greenhouse gas emissions targets are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a fair question. I am reasonably satisfied because I have met many people from the various groups that have made submissions on the White Paper. I am more than reasonably satisfied with some of the submissions that have been made. While the Government has a role to play in this, obviously the private sector will play a big role too. I am looking forward to the collation of all the submissions that have been made through the White Paper regarding the three pillars of heat, transport and energy. I think it is critical that we are serious about it. I am confident that the intricate relationship between the Government and the creative sector within business will provide the solutions. There are smart people with solutions out there and we have to respond to them.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Nolan as an gceist seo a chur síos anocht. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt do na Teachtaí Kyne agus O'Mahony fosta. Bhí mé i dteagmháil leo thar na seachtaine seo a chuaigh thart. Ní raibh an Teachta Kyne sa tír ar an gcéad lá - bhí sé ar a laethanta saoire thar sáile - ach bhí mé i dteagmháil leis achan lá. Nuair a tháinig sé ar ais óna laethanta saoire, bhí mé i dteagmháil leis fosta. Mar is eol don Teachta Nolan, bhí comhairliúchán cuimsitheach ar siúl le comhlachtaí maithe. Thosaigh an próiseas ag an am sin. I ndiaidh an phróisis sin leis na comhlachtaí, bhí cúpla moladh ar siúl. Níl mé san áit anocht chun an cheist a d'ardaigh an Teachta a fhreagairt ós rud é go bhfuil an próiseas ar siúl. Níl an cinneadh déanta. Mar Aire Stáit, níl mé freagrach as an gcinneadh atá le déanamh ag an OGP. Tá an oifig sin i Roinn eile, atá freagrach as an bpróiseas agus as an gcinneadh. Tuigim na deacrachtaí atá ar na hoileáin go ginearálta, go háirithe muna bhfuil an ceangal tábhachtach ann idir an tír mhór agus na hoileáin fríd an bhád farantóireachta. É sin ráite, chas mé le muintir Árann i rith an phróisis. Bhí mé i dteagmháil leis na daoine atá mar cheannairí ar na hOileáin Árann. Tá an próiseas comhairliúcháin atá idir mhuintir na n-oileán agus mé féin mar Aire Stáit tábhachtach. Thosaigh an comhairliúchán sin roimh an phróisis atá ar siúl anois. I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. Since the air service is the subject of an ongoing public procurement process, I have been advised that it would not be appropriate to make any comment on same or say anything that might in any way prejudice it or any appeal that might be made regarding the outcome of the procurement process by way of a judicial review to the High Court. It has always been my aim to ensure a continuation of an air service for the Aran Islands. As required under the relevant EU regulation, my Department commissioned a comprehensive review of the need for a public service obligation, PSO, service to the Aran Islands in 2014. This review was published in May of last year. It covered the period from 2003 to 2013 and I am satisfied that it was rigorous in its investigations and fair in its findings. The review recognised the importance of the air service to the island communities and its contribution to island life. At the same time, the report recognised that the cost of providing the air service had increased dramatically by 136% during the ten-year period under review, that the efficiency of the programme had deteriorated over the period in question and that the continuation of this trend into the future was unsustainable. Based on the report's recommendations and mindful of the need for value for money in providing this service, my Department requested that the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, as the agency charged by the Government with administering procurement services for the State, to undertake a tendering process in order to put in place an air service contract for the period from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2019. Prior to this tendering process being undertaken, my Department met representatives of the island communities to listen to their views in regard to the service. The tendering process was undertaken in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EC) 1008/2008, which governs PSO air services. The Deputy will appreciate that, as Minister for State, I had no involvement in the procurement process itself following my decision that a PSO air service should continue to be provided. I am aware that questions have been raised regarding issues relating to the procurement process, such as the type of aircraft to be used, the inclusion of Galway Airport as a mainland departure point and the expertise of the tender assessment committee. I have been assured that proper and appropriate procedures were adhered to at all times throughout the process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Fuair mé an cheist trí Bhéarla. Tháinig an cheist isteach in Oifig an Cheann Comhairle trí Bhéarla. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil an freagra foirmiúil i mBéarla. Is í an Ghaeilge an teanga is fearr. Ba mhaith liom mo fhreagra a rá trí Ghaeilge. Cé nach mbeidh mé ábalta cur isteach sa phróiseas, tá sé tábhachtach béim a chur ar an dul chun cinn atá déanta fríd an phróiseas, go háirithe ó thaobh cinnteachta agus leanúnachais. Tá leanúnachas tábhachtacht fá dtaobh den cheangal idir an tír mhór agus na hoileáin. Tá mé ag obair go dian.Tá mé ag déanamh mo dhícheall mar atá mo chomhghleacaithe, na daoine san OGP agus na daoine i mo Roinn féin. Tá mé ag déanamh mo dhícheall agus ag obair gach aon lá ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. Mar a bhí mé ag rá níos luaithe, bhí mé i dteagmháil le muintir Árann. Táimse freagrach as ceantar na Gaeltachta, na hoileáin agus an ceangal idir na hoileáin agus an mhórthír. Táim ag lorg iarracht mhór chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh anseo. Arís, nílim ábalta mórán a rá agus sin an chomhairle dhlí a bhfuair mé ón OGP. Tá próiseas úr ar siúl san OGP. Thosaigh an chéad phróiseas i 2014. Tá an próiseas ag rith comhthreomhar le mo Roinn féin agus tá an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe freagrach as an bpróiseas. Cinnte ní bhfaighidh muintir Árann focal fá dtaobh den phróiseas nó a leithéid ag an am seo. Tá mé ag déanamh mo dhícheall réiteach a fháil. Arís, ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas a ghabháil don Teachta Nolan. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil an Teachta Nolan, Seanadóirí sa Teach eile agus na Teachtaí John O'Mahony agus Seán Kyne ag obair go dian díograiseach ó thaobh an phróisis seo.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline the current position in respect of the permanent locations for Ballinteer Educate Together primary school, Stepaside Educate Together primary school, the new primary school to serve Stillorgan-Goatstown and the new post-primary school to serve Ballinteer-Stepaside. The Department of Education and Skills uses a geographical information system, GIS, to identify where the pressure for school places will arise. The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection in addition to the Department's own databases. It also uses data from the local authorities. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed. The need for the four schools in question was identified as part of this analysis. Ballinteer Educate Together primary school opened in September 2012 and is in temporary accommodation at present. The Department has identified a potential site for the location of the permanent accommodation and is in ongoing discussions with the local authority regarding its suitability. The Minister is pleased to inform the Deputy that a site identified as being a suitable location for the permanent school building for Stepaside Educate Together primary school has been acquired with the assistance of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Officials will be in contact shortly with the patron body in this regard and the Department is working to advance the proposed building project for the school. The new primary school to serve Goatstown-Stillorgan was one of the new primary schools announced by the Minister in February 2015 to open in 2016. The patronage determination process for this school will take place later this year or early in 2016. In the meantime, officials in my Department are working to find a suitable site for the school. Options for interim start-up accommodation are being examined at present and discussions will take place with the patron body in that respect. A suitable permanent site for a new post-primary school to serve the Ballinteer-Stepaside area has been identified and the acquisition process is under way. Given the commercial sensitivities associated with land acquisitions generally, the Minister is not in a position to provide further details at this time. The Minister can, however, assure the Deputy the acquisition of a new site for the school is a priority for the Department and the patron body, Educate Together, will be informed of the location for the school as soon as it is possible to do so. Options for interim start-up accommodation are being examined at present and discussions will take place with the patron body in this respect. I thank the Deputy again on behalf of the Minister for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position regarding the permanent location of the four schools in question and thank her for her comments. The provision of permanent accommodation for the four schools to which she refers is a priority for the Department of Education and Skills and the schools in question provide critical school places to meet specific demographic demand.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will convey the Deputy's sentiments to the Minister for Education and Skills. The process of acquiring sites in my own county is similarly lengthy. The ETB, as a patron body, works closely with the local authority under the new systems now in place. That is a national directive. Clearly there are commercial sensitivities around the acquisition of properties. It is a lengthy process. I am aware of the use of compulsory purchase orders in situations where issues arise in relation to road infrastructure. There is a public need for educational infrastructure also, particularly in the city where land is at a premium and the population is expanding. As I said, I will convey the Deputy's sentiments to the Minister.
