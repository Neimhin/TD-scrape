JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for his reply and acknowledge his speedy activity at the beginning of the DÃ¡il session in introducing the Criminal Justice Bill 2011.  The programme for Government commits to tackling white collar crime.  I acknowledge that the Garda is playing a proactive and constructive role in investigating these matters at the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC.  It is important to outline the feelings of the people towards this case, as described on the doorstep during the 2011 general election.  They are not looking for blood on the carpet or heads on a platter, rather they are looking for justice, fairness and a level playing field.  With this in mind-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If we are to follow through fully on the philosophy of fairness and equal treatment, is the Minister satisfied with the powers conferred on the Garda to investigate the matters in question?  I am conscious of the fact that he does not want to make a public comment, as the matter is still at an investigative stage.
