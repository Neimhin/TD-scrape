JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There has been a varied debate this morning covering both the international and the parochial. I will stick to parochial matters and County Donegal, as I always do. There are disturbing reasons for that. At 10%, Donegal still has the highest rate of unemployment in the country and continues to suffer as a result of false promises on the part of the Government. Donegal town was promised 230 jobs and Buncrana was promised 120 jobs under the decentralisation programme. Gweedore, an unemployment blackspot, was also promised 30 jobs.The situation in Donegal is serious. Its county council has invested funding in buildings for those who are supposed be sent there under the decentralisation programme. However, these buildings are empty and are costing ratepayers in Donegal money. Donegal and Derry will soon have the most highly skilled workforce in the IT sector in this country and the two are going to be linked via broadband in the not too distant future. Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Chamber of Commerce and every Opposition spokesperson in Donegal have been let down. Decentralisation must be placed back on the agenda.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Donegal has been let down on far too many occasions.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	At 6.27 a.m. last Sunday morning, a crab boat with four crew members on board got into difficulties in Mulroy Bay in County Donegal. The coastguard units from Mulroy and Buncrana responded immediately to the boat's distress signal by heading for it to help the crew. By the time the Buncrana coastguard unit arrived at the scene of the incident, the crab boat was gone. The four crew men had luckily been saved by the Mulroy coastguard unit.I have raised this case and given details of it because I am concerned that the area officer of the Mulroy coastguard unit was faced with a major moral dilemma on Sunday morning. He had to decide whether to try to save the four lives by launching a boat that was not commissioned by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. He was aware that to do so would not be well accepted by the Department. With the 20-20 vision of hindsight, we know all four crew members would have lost their lives if the area officer had not made the right decision, which was to launch the rescue boat. The crab boat had disappeared by the time the Buncrana unit arrived at the scene. Any sane person in a right mode of thinking will agree that four lives would have been lost if the area officer had not decided to launch the rescue boat. When the incident happened, the Mulroy unit had been waiting for six weeks to receive the training necessary to allow the rescue boat to be commissioned. I sent a fax to the Department last Wednesday to try to speed up the process.I ask the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to acknowledge the area officer's foresight and accuracy in deciding to launch the decommissioned rescue boat. It would have been a red letter day for the Department if he had not taken that decision, because four lives would have been lost. It is as simple as that. I ask the Minister of State to try to convince the Department that the official training of the Mulroy unit's crew members should be initiated immediately, as a matter of priority. There should be no more procrastination in this regard.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State, whom I know to be a reasonable man, having known him for almost two years. Perhaps he might use his expertise and common sense in getting in touch with the Department to support the decision of the area officer last Sunday morning. It was a moral dilemma, and I believe that he made the right decision in taking out a boat that was not fully commissioned. Four lives were saved, and that is what matters. I would like the Minister to use his good offices to convey those sentiments — as I know he will — regarding the officer's decision.
