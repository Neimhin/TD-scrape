JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I support the comments of other Senators on the Ferns report. I got an opportunity last night to go through it briefly. Perhaps the subject is a bit raw to debate now. Many details of the report were heard in the rumour factories of the 1980s and 1990s and, therefore, some of the allegations as to what went on do not come as a surprise. It is important that we take Senator Maurice Hayes's advice and do not react with knee-jerk legislation. In future we must take a holistic approach towards all sectors working with young people, whether teachers, community or youth workers etc. We must introduce a proper vetting procedure across the board.I will give one example of the confidence of the people in the clergy. The inquiries deal with a few rotten apples in the barrel of the priesthood. The people of Donegal have shown their utmost confidence in a priest, the man named as Donegal person of the year this year, Fr. Michael Sweeney. He was and is involved with young people at a sporting level. It is important we retain confidence in the clergy who voluntarily deal with young people through sport and community work. We must keep our eye on the ball in that regard. We must keep that balance when debating this issue.
