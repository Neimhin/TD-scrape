JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not have a question but wish to acknowledge that the Dyslexia Association of Ireland has facilitated a large number of voluntary groups throughout the country. There are 39 groups with over 3,000 members. The issue of definition has been raised but I wish to convey what is happening on the ground. People are working on a voluntary basis in these workshops, they are doing their own fund-raising and are bringing in their own tutors, but they do not have premises. They believed matters would be moved forward in this Bill. The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, was engaged in the task force report and there has been a lot of research and definitions. It is important for us, as a committee, to work with the groups to come up with a definition and not to let this opportunity pass. I do not want to be parochial but the dyslexia group in Donegal had to approach the local authority last year, which provided generous funding of approximately â‚¬10,000. As a group, it knows there is a need for assessments and it is calling out for help. We cannot allow this to go on.
