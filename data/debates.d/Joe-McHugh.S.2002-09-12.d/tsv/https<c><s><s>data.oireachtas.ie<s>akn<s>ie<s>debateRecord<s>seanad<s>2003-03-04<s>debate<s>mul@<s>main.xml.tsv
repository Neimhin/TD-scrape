JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wish to address the direction democracy is taking in our society. I remember arriving in politics at a local democratic level in 1999. I was told at that time never to ask a question in the local chamber without first knowing the answer to it, which I may have done previously in my naiveté. The person who told me that was suggesting that the best tool in any political or democratic field is information. It is the biggest weapon and one of the most important instruments in the political system.Power is the exercise of control, influence and authority. Local democracy has to start at a grass roots level and that must include community involvement and participation by local people. In 1998-1999, people in this category felt they were outside the decision making process. This led to a situation where the Government began talking the language of local development groups, which was a positive development. The 2000 White Paper regarding the Government's vision of society spoke of the ability of the voluntary and community sector to provide channels for active involvement, and the participation of citizens in democracy. That is the language the community and voluntary sector heard from politicians and the Taoiseach at that time.The discussion of better local government, decentralisation, bringing power closer to the people, getting people involved and greater transparency in Government and local democracy was the language our society needed to hear. Prior to that, Irish society was hoodwinked by politicians. I have no problem saying that because politicians kept power and information for themselves; they told people they would provide medical cards and get grants for house extensions, and that they would deliver for them. The people, therefore, became dependent on politicians. That hoodwinking had a detrimental impact on our society prior to 1999 when the new use of language began.I commend the Taoiseach on his use of language and his vision in regard to the information society. He spoke of e-democracy, active citizenship and transparency through e-government. The latter was defined as electronic government, where people could access any information they wanted by computer. The Taoiseach believed that such a mechanism was the way forward for our society.That mechanism was not rocket science or novel thinking by the Government. It was a European model of regional democracy which came from countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Finland, which entered the European Union in 1995. Every country in Europe was talking about bringing power closer to citizens. That came from the active involvement of Fine Gael in European affairs. Such language was used by our ambassadors in Europe and has been brought to the fore in Ireland. Whether referring to better local government, local democracy, the devolution of power, regional government or regional autonomy, it was Fine Gael which brought such language to the State and it has been spoken from 1998 onwards.If anyone asks about Fine Gael policy, I answer that it was my party which introduced this language in its belief as part of its commitment to Europe. Fine Gael brought the language to this State but there is now a situation where this Bill is an obstacle to e-government. The Government does not want to give out information. On the one hand, it talks about the information society while, on the other, there is the iron curtain Senator O'Toole mentioned. I disagree with Senator O'Toole with regard to Deputy John Bruton's take on Government transparency, but I believe in the idea of a glass window in front of the officialdom that executes the decisions of the Oireachtas.Our system could have worked well if there had not been a fear about allowing people to access information. E-government was supposed to stand for electronic government and giving information to the people. The community and voluntary sector wants information to empower the people – Mr. Paolo Freire's language concerns empowerment – to take decisions on their own and take control of their lives. The "e" in e-government might as well stand for "Excalibur", King Arthur's magic sword. It is Excalibur government, where a sword has been stabbed in every vein of the community and voluntary sector, and of every local authority official who is working hard to bring electronic technology into our democratic process.Today is a dark day for democracy. I am not using tonight's debate in an opportunistic fashion but am a believer in information technology as a mechanism to bring power to the people. I do not believe in the hoodwink, or that we should tell people what they want to hear. We must be honest with the people and allow them to make decisions on their own. The Excalibur sword is stuck in the back of better local government reform. The confidence has been knocked out of the strategic policy committees. They and the county development boards are supposed to represent the community and voluntary sector. That sector is asking what the story is but it knows the answer – that there is too much power and information to be devolved, and that this Government does not want to relinquish that power. Why is there such fear? The Minister of State knows the answer to that question.If there is a move towards a peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland, a big part of that will be our trust in the people working North and South of the Border. While the ministerial cross-Border bodies come under this legislation, I am concerned in regard to the non-governmental cross-Border bodies which do not. We should have had an opportunity to consult and discuss the matter with these organisations before the legislation landed on our table today. There was much to talk about. Community groups are irate that they were not consulted. Were those involved in the Reach programme in the north-west consulted? They thought they had a green light from the Taoiseach to go ahead and implement their strategy. Now there is fear.This is the biggest scam in the short time I have been involved in politics since 1999. I believed in everything put on the table regarding local government, decentralisation and plans for four or five offices in County Donegal. The plans were brilliant. A citizen, from Malin Head or any little place in the north-west, would be able to come to a local office and access information. Society must evolve. As politicians, we like to control our base, perhaps in the interests of survival. Tonight while we have taken a step backwards, the opportunity is still there to bring the people on board. The consultative process has not happened. That is the reason there is genuine concern on this side of the House.I come from a community sector background where I spent time working with community groups, the voluntary and paid sectors. Perhaps I entered politics with idealistic notions that I could play a part in bringing power back to the people. Was I naive? How can this be turned around? Can the Minister instil me with any confidence or give me any feedback or reassurance that I can bring to community groups? We are trying to encourage, not just the voluntary and paid sectors which represent the citizen but also individual citizens to go and seek information from these offices. Will the Minister reassure me that they can do this? I have no great confidence that they can.Senator Minihan spoke but I know by his expression that he believes I am disingenuous in my attempts to highlight that we had the opportunity, through information technology, to bring the people with us and get them involved. We could have had a system, of which we could have been proud. This issue highlights the reason and rationale behind the Government's lack of industry, commitment and leadership in regard to the recent Nice treaty. It does not have confidence in the democratic process that occurs in each European Union country. Not every country believes in our hoodwink type politics. While I oppose this legislation and appreciate the opportunity to do so, I hope it is not too late.I thank the Minister for coming. It is a serious stumbling block that we appear to be returning to Iron Curtain days in regard to access to information. The Opposition has nothing to hide. What does the Government have to hide? While I do not believe it has anything to hide or is involved in skulduggery, there is a problem in regard to the use of power. When people are given power, they find it difficult to let it go. It is easy for me to say this, as a new politician, but we had the opportunity to allow people to empower themselves and change the way that we run the country. That opportunity has now been lost.Change comes slowly. Sometimes we are afraid of it. Perhaps the electorate did not seek change in the last general election for that reason. We must challenge the public to examine the reason it lacks belief in our political system. Tonight we are stuck in this Chamber at 11.30 p.m. trying to block legislation in which we have no confidence. We cannot understand the reason it is being shoved in our faces. The Government has missed a rare opportunity to say to the people that it will stand down, that it has listened to the Opposition and taken its concerns on board and that it is willing to consult. We will remember this night for the wrong reasons.The staff of the House have gone out of their way to stay working tonight. I thank and commend them. We are out and about and used to this lifestyle. In regard to computer technology, local authorities are seeking to ensure a filing of every politician's representations is recorded. Tonight is an opportunity for us to say what big eejits we are out till 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Senator Moylan is an experienced politician and has done this all his life. This was never the normal 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job. Perhaps we had an opportunity on this legislation to sell ourselves and point out that we are working seven days a week and sacrificing our lives and personal ambitions but we missed that opportunity also. What person or group of people would stay on for so long? It is commendable that they have done so and I congratulate them on it. I also congratulate the Government Senators who have decided to stay and are hopefully using this opportunity to listen to the concerns of this side of the House.
