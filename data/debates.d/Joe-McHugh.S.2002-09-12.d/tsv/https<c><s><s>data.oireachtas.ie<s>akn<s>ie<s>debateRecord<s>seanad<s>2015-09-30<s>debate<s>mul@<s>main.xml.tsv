JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	
I agree with the Senators' concerns about keeping licences under review. A five-year review interval would be too lenient. Prospecting licences are granted initially for a period of six years and may be renewed for a further six years, if warranted. Thereafter, the licence may be renewed for periods of one or two years, depending on circumstances. During the six-year term of the licence, every licence is subject to formal review at two-year intervals and thereafter on renewal. This regime has been in place by administrative procedure since 1994 and has worked well. It is my intention that these arrangements will not change following enactment of the Bill. Section 29 provides that the Minister will determine the time limits for which prospecting licences and retention licences may be granted subject to any maximum limit prescribed under section 30.I do not propose to grant a retention licence for as long as six years, but the Bill allows flexibility, having regard to the particular circumstances. Retention licences will be formally reviewed at the same frequency as prospecting licences. Apart from formal reviews, the technical staff of the Department maintain contact with licensees throughout the licence term and keep apprised of developments. The proposed amendment is, therefore, unnecessary and I am not inclined to accept it.  I accept the Senator's point regarding prospecting licences. He is correct that there are between 550 and 600 such licences. He also asked how many prospecting licences are inactive and how many are active. All of the licences are active.  I reiterate that a prospecting licence is not a permit to mine. It is not always clear that a prospecting licence only allows the holder to explore for minerals. It is, therefore, a licence to spend money on exploration activities which, in itself, gives no return to the holder of the licence. Once prospecting has been completed, licence holders must go through the full rigours of the application process, which includes a planning process and the involvement of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I appreciate the Senator's concern regarding this matter. He should note that the legislation provides for a review to be held every two years to maintain vigilance.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senators raised a number of issues. While we are digressing a little from the substance of the proposed amendment, the issues raised are important nonetheless. We must be definitive in differentiating between a prospecting licence and a mining licence. The former does not confer ownership or allow mining to take place. It is important to clarify that. Prospecting creates a fear in local communities that mining for gold or other minerals will follow. It is important to make clear that a prospecting licence does not allowing mining. Inactive prospecting licences are revoked and have been revoked in some instances. The exclusive right to mine is vested in the Minister. A number of stakeholders are involved in the process. Outside the scope of the Bill, there is also an important relationship between the local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department and private companies. The community is critically important in this regard and communities must be part of the relationship. No mining company will start operations in a rural or urban area without establishing a solid relationship with the local community.  The Senators raised questions concerning special areas of conservation, special protection areas and natural heritage areas. This is a difficult issue for the National Parks and Wildlife Service in that in areas that have been categorised as special areas of conservation, local communities feel under pressure regarding the possibility that their sons and daughters will be able to build homes. As the Senators will be aware, it is still possible to build in special areas of conservation and special protection areas provided the proper processes are adhered to, for example, in respect of environmental impact studies and other investigations, environmental, community or otherwise. It is important to ensure we have sustainable communities. Similarly, mining may proceed in special areas of conservation and special protection areas. Senator Mark Daly referred to the fears of farmers and asked where they stand in this process. The proper mechanisms are in place and it is important that proper processes are adhered to. While the exclusive right to mine is vested in the Minister, community engagement must also take place.  Farmers who wish to plough land in a special area of conservation must request permission to do so from the local office of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This may appear prescriptive to outsiders. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh asked about the other hat I wear in another Department. Similarly, given that a prospecting licence does not confer on the holder a right to mine, companies wishing to proceed from prospecting to mining must go through a rigorous planning process which involves consultation with and adjudication by the Environmental Protection Agency. If a licence to mine is subsequently granted, the company must comply with the conditions that apply.  Legislation in this area needs to be upgraded to encompass all elements of the process, from the pre-mining stage, through the mining stage and after mining ceases.The legislation was needed to cover every process, from pre-mining, active and post-mining. Even while that legislation is not in place it is already happening in places such as Lisheen. There is money set aside. The process of rehabilitation is starting as the mine closes. It is important to get this right and the issues and concerns that the Senators raised here today are the questions I will be asking and have asked the officials in the preparation of this legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The process is important and there has to be a community consultation with any planning application. That opportunity will be afforded and there will be a period of time to do that. It is also important to point out that the environmental impact assessment is not just a case of employing a consultancy company to give a standard report and tick the boxes. In my position as Minister of State with a vested interest because of my responsibility for mining, I see that it is important that it is rigorous and that there is consultation with the communities. There have been many mistakes made in the past about planning, be it single or multiple development. We have to bring all the lessons learned into it. We can learn about processes from the good and positive aspects of building regulation. We need a very active, open and transparent process. As a former community development worker, I know the community has to be at the heart of it because if the community does not support a project, nine out of ten times it will not work.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Section 82 provides that the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, may sell State-owned minerals instead of granting a mining licence where the tonnage or value of the minerals is small and it is expedient and efficient to do so. Given that efficiency and expediency are included, one hat probably does not fit all; however, I take the Senator's point about the definition. Such minerals will then become excepted minerals, which means the Minister will not have the exclusive right to work them, and the Mining Board will be so advised. While I share the concerns about the sale of State assets Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh expressed on Second Stage, I assure him and Senators David Cullinane and Kathryn Reilly that it is not my intention in proposing the section. The section is intended to address a situation in which a small deposit of low-value minerals is identified, and setting up a procedure for collecting periodic royalties would not be justified on grounds of the cost of administration. The sale of the minerals in a once-off, up-front deal would be more appropriate in such circumstances. The sale of the minerals would be limited to the particular minerals being mined and considered only where the Minister was confident that the full value of the deposit could be accurately predicted and a net present value could be placed up on it. The consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would be required before such an arrangement would be entered into. While the provision would rarely be justified, it would be useful for the Minister of the day to have the option available, should it be considered appropriate. Therefore, I am not inclined to accept the Senators' arguments.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not want to underestimate the importance of the Senators' contributions, given that the issue is important. The section is a precaution. The scenario has not happened before. Some 60% to 65% of minerals are estimated to be in State ownership. This figure can never be firmly established unless all mineral deposits are identified and located. Private mineral ownership arises mainly when the land in question has not been dealt with by the Land Commission since 1903. If the Land Commission has dealt with the lands, the mineral rights are likely to be retained by the State. The fact that something has not happened does not mean it will not happen. It is very much a precautionary measure. The wording specifies that it will apply if it arises in the future. I take the point on the definition of "small" and the provision for expediency and efficiency. The parameters will differ in different cases and regions and depending on the operations and minerals involved.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am aware that the Senator raised this issue previously. It is under active consideration and we are working towards a definition. I am confident that I will be in a position in the Dáil to make a technical amendment. Táimid ag fáil níos gaire don líne. We are getting closer to the line in terms of the definition. The Senator raised it the last day and we have been working hard on it in the intervening period. I will put down a technical amendment in the Dáil on this specific item. I thank the Senator for raising the matter.
