JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While I congratulate the Minister on his work and his efforts, the legislation further highlights my insignificance as a Dáil Deputy from Donegal.  I do not say this because Donegal is, traditionally and historically, the forgotten county, but because the neglect of the county makes my role here completely insignificant.  Bord Gáis is doing a survey on the feasibility of bringing gas from Northern Ireland into Donegal.  That study will prove it is unprofitable, of little value and not in the interest of the State to bring gas to a big town like Letterkenny.  My message to the Minister is that even before that survey, the Government has a public service obligation to the taxpayers of Donegal to bring gas to our county.  As far as I and the citizens of Donegal are concerned, we are tired arguing the toss for services for a county that has been historically and traditionally neglected.
