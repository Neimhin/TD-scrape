JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an chomhchoiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a fhearadh roimh an Uasal Olli Ruutu, príomhfheidhmeannach, European Defence Agency. I dtús báire tá cúpla líne le rá agam ar cheist na pribhléide agus rudaí eile. Before we begin, I wish to deal with the issue of privilege and with some housekeeping matters. I welcome Mr. Olli Ruutu, deputy chief executive of the European Defence Agency. As Gaeilge, I gave Mr. Ruutu a promotion and called him the príomhfheidhmeannach agus ba chóir go dtabharfar leas-phríomhfheidhmeannach air, which is deputy chief executive. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or to otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witnesses’ statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. For anyone watching this meeting, Oireachtas Members and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or to join the meeting remotely by MS Teams. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I will ask any member participating by MS Teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. If members are attending within the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and have at least one vacant seat between themselves and others attending. I believe that everybody knows the drill in this regard at this stage. Without further ado, I call Mr. Ruutu to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Ruutu for his presentation. It was very European in its language but I realise it is a very technical area. Is the MIC a specific conference on a specific date or will it be over a period? Does Mr. Ruutu have a date?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Ruutu for his comprehensive answers. Since no one else is indicating, does anyone wish to ask a supplementary question? We have time. I call Deputy Howlin, followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputies and Senators for attending. I also thank Mr. Ruutu and Mr. Roehrig for attending. We appreciate it. This is our second meeting on this issue. There will be other meetings, which will culminate in a report. We are grateful for the witnesses' attendance to look at an important, technical matter which affects people's lives daily, as Deputy Howlin pointed out with regard to recent issues with our health service.
