JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to check this particular application out. The Deputy mentioned a sports hall. As we move towards 2020, when PE will be on the curriculum, I am getting several representations from around the country asking about the investment trajectory. Next year we will have an extra €200 million in capital spending within the Department. There are a lot of pressures. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, is coming under a lot of pressure to agree to expenditure and to show prudence. We have to marry the demand with the supply. There is not a parish in the country where schools are not looking for extra facilities or extra rooms. Obviously there are different population pressures. Within the ten year capital plan there is an allocation of €8.4 billion, and within that a plan will be mapped out to find the best way forward. I am happy to check that specific application out for the Deputy.
