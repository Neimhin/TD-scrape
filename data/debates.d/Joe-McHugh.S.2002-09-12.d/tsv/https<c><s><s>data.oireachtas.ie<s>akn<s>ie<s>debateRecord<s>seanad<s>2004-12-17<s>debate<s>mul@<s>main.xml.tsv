JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is agreed.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Like my colleagues on this side of the House I have major concerns about the fast-tracking of this important Bill. By not giving it enough time issues will be missed and there can be grey areas that need to be addressed. On the political debate surrounding what Senator Feighan called mea culpa, or the question of who is to blame, it is easy for the other side of the House to go back to 1976 but the nub of this issue concerns what happened in 2001. That is when the nettle should have been grasped and the matter addressed but it was not.With regard to the outcome of the Bill, much work remains to be done on the set procedure for medical cards and subvention payments for private nursing homes. That debate needs to begin very soon because there is a large cloud over the issue and a great deal of misinformation and lack of transparency and accountability regarding subvention. If this legislation is passed today there will be a legal mechanism for effecting payments.A major issue surrounds community hospitals. I can use my own area as an example, where there are community hospitals in Dungloe, Carndonagh and Lifford, outside the mainstream Letterkenny General Hospital. We need answers before a vote is taken here. Will convalescent patients who are recovering or rehabilitating in community hospitals be charged after 30 days? That question must be answered. For example, a gentleman or lady who needs a hip replacement may, due to the pressures in the general hospital in Letterkenny, recover or rehabilitate in one of the community hospitals. It may take longer than 30 days in some instances for an elderly person to recover from an orthopaedic operation with the necessary physiotherapy rehabilitation programme. After 30 days will that patient have to pay charges? This is a very important issue and has not been raised due to the fast-tracking of this legislation. It is important that the Minister of State say whether an elderly person undergoing treatment, rehabilitation or otherwise in a community hospital must pay after 30 days. We need an answer before taking a vote on this legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 12b:In page 5, after line 33, to insert the following new section:"3.—The Minister shall as soon as may be after the passing of this Act prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the impact of this legislation on patients in Community Units who are admitted for acute medical illness or rehabilitation, e. g. minor stroke or fractured femur where the length of stay exceeds 30 days.".The passing of the legislation through this Bill reminds me of an old Scalextric set I had when I was introduced to speed for the first time.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Browne might not remember Scalextric.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State may be commended among his electoral base in Kildare for being the man to put legislation through in a fast and effective way, but yesterday and today are sad days for democracy. One cannot put such sensitive legislation, which will affect the daily lives of a vulnerable group of people, through both Houses with such speed.The irony of today is that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is on record only half an hour ago for commending the workings of this House and the reasoning and importance of "informed debate". However, we have not had time for an informed debate on this legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is. I am building up to it. It is ironic that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is on record as saying this is an excellent forum for putting legislation through.I wish to be clear about this amendment. There will be anomaly regarding the 30-day rule that will apply to elderly patients. I stressed this point on Second Stage, but the response I got did not address it. I will give a specific example. An elderly patient who has a minor stroke may not go to the general hospital, as we are all aware, and Senator Glynn will know the procedure, having been a former member of a health board. Such an elderly patient may have to go to a district hospital or a community hospital and after 30 days he or she will be charged. This legalisation puts in place a legal framework to provide for the charging of such a patient.I raise this issue on two grounds. First, this provision is ageist. A 14 year old boy who breaks his leg and spends more than 30 days in a general hospital will not be charged, neither will a 24 year old man in similar circumstances. Therefore, why will an elderly patient who has suffered the same condition be charged after a hospital stay of 30 days? I appreciate the response to this issue I got from the officials on Second Stage, but there is a grey area in regard to that anomaly. It is discrimination at its worst.I seek the Minister of State's help on this matter. I am not proposing a substantive change or the employment of consultants to carry out a review. We seek that the Department addresses the provision to charge elderly patients after a hospital stay of 30 days. It will affect an elderly patient who has a minor stroke or who has a fractured femur who spends 31 or 32 days in a hospital. How much will such patients be charged per day?I need clarification on this issue. It is a sensitive issue for the community of elderly people who will be discriminated against and the provision is ageist. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would clarify the matter. He can correct me if I am wrong and, if I am, I will be delighted.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State acknowledged that there is a need for extensive consultation in this regard. This is discrimination against the elderly, who are being treated differently from other members of society. I ask that the amendment be accepted.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that. However, I want a commitment from the Minister of State to a follow-up review of this issue. It is not good that a significant proportion of our population is being discriminated against and treated differently from the rest of the population.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate Senator Glynn's intervention. He is the old dog for the hard road and a seasoned campaigner.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The facts are that on the one hand, the State gives a pensioner money and on the other hand, if an elderly pensioner breaks his or her leg, the State takes the money from him or her after 30 days. For example, a social welfare recipient is given money by the State. However, if that person has to stay in hospital to receive treatment for a period of 30 days, the State does not take back the money. The only group being discriminated against are the elderly. It is a serious and sensitive issue which must be addressed. I appreciate the Minister is in a corner but I want a commitment that the measure will be reviewed.The only reason we have reached this impasse is because the Bill is going through so quickly. The issue should have been raised in the Dáil but it was not because of the speed of the Bill's passage. This is grand prix speed. To put through a Bill in two days is not acceptable. I need a commitment from the Minister of State.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that it has been put on the record of the House that no patient in a community hospital will be charged after 30 days if he or she is receiving acute medical treatment, be it for a minor stroke or a broken leg, and that such a person will not be treated differently.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that the Minister has put this on the record because, in doing so, he has avoided a major grey area. I appreciate his statement.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is new legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I must reply to Senator Glynn. This is new legislation. I am worried about the legal mechanism that will be created with the passage of the Bill. I am concerned that a patient who suffers from an acute illness will be charged after 30 days. If having a worry is baseless-——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is having a worry baseless?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	My concern is with the period of 30 days. I am glad the Minister has put on the record of the House that any patient receiving acute treatment in any community or district hospital will not be charged after 30 days. I am delighted this will be the case under this new legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I concur with my colleague, Senator Browne. I thank the Minister of State and his officials for their patience and perseverance during the Bill's passage through the House. I assume that it is not an easy job being a departmental official when legislation is going through the Houses very quickly. The Minister of State's staff must be commended on all their work, including the work that will need to be done following the Bill's enactment. There is a grey area concerning elderly patients who are recovering in district and community hospitals. When is a patient with an acute illness reclassified as being in the recovery stage? Work needs to be done on defining convalescence, including physiotherapy treatment, for example, following a leg injury. It can be a matter of medical opinion but the important thing is to protect our elderly at all times. I am glad the elderly will be treated no differently from the rest of the population.I thank the Clerk of the Seanad and her team for all their work during the year. I appreciate the time and effort they have expended. I wish you, Sir, and the Minister of State a very happy Christmas.
