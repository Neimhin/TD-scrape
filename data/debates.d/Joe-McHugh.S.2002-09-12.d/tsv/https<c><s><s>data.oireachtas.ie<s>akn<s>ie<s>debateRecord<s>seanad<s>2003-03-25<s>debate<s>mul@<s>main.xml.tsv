JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	Members on the other side of the House have dwelt on the record of the previous coalition Government, but I wish to dwell on this period of Government. Any straw poll on the streets of Dublin on a Saturday night will reveal the half empty restaurants and pubs.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	We are no longer competitive as a country or an economy. That is reflected in the cost of living increases. Six months ago, a basic basket of goods for a couple in Dublin cost €120 to €130, whereas today it will cost €150 to €160. I am not familiar with the cost of living in Dublin because I am only in the city a few nights a week, but in County Donegal consumers are moving across the Border to buy their groceries in Derry and Strabane. It is a worrying trend when people in the eurozone travel to the sterling zone to do their shopping because groceries are more competitively priced.The stealth and indirect taxes, referred to by Senator McDowell, are also a cause of concern. While there was a spin put on the reduction in direct taxes, indirect taxes have increased, whether it be increases in local authority rates, higher bin collection charges, extra duty on credit cards and higher gas bills resulting from the 1% increase in the lower rate of VAT. There have also been increased charges on petrol, VRT and motor tax. This is evidence that there is something wrong with the economy.I do not usually believe what car salesmen tell me, but this week I took note when a car salesman indicated that since the beginning of the year, what he referred to as the "ordinary five-eighths", the PAYE worker or ordinary man or woman on the street, are no longer buying cars. These are the people – I include myself in this category – who are paying mortgage and hire purchase charges on their cars. They are also paying high levels of indirect taxes. By contrast, there has been a big increase in the number of new cars being bought by the high earners. This is a worrying trend because it indicates that we are becoming a two-tier society. That is what is happening during under this Government.The inflation rate is 5.1%, which is considerably higher than the rate in the rest of the European Union.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	It is scandalous that the price of houses is not included in the CPI, which means it is not a true reflection of the inflation rate.Eating out in Dublin has gone off the Richter scale. I know of a couple who, rather than staying in Dublin for St. Patrick's weekend, travelled to Brussels where they had a cheaper weekend. I know of another couple, constituents of the Minister of State, who spent a weekend in Paris where eating out was cheaper than in Dublin. This raises serious questions about our competitiveness.People working in Dublin travel north of the Border to avail of dental services, which are cheaper. It raises questions about how they can access their PRSI dental benefits. Furniture and clothing are also more expensive in this country.Ireland is suffering from a reverse brain drain. In the past we suffered from a brain drain because of the lack of jobs, yet while today jobs are available, there is a brain drain because of the poor quality of life, especially in Dublin. People are unhappy with the quality of public services, including the public transport system. As a result, we are losing people who are trained and qualified in specialist areas.The first-time buyer's grant was also abolished in the budget. The Minister could have allocated 1,050 of those grants with the money that was spent on the Spire. Many people from Donegal have been telling me what can be done with the Spire, but I will not place their comments on the record of the House.There is hard evidence that talented people are leaving the country because we are not competitive. Tax receipts will be lower and aggregate demand is lower. People are buying beer and staying in on a Saturday night; they are not spending their money in restaurants. I do not blame restaurateurs or people in the service industry for this. The prices they charge have increased because indirect stealth taxes have driven up the cost of their raw material. Costs are spiralling and in the long-term these people will have to abandon their businesses because of increased costs, higher insurance and higher employment costs.I accept and appreciate that pensioners did well in the budget and that their needs are being catered for. This contradicts what Senator Ross said, namely, that Members on this side indicate their opposition to things simply for the sake of doing so. However, I have discovered that elderly people are handing over substantial amounts of their pensions to their grandchildren in college for pocket money. That is not happening across the board. I do not have empirical evidence, but I have been speaking to pensioners who have been doing this.Senator Ross is an intelligent and articulate businessman, but it is time he changed the record. I take exception to him standing up on every occasion and saying that Opposition parties oppose just for the sake of doing so. That is wrong. As a new Fine Gael Member of the Oireachtas, I believe we are putting together credible Opposition points. In regard to every point I have made, all I had to do was to listen to the people on the street for their views. People are angry. People who do not even have an interest in politics are saying that they are being told lies because there is less money in their pockets today than there was six months ago. They are now saying that there is something wrong.I pay my taxes, but it still takes me six hours to get from Donegal to Dublin. I still get stuck in Ardee on a Friday evening for about half an hour on my way to Donegal, but I hear talk about CPOs and building motorways to Limerick, Galway and Cork.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	Exactly. I would do so if I lived near Derry city airport. Not everybody is in a position to use air transport and we do not have enough aircraft to carry everybody.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I do not wish to criticise the people of Ardee, which is outside my constituency. The point I am making is that we need to remove freight traffic from our roads. One does not want to sit in a car, particularly on warm days like this. Today I think there was a near zero energy level in the Seanad at the Order of Business because people were probably stuck in traffic before they got here and the heat tired them out.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I wish to point out a number of things to Senator Ross who said that we have nothing to offer. We have been pushing for value for money in regard to public expenditure. The man and woman in the street knows that public money is squandered and wasted. The Senator knows there is waste and I challenge him to contradict me on that.In regard to what we have to offer, we need a quality product if we are to promote Ireland as a tourism destination. We will have to advertise Ireland and give incentives to people setting up tourism businesses. We will have to give tax reductions and offer people incentives to remain in business. People are going out of business. People in the tourism sector in Donegal this year are saying, "To hell with it, costs and insurance are too high." That is a problem. In order to remain competitive we need quality business in the tourism sector.I remind Senator Ross, who seems to have put himself forward as a Government spokesperson, that we have also pushed for radical reform in the education curriculum. To have a complete, radical overhaul, we must invest in research and development and examine the entire curriculum. In Romania and Hungary, children of 12 and 13 years of age are being sent to college to do degrees in car mechanics. What are we doing about encouraging young people to get degrees in car mechanics? We are pushing young people into academia and are not emphasising the practical side of things. What we have are young people who are thrown out of school early at 15 or 16 and enrolled in FÁS courses on car mechanics. That is an insult to the car mechanic sector in this country.In regard to benchmarking for nurses and teachers, I am proud to push for the increases these neglected groups deserve and take exception to some of the remarks made earlier. My stand today represents the views I have heard on the streets in regard to this Government's actions. What happened under the rainbow coalition is history and what happened under the last Government has also been consigned to the past. We must live in the present and get out of the hole in which we find ourselves. We have to move forward.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	They are probably not as good.
