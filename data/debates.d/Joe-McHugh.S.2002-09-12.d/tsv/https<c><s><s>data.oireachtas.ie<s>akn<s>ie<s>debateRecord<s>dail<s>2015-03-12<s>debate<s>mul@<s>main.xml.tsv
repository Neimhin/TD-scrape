JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources	2002-09-12	None	The national digital strategy, which was launched in July 2013, focuses on driving digital adoption in three key areas: enterprise, citizens and education. Implementation of initiatives across these three strands is progressing well. The trading online voucher scheme aims to get 2,000 small businesses trading online. More than 700 businesses have been awarded vouchers of up to €2,500. Roll-out of a further 1,300 vouchers continues. Early indications from the programme are that companies have experienced more sales and are expecting to recruit as a result. Under the citizen component of the strategy, community and voluntary organisations are grant-aided to provide digital skills training to citizens. More than 116,000 training places have been delivered under the BenefIT scheme since 2008 and more than 30,000 citizens will be trained in 2015 at more than 700 locations nationwide. Following the roll-out of 100 Mbps broadband to every second level school in Ireland, last year my Department and the Department of Education and Skills ran a series of so-called switch-on workshops for teachers to showcase how digital technologies can enhance teaching and learning. In tandem with these measures to stimulate use of technology, the Government's national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high speed broadband service of at least 30 Mbps. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. Last November the Minister published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at www.broadband.gov.ie . The areas marked blue represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016. The amber areas show the target areas for the State intervention. Following further public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process will be undertaken to select a preferred bidder or bidders. I anticipate that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within five years. This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to address conclusively current connectivity challenges in Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his supplementary. It is important to point out that the new national broadband plan has to be technology neutral in terms of EU state guidelines. There has been much communication and consultation at European Union level. The Deputy's last question was about possible European Union funds and strands of funds. Consultation is under way to look at a combined package of money. Obviously, at this stage we cannot give a broad figure because the procurement process will start and it will be full steam ahead at the end of the year. In light of procurement, it is important we do not mention a figure. However, there has to be a bundle. There has to be national government funding, and there is possible European Investment Bank funding and a combination of funding. In regard to the kerb, which was the Deputy's first question, there is investment by commercial operators, for example, by Vodafone and the ESB in 50 large towns and Eircom with a further roll-out at a commercial level. There is also fibre to cabinet delivery by semi-State companies for 70% of homes and businesses, with almost one third potentially having access to fibre to the premises.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The track record in terms of trying to get broadband roll-out for the whole country was 4 Mbps to 5 Mbps in certain instances under the previous programme. However, in trying to roll out a minimum of 30 Mbps to every house, the biggest challenge for Government is to ensure that it follows EU competition guidelines. That is where the urgency and the focus have been in terms of ensuring that legally we are not pushing one technology over another. As the Deputy is aware, some parts of his constituency have wireless.From listening to people, fibre is a possible solution. There is a backbone of cabling belonging to Eircom and infrastructure belonging to the ESB. These could form part of the solution. Those companies have been ploughing ahead and putting fibre on their backbones and Eircom has announced that it will bring broadband to more homes and premises. More than 1 million premises have it now. The critical issue for the Government is to get this right, that being, a minimum of 30 Mbps. It cannot be the maximum in the long term, especially with so much data.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy may be aware, in June 2013 EU member states authorised the European Commission to commence trade and investment negotiations with the US. These negotiations are ongoing. Their purpose is to reduce barriers to trade and investment to generate jobs and growth. Ireland stands to gain significantly from this because of the existing significant flows of trade and investment between Ireland and the US. Briefing and update material on the negotiations can be found on the website of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, www.enterprise.gov.ie. I assure the Deputy that the conclusion of an agreement will have no impact on the public policy approach adopted by Ireland towards the exploration for unconventional hydrocarbon resources. The scope of the European Commission's mandate to negotiate with the US includes investment protection and the ISDS. Countries sign such agreements in order to set out certain ground rules when foreign companies invest in their territories. The Commission's mandate to negotiate clearly provides that the objectives of any investment protection provision would be without prejudice to the right of the EU and member states to adopt and enforce measures necessary to pursue legitimate public policy objectives, such as social, environmental, security, stability of the financial system, public health and safety, in a non-discriminatory manner. I assure the House that no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration or extraction project in Ireland until there has been time to consider the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, research programme directed at examining the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In fairness, the Deputy's question was well thought out and I commend him on exploring whether there is a connection, but the answer is in black and white. In terms of the research into hydraulic fracking, the two main pillars for ensuring that the study is done comprehensively and in line with the consultation are the environment and health. The Deputy referred to the importance of people consulting. A high percentage of people have contributed to the pre-consultation stage of the EPA's study and their opinions must be reflected in it. Health is a key component in the consultation, although it was not at the beginning. Health is now represented in the EPA study to ensure that all outcomes and aspects are considered. Consultation is important. As to the Deputy's question, there is no connection. The EPA's study on this matter is primarily focused on environmental and health issues and is not related to TTIP.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The exploratory licences were granted. Although the European Commission will not necessarily set rules in respect of each country, it will have an important role in ensuring an EU-wide approach to anything that will affect the environment, for example, EPA studies and environmental impact assessments. Every private company can use court proceedings at a broad level. The significance of the study is that it was done on a North-South basis. There is a role for the North-South Ministerial Council to ensure that, while the study is ongoing, the political conversation will be ongoing as well. I do not like the idea of an EPA study being boxed off for two years while, back at the ranch, there is no political conversation. The political mechanism is the North-South Ministerial Council and possibly our Good Friday Agreement committee and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, BIPA. As the Deputy knows, there is a different attitude at governmental level in the UK to this type of process. We are keen to ensure that all of the collaboration and research is done on a North-South basis. That is why we want university expertise from both jurisdictions.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. A well-balanced fuel mix is essential to meeting these objectives for consumers and businesses. Onshore wind contributes significantly to achieving these objectives. A 2014 Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, report listed the benefits from wind electricity generation in 2012.In summary, almost 600 kilotonnes oil equivalent of fossil fuels were displaced, valued at €180 million, with a consequent carbon dioxide saving of 1.5 million tonnes, valued at €11 million. A report published by the Council for European Energy Regulators recently found Ireland to have one of the lowest levels of monetary support per unit of gross electricity produced. In other words, Ireland's approach to subsidising renewable electricity generation is amongst the most cost-effective in the EU.  As we make the transition to a low-carbon economy, we will continue to assess the alternative energy sources that are available to us, including offshore wind in the longer term. This was acknowledged in the Green Paper on Energy Policy, published in May 2014. More than 1,200 responses to the public consultation were received and 12 public seminars were held to enable public participation in the finalisation of a White Paper, which will be published in September. It is essential that local communities are at the heart of the transition to a sustainable energy system. The Department is currently finalising a renewable electricity policy and development framework, which is to be underpinned by a strategic environmental assessment and an appropriate assessment. The proposed framework, which will be completed in 2015, will be a high-level strategic policy intended for the guidance of persons seeking development consent primarily for large-scale renewable electricity projects, as well as for the guidance of planning authorities, statutory authorities and the public. The next stage of public consultation will commence shortly with the publication of the scoping report. This work, along with a review of the existing wind energy guidelines currently being finalised by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, will set a clear framework for the development of renewable energy infrastructure into the future.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am certainly on the same page as the Deputy as regards exploring all potential alternatives. A reliance on one source, especially onshore wind energy, as a single solution for sustainability is not the way forward. I recently met a company looking to invest in Donegal in tidal energy, which was fostering the community approach in order to get community buy-in from day one. In the Deputy's original question, he mentioned Donegal and the midlands. I do not need to speak on behalf of the companies. They know that mistakes were made in terms of pre-announcements. For example, in the midlands, companies were saying they would build 10,000 wind turbines, which put the community's back up straight away. There was no exploration of or conversation around community dividend or what the benefits to the local community would be. Deputy Pringle and I know that wind farms contribute about €1.8 million per year to the rate base of Donegal County Council, but that does not mean we should continue to plough ahead in building more wind turbines that will affect and upset communities. We have to be very careful and strategic. That is why I am delighted there is going to be a strategic look at this. There will be a consultation coming up shortly and there will be a more critical appraisal of how we meet community needs as well as the need for industry. We have to look offshore. Industry people say that it may be too expensive off the west coast of Ireland, but we have to look at the west coast and the east coast as well. There were company developments in respect of the Irish Sea, and negotiations were taking place on a bilateral basis between the UK and Ireland. That is parked up until about 2018 or 2020, but there are still opportunities for offshore energy. I will be encouraging the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy White, to include biomass as part of the mix in the context of the negotiations and consultations on energy.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	One cannot go to a community and say, "This is going to be the way, and you have to accept that." Mistakes were made on the part of private industry, but I am certainly not going to speak on its behalf. We have to learn from the mistakes that were made and bring communities with us. Communities have to be at the heart of the solution for sustainable rural economic models. That is why it is important that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is going to have a role in ensuring that the proper and thorough processes are adhered to so that we do not have communities feeling upset and disenfranchised in that they are not getting a dividend. We have to look at all the alternative potential, be it tidal energy, offshore wind or the Deputy's own suggestions of biomass. We have to look at the complete mix. We are importing 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas - which will change in a few months' time - and we have such a heavy reliance on fossil fuels, particularly considering the percentage mix in the 2020 targets for renewable energy. I know the Minister, Deputy White, is on the same page as me in believing that communities have to be at the heart of the solution, in terms of ensuring it is acceptable to communities and that they feel part of the dividend as well.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The European Commission’s energy union package is aimed at enhancing energy security, sustainability and competitiveness throughout Europe. It proposes that EU member states work collaboratively and intensively on a list of actions in pursuit of common energy policy goals. Included in the package is a Commission communication on achieving interconnection of at least 10% of installed electricity production capacity for all member states. For energy consumers to participate fully in an integrated European internal energy market, poorly interconnected peripheral member states, including Ireland, will need improved electricity and gas interconnection. An enhanced regional approach to delivering full European energy market integration is proposed. In this regard, Ireland has witnessed the benefits of regional co-operation since the establishment of the single electricity market in November 2007.The benefits of the single energy market include improved security of supply, competitive prices and increased penetration of renewable energy, each of which is a goal of the energy union proposals. The completion of the North-South transmission line project will significantly enhance Ireland's level of interconnection with the UK. Similarly, additional interconnections with France and the UK would further enhance our connectivity and bring benefits in security, competitiveness and sustainability. To help the creation of an integrated EU energy market, the European Commission has drawn up a list of projects of common interest. These projects are proposed by infrastructure developers, and the list contains several possible projects relating to Ireland. While the projects are at various stages of development, with some of them still conceptual and possibly never coming to fruition, some of the projects could potentially underpin further integration into regional markets through additional interconnection. The North-South transmission line project is included on the list of projects, as is the possible interconnection with France. Several interconnectors with the UK are also listed, some of which relate to the possibility of trading renewable electricity with the UK after 2020.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The Department is engaging with the European Commission to clarify Ireland's current level of interconnection. Depending on the variables used in the calculation, the level of a country's interconnection can vary. I am advised that, at a minimum, Ireland has around 11% of electricity interconnection. Notwithstanding this, Ireland would welcome additional investment to increase our connectivity, and opportunities will be pursued where possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The North Sea offshore grid is in the first priority list in the annex to EU Regulation No. 347/2013, which sets out guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure. These guidelines cover integrated offshore electricity grid development and related interconnectors in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the English Channel, the Baltic Sea and neighbouring waters aimed at transporting electricity from renewable offshore energy sources to centres of consumption and storage, and to increase cross-border electricity exchange. The member states concerned are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The interconnector with France is at a conceptual stage, but from speaking with people in the industry, I am aware of the opportunities associated with it. If we are to move to a single energy market, we should not be restricted to connectivity with the United Kingdom. From a personal point of view, I see France as an option but it is at a conceptual stage and we need to continue the conversation by keeping it on the agenda, whether in Strasbourg, the European Commission or the European Council. We are all conscious of the importance of energy security given what is happening in eastern Europe. We need to develop plan B and plan C, and if the interconnector with France is an option, we have to keep it on the agenda.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree it must be kept on the agenda. If we want to keep something on the agenda, the question of resources and funding must be addressed. There could be a role in this matter for the European Investment Fund and the Connecting Europe Facility, which can attract capital at favourable interest rates and, in turn, leverage debt and equity financing to enable major energy infrastructure projects to proceed. The concerns of peripheral regions with inadequate interconnections and sources of energy can be addressed by these means. While our figure for connectivity is currently at 11%, we need to build on it. This debate needs to continue in this Parliament and in Europe, with a focus on the key issue of resources.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising a question close to my own heart. The Government's national broadband plan aims to deliver a minimum high speed broadband service of 30 Mbps to every home and business in Ireland. This State intervention can be delivered over a number of different technology platforms and, in designing an intervention strategy and a procurement process, we must be mindful of complying fully with EU state aid guidelines by being technology neutral and not favouring one technology over another. These guidelines do, however, allow for fibre to be deployed as close to the end user as possible. Retail telecommunications providers would then be free to use a variety of technology platforms to reach the final customer. We also need to ensure that State investment delivers a network that can meet current and anticipated future demand. It must be capable of ensuring that there is no urban-rural digital divide and that rural based businesses and residents are not at a disadvantage compared with those in urban areas. The planned intervention is being designed to deal conclusively with the rural connectivity challenge. The comprehensive mapping exercise we completed in late 2014 shows a clear fibre backhaul deficit in many parts of rural Ireland. This will need to be addressed in any intervention. The intention is to design a clear specification around the services we wish to see delivered and then allow the bidders to submit tenders based on their ability to meet these specification requirements.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have to get it right conclusively. The more than 60 towns that Eircom will be targeting and the 50 towns that ESB, along with Vodafone, will be working with in the initial stages of the plan comprise large urban areas. In rural areas, somebody employed by, for example, Pramerica in Letterkenny should be able to work from home in Malin Head or Killybegs. That is the critical issue. The national broadband plan aims to address areas in which commercial companies are not interested. It is not commercially viable to go into these areas. A potential solution, as Deputy Pringle correctly noted, is to wrap fibre around the ESB network.However, the Government is constrained in what it can do because of EU guidelines and state intervention rules. Most of these rural areas have wireless broadband, so there are competition issues in terms of whether the State can go in and compete with another provider. We must be very clear in what we are doing and we must be technology neutral. The Deputy is correct that a potential option is wrapping fibre around the ESB network. That network goes to Arranmore Island, Tory Island and other peripheral areas. There is also the Eircom network, however, and the question then is which one to choose. Where we are at in the process is ensuring we are proceeding on a legally sound basis to deliver broadband, finally and conclusively, to rural areas. That is the challenge we face. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is no question that we are constrained in the area of state-led interventions by EU rules and regulations. The Government cannot go into areas that are not viable from a commercial point of view and wrap fibre around a particular infrastructure of its choosing. There has been a lot of advice sought on this and a lot of legal advice given. As well as ESB and Eircom, any other provider, such as UPC, to give an example, can choose to compete. The process must be open to everybody, including wireless providers. It is not confined to those companies providing one particular technology. The firm advice we have been given is that we must be technology neutral. The Deputy referred to the particular challenges that present in respect of the islands. I am very clear in my conversations with the officials that we should be treating all areas equally and ensuring we deliver to the most peripheral areas in the country, including the islands, even where they are not commercially viable.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The information sought by the Deputy is an operational matter for the individual State companies in the first instance. The Government is fully committed to renewing and significantly expanding the apprenticeship system in Ireland. The recent announcement by the ESB Networks training centre of excellence in Portlaoise of plans to recruit 300 new apprentices in the coming years is a significant development in this regard.  There are several other State bodies under the aegis of the Department actively participating in apprenticeship and graduate schemes. Bord na Móna, for instance, recruits apprentices on an annual basis. I understand it currently has 28 apprentices ranging from first to fourth year serving their apprenticeship in the trade of construction plant fitting, mechanical automation, maintenance fitting and electrical. The company reviews the apprenticeship programme on an ongoing basis and plans to recruit apprentices each year based on the business requirements.  In addition, Gas Networks Ireland is committed to providing opportunities for young adults through apprenticeship and graduate programmes. These personnel will be provided with specific training which will ensure Gas Networks Ireland continues to have the appropriate core technical competencies within its business to deliver its work programmes and ensure the ongoing success of the business.  The Engineers Ireland graduate placement training programme allows young engineers to gain experience in an engineering environment and the host organisation to benefit from their skills and enthusiasm. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland currently has three graduate energy engineers on this 23-month graduate programme. To date, SEAI has enabled 32 interns to participate across 15 local authorities under the SEAI-led energy intern programme which commenced in 2010. Under this programme, support has been provided to 70 SMEs in identifying energy savings of €1.75 million for their businesses. Electric Ireland has taken this programme and developed it into the Energy FIT programme which was recently launched in GAA clubs countrywide.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy makes a fair point. In regard to the national broadband roll-out plan, I am getting a lot of information from industry that there is potential in this regard. If the roll-out is to go to every single house in the country, we should be planning and preparing for that. I am glad the officials are already having those conversations. There must be joined-up thinking between the different interdepartmental groups and the various Ministers. It is about upping the ante and co-ordinating our efforts. There is scope to look at bringing in people who are coming out of certain courses and looking to add value to their qualification. Ensuring there is a component of skilled apprenticeships is a social dividend, as the Deputy noted. I thank him for raising this particular issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a sensible suggestion. I have spoken to a number of companies that are outsourcing in different spheres. It is a demand and supply issue and they are operating in the real world of business. If they get the contracts to do the work, they need the people who can do that work. My information is that there is a gap there. "Gap" sounds a little negative; I should say there is potential there to bring recruits on board. Not to throw it back to the Deputy, but perhaps he might seek a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, on the back of Deputy Colreavy's suggestion.I certainly would not mind having this conversation and we can do it sooner rather than later.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his question. The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high-quality, high-speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided. The commercial telecommunications sector is investing approximately €2.5 billion in network upgrades and enhanced services, with approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland expected to have access to commercial high-speed broadband services over the next two years. These significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available. Last November the Minister published a national high-speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at www.broadband.gov.ie. The areas marked in blue represent those areas that will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016. The amber areas show the target areas for State intervention. The map allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to see whether their premises or homes will have access to commercial high-speed broadband services by the end of 2016 or whether they will be included in the Government's proposed intervention. A public consultation on the map, which commenced in November, closed on 12 February. A total of 29 submissions have been received to date and will be assessed over the coming weeks. This will help inform the key decisions that require to be taken to finalise our comprehensive intervention strategy which will be published for consultation in July. The strategy will address a range of important issues on the intervention, including the optimum procurement model, ownership and governance options, funding issues and levels of service for end users. Part of the analysis being undertaken involves consideration of identifying and prioritising strategic connection points, such as enterprise parks, schools and other points of economic or social activity in rural communities.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
The proposed intervention will also be subject to state aid clearance from the European Commission. Following the public consultation this summer, a detailed procurement process, in line with EU and Irish procurement rules, will be undertaken to select a preferred bidder or bidders. The Department will design the tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost of the network build as low as possible. It is anticipated that the first homes and businesses will be connected in 2016 and connections will continue thereafter, with the intention of having all premises connected within a five year period. This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to address conclusively current connectivity challenges in Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Areas have already been identified in the amber sections of the national broadband plan maps produced by the Department. This is with regard to 90% of the geographical area but 30% of the population. These are the most peripheral areas. Earlier we spoke about the islands, and several islands down south, such as Sherkin Island, Bere Island and Oileán Chléire, are close to the Deputy's heart. Communities in the most peripheral areas think the further away their area is, the more likely it is to be dealt with last. I have raised this point, and as part of the procurement process we examined whether those areas which are always last could come first. This is the type of creative thinking we need. We are having a parallel conversation about how to save post offices, and Bobby Kerr who chairs the group has been considering the potential of post offices to become Internet cafes. We cannot have Internet cafes on Tory Island, Sherkin Island or Bere Island if we do not have broadband. We need creative thinking about where to start, but now is the time to have the conversation and feed into the procurement process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No doubt Deputy Harrington's suggestion will feed into the conversation. I do not have a problem with it and it is a good suggestion. The Wild Atlantic Way had a number of tourists last year, and before it was actively or aggressively promoted, it was a success. Somebody researching it on an iPhone in Bavaria and deciding to go to south Cork or north Donegal will expect to have Internet access when travelling the Wild Atlantic Way to find out what is happening in Galway, Clare, Sligo, Malin Head or Kinsale.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am familiar with the MANs from a number of towns and industrial estates in my county. Gweedore industrial estate has a MAN, as do larger towns such as Letterkenny, Carndonagh, Buncrana and Donegal town. At the time, overall responsibility for the MANs was given to Enet and I have had a number of conversations with its CEO. The company wants to work on various projects on its MANs throughout Ireland. I suggest the Deputy gets in touch with Enet's CEO because no doubt there are MANs in his constituency. I get the feeling the company is open to ideas on potential creative solutions. It is working in Ennis at present. From what I hear, the company is looking to engage with the Government and there is potential. The MAN in Letterkenny was not enough on its own to provide the proper infrastructure for big companies such as Pramerica, United Healthcare and Zeus. Project Kelvin, a North Atlantic connectivity to Coleraine, Lifford and Letterkenny, provides another solution. MANs are certainly part of the mix, and for the Deputy's information, Enet is open to conversation.
 Questions Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, replied to with Written Answers.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is Government policy that An Post remain a strong and viable company that is in a position to provide high-quality postal services and maintain a nationwide network of customer-focused post offices in the community. The post office network faces significant challenges given the impact of the economic downturn over the last few years, changes in technology and customer retail preferences. However, it is also well positioned to become the front office provider of choice for government and financial services sector electronic transactions, as well as the more traditional over-the-counter transactions. The Minister recently established the post office network business development group under the chairmanship of Mr. Bobby Kerr. The group's terms of reference are to examine the potential for existing and new Government and commercial business to be transacted through the post office network; to identify the new business opportunities for the post office network, taking account of international experience; to engage, as necessary, with the public sector, commercial bodies and other interested parties in pursuit of the above objectives; and to prepare an interim and final report for the Minister in accordance with an agreed timetable.  The group’s work will be of strategic importance to the future of the post office network. Its final report will be available during the course of this year. Operational matters, including the closing of post offices, are issues for the board and management of An Post.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not the only initiative. While whether a post office remains open or closed is not a matter for the Government, the importance of retention of post offices has been a matter of huge concern for members of the Fine Gael and Labour parties, particularly backbenchers. The strong conversation around the need for retention of post offices led to the establishment of the post office network business development group, which is expected to report soon on the issue of the sustainability of post offices. As part of this critical mix, there will need to be a sharp focus on banking.  Earlier this morning I spoke to the postmaster on Tory Island, Mr. Jimmy Rogers. People from Tory Island who wish to withdraw money from their post office accounts are required to travel to the mainland - some people on Tory Island believe it is the mainland, with which I agree - to withdraw money from their post office accounts via an AIB ATM. Post offices need to engage more in banking services. It is also important that there be a greater focus on the availability of government services through An Post, which is where the conservation is at. As I am a member of the post office network business development group, I do not propose to engage in predicting the likely outcome of its review. Discussion on the matter is ongoing.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The statistics are indicative of what has happened in the three years between 2011 and 2014. During that time, 24 post offices closed. During the six-year period between 2004 and 2010, 345 post offices closed. On the basis that this has been the trend, the Government takes this matter very seriously. The Government has faced enormous pressure at parliamentary party meetings in relation to the need for retention of post offices. Post offices are a critical part of the community infrastructure. Friday is an important day for the elderly in rural and isolated communities. They do not all go to bingo on a Wednesday night, so visiting the local post office on a Friday is often the only point of contact for them. There is a massive social dividend here that needs to be protected. I take on board the Deputy's constructive suggestion. I look forward to engaging further with him on the matter when it comes to the debate on the report of the post office network business development group, which, as I said, is being chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The national broadband plan outlined the Government's commitment to deliver a high-speed broadband connection to every citizen and business in Ireland, regardless of location. It reflects the Government and European objectives to deliver new opportunities for jobs, growth and social inclusion. The digital agenda for Europe commits to the delivery of 30 Mbps broadband to all citizens by 2020. This was to be achieved through a combination of commercial and State investment.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately €2.5 billion in network upgrades. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high-speed broadband services over the next number of years. These very significant investments represent a step change in the quality of broadband services available. While the enhanced investment by industry is very much welcome, it is exacerbating the divide between those areas benefitting from the accelerated commercial investment and other areas, predominantly rural, where available commercial speeds remain very basic. The Government's broadband intervention will ensure the availability of high-quality future-proofed broadband services to all other parts of the country. It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business.  To definitively address the broadband challenges faced by Ireland, the State intervention under the national broadband plan will present a long term future-proofed solution which will address those areas of the country identified in the mapping exercise conducted last year with no present or planned next-generation access services. Through the national broadband plan, it is our objective to ensure that all citizens in every part of the country have access to high-speed, high-quality broadband services that will put Ireland at top of the class in terms of access to broadband services throughout Europe.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is a fair question. We have outlined the time period. We will seek to move the procurement process forward towards the end of this year. In 2016, we will start to roll out broadband in the areas that are not commercially viable for private companies. People do not want to hear about a three to five year period for the provision of broadband. Deputies live in the real world and when companies approach them with an idea for locating in a rural area, when they tell them there will be no broadband for some time that is not what they want to hear. Deputy Durkan's question is critical. It is important that we continue to seek creative solutions in the interim in terms of what we can do with private companies. Private companies can work with each other. For example, Vodafone and the ESB worked together on projects in the 50 largest towns. There will be a further roll-out in that regard in the second phase and third phase. A lot will happen at that level. As Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, I am pushing very strongly the agenda that we would provide broadband in Gaeltacht areas where we are trying to attract investment. There is a sense of urgency in that regard. I appreciate the Deputy's position. He is correct that he has heard it said previously that we will get it right. He heard that years ago. However, it is about getting it right, and it is also not just about providing a solution of 30 Mbps because children in the Visitors Gallery will be going to secondary school in a few years and their expectation will be akin to that of Paddy McGilligan in the 1920s, namely, that they will just press a button on the wall and they will have access to broadband-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	-----in the same way that we take the electricity supply for granted.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We could do a number of things. I accept you have requested brevity, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I will respond to Deputy Durkan on the demands for the here and now. We must continue to engage with the private companies because they are looking at alternative solutions. If I hear from people within industry that there is a deficit in the number of apprentices, then the Government can help. One element we can deliver is to train up more people and give them the skills and expertise in order that they can be available to those companies. In response to Deputy Stanton, Members across the House all hear the same thing every day from people with business ideas who want to go to a certain area where there is no broadband. The situation is reflected in the critical mass of oral parliamentary questions today which predominantly relate to broadband. That is the issue. Deputies have their ears to the ground. We must respond to the demands of the electorate in our constituencies and ensure people are not discriminated against in terms of service provision. That is why it is critical that the State-led intervention is done correctly. We do not want to be faced with a situation whereby once the procurement phase commences, things are not done right and we are back to square one. We are ploughing ahead. I am happy with the efforts, number of meetings and the work that has gone into it at an official level.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	First, it should be noted that RTE is not the sole recipient of licence fee revenue. Licence fee revenues are distributed in accordance with section 123 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 in the following prescribed manner. From the gross TV licence fee receipts, the Department first deducts commission payable to An Post in respect of its role as the Minister's issuing agent for TV licences. TG4 also currently receives €9.245 million from the gross receipts. Following these deductions, 7% of the net revenue is paid to the broadcasting funding scheme. The scheme, which is operated by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, was established to provide funding in support of the production of high quality programmes by independent producers and broadcasters on Irish culture, heritage and experience, and programmes to improve adult literacy. The scheme also supports certain archiving projects being undertaken by broadcasters. Any revenues remaining following these payments are provided to RTE. The purpose of the TV licence revenues paid to RTE and TG4 is to facilitate the pursuit of each broadcaster's public service objectives, which are set out in the 2009 Act. Statutorily mandated annual and five yearly reviews are conducted by the BAI which must consider whether each broadcaster has fulfilled the commitments set out in its annual statement and make a recommendation as to whether there should be an adjustment to the level of public funding. The first five-year review was undertaken in 2013 and this work included a wide-ranging process of stakeholder engagement with market players and other interested parties, involving both face-to-face interviews and written submissions. The results of that review, and the Government response to it, acknowledge the very significant programme of cost savings implemented by RTE since 2008, whereby it has reduced its operating costs by 30% and reduced its staff by more than 500 people. Members will be aware that a service which was provided in the UK has been taken off the air. It is also worth noting that these efficiencies were achieved in a period where RTE's annual revenues fell by 26% and where, despite the impact of this period of restructuring on the broadcaster, RTE continued to deliver its full range of services and achieved a break-even position in 2013.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 As the Deputy will be aware, the Government response to the five-year review tasked NewERA with conducting an independent assessment of the scope for further efficiencies within RTE, including an examination of achievable efficiencies in its performing groups service model and the manner in which it delivers Irish language radio services. As part of this review, NewERA has also reviewed the scope for optimising the use of independent productions as part of RTE’s programme output. The Minister is currently considering the findings of the NewERA report prior to bringing it to Government and intends publishing it shortly thereafter.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He is correct in that I have much empathy for what he describes as I have driven through the Border twice every time I have come to these Houses since 2002, or for 13 years. It has been an issue.I welcome this opportunity to clarify for the House the steps taken by the EU institutions to control, reduce and ultimately to eliminate roaming charges within the European Union. I am aware of the recent media reports which suggested the Council or the Commission does not support actions to eliminate roaming charges, or is seeking to delay the removal of roaming charges, contrary to the consumers' interest. This is not an accurate representation of the true position. The Minister fully supports harmonised EU actions to eliminate roaming charges, but this shared objective has to be achieved in a manner that avoids long-term adverse impacts on users of mobile phone services generally, including those who do not avail of roaming services. The EU has made substantial progress in reducing the maximum permitted roaming charges. Three EU regulations, adopted since 2007, have progressively reduced roaming charges by an estimated 80%. This includes voice calls, SMS, texting, and data-Internet access. These substantial reductions in retail roaming prices are also sustainable due to the imposition of proportionate reductions in wholesale charges. The European Commission brought forward proposals for a future EU regulation to incentivise mobile service providers to remove roaming charges voluntarily. The European Parliament adopted an amendment to the European Commission proposal which would prohibit retail roaming charges within the EU from December 2015. The European Parliament's proposal does not prohibit the imposition of wholesale charges. If service providers are prohibited from recovering those wholesale costs directly from retail users, it is inevitable they will seek to recover the costs from other users or reduce volume limits in bundled minutes and data package limits to control costs. These outcomes would not serve the long-term interests of users. The shared position within Council is to give the Latvian Presidency a mandate to enter into negotiations with the European Parliament to reduce retail roaming charges further towards zero. The revised charges, if agreed by Parliament, will deliver significant further reductions in regulated retail roaming charges and allow service providers to recover the wholesale costs incurred in providing the service. The proposal provides for a further review of the regulation by June 2018 which will include a further review of both wholesale and retail roaming charges. I am glad to have had this opportunity to clarify for the House the significant progress which has been made possible by EU regulations to control and reduce retail roaming charges and to confirm that the Government's ultimate objective is to eliminate retail roaming prices in a manner which does not generate predictable adverse impacts for users.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When I was in opposition, I did a lot of shouting about roaming charges. If one was going from O2 Ireland to O2 UK, crossing the Border, one was charged. That changed when various companies, such as O2, said if one was locked into O2 North and South, one did not have to pay roaming but if one happened to move into another frequency, one would be charged.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. There are still charges if one roams into a different network, such as Orange or Vodafone UK. There are data charges on top of that. Compared with 2007, the cost of outgoing voice calls has fallen by over 60% to 19 cent per minute. I agree that we have to work towards zero. Incoming voice calls have fallen 80% to 5 cent per minute. Outgoing texts have fallen from 11 cent in 2009 to 5 cent. Per megabyte data charges have fallen from 70 cent in 2012, when the regulation on data price was introduced, to 20 cent today. It is significant that the Latvian Presidency has been given responsibility to ensure we work towards proposals that would allow mobile service providers to charge a premium above domestic charges only to recover the regulated wholesale charges. My colleague, Brian Hayes, MEP, raised this publicly during the week at the European Parliament. I will speak to him about how we can move this forward. The date 2018 was given but that seems a long time to work towards eliminating charges altogether. I agree about the mobile coverage at the moment. Everything is not hunky-dory; in fact it has deteriorated. I met some weeks ago with the head of ComReg. The new motorways were not built in a joined-up way with mobile phone antennae placed along the motorways. We are playing catch-up. Calls are dropping out. We need more information on the infrastructural upgrades. We need to know how much money is being spent. When I go to Cavan tonight, my calls will be dropping out the whole way and then I will probably go through Enniskillen. The coverage in the North is very poor. I hear, however, the mobile phone companies in Northern Ireland are making a substantial investment in their infrastructure. They should make the same level of investment in the South. We need an open, transparent conversation about mobile phone operators. Local companies declare their profits publicly, but we need to ensure the end user is not the one left to do the heavy lifting. That has been the case. There are different attractive packages and bundling of minutes and so on and phone costs have come down, if one is smart. If one brings one’s iPhone to Belfast, the data charges are astronomical. We are part of the European Union which must become a non-roaming charge environment for phone access. I will have a long conversation with Brian Hayes, MEP, to see how this Government, including the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, who is also keen to work towards zero cost, can work with the European Parliament to push this important matter forward.
