JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Senator Chambers and Deputy Brady.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Senator Chambers, tá fáilte romhat. Fair play to you. Ar son an choiste, on behalf of the committee, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Mr. Barry Andrews, MEP, go dtí an cruinniú inniu. You are very welcome to the committee today. We look forward to this engagement on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give. Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. My apologies to members. I have to read the privilege statement out verbatim every week but that has to be done. If any members have trouble going to sleep at night, I would advise them to learn it off by heart. I find it very helpful when falling asleep. I call on Mr. Barry Andrews to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The sound is coming and going. Perhaps Mr. Andrews is a little too far away from the microphone. I thank him for his comments. There is no doubt that members will focus on the matters he highlighted relating to enhanced engagement between Brussels and Belfast. It sounds like both a proactive and very positive move.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If we keep the engagement brisk, members will get a chance to contribute again as there is no shortage of time today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It seems a little better.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The next speaker is Deputy Ó Murchú, followed by Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry if I did not respond to the Deputy earlier but I am flexible when it comes to questions. I was not going to get involved there.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As Senator Chambers is outside the campus, I will raise her question with Mr. Andrews. Regarding future parliamentary oversight of the ongoing implementation of the trade and co-operation agreement, Senator Chambers wishes to know whether there is any potential dispute and any associated resolution mechanisms to deal with this.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will move on to a second round of questions. Deputy Ó Murchú is first on my list. Before I call him, I have a brief question. We are constantly being introduced to new jargon in the European Union. I thank Mr. Andrews for that new medical jargon term, connective tissue. It stands out. I appreciate what he and the eight MEPs were trying to do. It is important to have that link between Belfast and Brussels. Has Mr. Andrews tested the water in Belfast on this issue and I am specifically referring to unionism? What would this look like in practice? Potentially how would he see this operating in practice?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Andrews for that reply. I call Deputy Ó Murchú to be followed by Deputy Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On the point about further engagement, Mr. Andrews will be aware of the politics in action programme which involves schools on both sides of the Border. It is part of the programme for Government and has been active, even during Covid. I have been hearing, anecdotally, that this engagement is very productive. The conversations are not focused only on the issues involved in our political discourse but also cover issues that affect young people. The clerk will be happy to pass on the details. There is a lot of engagement between Belfast and Dublin but maybe Brussels should also be involved in some way. This is just an idea.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Andrews. Deputy Haughey is our final contributor.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thought Mr. Andrews was out the gate there but Deputy Harkin has come in with a late question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will leave Mr. Andrews with a final question. Noelle O'Connell from European Movement Ireland has written to the committee highlighting a recent Red C poll. No doubt Mr. Andrews has access to these figures but I will highlight a few of them. On a positive front, 84% of the people surveyed agreed that Ireland should remain as part of the EU. That is really strong and is reflective of what people are saying on the ground. One hears it through the media as well. Interestingly, only 35% felt that in order to deal with a crisis such as Covid-19, Ireland and other member states should give the EU more control over healthcare policy. I assume that is a reaction to the roll-out of vaccines in the European Union. There is a weakness there. Some 29%, which is a very low figure, agree that there should be more political and economic integration in the EU, even if that means member states lose control over economic policy such as tax. That is a very strong and loud message about protecting our own sovereignty in economic decisions. Going back to a positive statistic, which will lead to my question, 71% of people interviewed in that Red C poll agree that the EU should do more to regulate digital media platforms, including online sources of news, information sharing platforms, social media, etc. I acknowledge that Mr. Andrews's committee deals with digital trade and that this is not his area. However, I am thinking about this in light of the fact that 52% of the people interviewed believe that we need to hold the Conference on the Future of Europe to reform the EU, which is a low enough percentage. Does Mr. Andrews think we can make progress on the debate about trying to regulate digital media, in light of the Irish people's opinion that we would stand stronger together as a European Union bloc on an issue like this, in order to take on the big tech companies and the difficulties and trouble we have with some social media platforms? Is this something on which we can make ground at a European Union level, rather than having to wait for discussions at the Conference on the Future of Europe? I would appreciate Mr. Andrews' opinion on that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Andrews was nearly out the gate with Deputy Harkin but he is not out yet. We have a last dash interjection from Senator Martin. No doubt he will have a few words of wisdom and, potentially, a question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is a question on the French connection.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I think we are out the gate. We are very grateful.
