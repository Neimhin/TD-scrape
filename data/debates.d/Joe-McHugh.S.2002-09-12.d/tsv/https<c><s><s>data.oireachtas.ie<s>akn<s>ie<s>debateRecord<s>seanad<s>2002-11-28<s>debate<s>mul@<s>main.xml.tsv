JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have two jobs for the Leader this morning; it will be a busy one for her. I would like her to make representations on behalf of the textile and clothing industry to the Government's spokesperson on Europe, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, and ask him to initiate anti-dumping measures against Turkish imports with the European Commission. We have 14,000 jobs in the textile and clothing industry and we must consolidate our position. Naturally an expansionary policy is not being initiated, but we must consolidate what we have.I have been in touch with a few members of the Irish diaspora who suggest that, given that we do not have an international election due to logistical problems which would enable members of the disapora to have a vote, consideration should be given to maybe not three but at least one of the Taoiseach's nominees being a nominee of the diaspora.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No. I spoke about this issue three weeks ago.
