JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I support Senator O'Toole's call for a proactive debate on agriculture. On the last occasion on which we discussed this matter the debate was similar to a tennis match at Wimbledon; it was merely a point-scoring political exercise. Farming is in trouble and I am a little concerned – perhaps the Senator opposite received prior notice – at the commendation and the praise being heaped on the Minister when we have absolutely no idea about the contents of the deal made in Brussels.I am aware that the farming lobby groups felt disenfranchised during the entire process. My party called for a debate on agriculture in the Lower House and was refused, at all times, by the Minister. It is, therefore, somewhat premature and naive to congratulate a Minister when many people and representatives were disenfranchised during the debate.A total of 6,500 acres in the Finn Valley area in Donegal have been designated SACs. The problem we and the farming community have with that is there was absolutely no consultation; the Minister for the Environment and Local Government merely listed the farms on a map. The farmers involved are entitled to be aggrieved and they believe that this lack of consultation is endemic to the Government.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about the SAC categories which come under the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	About which there was no debate.
