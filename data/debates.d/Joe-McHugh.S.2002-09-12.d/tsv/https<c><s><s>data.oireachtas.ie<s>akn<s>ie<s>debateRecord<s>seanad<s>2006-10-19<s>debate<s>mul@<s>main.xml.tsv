JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I support Senator Kitt's call for a debate on banking.  The key issue in the case in County Wexford is whether parental consent was given.  The House should have a robust debate on banking because hundreds of customers are being ripped off as a result of Internet fraud.  People who believe they know how to avoid being ripped off are also affected by Internet banking fraud, which affects people across the board.  Perhaps we also need a debate on this issue.While acknowledging that the House had a good debate on energy several weeks ago, I call for a series of further debates on energy issues, for example, spiralling energy prices and the proposed interconnector between Wales and County Wicklow.  The interconnector project has been put on the long finger for a considerable period.  Four years ago a private company was ready to commence work on this piece of infrastructure.  An interconnector would have two benefits.  It would allow us to import cheaper energy, thus enhancing competition, and Ireland could start to export green energy through onshore and offshore wind farms.  It is incumbent on the House to have a special debate on the proposed interconnector between Wales and Wicklow.
