JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle agus leis na Teachtaí uilig atá i láthair linn arís inniu chun an t-ábhar oideachais a phlé agus an díospóireacht iontach tábhachtach seo a bheith againn anois. I am happy to be in the House again to provide a further update on our work programme. I want to focus on three particular areas, namely, the leaving certificate and preparations for the calculated grades system, the planning under way for reopening the education and training sector, particularly schools, and the delivery of educational provision to students with special educational needs during the summer period. I announced on 8 May that all students are to be offered the option of receiving calculated grades for the subjects they are studying and the alternative of sitting the 2020 leaving certificate examinations at a date in the future when it is considered safe to hold them. I updated the House last week on developments in that regard. There has been significant work undertaken within my Department, working in close collaboration with education partners, and the executive office approved by the Government to operate the calculated grades system has been established. A number of staff from the State Examinations Commission with relevant expertise have already been seconded to my Department and further secondments are expected as the calculated grades system becomes operational. I am delighted to announce in the Chamber that Dr. Áine Lawlor, former director of the Teaching Council, has agreed to chair the independent steering committee on calculated grades. The committee will oversee the process of implementation of calculated grades from the perspective of quality assurance and integrity. We are continuing to work with stakeholders on the key issues, including through the advisory group on State examinations. That group met last week and will meet again this Friday, and its members have continued to engage with my Department between meetings. This collaboration and intense work, including by my officials, has meant that the detailed guidance material will issue to schools tomorrow. I am very conscious of the importance of this guide for schools, teachers, principals, parents and students to provide certainty and clarity. Over the past number of days, through engagement and discussions with all involved, we have made significant progress on finalising this guidance material and issuing it as a priority. I again acknowledge the contribution the members of the advisory group and all the educational stakeholders have made to the process so far. The group remains in place and will continue to meet as we bring forward the school component of the calculated grades model. I have today answered a range of written parliamentary questions about how different aspects of the calculated grades system will operate. The detailed guidance to teachers and principals addresses many of the detailed aspects of how a teacher will determine an estimated mark in a particular subject. There is one issue, which has come up in a lot of the questions, on which it is important to be clear. The guidance makes it clear that the estimated mark is not based on a student's performance in any mock examination undertaken in his or her school or on his or her junior cycle results. The estimated mark is informed by a teacher's professional judgment and available evidence can be used to support the estimation of a mark. Once a teacher has completed the stage of establishing an estimated mark for each student, those marks will then be considered as part of a school alignment process. It is vitally important that teachers' professional judgment, the in-school process and the application of a national standard all work together to provide each student with a result that is fair and equitable. Since I last addressed the House, we have moved into phase 1 of the Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business. In the education sector, this means that schools and other educational buildings can open for access by teachers for the organisation and distribution of remote learning. These are welcome developments and reflect the progress we have been making as a society in suppressing the virus. The Roadmap for Reopening Society and Business envisages commencement of a reopening of schools and educational institutions from the beginning of the next academic year in September. Planning in this regard is now under way in consultation with stakeholders and having regard to the experience of other countries. Managing the reopening of our education system is a massive logistical operation that needs to be carefully planned and managed. Given the diversity in school and education settings, one size fits all will not apply.We are talking about a system with more than 1 million learners and facilities ranging from small schools to multi-campus higher education institutions. Schools and other education institutions are also workplaces for more than 110,000 people, and the national return to work safely protocol has to be a factor in our future planning. The key to a safe and continued return to work requires strong communication and a shared collaborative approach between employers and workers. Schools will require clear guidance and early clarity on key issues so they can start planning at a local level. In planning for the reopening of schools, the Department's approach to managing the public health aspects of the reopening and operation of schools will be based on ongoing health advice, and we will continue to engage with expert groups to strive to ensure our plans for the reopening of schools reflect the most up-to-date advice available. There may be different scenarios for reopening schools depending on the prevailing health advice, ranging from the attendance of a small number of students at any given time to a full return. There may be a need for phasing of different approaches. All issues need to be considered in looking at these scenarios, including implications for the curriculum, for teaching and learning and for those at risk of educational disadvantage and those with special educational needs. Our most vulnerable students must and will be a focus for our priorities as we plan for the future. The Department is engaging with all stakeholders to develop a plan to reopen schools. All primary and post-primary stakeholders have been invited to make submissions to the Department on the issues to be considered from their perspectives. In addition, a meeting of the primary education forum took place last week and a meeting with post-primary stakeholders took place today. Ongoing meetings with stakeholders will be arranged as the Roadmap for Reopening Schools is developed. In addition to the education stakeholders, wider consultation is needed with other parties, including Bus Éireann, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the National Transport Authority, NTA, the HSE and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. Similar processes are happening in the tertiary sector, and my Department is engaging with stakeholders in that regard. We have also been looking closely at the experience of other countries. I attended a virtual meeting of EU ministers of education on Monday to hear the experience of my colleagues on the steps they are taking. Yesterday, I also spoke with my counterpart in London, Gavin Williamson, on the common challenges we face. Schools continue to be best placed to make decisions on how to support and educate all their learners during this period. Consideration of the types of experiences that schools will be able to offer in the new school year and how remote or online learning can support and complement the teaching and learning that takes place in the classroom will be required. In addition, continued support will be required where students cannot attend school.  I am particularly concerned about the impact of school closures on students with special educational needs and disadvantaged students. I want to see some summer provision for these students. Public health advice will be key to achieving this, and I am looking at what potential there might be for the running of existing programmes supporting children at the greatest risk of educational disadvantage. My Department is working closely with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla on this issue, and I will be meeting the Minister for Health in the coming days. I am very aware that this closure of schools has impacted hardest on families who have children with complex needs and whose well-being and engagement with learning depend very much on the routine of school and relationships with other students, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs. They have also lost out on specialist support during this closure period. I am conscious of the real risk of regression in learning among these children. I know their families place a high value on the traditional July provision programme. Unfortunately, due to the Covid-19 health crisis, it is not possible to deliver the normal July provision programme in the same way and at the same time as in other years. We are, however, exploring all options for a programme to run over the summer for children with the most complex needs. First, I need to be satisfied that the public health advice will support the running of such a provision. It must be safe to do it. Second, we need teachers, SNAs and schools to be in a position to do this. We have to be sure that teachers and SNAs are going to be able to provide a summer programme and that the necessary precautions to safeguard them properly can be put in place. Finally, while many parents will welcome the possibility of a summer programme, they too will have a real and genuine concern for the welfare of their children. We will need to engage closely with parents to ensure they will want to avail of such a programme. The primary aim of any programme will be to limit potential regression and learning, thereby ensuring, insofar as possible, that these children can reintegrate and transition into their planned education setting for next year with their peers.It is hoped to deliver this programme in July or August, public health advice permitting. The participation of schools, teachers and SNAs is critically necessary and it is for them to decide whether they wish to participate. I have already commenced consultations with stakeholders on the nature and scope of the proposed programme and these will continue for the next few weeks. Earlier today, I met AsIAm, Down Syndrome Ireland and the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. We had a very fruitful conversation and the importance of trying to do something while recognising the challenges involved made a big impression on me. Due to a communication difficulty, Inclusion Ireland did not participate but I will speak directly to it tomorrow.  Conversations such as that and our debate this evening are very beneficial in informing thinking in this area. It is important that stakeholders contribute such that any programme developed is relevant and meets the needs of children. As I stated at the outset, a significant amount of work is continuing in the education sector, with my Department leading and facilitating stakeholder engagement in the planning of our responses in various areas. We will continue to listen to proposals and concerns from stakeholders and to work collaboratively for all students.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a range of them and I will not get through them all, but I will ensure that Deputies will get individual responses and answers back to them. Deputy Ó Laoghaire raised a specific individual case and I will ensure that is replied to. The Deputy also has concerns around how the calculated grade process will work.The school-calculated grade is the primary process in determining the results of the individual students. That pressure is not singularly on the teacher. He or she will have to sit down with his or her teaching colleague within the school. If it is an art teacher and there is no colleague, that teacher will sit down with the deputy principal and the next part of the alignment process will go to the principal. There is a whole-school alignment process to ensure that the two years of the student's work will be measured and calculated in a way that is reflected in the professional judgment of the teacher. We have set up the new executive office because we have to have a process within the Department. I am very encouraged by the intensity of work that has happened already and that has brought us to this stage. Dr. Áine Lawlor will be a key person to ensure, along with others in the new office, that there is a standard. If the State is going to allow calculated grades to be used as a certified leaving certificate, which it will be doing, the likes of UCAS will demand a State certification, which is why there has to be a national standard. Schools in Bandon have to be treated the same way as schools in Boyle. The importance of the national standard is that all schools will be in a system and a process to ensure that the results that come from a school will be sacrosanct. Nevertheless, we have to have a standard because we cannot have some teachers marking leniently and others harshly. It is not just a case of students being downgraded. There is also a chance that they will be pulled up.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Feighan for raising the question and he is happy with the answer he received but I want to reassure him that the alignment process and all the detail around calculated grades is very technical. A lot of technical work went into it over the last week. Right up until today we have been working hard on it. Clarification around that will be published tomorrow. Deputy Carroll MacNeill asked about the issue of safety. That is at the heart of all of our deliberations. She is correct in pointing out that there will be individual cases with complex needs, including complex medical needs. One of the matters I encountered today when meeting the different stakeholders representing those with Down's syndrome and autism as well as the boards of management of special schools is that there is a big challenge to get this right. However, safety will be at the heart of all of our deliberations and anything we will try to bring forward in terms of a summer programme will also be directed by the public health advice. Deputy Carroll MacNeill also raised the issue of students with UCAS offers from UK universities. We are working towards a date for the results to come out that would be aligned to the traditional date of the leaving certificate.We cannot commit to a date yet because we have to start the process associated with the calculated grades. Once tomorrow's publication becomes available to all teachers, the process can start and then we can start working towards a specific date. I know from my conversations with the UK Secretary of State for Education, Mr. Gavin Williamson, as recently as yesterday, that there is a lot of collaboration. There will be flexibility within the whole third level sector, not just at home. Mr. Williamson was very clear he wants to work with us. There will be flexibility at an all-Europe level for our students who go to other EU countries. Deputy Higgins talked about the months of lost schooling, specifically regarding special educational needs. One of the main pieces of work I have been doing over recent weeks has been identifying these gaps. There is anecdotal evidence from parents that they are seeing a regression in their sons or daughters in some instances. Therefore, we will continue to try to have a summer programme that could help in combating those challenges. I will not get into the question of repeating examinations. What we want to do is ensure a transition, a stepping stone. A very clear message from the stakeholders today was that they want a transition. The summer programme could help in that regard. September will see a new approach. It may be different. Depending on the public health criteria, we do not want the vacuum from 12 March until September to be negative in any way for children with special needs. I will be happy to take details of the school mentioned by Deputy O'Dowd. The teacher-allocation process is independent but I will certainly get one of the inspectors to look specifically at the case. Deputy Durkan mentioned the 2020 class. I agree with him wholeheartedly in that the class should not be labelled in any way differently. That is why the leaving certificate the students will receive will be a State-recognised certificate, the same as last year and the year before. I note the Deputy’s point on planning for special educational needs. We have a planning department. It tries to take in as much information as it can, including from local authorities, in terms of houses being built and where it is projected there will be increases in population. The department has an almighty task but it tries to work with the best information possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy and join him in acknowledging the great innovative and creative work that is going on through distance learning. Obviously, it is not sustainable in the long run. The Deputy referred to how third level institutions have responded to this crisis. It has been incredible to watch the processes to continue learning remotely and to do examinations remotely as well. Within that there are gaps relating to technological inequity as well. The Deputy is correct that many students rely on hospitality and summer jobs. Those jobs will not be available this summer. Interestingly, however, there has been much debate in the House in recent years about how the money students generated was used against them when they were trying to apply for grants. I acknowledge the Deputy is referring to the entire cohort. There is a fear around the SUSI grant in that it was determined on 2019 income by parents. The circumstances have changed and that will have to be taken into consideration. I take the Deputy's concerns about the grading calculation system on board as well. From tomorrow the guidelines will be available and teachers will have a roadmap for the processes. Hopefully, that will help. I will ensure that, at the heart of all of the deliberations of the new executive office that has been set up, the principles of fairness and equity will remain central to all deliberations. The Deputy asked questions regarding another language and leaving certificate grades outside of school and tutors. We are going to look at those on a case-by-case basis and this will be determined by the information provided by the student in terms of learning support. Maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh, tá an ceart ag an Teachta maidir leis an Aire atá freagrach as an gcinneadh sin, mo chomhghleacaí an tAire Stáit, Teachta Kyne. Bhí mé i dteagmháil leis agus tá a fhios agam go mbeidh drochthionchar agus aontaím agus táim cinnte de fosta, i mo cheantar Gaeltachta féin i nDún na nGall, go mbeidh an áit fholamh agus an bhearna maidir leis an airgead nach mbeidh ann. Maidir leis an gceist dheireanach, b'fhéidir go mbeidh freagra ar fáil uirthi ó mo chuid oifigeach.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy and take his points regarding his concerns about the new model of calculated grades. The Deputy raised the specific issue of school teacher allocation. We got the relevant information in the office today and I have asked for an inspector to make contact with the school. As the Deputy correctly pointed out, though, it is an independent process. One of the rigid features of the teacher allocation model is that it is based on numbers. There has to be a threshold. The Deputy's wider proposal of departing from that system and retaining everyone who is in place currently raises financial considerations. A number of Deputies including Deputy Ó Ríordáin have raised the issue of SUSI and the difficulties that families will have. These are indicative of the broader, wider and deeper questions that we as legislators in this House will be asked in the time to come. Everything will be different and parents are under pressure. The summer jobs that students used to have access to will not all be there. That is a major difficulty. Deputy Ó Ríordáin referenced the July provision. We are not able to implement it in the traditional way that parents are used to, but we are focused on trying to widen it if possible in a way that they are satisfied with and that stays within public health guidance. Regarding schools returning, people are seeing what is happening in Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Speaking as a parent, never mind as the Minister for Education and Skills, no one wants schools back more quickly than me. People want it to happen and their children to be in class, but at the heart of everything we do must be the question of whether it is safe. Advice changes as we move along, but the NPHET advice that we have currently is that schools should return in September. We want to put a proposal to NPHET in respect of special education and disadvantage, though. If possible, we would like to see some schools opening to provide the relevant school programmes. We are accepting and working towards the current advice that schools should not return until September, but the Taoiseach is anxious to have a full school programme for these students because he knows from the advice he is getting that there is a regression. Deputy Ó Ríordáin also referenced the Teaching Council.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will correspond with him concerning teaching courses.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am glad the Deputy raised that school again. I raised it last week as well. I have great memories of my visits there. It was involved in the P-TECH project. It was during an aside conversation with one of the teachers that I was told about that progression. The teacher spoke about the progression not just to university but to further education and training and apprenticeships. They are doing this year-on-year. I have made clear to my officials that all of the investment we are putting into disadvantaged schools and DEIS schools is to work on that progression. If there is a year-to-year progression in terms of those schools moving to stronger classes than they had the previous year, this goes back to the school alignment. A school, be that a geography teacher in Larkin community college or a maths teacher in my old school in Milford, will sit down with colleagues to work through the guidelines and procedures that they have to follow through as from tomorrow. There will then be an alignment with the principal and there will be an engagement looking at the progression of those individual students. The Deputy raised the good point, which I am glad he raised publicly tonight, that if schools are making year-to-year progress they should not be disadvantaged in any way. There are other examples in other schools. For example, a school that has introduced honours maths this year for the first time will have no comparable evidence. It is the year that is relevant in the school alignment process and it is the school results that are key here.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is the piece of work in which we are currently engaged. The post-primary stakeholders have been asked to make submissions. The majority of them have already done so. Those submissions raise queries in regard to what schools will look like in September under current health guidelines. The current NPHET distance requirement of 2 m does not allow for 30 students per classroom. We are also looking at how we make the classroom work for the students, how we make it work from a learning point of view, how we make it work for students with special educational needs, how we make it work for the SNAs in classrooms and how we address the issue of hand sanitisation and ensuring that schools are cleaned in advance and potentially on a daily basis. All of this means extra cost and potentially extra resources. We are working through all of this and we hope to have a roadmap at the earliest opportunity.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank all the Deputies who have raised the situation of fifth years. We have had individual contact from some of those students. We need to ensure we give whatever support we can to the class of 2021 because of their lost class time and their return in September with all the challenges ahead of us. We will prioritise them and put support systems in place to ensure that whatever time or parts of the curriculum they have lost, we work with them to make up what was lost. The detail of that is not a finished piece because we have to decide what schools will look like collectively. We are not yet in a position to do that, but I know from my contact and communication with the stakeholders that it is a piece of work we will continue to focus on.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I had a briefing on this issue prepared for me by the National Educational Psychological Service, so it is something we are going to be prepared for when schools go back in September and we will look at whatever resources are required. A lot of the suggestions made here tonight, be they in relation to pupil-teacher ratios, extra support for guidance counsellors or similar, are budgetary considerations. If there are changes to be made in regard to budgetary decisions for any individual Department, those decisions will have to be made by a Government with the proper governmental powers, including in terms of financial decisions, to make that happen. One of the things on which the Department has been very clear with me is in terms of the financial projections going forward. There is going to be a lot of extra money needed in a variety of areas to ensure we have a sustainable educational model into the future.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The meat on the bones will very much be determined by public health advice. We are going to come up with a summer programme and present it to health officials in terms of how it will look.One of the determining features of this process is to have the voices around the table. It was important to have Down's syndrome and autism represented today, as well as the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, the management body for special schools. Those organisations came back with many concerns regarding public health. We have many students with complex medical needs and we have to get this right from a health and safety perspective as well. Until we determine what it is going to look like, we will be presenting this proposal to public health officials and asking if we can do it. At the moment, however, we are looking at July or August, or it could be something that might involve some remote learning. We are also going to focus on trying to have some of the programme in centres or schools, but we are still working on that so that it will have not only the confidence of the teaching community but also of the parents.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this topic. He should not be hard on himself about it being 30 years since he did his leaving certificate. I am much older than he is; my leaving certificate was 31 years ago. This is an important issue. I know the school completion programme is something many young people would have availed of during the summer. When I say, therefore, that we are going to look at the July provision and special educational needs, we are also going to look at the whole area of disadvantage. We are going to build support during the summer for vulnerable groups that could potentially leave school as a result of this gap. We are going to continue to work on disadvantage as well as special education needs.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to say to Caoimhe and Rachel, through the Deputy, that fifth years are not being ignored. It is the subject of focus within the Department because many fifth years have lost out on curriculum time. No fifth year student had completed the curriculum for any subject in year one of what is a two-year programme. We are very conscious of that. I agree with the Deputy that it has been a massive disruption for them and the entire school cohort. On the issue of a review of the leaving certificate, as the Deputy will be aware, such a review is ongoing. What I would suggest to the likes of Caoimhe, Rachel and the Deputy is to join the many others who have made their commentary heard through the ongoing review of the leaving certificate. There is a process there and I encourage all those interested to use it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Berry for his question. A few schools that both the Ceann Comhairle and I would be familiar with were referenced in that last contribution, including Coláiste Íosagáin and the schools in Monasterevin and in Newbridge and the Curragh. Deputy Berry will enjoy great levels of co-operation from the Ceann Comhairle and Deputy Heydon, both of whom have been very strong on this. I want to reassure all three Deputies, who have been working very closely on this matter, that the building programme in place for this year will continue. In fact, the building unit in Tullamore put in an enormous effort to ensure that builders were back on site on Monday. They are in a number of the Western Building Systems schools as well. There is an opportunity over this period to deal with a lot of outstanding works that are required too. Any school projects that are in the pre-tender, tendering or tender award stage and any commitments that were made prior to the Covid-19 crisis are still in place. I also agree with the Deputy's point about trying to work our way out of this pandemic. It will be through work that we do so and we need to make sure that capital investment remains a firm priority.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	These are the wider questions we are all going to be grappling with in terms of how we adapt to this phenomenal disruption, not just within the economy but within society, and education is going to be part of that. Certainly, from the conversations I had on Monday with my European counterparts, I know every single country in the European Union is grappling with the same issues. With regard to special education, we are very lucky to have 125 special schools and an extra one - Danu Community Special School - came on stream last year. I accept there are challenges within those schools and we have to ensure that whatever support we bring in is line with the demands of the sector. The leaders within special education are very keen to have a holistic approach. One of the pilots I have set up operates in 75 schools and is something that special schools are very interested in monitoring. We cannot just have education working in a silo with regard to health because there are many medical complexities within these special schools. Many are fighting for nurses to be on campus but it has to be wider than that, and it has to include nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists. There has to be a holistic approach to education that ensures we are compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in that, irrespective of a person's intellectual or physical challenge or disability, each and every student should have the same opportunity as any other student in mainstream education. That is something we are working towards, although it is a complex piece of work. I know there was a debate during the election and reference was made to Canada, where a particular state closed all special schools. I do not believe in that philosophy and I think our 126 special schools play a pivotal role. In order for them to grow and get stronger, all the issues around staff-student ratios will be on the table in the future. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his questions and for his contribution last week.We have been deliberating on a number of areas that he raised then and he has returned to the issue of students doing leaving certificate subjects outside of school. It will be guided by the direction in the guidelines that will be published tomorrow. Schools and teachers will be given these guidelines and instructions. This is after a process of engagement where high-level discussions were going on since the end of last week and all weekend, right up to last night, with regard to the education stakeholders being happy with the guidelines for calculated grades. With regard to the Deputy's example of a subject being done outside of school, whether by a Spanish tutor, a music school or a music teacher where a student decides to take music outside of school, the detail on this to be published tomorrow will be that assessment can be made by tutors outside of the school but we will have specific cases that will be difficult, where students have been working and studying for the leaving certificate with no tuition and doing it from home. What we will do in this instance is look at every individual case and see whether there is any evidence to determine what the assessed result will be. The Deputy is correct to identify it again because it is a difficult area and it will be difficult to assess where there has been a complete absence of tutors or teachers. With regard to the physical buildings, if we are looking at a September reopening under the current medical and public health guidelines, potentially we are looking at a staggered return initially. We are looking at a lot of added costs in terms of hygiene and cleaning schools on a daily basis and ensuring provision of personal protective equipment or other resources. This is an area that we are working through. The submissions coming from the post-primary and primary stakeholders will form part of how we develop this. From the point of view of parents and students, we have to ensure this information is available at as early an opportunity as possible. I will ensure the communication channels are kept open through this House. If people want to contact me directly I am always open to this. The Deputy also asked about the July provision. I want to look at a programme of events this summer that will cover disadvantage and special educational needs. The engagement and consultation has started with the stakeholders. I am very keen to ensure parents of children with special educational needs have confidence in a summer programme. It will be optional, obviously. We will not put out a summer programme that is compulsory or that requires all students to be part of it. It will be optional and parents will have to have confidence.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, for small schools, I had an opportunity last budget to reduce the PTR for one, two, three and four-teacher schools. Fine Gael also committed to reducing the PTR in future budgets. Maidir le Gaelscoil na Laochra i mBiorra, chas mé leis an gceannaireacht uilig an bhliain atá imithe thart agus tá sé soiléir sa scoil agus sa cheantar seo go mbeidh an scoil seo iontach tábhachtach. Dá mbeadh aon sonraí nó rud ar bith eile de dhíth maidir le dul chun cinn na scoile sin beidh mé sásta teagmháil a dhéanamh leis an Teachta.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I assure Deputy Harkin that the momentum currently behind the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, CUA, for GMIT and for Mayo, Donegal and Killybegs, as Deputy Pringle will also be anxious to point out, is full steam ahead. It made considerable progress in the back end of last year and they will continue that work. It will be an important project. There has always been an historical link between Letterkenny Institute of Technology and Ulster University Magee. There has also been much collaboration with the higher level institutes in the north west. There is an historical relationship there. We have a memorandum of understanding, which we lodged within the Department. There is absolutely no reason one cannot have a dual process happening there with regard to collaboration on a cross-Border basis on one level and then building towards a technological university at another level. If we continue with those relationships on a cross-Border basis, it will benefit Sligo, Mayo and Galway as well as Letterkenny.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is a very important question. I assure Deputy Harkin that we are working on that and there will be further clarity tomorrow.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy and reassure him that, while there has been a fairly long journey in recent years with respect to Killybegs and its place within LYIT, one of the things I was always clear on was that if we were to tap into tourism and marine potential in the way we need to, we need to have a place such as Killybegs, which has a good track record in that regard. My commitment in my time as Minister for Education and Skills has been to ensure that Killybegs will remain at the heart of the future technological university. To reassure people in Killybegs and those working there, where sometimes they might have felt on the periphery of Letterkenny, they will now be between Sligo and Letterkenny in terms of the new technology.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I suppose. Killybegs has made a great contribution to date as part of the institution, not only given its historical track record of bringing through tourism, catering and all the other courses that have been worked on over the years, and it has a strong future. It certainly has my support. On the issues with SUSI grants, I will take all those suggestions on board. There has been a transformative change in education in recent weeks and months. Almost on a daily basis now, we deal with a new issue. If we think that an issue presented to us in the morning is the priority issue, the one in the afternoon will eclipse it and in turn will be eclipsed by another in the evening. There is no shortage of issues. I appreciate the interventions in the House. As I say to my officials, whether Deputies are in opposition, on another side of the House, in another party or an Independent, they have a role to play in trying to figure a way out of this. We will figure a way out of it but doing it on a collective basis is the most important thing.
