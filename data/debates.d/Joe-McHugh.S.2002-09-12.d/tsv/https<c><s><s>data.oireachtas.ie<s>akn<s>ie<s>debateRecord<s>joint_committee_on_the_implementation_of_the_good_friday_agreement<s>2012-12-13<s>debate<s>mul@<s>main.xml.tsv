JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Lady Sylvia Hermon, MP, Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, Deputy Regina Doherty, Senator McAleese and, I believe, Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, MLA, to whom I spoke yesterday.  Are there apologies from anyone else?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask people to switch off their mobile telephones, if possible.  If they are on silent and left on the ground, they allegedly do not interfere.  There is a danger in leaving them on the ground.  I left mine down once.  Be careful when standing up.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our first item for discussion is the work of Youth Work Ireland and Youth Action Northern Ireland, YANI, in supporting young people.  I am delighted they are present in a joint capacity.  Youth work is an area in which I am interested as a former youth worker and community development worker.  Our guests are speaking to the converted.  Given the community and civic work done by the committee's members, they undoubtedly have an interest in this issue.  I am pleased to welcome from Youth Work Ireland Mr. Patrick Burke, CEO, Mr. John Gilmore, president, and Mr. Michael McLoughlin, head of advocacy and communications.  From YANI, I welcome Ms Caroline Redpath and Mr. Martin McMullan, assistant directors.  I have a great preamble ready about what the organisations do, but I will discard it as the delegates will give a presentation on the good work in which they are involved.  I advise delegates that when I invite them to make their presentations, they will be protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Before I call on Mr. Gilmore to start proceedings, I will give the delegates an idea of the committee's approach.  We sit once a month, but we also do a bit of outreach work and try to visit Northern Ireland.  Recently, we visited Unionist, loyalist and Nationalist communities in east, north and south Belfast.  We still need to conduct an evaluation, which we will do in private session after today's presentations.  Our visits were interesting.  We are concerned about the issues on the ground.  While driving home to Donegal last Thursday, I came across 16, 17 and 18 year olds in Omagh.  Matters are not pigeon-holed into Belfast.  We are quite concerned about the entire dynamic and questions will be asked at this meeting in that regard.  I invite Mr. Gilmore to make his presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegates for their presentations.  Ms Gildernew and Deputy Frank Feighan are offering.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are under pressure timewise.  We have hurled a ball in there which probably does not work.  I suggest one person respond from each group but if somebody else wants to come in, we will not be too strict.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you.  I am delighted everybody was able to be here.  It is good to see the dynamic and to see the different dynamics between youth work in Northern Ireland and southern Ireland.  Northern Ireland was ahead of the posse in terms of professional youth work courses, and Jordanstown would have been a pioneer in that area.  Many youth workers from the South had to go to Jordanstown.  That has all changed, thank God.  It is good there is interaction now.  If there is anything with which our guests feel we as a committee can help in regard to issues around sectarianism and the work our guests are doing on a cross-community and jurisdictional level, our door is always open to them.  Thank you all very much.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Michael D'Arcy to the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  He was commissioned to do some work for the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  I am delighted that Andy Pollack is here today.  He is the inspiration behind it and he is very welcome.  Mr. Pollack has entrusted Mr. D'Arcy to get the message out about what the Centre for Cross Border Studies is aspiring towards as well as the range of work undertaken.  Mr. D'Arcy might use this as an opportunity for a good, interactive question and answer session.  There will be many questions from the members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. D'Arcy.  This is a scoping study containing ten areas which have been identified.  I will list the areas for the benefit of members.  They are, work and jobs from economic growth; the single energy market; off-island tourism research projects; cross-Border health service provision plan; the case for a cross-Border economic development zone - this will be of interest to Border Deputies; higher education initiatives between third level institutions; North-South co-ordination on treated water; memorandum of understanding on all 21st century infrastructure upgrades; Ireland's EU Presidency - a vehicle for the North-South collaboration will be the North-South Ministerial Council; and a practical system-wide support for public sector managers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious there may be a vote at 2 p.m. so I will take a group of questions together.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask for a seconder for Ms Gildernew's proposal.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I take the Deputy's point.  Perhaps Mr. D'Arcy and Mr. Pollack would agree to return on another day to explore the report further.  We can discuss the issue among ourselves at the end of the meeting.  I agree that further consideration is desirable.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We should keep this strictly professional, Senator.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Senator's suggestion is a good one.  I am sure Mr. D'Arcy will refer in his response to Tourism Ireland and the work it is doing.  A division has been called in the DÃ¡il.  I propose that the meeting be suspended to allow Deputies to vote, after which Mr. D'Arcy will have an opportunity to give a comprehensive reply to points raised by members.  This is preferable to asking him to respond in the two or three minutes available before the vote.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Mr. D'Arcy might like to engage with the Senators in our absence.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are now resumed in public session.  I think we have broken the world record for having had the longest time to reflect on questions and therefore I am sure we will be inspired by Mr. D'Arcy's contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As much as the members, including me, would like to contribute further, we must acknowledge that we are under pressure as there is another meeting.  The delegation has been more than welcome.  We must really consider how we follow up on the economic side.  Mr. D'Arcy's message is a refreshing intervention.  He has asked us to determine exactly how we take stock of what is occurring.  We certainly value his input.  I look forward to reading the report.
