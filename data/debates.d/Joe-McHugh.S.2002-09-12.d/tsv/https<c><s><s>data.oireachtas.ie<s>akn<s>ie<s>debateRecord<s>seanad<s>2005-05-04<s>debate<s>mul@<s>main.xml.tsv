JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I also welcome this legislation, as is proper for anything that deals with safety on the sea. I did not have an opportunity to speak because my colleague Senator Feighan took this Bill through the Seanad previously. As good as this legislation is from bureaucratic and administrative points of view, there is a serious problem with people who are now preparing for the summer by purchasing jet skis. These young and not-so-young people have the waterways of Rossnowlagh, Downings and Portsalon in mind.How far does this legislation extend to stopping these activities at their source? Perhaps there are provisions within the legislation to monitor people who sell jet skis. Will there be provisions to monitor who ends up with the jet skis and whether they are under age or over age? Where is the enforcement in this Bill? There are good and competent people jet skiing and I have no problem saying I know some who act in a responsible manner. They do not jet ski on waters where the public is swimming at the time.I ask the Minister of State to keep in mind the fact that there are no regulations governing jet skis and no identifiable numbers on such vehicles which indicate their ownership. There are no mandatory training courses for jet skiers to complete, yet jet skis are as dangerous as cars. Not all car drivers are irresponsible, but some are. Some car drivers decide to wake their neighbours at 3 a.m., some drivers do doughnuts and hand brake turns at Mount Errigal at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. However, they are only a small percentage of car drivers.Similarly, there is a small percentage of jet ski users who are irresponsible. My concern is that there are no mandatory training courses for users and no adequate regulations governing the purchase and ownership of jet skis and the same is true of power boats. It might be possible to cordon off areas off the Atlantic coast for people who wish to use jet skis in a competent and responsible manner.There is a need for stringent legislation at the point of sale. An individual can purchase a jet ski for â‚¬8,000 without any proof that he or she is capable of piloting the vehicle or has taken part in a training course. Currently, a person can buy a jet ski, put it on the back of a tractor, take it to Downings beach and head off into the wild open seas. There is nothing to prevent a person from doing that at present. This can cause grave problems for others in the sea, particularly swimmers. It also leads to a situation where all jet ski users are tarred with the same brush and assumed to be incompetent and inconsiderate.The novice jet skier is naive and has no idea of waves or when the tide will turn. There should be mandatory courses and strict regulation at the point of sale. Vendors also need to take some responsibility in this area. There are responsible jet skiers and power boat owners who are crying out for stiff penalties for misuse of such vehicles. They are also calling for some regulation between the point of sale and the point of putting a jet ski into the water.
