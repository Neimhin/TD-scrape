JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Ms Pauline McCabe and Mr. George Richardson to the committee. I will make full introductions following a minute's silence as requested by the committee members to mark the sad passing of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Pauline McCabe is the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman and will talk to the committee about that role and its context today. She will also discuss the rights of prisoners in Northern Ireland and the reform process within prisons there. I advise members that the Prisoner Ombudsman is fully independent of the Northern Ireland Prison Service and her task is to carry out investigations arising from prisoner complaints to her office. The independence and impartiality of her office is paramount to its effective functioning. As such, Ms McCabe is not in a position to comment on specific individual cases. I ask members to bear that in mind in their questions. I am also aware that the ombudsman has had some contacts with the Prison Service here in the South and I would welcome hearing her ideas on cross-Border co-operation and issues of shared concern for both jurisdictions. Before I call on Ms McCabe to make her presentation, I advise her and Mr. George Richardson, director of operations of the Northern Ireland Prisoner Ombudsman, that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease to make remarks on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only comments and evidence related directly to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Ms McCabe to make her presentation. The committee is very appreciative of the fact that she has given her time to attend. From reading background information, I understand that Ms McCabe is involved in very sensitive work. We appreciate that. Her organisation is looking forward to having more statutory functions in the next year. We look forward to her analysis in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Ms McCabe, for that comprehensive analysis. Some Members are under pressure of time. With the agreement of the committee, people can indicate if they are under pressure. I realise there is another event on this morning. I welcome the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade in attendance today. I call Deputy Daly.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take questions in groups of two. The protocol is for members to go first.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In light of the number of issues Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan has raised, perhaps Ms McCabe might like to deal with them before we proceed to deal with the questions of other members who are offering.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, to be followed by Deputy Crowe and Senators Jim D'Arcy and White.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will call you again, Deputy, but the two Senators have indicated.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms McCabe for her openness on this delicate and sensitive issue. We appreciate the work in which she is involved in a constantly evolving environment, which hopefully is evolving in the right direction. I have two questions. The ombudsman referenced the importance of cross-community representation among prison officers, as it is conducive to a more positive environment. How important is balanced cross-community representation in the recruitment of prison officers, if they are being recruited at present? Second, having read the United Kingdom commission's proposal on a Bill of Rights for the United Kingdom, I noted there were many references to prisoners' rights. One of the outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement is a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland. How important is a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland in respect of prisoners' rights and the work in which the ombudsman is involved?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is it just a case that members of, say, the Catholic community are not coming forward for interview and are not even applying?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Has recruitment in this present round closed?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the members of the committee for their contributions and Mr. Richardson for his presentation. We appreciate Ms McCabe's presence and her openness on this issue. The committee would like to stay in touch with her. She should feel free at any stage to contact us. We will be monitoring her good work.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement.
