JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht an ábhair fíor-thábhachtach seo a ardú inniu. As the Senator may be aware, the report of an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on island development chaired by the then Minister of State, Mr. Donal Carey, in 1996 presented a strategic framework for developing the offshore islands of Ireland. The report made a number of recommendations to the Government, with the aim of supporting island communities in their economic and cultural development, preserving and enhancing their unique cultural and linguistic heritage and providing island communities with access to adequate levels of public services so as to facilitate full participation in the life of the nation. The report also recognised that access was the single most important issue facing island communities. At the time, the number of lifeline ferry services supported by the State was very limited. There was undoubtedly a need for action to correct this deficiency and during the years the number of services to the islands has grown. Now my Department funds 23 services to 19 islands. Included in these are passenger ferry services, cargo ferry services and air services. The budget for these services has increased since I came into office and as part of budget 2016 the allocation available for these services will be increased again in 2016, from €5.9 million to €6.631 million.  In addition to providing transportation services, my Department endeavours to assist islanders and island life in other ways. During 2015 my Department reached an agreement with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government on the funding for development offices on non-Gaeltacht islands. This funding enabled them to continue delivering vital services and to improve the quality of life for the residents of the islands. Through the increased allocation available to me in 2016, I will be providing assistance for these vital services. During the years my Department has improved harbour infrastructure on the islands and corresponding harbours on the mainland. The largest project ever undertaken on the Irish islands, the €45 million redevelopment of Cill Ronain Harbour, a harbour of significant regional importance which handles in the region of 300,000 passengers annually, was constructed with major investment by my Department. While the capital budget available to me has decreased significantly, assistance is still provided for relevant local authorities for focused works on the islands, particularly directed to issues of safety. As the Senator may be aware, there have been issues regarding the renewal of the public service obligation contract for air services to the Aran Islands. I am pleased to announce that since earlier this week my Department has agreed an interim contract with Galway Aviation Services Limited for the provision of an air service for the Aran Islands from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2016. Under the interim contract, the Department will subsidise the same level of service as it did under the previous contract. The Department, in conjunction with the Office of Government Procurement, will in the coming period proceed to undertake a new procurement process in accordance with national procurement rules and EU Regulation 1008/2008 in order to agree a four-year contract for the air service. Obviously, a re-engagement with the island communities will happen side-by-side with that process. My Department consults island communities on a regular basis. I have visited many of the offshore islands since my appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for the islands. In the past 12 months I tried to go to the islands I had not visited previously. I have had the pleasure of being on the Aran Islands, but I had not been to places such as Sherkin Island, Bere Island, Owey Island in my own county, Tory Island, Inishbofin and Gola Island. I tried to get to as many of the islands as possible that I had not been to before. Funding for vital access services to the islands has been maintained by my Department throughout the recent economic downturn and it is my intention to continue with this support in the future. However, I am very aware of the need to get value for money in order that the funding available will reap the maximum benefit for all island communities. The Senator will also be aware of the need to comply with national and EU law in providing various supports for the islands. My Department will continue to adhere to the relevant regulations and guidelines, while at the same time ensuring as far as possible that all island communities are assisted in their efforts to get the services that are sometimes taken for granted on the mainland. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadoir as ucht an ábhair seo a ardú. I thank the Senator for her remarks. We can all agree that the islands are a unique and valued part of our community. My Department will continue to support the island communities in their economic, social and cultural development in order to preserve and enhance their unique heritage and to enable the islanders to secure access to public services in order that they can have full and active participation in the overall economic and social life of the nation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I again thank the Senator for her observations and suggestions. She is correct in saying there are always ways in which we can be creative in accessing necessary funding that could have a direct impact on the lives of those living on the islands. I visited Árain Mhór in the last ten days, with the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar. We got a great insight into the provision of health services there and the importance of such services to islanders. The issue is one of having a direct impact, of which a lot of projects at a European level are capable. The Senator will be aware of the AranLIFE project on the Aran islands, funding for which was secured from the European Union to the tune of approximately €2.5 million. That project is having a very positive impact. The Senator also mentioned agriculture. She may be aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, has made special provision for the islands in the new round of single farm payments. The islands have been considered in that context. I agree with the Senator in her point that any policy measure that may impact on the islands must be proofed. I continue to engage with Comhdáil Oileáin na hÉireann and will meet that organisation again next week. Consultation is important and has taken place in the past 12 months. That said, if there are new ways of doing things, I am certainly open to considering them.  We must also be conscious of investments for different islands. On Tory Island, for example, we are investing €250,000 in the development of a helipad, which will be a very welcome infrastructural addition to the island. There are smaller islands, including Inishbofin, Gola and Owey, for example, which do not have a ferry service. They are seeking such a service, especially during the summer, given that tourist numbers are increasing at such an enormous rate along the Wild Atlantic Way. There are development opportunities and it is important that we engage with them on them. There is a meeting arranged with the smaller island representative group in a few weeks time. There are plenty of issues involved. I acknowledge the role of the leadership on the islands. During the recent negotiations on air services to the Aran Islands, a number of public meetings were held and approximately 18 politicians from the mainland attended them. The meetings were very dignified. I received feedback from different people who said the meetings had been dignified and well measured and that there was much leadership shown on the island. I acknowledge that leadership. I also acknowledge the new transparent and independent process in which full responsibility is given to the Office of Government Procurement in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and which leaves me outside that process. It is important to acknowledge the professional work that was done by the officials of the Office of Government Procurement and the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor's office. Where there probably was a political weakness was that I was precluded, as Minister of State, from saying anything during the process. The advice from the Chief State Solicitor and the Attorney General was that it was better to say very little in case it would prejudice the process.  This is a new system which was only introduced in 2014. If there are lessons to be learned, let us look at them in terms of the needs of the community and islands. On the other hand, we all have a responsibility and duty to the taxpayer and a responsibility to due process. The public is very much of the opinion that politicians should not be involved in that process. This is a new process. Politicians are completely outside of the process in terms of the decision and the outcome. If there are lessons to be learned from the past five to six months, let us look at them and see what we can try to do differently. As a former community worker, I am a big advocate of ensuring that at the centre of any consultation is the community and its needs. We have a duty, as legislators, to have a very strict adherence to process and do things right and also to ensure savings are made because we have a duty to the taxpayer. All of that is in the mix and no doubt it will form part of the conversation on the new tender process in the future.  I again thank the Senator for raising this matter. It has given me an opportunity to talk a little about the process. Key to any future deliberation on policy or policy change on the islands is that the communities have to be at the heart of it. The officials in my Department are very conscious of the work they are doing. They have been very proactive in providing services. One can see the number of cargo ferries that we have provided on the islands and they do a very professional and thorough job. I acknowledge my officials for the work they do on an ongoing basis. As we go forward with the new tendering process, we will, no doubt, have a very proactive and engaged conversation between the island communities, my own officials and officials of the Office of Government Procurement to ensure we continue to provide the service for the islands. Keeping that service was critical to the process. The officials in the Department were very conscious of this from the beginning.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	The proposed amendment clearly refers to prospecting and retention licences. As I said during the previous discussion, prospecting licences are already subject to a two-year review process. It is intended that retention licences will be treated the same. These reviews are not a box-ticking exercise. Work carried out in the period under review is scrutinised by professional experts on the staff of the Department to ensure compliance with best practice and meeting commitments. Work programmes for the next review phase are also revaluated. Quite apart from the formal reviews, of course, the technical staff of my Department maintain contact with the licencees throughout the licence term and keep apprised of developments. Site visits are also undertaken as part of this process. Mining licences are also kept under review in accordance with the terms of the licences and, particularly for the main underground and surface operations, inspections by an independent qualified mining engineer are carried out twice per year. The Senator raised a separate issue in regard to old operations which it is claimed are not being worked. I do not want to discuss particular cases, but I believe it is not a licensing issue but, rather, relates to the question of excepted minerals. These are mines that were being worked in 1978 and which were registered by the Mining Board as excepted from the statutory vesting in the Minister of the right to work minerals that was contained in the 1979 Act. The Bill contains provisions that will on enactment automatically cancel all those registrations. If a deposit of formerly excepted minerals is still genuinely being worked, the operators will have an opportunity to apply once again to the Mining Board to retain the excepted minerals status, but this will be done only if the operator makes an application within the prescribed period and if the Mining Board is satisfied that the minerals are being worked and worked efficiently. We have had a discussion on this issue and I acknowledge the Senator's concerns. It is a question of trying to create the difference between prospecting and exploration licences in respect of drilling. The process is not the same as that for a mining licence. There are two issues, namely, that of excepted minerals and that of the application process. As I stated on the last occasion, where a prospecting licence is given, exploration might just be a matter of evaluating the different types of rock or rock infrastructure in an area. It also could mean drilling. One could compare it to drilling for water. It could involve equipment of the same diameter as that used to drill for water, perhaps 5 cm to 6 cm. There still has to be a screening process which must take account of noise pollution and the impact on water tables. There are still screening parameters for a prospecting licence. My Department has the technical expertise to deal with these matters. The corollary is the application for the actual mining licence. This is a completely different ball game which involves going to the planning authority and taking responsibility. It requires environmental impact assessments and environmental impact statements by the company. A big part involves public consultation, whereby the public has an opportunity to make its voice heard on potential applications.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The amendment relates to section 82. We had a conversation on it on the last occasion. I shared the concerns raised on the sale of State assets. As discussed with Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh, it was never my intention to sell off any major deposit. We had a conversation on the definition on what was small and what was not. We had a conversation following the Senator's intervention the last day and considered the definition of "small" in this context. Having given the matter some further consideration, I am now prepared to accept the amendment.
