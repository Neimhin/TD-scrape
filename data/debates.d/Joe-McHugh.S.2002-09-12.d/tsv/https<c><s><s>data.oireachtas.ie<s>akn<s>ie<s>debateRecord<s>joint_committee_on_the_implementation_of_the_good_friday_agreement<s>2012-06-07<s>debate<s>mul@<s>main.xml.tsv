JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome both gentlemen to the joint committee.  I congratulate Mr. Nesbitt on his recent success in the leadership.  I wish him well.  No doubt he has hit the ground running.  I also acknowledge the presence of Mr. John McCallister, my colleague on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  It would be remiss not to mention our other colleague Mr. Jim Wells from the DUP, because he recently sat in Mr. Nesbitt's chair at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children.  Mr. Wells might have one up on him but they can work that out among themselves.I make the point for this reason.  Growing up in Donegal, as part of Ulster, 30 years ago this summer when Northern Ireland was playing in the 1982 World Cup, as a Donegal man I was supporting Gerry Armstrong and Martin O'Neill in their famous victory over Spain.  There is a connectivity there; an all-Ulster thing is going on.  My memories of unionism, be it DUP or UUP, was the single narrative of "Ulster says No".  That was what shaped my perception of Unionism.  It was a negative narrative but it has been usurped by their colleagues in Sinn FÃ©in who have borrowed the "No" narrative in many respects down South.  They can battle that out among themselves as well.Today I wish to acknowledge the proactive approach of Unionists to dialogue down South.  They are open for business and working on key issues we share, be it on health or transportation.  They see the importance of dialogue.  I acknowledge Mr. Nesbitt's party.  I am aware Mr. McCallister has been doing a lot of work behind the scenes.  While there may not have been many formal meetings, many informal meetings have taken place.  This is important.  It is about respecting not only the identity about which Mr. Nesbitt spoke but also acknowledging the importance of co-operation and communication.I have a question for Mr. Nesbitt on the North-South parliamentary forum, on which a working group is up and running.  We have been working towards its establishment.  That may not be its title; there might be conversations and negotiations on this.  However, much good work has been done in that regard.  The Government and I see it as having the potential to be a great mechanism for enhanced communication and dialogue.  However, the process has reached an impasse, but we are confident we will get over the hurdles.  Mr. Nesbitt might outline his party's position on the forum.Having spoken to many people in Northern Ireland who lived through the Troubles, I am aware that they have to deal with the past in their own way.  It can be a lonely journey for them, but there is unfinished business.  Mr. Nesbitt has mentioned that his party is reaching out to London and Brussels; the Parliament in Dublin is also interested in working with his party in dealing with many of the issues that affect many on both sides of the Border.
