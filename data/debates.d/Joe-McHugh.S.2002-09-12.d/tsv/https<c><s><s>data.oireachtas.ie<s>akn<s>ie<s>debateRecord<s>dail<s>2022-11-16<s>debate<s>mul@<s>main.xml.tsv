JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas as an seans labhairt faoin ábhar iontach tábhachtach seo. Mar atá a fhios ag an Leas-Cheann Comhairle, tá na bealaí difriúil sa tír seo. Mar shampla, ina contae féin, tá an bealach mór ann idir Átha Cliath agus Gaillimh. I gcontae an Aire Stáit, tá bealach ann idir Átha Cliath agus Luimneach, agus tá bealaí eile idir Corcaigh, Port Láirge agus Béal Feirste. Tá bearna mhór ann faoi láthair san iarthuaisceart, idir Doire agus Átha Cliath. Sin an fáth gur ardaigh mé an cheist seo faoi na rudaí tábhachtacha seo. The Minister of State is welcome. I am delighted he is here because I know that, as he represents Limerick, he will know the value and importance of connectivity. The things that motorists travelling from Limerick to Dublin will take for granted would be not to have cows on the road or tractors holding up traffic for 10 km or 20 km, which is the case in the north west. I appreciate the Minister of State being here. I ask him to use his influence in his position on two specific points, one being the A5. First, I acknowledge the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in regard to the shared island initiative, and there is reference to the A5 within the shared island programme. The Minister of State might update us on the public inquiry, which I believe is due to be held in January 2023, and it is hoped progress can be made after that. I also want to raise the issue of the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, bypassing Stranorlar and Ballybofey - the twin towns, the connectivity between Lifford and Letterkenny, and the Bunnagee link road. We have been waiting a long time for this companion link with the A5, for want of a different expression. It is important and it has to be delivered. These points have been highlighted, emphasised and re-emphasised for a long time. We can offer a serious counterbalance to Dublin and become a serious net contributor to the overall economy. A new motorway through the north west will provide modern electric charging stations, assisting in the reduction of carbon emissions. We have to try to ensure both of these projects are brought along in tandem. I know there is a strong, dedicated team working between Donegal County Council and that the national roads design office, NRDO, is also working on a business case. The Minister of State might have an update on that and, if not, he might provide that at a later stage. We have a new university in the north west. The Minister of State knows what has happened in Limerick over the past 20 to 30 years through having that university and having a strong presence of multinational companies and research and development.We are looking to the likes of Cork, Limerick and Galway to see how we can build on that.  Connectivity is key. When directors from major companies come to Donegal, they have to travel on a road that is not up to scratch. That is not right in terms of positive conversations. We now have a lot of remote working and an emphasis on healthcare. In my next contribution, I will raise the issue of tourism, which I know is close to the Minister of State's heart. I ask for an update on the A5 today, if possible. When will the public inquiry happen in the North? I want to acknowledge the team of workers in the Department for Infrastructure in the North, which is very focused on trying to bring the A5 to fruition. How can we advance the business case that dedicated team is working on? Will we move the two projects in tandem? They are really important for the north west and would be a massive game changer.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive response. I wish to acknowledge the preparation of the officials in TII and the Department of Transport because they provided important information. The questions I raised were answered and I am grateful for that. It is important that the public start to believe this can happen because given all of the delays and false dawns regarding the A5, people have stopped believing in the project. It is important to send out a positive signal, and I thank the Minister of State for doing that today. I thank the officials and, most important, the dedicated team in Donegal County Council which has worked hard on this for a long time. It is good to hear that a business case for submission under gate 1 of the public spending code will be made in quarter 1, which is just around the corner in 2023. This information is in the public domain, but it is good to hear in the Dáil that the public inquiry into the reopening of the A5 will happen in January 2023. I thank the Minister of State for providing that information. I said I would mention tourism because it is the lifeblood of my county and requires connectivity. The Irish Hotels Federation, IFH, has a lobbying day today in Buswells Hotel and will raise issues around the criteria for energy cost supports, insurance and the 9% VAT rate. It is an area close to the Minister of State's heart and any support he can give to the lobby session today would be welcome.  I met Aisling Arnold, of Arnolds Hotel, this morning. Dunfanaghy has a small population, yet this one hotel employs 100 people. That gives us an idea of the significance and importance of tourism to many small towns and villages in our county. Aisling was very keen to point out that the business supports available during Covid kept that small independent businesses open. However, a number of challenges are coming down the track. Arnolds Hotel is celebrating 100 years in business this year and will hold celebrations in January. Having such a legacy of tourism in the county is important and it is important that we hold onto it. Anything the Minister of State can do on energy cost criteria supports, VAT rate, insurance and road connectivity in order to keep small independent businesses alive would be welcome.
