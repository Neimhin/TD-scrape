JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister has heard the declarations from our colleagues.  He has five people from the Department of Finance or Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with him tonight.  He is in contact with the banks on a daily basis.  The Minister should give a commitment to farmers that they will have some sort of leverage regarding the interest.  That is what they seek today and the Minister should give that commitment.  It was not given today because people were in the banks today and they know nothing about it.  The Minister should use his leverage and influence on the banks because we have a role to play in easing off on the farmers.
