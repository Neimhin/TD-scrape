JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Tá mé ag súil go mór leis an obair atá romhainn maidir le cúrsaí forbartha idirnáisiúnta agus cúrsaí diaspóra. Tá mé ag súil go mór freisin le bheith ag obair le chéile le mo chomhghleacaithe ar an taobh seo den Teach agus le mo chomhghleacaithe éagsúla i dTeach Laighean. Ar nóta pearsanta, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta O'Brien mar ag an am a tháinig mé isteach i bpost Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta fuair mé cuidiú mór uaidh agus spreagadh freisin. Bhí mé fíorbhuíoch de mar bhí mé faoi bhrú agus bhí mé sa choirnéal. I will give this English language a go now. The Government is strongly committed to Ireland’s overseas aid programme and to its place at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy. The Government has restated this clearly in the programme for Government. The Government's policy for international development, One World, One Future, articulates clearly its commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance, ODA. The programme for Government sets out the Government's ambition to make progress towards the UN target as resources permit. It is important that such progress be made in a sustainable and manageable way that strengthens Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in providing humanitarian assistance and contributing to the fight to end global poverty and hunger. Since 2011, Ireland has provided more than €3.8 billion in ODA. This has involved significant annual contributions in excess of €600 million at a time of great economic difficulty. Over this time, the Taoiseach and Ministers have stated consistently that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target once economic conditions allow.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a major challenge in terms of financial resources to get to the 0.7% target. Moreover, as GDP widens, that percentage also narrows and consequently there are challenges in this regard. In this new era of new politics and new co-operation, I am open to working with Members to try to work out a way of moving towards this benchmark because it is an area of such great importance. Even during the period since 2011, some €3.8 billion has been spent in overseas aid on important work at both humanitarian and development levels. At what is a very early stage in this job, I have found that new methods of best practice are being introduced to try to draw a more effective linkage between humanitarian and development aid. Moreover, Ireland is perceived to be a world leader in this regard. At the humanitarian summit in Istanbul in recent days, it was obvious that the world is looking to Ireland for ways to try to make progress in this regard. I am open to ideas and to working with the Deputy on a more coherent roadmap to achieve the target.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That absolutely can be organised.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil leis an Teachta faoin gceist thábhachtach seo. The Global Island: Ireland’s Foreign Policy for a Changing World recognises clearly that climate change is one of the biggest global challenges of this century and that it is pushing more and more people in developing countries into poverty. My Department brings a strong development perspective across government to Ireland’s work on climate change and sustainable development. Our policy for international development - One World, One Future - prioritises action to address climate change for the poorest people in developing countries, in particular in the least developed countries. We recognise the importance of climate justice as noted in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which was signed by Ireland on 22 April at the United Nations in New York. One of the key principles underpinning the agreement is "the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities". This acknowledges the need for equity and requires action by all parties, big and small.  At the UN conference of the Convention on Climate Change in Paris last December, the Taoiseach committed that Ireland will commence contributions to the green climate fund in 2016 with a view to building up our support over the coming years. He also committed to increase our contributions to the least developed countries fund and to provide €175 million in international climate finance over five years. It is planned that this will largely be channelled through existing partnerships.  Given a number of effective financing mechanisms are provided for by the UN Convention on Climate Change, there are currently no plans to establish a new national mechanism to provide climate financing to developing countries. One of the leading advocates for climate justice internationally is our former President, Mary Robinson. I welcome her appointment this week by the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, as his special envoy on El Niño and climate. We look forward to working with Mary Robinson in this important new role.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can obtain information for the Deputy regarding the detail of when and how it will be paid. However, buying into the commitment is the most important factor. At the humanitarian summit earlier this week, humanitarian aid and development programmes were not discussed in isolation. Climate change, food security and conflict solutions were very much at the heart of the debate. We cannot anticipate some issues such as climate change but preparatory work is being done. With regard to the money that is being made available, a fixed amount is ring-fenced for ODA - €640 million for 2016. During our earlier discussion on this, we alluded to an additional €40 million, which is a significant amount in the context of reaching our 0.7% of GNP budgetary target, but it still does not go far enough. However, we have provided €3.8 billion in ODA since 2011, which is a lot of money. The money for this programme is additional to the ODA budget and I will get the detail of when it will be paid. I do not have that information to hand.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There have to be announcements but we may agree that the major challenge is delivering the money on the ground. We may have a solution in Ireland for countries in which there is significant conflict such as South Sudan but we need to find the solutions at local level. The EU promotes subsidiarity. There was a strong conversation among world leaders and UN officials on the solutions having to work from the bottom up on the ground. Many issues present an enormous challenge. A total of 60 million people have been displaced by conflict. An additional €15 billion is required for humanitarian assistance in the current period. There are many challenges and while we are focused on the country and on our constituencies, this has an impact at local level. I thank the Deputy for asking the question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Which question is that?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Achieving relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and agreement on a facility for future legal migration between Ireland and the US remains a priority for the new Government. Our embassy in Washington and consulates elsewhere in the US are active in advocating immigration reform and the issue is also regularly addressed in high-level political contacts between Ireland and the US Government. While in Washington for St. Patrick's Day, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met President Obama, Vice President Biden, House Speaker Ryan, Senator Charles Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle. During these meetings, they emphasised the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work on a bipartisan basis towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures. In his speech at the House Speaker's lunch at Capitol Hill, the Taoiseach addressed the issues of immigration reform and urged Republicans and Democrats to work together to address the concerns of the undocumented Irish in the US. The Taoiseach also spoke of the need for improved legal migration channels for those Irish people who wish to live, work and develop their skills in the US for a time and emphasised the exceptional contribution made by Irish people to American society over the course of centuries of shared history. Our embassy in Washington continues to closely monitor the progress of the judicial case on President Obama's executive actions on immigration reform. This case, which was brought by a coalition of US states seeking an injunction against the executive action, has now reached the US Supreme Court and it is expected that the court will declare its decision next month. If the appeal succeeds and the measure is implemented, the executive action could benefit a significant number of our citizens by lifting the threat of deportation and allowing those undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for more than five years and who have children who are US citizens or legal permanent residents to work and travel more freely within the United States.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House. 
 The new Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our embassy in Washington will continue to actively pursue all opportunities to advance immigration reform that would be of benefit to our citizens with the US Administration, both sides of the aisle in Congress and the US Embassy in Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree entirely that it is not good enough on the big days. There are lots of opportunities outside that. On Friday, I met Kevin Cullen from The Boston Globe. We have to look at a way of keeping up that engagement and keeping it consistent. There are many things outside our control such as the presidential election that is coming up. There is a loud debate on emigration, particularly on the Republican side, of which we are all aware. In the meantime, we can use our natural network with the United States and with people outside the Irish gene pool, such as Republican Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who introduced a Bill. We have advocates in people who are working in a very sensible way. While initially there was a wholehearted welcome of President Obama's executive action, there were weaknesses in it for many people. I am thinking of one man from my county who has no children so some people were left out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It works between America and Australia with the E3 visa so it is a sensible suggestion. There are cases where American citizens are having challenges getting visas in this country. We have to be constructive and sensible about it. There are things we can do on this side of the pond; it is not just a one way street. I look forward to working with the Deputy on it. There are many people from different parties that have a very strong interest in this issue. It affects us all. There are people in other constituencies who have children in America who cannot come home and are worried about attending potential funerals or a wedding and they know they cannot be part of it. We all know the difficulty.
