JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I will take the slot on islands. I do not have responsibility for births, deaths or marriages but I certainly have islands.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was on Sherkin on Thursday. I acknowledge that this specific issue was raised again. The islanders and the community down there have great plans for a digital economy yet are without the basics of a phone line. It is not acceptable. It is outside our hands, it is a matter for Eir, but I certainly will make formal contact with it again. The company indicated that it would do it last Friday but obviously that has not happened. It is a matter of priority. I acknowledge the great work that is being done on Sherkin Island and the councillors there are also doing absolutely tremendous work.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ably assisted by the Deputies and Senators as well.
