JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an choiste fáchoinne an seans labhairt leis inniu ar an ábhar iontach tábhachtach seo. I thank members of the joint committee for the early opportunity to brief the committee on the proposed amendment to the Student Support Act 2011. I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who will take the committee through the specifics of the proposed amendments. My Department prepared a statement, which has been provided to the committee, but I would like to add to it. As a Donegal person, I am particularly conscious of the impact of Brexit not only in the daily lives of people living along the Border but of its potential impact on education. I am also conscious of the work-in-progress that has happened in the past two decades through the Good Friday Agreement.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was a Brexit briefing. This is just a short introduction. A Brexit briefing was prepared. We will make sure it is circulated.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Apologies for that. With regard to the role education has played in the development of peace on this island, the most recent statistics for the 2015 to 2016 academic year on cross-Border student flows indicate 2,195 students from Ireland were studying in Northern Irish higher education institutions, of whom 1,135, or 52% of the total, were pursuing undergraduate programmes. Interestingly, the number of Irish students in the South declined by 38% in the five years leading to the 2015 to 2016 year. In contrast, the number of Northern Irish students studying in Irish higher education institutions increased by 24% over the same time period. Numerically, the figure stood at 1,200, with 980, or 82% of the total, pursuing undergraduate programmes. This is only part of the picture. In the 2017 to 2018 academic year, more than 10,000 students from the Republic of Ireland were in UK higher education institutions, with more than half pursuing undergraduate programmes for the first time, while a further 44% were undertaking postgraduate studies. In the same year, there were 2,426 students from the UK in Irish higher education institutions, with 63% of these doing undergraduate studies. Clearly, not all of these students are eligible for SUSI supports. In the 2017 to 2018 academic year, 1,475, or 14%, of the Irish students attending UK higher education institutions were in receipt of a SUSI grant, which amounted to €5.2 million. In terms of the number of UK students in Irish higher education institutions, 205, or 9%, were eligible for the SUSI grant. This amounted to €720,000. Since my appointment, my goal has been to protect the valuable and rich co-operation that takes place between educational institutions on a North-South and an east-west basis. There are examples of this at all levels. I look at the north-west strategic partnership, where Letterkenny Institute of Technology and Donegal Education and Training Board work closely with the University of Ulster and North West Regional College from the North to ensure further and higher education provision are closely aligned with the skills and industrial needs of the region. In many senses, the Border does not figure as these educational institutions seek to develop a shared education and skills strategy. It is important to acknowledge the commitment of those educators at all levels who have built collaborations across the Border. They deserve commendation and our appreciation. The foundations they have built must be protected and strengthened. Indeed, there has been a shared education ecosystem between Ireland and the United Kingdom since the foundation of the State and even before that. It is hugely important that we protect and preserve this collaboration in the interests of our young people and in the interests of the quality of our education and training system. In this regard, we are working to maintain the common travel area, which will protect much of the valuable and rich co-operation that takes place in education on a North-South and an east-west basis. The Minister of State with responsibility for higher education and I view the amendment that is the focus of today's engagement as one of the key responses of the Department to the challenges of Brexit. It will facilitate student mobility between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the wider UK, and enable me to meet education obligations under the common travel area. I will now ask the Minister of State with responsibility for higher education to take the committee through the proposed amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State and I will answer the questions between us. We must be very clear at the outset that we cannot answer many of the questions relating to Brexit. There are a lot of hypothetical questions such as what happens if it is a disorderly or orderly Brexit. Regardless of which it is, this legislation will still be needed. We will still need to change the legislation either way. Deputy Thomas Byrne asked why students from Northern Ireland will not be treated the same as French or Spanish students. Part of the Brexit deal between the European Union and the UK, which was accepted at Westminster, was that there would be provision within the backstop to ensure that there would be singular alignment. That was not accepted by the UK. Discussions are ongoing as to where that will take us. Central to what we are doing here is the protection of the common travel area. That is sacrosanct in every piece of work we do, whether it is on a North-South or east-west basis. The key mechanism for that is the Good Friday Agreement. At all times, whether it was Declan Kelleher and his colleagues in Brussels or officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Good Friday Agreement had to be protected in all its parts. Part of that was the flow of students, wherever they wanted to study, workers' mobility and so on. We are in a position where we do not know what will happen in the next six weeks. We must be vigilant but one thing is sure, as someone who comes from Donegal, we cannot contemplate going back after the great work that has been done over the past 20 years with communities coming together. Education has been an integral part of that. It could be students who can now do a joint course between Queens University Belfast and LyIT, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, or students being able to do a combined course between the Ulster University in its Magee campus in Derry and Letterkenny. These are practical examples of education transcending any kind of physical border. Our duty is to ensure that we protect this.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the first week of January, we announced that the fees would be protected. Deputy Funchion also asked what would happen with fees. We have made a commitment for the coming year from September, for the duration of the course. I know the question is what about the following year-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	-----we have committed to protecting students who are coming from the North-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	----- in relation to the €3,000 contribution.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am confident that with the change in this legislation we will be in a position to do that. It is very important to highlight that at all times we will encourage the continued movement of people whether it is North-South or east-west. However, we do not know what will happen within the next six weeks. This legislation is quite clear in what it is attempting to do, namely to ensure that the SUSI grant, the student support scheme that is in place, will continue next year.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have to create that platform, first, but also create a pathway to ensure that there is more continuity. That is where I would like to be after whatever happens over the next six weeks, so that it is not on a year-to-year basis----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, but the decision that we made in January was to provide certainty for parents. Our job is to secure agreement on all of these matters including child support and the common travel area.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are trying to solve the big question here, namely the common travel area. This legislation relates to the student support scheme. Once we have some certainty in the next six weeks, whatever the outcome-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To reiterate, there was a vacuum or uncertainty in January. I had to move really quickly to provide certainty to the parents in Northern Ireland. I met one of the mothers in Belfast two weeks ago. She said they had been in a very bad place because they did not know whether the student contribution fee of €3,000 was going to be protected.What will happen in the following two years is a reasonable and fair question. It was asked in the Dáil where I answered the Deputy's question. I will be happy to work with him to ensure we bring that certainty to the matter in the future. In the first week of January I had work to do for September. I did it to bring that certainty to the matter. If the question is whether we have to move on from it, I am happy to do so. The Horizon 2020 programme is within the remit of the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation. Nevertheless, Erasmus+ is an important programme, under which more than 30,000 students are studying in the United Kingdom. Discussions are ongoing on the matter which will not require any legislative change. On the issue related to the Middletown Centre for Autism which was raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan in the context of Brexit, the Department of Education in Northern Ireland is anxious to protect the work of the centre and the service it provides for children on the island of Ireland. I share its determination in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will pick up on the point made by Deputy Naughten. If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of March, the UK's participation in Erasmus will prove to be a difficulty. Obviously, we are working on every potential outcome and this legislation regardless of whether Brexit is disorderly or orderly. The Deputy also asked about the decline in numbers in terms of the North-South element. I raised this question during my first fortnight in the job. I have looked at those trends. Traditionally, many students from my county would have studied engineering in the likes of Queen's University Belfast and Ulster University in Jordanstown. That would have been a traditional route. Capacity is built around the IT sector. I know the likes of Letterkenny Institute of Technology in my county, Dundalk Institute of Technology or GMIT in the Deputy's county, which aspire to and are applying to become technological universities, have strengthened the choice available as well. I know many Irish students go to Europe. I am looking at the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, support we give to Bulgaria, which is more than 81,450. The Netherlands is the highest at 349,473, so there is a lot of movement of Irish students to Europe as well. The major piece is the number of students from Northern Ireland coming south. There is a piece of work that needs to be done there in terms of why that is happening. It is obviously down to choice - parental or student choice - but I would like to do a piece of work on that as to why that is happening. It would be important.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know there are areas that have not been identified in terms of apprenticeships, but I know from speaking to different agencies and even at a local level from speaking to members of SOLAS that they are looking at new initiatives and there is an appetite for it. A recent study has shown that employers, particularly multinational companies, are equally satisfied with people coming from either higher education or apprenticeships, so they value them.There is still a piece of work that we can do together but there are agencies and different organisations looking at new apprenticeships. That will evolve as time moves on.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Byrne asked when the legislation would be completed. Hopefully, that will happen by the middle of March. Deputy McLoughlin asked what protections are in place for parents and students. He also spoke about certainty for students who want to study in Coleraine or some other institutions in Northern Ireland.The job we are trying to do here is very specific. We are trying to minimise disruption and in doing so we are ensuring that disruption to any movement thus far, be it in preschool or at primary, secondary or third level, is minimised. We also want to build on the contribution education has made to the movement and mobility of people through the Good Friday Agreement. That is the space in which we find ourselves. Deputies spoke about fees. We have moved to ensure that the contribution of €3,000 for students from the North who want to come south is in place for September and for the duration of their course, whether it is a three-year, five-year or six-year degree. While this is ongoing - to go back to Deputy Byrne who feels his question was not answered - discussions on an overall agreement continue. This will involve the common travel area and trying to come up with an agreement. Going back to Deputy Byrne again, any future fees in the 2021-22 or 2023-24 years will be decided in the context of that agreement. While this is all ongoing, the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, is in discussions, as are my officials and I, with the Department for Education in the United Kingdom on getting certain principles agreed surrounding the protection of education in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, North-South and east-west. I am not in a position to say what will happen after the end of March, but our job and duty as legislators is to ensure we do everything to minimise that disruption. To respond to Senator Gallagher's question about what we are doing to ensure we attract more international students, we are examining this issue and engaging comprehensively with our EU counterparts. We are part of the European Union. Someone from Boston has no problem travelling to California or elsewhere on the west coast of America to study. Irish students are now going to Bulgaria, France, the Netherlands and Italy. If we can have a reciprocal arrangement, our doors are open. To give the committee another example, by 2021 we will have lifted the derogation on the Irish language in the European Union, after which time an Irish student with three languages - English, Irish and French, English, Irish and German or English, Irish and Italian, for example - will be able to apply for interpreter and translator jobs. If the UK is not in the European Union, that will obviously give us an added advantage.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. Táim an-sásta a bheith anseo os comhair an choiste chun labhairt faoi ráiteas straitéise úr mo Roinne. Táim an-bhuíoch don Aire Stáit ar a bhfuil freagracht as an ard-oideachas, Teachta Mitchell O'Connor, as a bheith i mo theannta inniu. Mar is eol do bhaill an choiste, bhí dualgas orm agus ar mo Roinn ráiteas straitéise úr a fhorbairt taobh istigh de sé mhí ón dáta a ceapadh mé mar Aire sa Roinn. Nuair a bhí mé os comhair an choiste cheana féin, gheall mé dó go dtiocfainn ar ais chun labhairt leis faoin ráiteas straitéise úr agus chun deis a thabhairt do na baill a dtuairimí agus a moltaí a chur chun cinn. Ní féidir liom a rá go mbeidh mé in ann iad go léir a chur isteach sa ráiteas ach tá sé tábhachtach dom éisteacht. I am here with my colleague, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, and my officials as part of this consultation process. My Department has already made a call for written submissions from the general public and stakeholders on what should be in the next strategy statement. This led to our receiving almost 400 submissions. In addition, I have been meeting various stakeholders as part of my introduction to my new portfolio. This has given me the opportunity to discuss with various education partners the issues they consider to be of importance in the coming years. Additionally, last Thursday I had a very successful meeting in Letterkenny with regional representatives of many of the key actors in the education and training sector. This was a very fruitful event and there were a range of suggestions made and ideas put forward which I have noted and will consider. I have also been immersing myself in the job, back in the classroom, meeting stakeholders, students, teachers and representatives of the board of management, whether in Cork, Kilkenny, Dublin or other parts of the country. I intend to continue with this because I am hearing many issues being raised, and at the coalface is where one will find out what is needed and where the weaknesses and strengths are. I am here to meet and consult this committee and hear its views as to what should be in the statement of strategy for my Department. I am aware that under the terms of the Public Service Management Act, the statement will be submitted to the Oireachtas once it has been finalised. However, I requested this opportunity to add an additional consultative step rather than presenting the committee with a finished article before it had the opportunity to contribute its views. I am here in listening mode and I look forward to hearing the contributions from members on what they consider to be the key priority strategic actions for my Department in the next few years. I emphasise that my focus today is on the strategic level. The strategy statement is an important document for any organisation. It is a key opportunity for a Department to define the direction to be taken in a policy context. My Department's strategy statement is an overview and a statement of direction for the education and training sector over the next three years. It introduces accountability at a Civil Service level but also allows the Minister of the day discretion in the work he or she wishes to carry out. For this reason, I ask the committee to set out today what strategic direction it wants the education and training sector to travel over the next three years. Obviously, we are all very aware of the various constraints that operate from the point of view of finite resources and the like, but I want to focus today on what can be achieved and on setting out a level of ambition for the sector into the future. For my part, I am very keen to continue the work towards an education and training system that empowers learners and gives them the resilience, skills and training they need to prepare for living successfully in a complex and changing world. I want to release the potential of learners, enabling them to achieve their personal goals and supporting them to make the best of their opportunities as they move forward in their lives. I want a system that can respond to the changing needs of learners, one that is adaptable, accessible and challenging and remains consistently relevant. The education and training system needs to equip the 21st century learner with core competencies such as critical thinking skills, language skills, ability to use technology and written communication skills. These core competencies will enable learners to adapt, work with others, think critically and be creative not just when they leave school or college, but throughout their lives and careers.The committee is aware that the Department has engaged in a significant reform agenda in the past few years and there is no doubt that much has been achieved. I pay tribute to my predecessors for their work in that regard. I want to continue to make progress to embed initiatives and strategies that are under way and reform at a pace at which the system can deliver. I am also conscious that the education and training system works as a partnership between the various players involved, including providers, learners, parents, patrons, management bodies, teachers, lecturers, administrators, the ETBs and the State. It is important that this be explicitly recognised and the spirit of partnership evident in the sector be nurtured and built on. To clarify for the committee, as well as the strategy statement which will set high level priority actions for the next three years, the Department will be developing annual action plans over the lifetime of the strategy. The committee will be familiar with the model of my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Bruton, who had annual action plans. My intention is to have the strategy statement which will identify the strategic direction to be taken and then annual action plans which will set out the more immediate actions to be implemented in order to make progress towards achieving the longer term strategic goals. I intend to publish a 2019 action plan shortly. However, it will be defined by the objectives set in the strategy statement. That is why it is important for me to have this session to hear the views of the committee on the content of the strategy statement and have the opportunity to take them into account in developing and working up a new strategy statement.  As I am conscious of the time constraints, I will not keep the committee much longer. I look forward to hearing the contributions of committee members.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Thomas Byrne asked about teacher supply. This is an issue in secondary schools, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM, subjects and Irish. There are also many issues with substitute teachers in the primary school sector.A group is working on this. We had an advertising campaign pre-Christmas and will continue to do that and look at different interventions to try to attract and invite people who may be interested in coming back from places like the south-east of Great Britain or the United Arab Emirates. Teacher supply will remain a priority for me. There is an ongoing conversation about teacher supply panels. Our officials are working closely on the idea of regional supply panels for substitute teachers. Deputy Thomas Byrne also raised the issue of population and school places with reference to Ashbourne. There are population pressures regardless of whether we are talking about Ashbourne in County Meath or Kildare, Wicklow, Louth or Dublin. The population pressures are growing. To tie it into the question raised by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the Department works very closely with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and looks to where housing estates can be built and planning. The GIS is very much involved in it as well. We can only continue to be as informed as the information available to us. That was the thinking behind Project Ireland 2040, to see where the population pressures will be in the future. Regarding tying the two issues in with the purchase of lands, there is the example of the memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the education and training boards, ETBs, and local authorities in the acquisition of sites. There are examples where this has worked very well. In some instances, it has not worked well. Regarding the idea of an MOU, Limerick is an example of where that has worked and it should be heeded. Deputy Byrne also spoke about the reintroduction of history as a compulsory core subject. He will be aware that I have called for a review in this area. I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, but the officials and members of the NCCA are very familiar with my strong opinion in this area regardless of whether it is the decade of commemorations, the recent conflict in Northern Ireland, own history of emigration, the work on the move from conflict to peace, or our global imprint. That history needs to be told regardless of whether it involved peace, education, peacekeeping in places like Lebanon or the UNHCR, where we have a very high standard and acceptance in respect of working in critical places around the world such as Somalia, South Sudan, Jordan or Lebanon. We must be very open to the fact that we have a dark history encompassing things such as institutional abuse. We must ensure that we cannot just hide all that under the carpet. People came forward, spoke and gave their testimonials and we must ensure that the history of that very dark period in this country is not washed down the stream. Deputy Byrne also raised issues relating to DEIS and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, while Deputy Naughten raised the very important subject of politics and society. It is working very well in the schools in which it has been piloted. I have spoken to a number of teachers and students in the pilot schools. It is a class I would recommend to my colleagues. If they have not done so, I recommend that they go into that politics and society class because they know how to ask questions, engage and put someone on the spot. It is a pleasure to be in there. That politics choice will be rolled out to all schools in 2020. Deputy Naughten also mentioned history in connection with populism in respect of the many challenges we face internationally such as the mass migration of people from sub-Saharan Africa looking for refuge. Given the history of this country when we needed refuge, we must be very open to our contribution on a global basis. The Deputy spoke about empathy, well-being and compassion. He is correct. Well-being means being well both physically and mentally but it also involves dignity - how we treat, relate to and interact with people and not just students. One of the most significant ironies of life is that adults are great at lecturing young people and telling them how to behave and treat each other, but in respect of how we treat each other as adults, particularly in a large public forum like Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, sometimes the dignity piece leaves a lot to be desired, especially when we have such a legacy and footprint globally. When Irish people went abroad to work, be it in education or in the missionary field, they knew how to treat people and there was an acceptance there. We must continue to be very focused on that legacy and appreciation for the way Irish people treat others. I know Deputy Naughten organised a meeting around that. UNESCO is involved in the empathy piece. If we are having the major debate around well-being, let us try to incorporate the empathy piece as well. I have covered some of Deputy O'Sullivan's points. I know she had a couple of questions about third level education as well. I acknowledge the Deputy's work on junior cycle reform. It was a significant piece of work that was not without its challenges at the time. One of the lessons was that change needs to be done in a certain way. Perhaps a period should be set aside. I have learned from that for the leaving certificate reform. We must bring it in gradually. I am getting a lot of positive feedback. Many risks were taken. It required a lot of initiative at the time, whether it was the classroom-based assessments, the new subjects and the new short subjects. With the core subjects of mathematics, English and Irish, the complete focus was around literacy and numeracy. This is why I go back to history again. There is no better subject than history when it comes to focusing on literacy so perhaps there is an opportunity there. I will update the committee on leaving certificate reform. We cannot have junior certificate reform without leaving certificate reform so there is a missing piece. Our students are going to go through the junior certificate and will get used to classroom-based assessment, research work, team work and the critical thinking piece, so we must ensure that the leaving certificate follows through. In saying that, we have a leaving certificate that is very much an integral part of our education system. Yes, there are pressures, including exam pressures. We have tried to take the heat out of that by adding two more days to the leaving certificate through the State Examinations Commission, SEC, this year. One thing that must happen is the continuity between the junior certificate and the leaving certificate. There must be a focus on that. I will keep the committee updated on that. I know it has contributed as a committee.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the committee members for their comments. There is a lot of good stuff in all of this. I would do the committee members an injustice if I kept them here for an hour to go through this line by line. This now is not just a matter of public record, it is also going to be the blacks and whites for my team to put together the action plan. Obviously not everything will be incorporated into the action plan. We can work on themes that have emerged here today and I really want to do that. I will do a whistlestop tour through a few of the issues that have been raised. Senator Maria Byrne mentioned corp oideachas, which is PE as Gaeilge, and looking at how we differentiate between physical literacy, physical education and physical activity. I want to try to work on giving PE its proper status within primary schools. We are doing that at second level. By 2020, PE will be introduced as a choice for the leaving certificate, as will computer science. Senator Byrne mentioned the statistics which show that girls drop out of sports at the earlier age of 13 or 14 years and are twice as likely as boys to drop out of sports. If we are serious about PE at the leaving certificate level then we must consider PE at primary school level. I have learned, having informed myself about this subject, that there are specific modules within the training of teachers for primary schools so we have to figure out a way. In terms of my own passion for the Irish language, I think there is a quick win in terms of the Irish language. I mean if PE can be taught through the medium of Irish then students will learn or improve their Irish language skills in a fun, more creative and more enjoyable way. Maybe we could enter a new era where people develop a love for the Irish language in that way. I will keep the committee up to speed with this matter.  Deputy Funchion talked about the nearest school rule. We are reviewing that transportation arrangement as we speak. She talked about special classes as did another member. That is an evolving issue. It is hard to comprehend the change since 2011, when there were nearly 500 special classes and today there are nearly 1,500 but that is still not enough. The programme is still not done in the way that I would like it to be done. I do not like the programme being diagnosis led. We will look at a new model. We are working on that at present and we will look at incorporating the HSE, my Department and the Department of Health. To be honest, it was at this committee that I encountered this concept, and it was my first day here as Minister. I am very interested in developing that model where if a speech and language therapist, occupational therapist or nurse is needed in a mainstream school then that is the place where we need to be going and continue to give parents the choice. Deputy Funchion also raised the issue of the lack of secondary school options. The issue was raised by a number of members. We have done a good piece of work on that at primary level but we have still a piece of work to do at secondary level. On empathy and mindfulness, has Deputy Martin formally invited me to the event at 1.30 p.m. on Wednesdays?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We live in a crazy world, especially politicians where we maybe do not have enough boundaries in terms of time and taking time out. I will take up the invitation and I will attend on some Wednesday at 1.30 p.m.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Martin stated that equality is at the heart of access. She talked about pay equality and the issue of teaching principals. I met a cohort of principals yesterday evening. It is a very difficult space for half of the primary schoolteachers who are teaching principals. It is an area in which I have given a commitment. Recently, at the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, conference, I stated that I want to work on trying to alleviate the pressures on teaching principals. It is a piece of work that I am going to work on and take seriously. The status of caretakers and school secretaries was mentioned. Fórsa now has a campaign. I am on public record as saying that if there is to be a conversation it has to be within the parameters of the Workplace Relations Commission. My officials and I are happy to engage in that regard. In terms of the language used when describing school openings, when a school gets its patronage and status as a school, be it a Gaelscoil, an education and training board, ETB, or an Educate Together school then word goes out that a new school is opening and creates that perception. We have to look and reflect because it is going to be temporary accommodation for a period before there is a full school. There is a piece of work that we can do there. Relationship and sexuality education, RSE, is under review. That was started last Easter by my predecessor. I will keep the committee up to speed on where we are at in terms of the issue.  In terms of resilience training and mindfulness, specific questions were asked around how schools get resilience training and how they get targeted. I will get back to the committee on that particular question.  The strategy and the sustainable development goals, SDGs, were mentioned. That is an area on which I have been working closely with my colleagues in the Department. Young people are interested in the area whether it is the environment, sustainability, migration, social inclusion, disadvantage or economic disadvantage. Teachers and students are embracing the area and I am interested in seeing whether we can add more value to that. Broadband was mentioned. I am working closely with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Richard Bruton. We have a strategy for the schools but I know that some schools still lose out, particularly primary schools in rural areas. Senator Conway mentioned what a school in west Clare has done. In between now and getting the national broadband plan the school is considering a wireless solution. I know it is not a long-term solution but it does give the school 17 megabytes as opposed to the existing 3 megabytes.  Senator Higgins asked about the history review. We plan to complete the review by the end of the first quarter, which is the end of next month. I will keep the committee up to speed on the issue. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am interested in hearing more about the critical thinking piece about the Young Philosopher Awards in UCD.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am particularly interested in the awards as I studied philosophy for one year; I am not a philosophy graduate. The insecurity of teachers was mentioned, as were inequality and the key role played by secretaries. I am very conscious of the role that secretaries play in schools. They are front of house; they do not just deal with administration but deal with many aspects of the school curriculum. Senator Higgins mentioned mindfulness as well. She suggested that responsibility for the initiative could be shared by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and my Department. That is a good idea.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am somebody who was involved in second chance learning so I firmly believe that everybody should get a second, third, fourth or fifth chance to learn. Such learning is embraced in a very positive way and is connected to the confidence piece as well. I know from my experience of working in an estate years ago that there was a very diligent and active neighbourhood worker named Ms Mary English who went into houses drinking tea with and talking to women to try to encourage them to return to education. Her actions were transformative and changed the lives of many of those women. All of the people that she trained 20 years ago are tutors and facilitators themselves. I am very interested in this piece. Senator Higgins asked about the future procurement of frontier research. I will ask Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, to get back to the Senator about that issue.  Deputy McLoughlin mentioned online abuse. Without question, online abuse is a challenge. We must figure out a way to accept that technology is part of our new society yet allow creativity. Obviously technology is a place where young people are creative but we must deal with the abuse bit. Parents and schools must play their role. Schools have the autonomy to decide whether they want to ban phones or simply not have them in school. One of the elements that I have picked up in primary and secondary schools, whether it is in coding or encouraging more young women to study science, technology, engineering, mathematics, STEM, subjects, is that there is an appetite for the technological aspects of learning. Whether it is Combilift in County Monaghan, where the company is now considering automotive forklifts, or elswhere, one needs the people with the skill set to do those things.We are moving into that space. We want to intervene effectively to ensure there is no online abuse. To give one example of how young people are responding to it, I came across a young lad at the Young Scientists who is developing a software package that concerns how to spot online abuse - how to use computers to deal with a computer problem. We must follow young people as well. There are no better advocates in terms of ensuring that bullying is not part of the group than young people. They will be the ultimate people who will do that. I am confident that solutions will be found.  The acquisition of land, the extension of schools and the capital plan in the future were all mentioned. We have a ten-year bundle and are looking at €8.4 billion so we will continue to work closely on that. The Chairman spoke about the review of the 16 to 19 plan. One of the things we are doing at the stakeholders meeting is asking what has and has not worked. For example, we have achieved 85% of last year's action plan so much of it has been delivered. We also ask them what the weaknesses were so we are asking that question.  Some other issues that were raised include morale, pay parity, the fact that 50% of teachers are on lower pay and scale in some of the larger classes for younger teachers. It is an issue. I acknowledge that we cannot have a system where teachers do the same job for different levels of pay. There is unfinished business and I want to continue to work with the unions and teachers to ensure we finish that unfinished piece. I know we have an agreement up to the end of 2020 but it is something of which I am conscious. Teaching principals were mentioned and I spoke about that issue. Other issues raised include caretakers, secretaries, special classes in primary and secondary school and the full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act. Regarding the DEIS issue, we have, hopefully, identified that the full audit will be complete by the end of March. We will then evaluate the results. There will be a new DEIS system, a system that will be gradual but also more targeted. Certain schools are in DEIS because of geographical considerations but it is a lot more complex so I keep the committee updated about that. Access to further education was mentioned along with the specific issue of apprenticeships in Athy. We must follow up on that.
