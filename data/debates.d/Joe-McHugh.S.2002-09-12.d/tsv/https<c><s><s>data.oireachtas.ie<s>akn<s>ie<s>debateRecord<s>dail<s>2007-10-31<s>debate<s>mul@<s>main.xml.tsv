JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On promised legislation, No. 84, there are major concerns about the viability and the future of Malin Head coast guard station and concerns need to be raised at this stage because there is talk it will be closed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To be specific, I raised it because it has to do with the Safety Convention Bill.  Just today, there were two successful rescue missions, 230 miles and 60 miles off the west coast.  A Naval Service ship was 230 miles off the west coast.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Can I ask the Taoiseach, under promised legislation, what is the commitment, and this Government's stance, on the future viability of Malin Head coast guard station?
