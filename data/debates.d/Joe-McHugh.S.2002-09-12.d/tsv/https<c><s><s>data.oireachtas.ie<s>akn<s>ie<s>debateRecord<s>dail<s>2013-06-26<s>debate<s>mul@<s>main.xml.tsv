JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have already contributed twice on this matter, both in this House and in the Upper House. As we all will be aware in this House, it is a complex issue. It is both emotive and highly personal. Of the many concerns that have been raised through many different forums, different voices and different organisations, the two issues that strike me are the ultimate protection of the unborn and giving a voice to the unborn, and the issue around suicide. Where people have been in contact with me, that contact has been in the main cordial. On the suicide issue, there has been a somewhat flippant discourse on the issue of suicide which must be acknowledged. Suicide is a very real and complex difficulty for many citizens and for many families that have endured the loss of loved ones. If there happen to be women who are pregnant and have suicidal ideation, it is important that we encourage them to present themselves to the proper social service teams - able staff the length and breadth of this country - and create the proper pathways where we can bring them in and where they will feel safe and will be listened to. We should be doing everything in our power as a society and in the professional medical service to exhaust every avenue with those females who present with suicide ideation and it should not be treated in the way it has been discussed to date. If they have suicidal thoughts, we should encourage them to come into the health care system and help them along with the assistance that they need. On the concerns around precedent, the precedent in California, in France and in the United Kingdom is alarming. The figures are alarming. People are genuinely concerned that if this legislation is introduced the floodgates will open. It is important to highlight the fact that enshrined in the Constitution is the protection of the life of both the mother and the unborn and we must trust the Constitution that this will be ultimately protected following this legislation. We need clarity around terminations. I do not have the information to hand on all of the individual hospitals in this country. We do not have clarity on the numbers of terminations. For obvious reasons, there are terminations in this country. It is hoped that the legislation will provide clarity and more protection in terms of protection of the life of the mother. I have concerns in relation to rights of the father. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White, is here tonight. One of the churches raised this issue of the rights of the father in regard to this legislation. There is a need to explain and define more clearly what are the rights of the father. I am aware that in different countries the rights of the father differ. On the 1861 Act, there will be a change in the penalty for the offence of intentional destruction of unborn human life, from life imprisonment to 14 years. However, there are questions around access to abortive pills over the Internet in the first stages of pregnancy - up to 12 or 13 weeks. We need clarity where women have access to abortive pills, get into medical difficulty and present themselves to the GP, and we also need legal protection for GPs who will ultimately assist women who have taken abortive pills. In the short time available to me it is not possible to discuss all of the different concerns and questions raised by many people. However, in a nutshell, the core fear of many men and women is the question of the suicide provision leading to the opening of the floodgates. We must have protection against this. The psychiatric profession has a very important role in preventing the opening of the so-called floodgates. It is a real live concern for many and we must be cognisant of this as the Bill passes through the House. Regarding the debate about the Whip, I believe every Member of the House will take his or her conscience into consideration when he or she makes his or her decision. Certainly, I will make my decision on the Bill based on what I believe is right and ultimately what I believe is right for the protection of the life of the mother and that of the unborn and to give a voice to the unborn.
