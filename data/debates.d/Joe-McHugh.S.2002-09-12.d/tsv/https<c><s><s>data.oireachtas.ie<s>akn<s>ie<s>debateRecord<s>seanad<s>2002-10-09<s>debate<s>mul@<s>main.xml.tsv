JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for being in attendance because there are a few pertinent points I wish to make and I have a number of questions which he might answer.Before dealing with the substance of the motion – I thank Senator Ulick Burke for introducing it – I wish to discuss my experiences in the field of pedagogy. I had the opportunity to work in both the formal and non-formal sectors of education. I worked in a secondary school and as a community development worker and I believe I can empathise with the people who work in these areas.We must consider the holistic aspects of education before we attempt to make decisions. As Senator Burke stated, we must exercise caution and take time in this regard. We must look at the bedrock of the education system which, on a positive note, rests in the area of family support. This is a non-tangible aspect of the education system and comes in the form of parents who help their children with homework, who take time out to serve on boards of management and who volunteer to help with sporting organisations. In addition, there are teachers who voluntarily involve themselves in extracurricular activities. The assistance these people provide is a massive and positive component of the education system.Problems have arisen in education in the past ten years and I wish to refer to a number of them. Income limits for receipt of grants are far too low. I will provide an example of this. A mother with whom I am familiar is a teacher – sometimes when we categorise teachers we forget many of them are also parents – who job shares and she is not allowed to obtain a grant for both of her children who are attending courses in Northern Ireland because of her income limit. In addition, she will not receive compensation for registration fees because they are attending colleges in the North. We are talking here about a parent, who is also a teacher, being discriminated against because she happens to be in the PAYE middle income category. I suggest that net rather than gross income should be taken into consideration.As a representative from Donegal, I believe the people in my county are being discriminated against. I am familiar with a great institution called Magee College in Derry. In my view the Government is not providing incentives to subsidise students from Donegal who want to attend third level institutions in the North, be it Jordanstown or Queen's in Belfast or Magee College in Derry. If we are wholeheartedly committed to the idea of North-South co-operation and fostering an atmosphere of unity between people on this island, we must give greater consideration to using our education system to build bridges between Northern Ireland and the Republic.At present, applicants cannot be assessed on their own income until they are 23 years of age. That is disgraceful. Young independent mothers aged between 18 and 21 years who may have two or three children are still means tested on the basis of their parents' income. These young female adults may have been independent from the age of 16 and there is something wrong with the way they are being treated.Grants are not payable in respect of post graduate study outside the Irish Republic or Northern Ireland. The level of these grants is too low. For people living in Donegal or other Border counties, the position is made worse by the rate of exchange vis-à-vis sterling. In addition, applicants are of the opinion that the grant application process is in no way user-friendly.I have highlighted the positive and negative aspects of the system and I will now deal with the substance of the motion. Confidence in the education system is being eroded and parents and teachers, who motivate our young people, will withdraw their voluntary services if this continues. Senator Ulick Burke referred to morale among teachers and if one visits any school staff room in Ireland, one will be presented with the same theme, namely, we were let down by the ASTI which did not do its homework. I believe that is letting the Government off the hook.We must consider the position in which teachers and parents find themselves and also look at the state of the education system. Increasing third level registration fees by 70% and slashing by €11 million initiatives to tackle school drop out rates will undermine the work that has been done in the area of education during the past 30 to 40 years. As a citizen, a representative from Donegal and a person who has worked in both the formal and non-formal sectors of education, I believe teachers, parents and students have been let down to a great degree and I beg the Minister to exercise caution and take heed because we need to examine this matter in a constructive and comprehensive manner.
