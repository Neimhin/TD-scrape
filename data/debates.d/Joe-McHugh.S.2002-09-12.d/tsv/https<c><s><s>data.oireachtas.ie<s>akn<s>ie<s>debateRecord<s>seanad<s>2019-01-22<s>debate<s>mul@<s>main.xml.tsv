JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it allows me the opportunity to clarify the position on St. Joseph’s secondary school, Rush, County Dublin. I acknowledge that my colleague, Senator James Reilly, has kept me up to speed on this issue. The school is currently located at Convent Lane, Rush and consists of a number of buildings, some permanent accommodation and others prefabricated accommodation. The site is limited for development due to its size and location in the centre of the village in a settled residential area and it was determined that a new site was required to facilitate provision of sufficient permanent accommodation for the school. The school’s trustees have recently confirmed to my Department that they are not in a position to provide a site to accommodate a new school building. Following on from this, officials of my Department have requested the assistance of officials in Fingal County Council in procuring a site for the school under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites. Under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites, local authorities assist my Department with the process of identifying and acquiring sites for the development of school accommodation. The first step in this process is the identification of suitable sites by the local authorities. The identified sites are then technically assessed on a joint basis by officials from the local authorities and my Department's professional and technical staff. The Senator will appreciate the importance of a thorough appraisal of site options at this point to ensure the achievement of value for money and minimise the potential of any issue arising during the planning and development stages. The relevant local area plan provides for the location of a post-primary school site in the Kenure area of Rush. My Department understands this site was reserved by Fingal County Council on foot of representations made on behalf of St. Joseph’s secondary school. To date, access issues have inhibited the potential development of this site but Fingal County Council is working to deliver a new roadway which would facilitate such development. Engagement between my officials and council officials on the potential acquisition of the site is ongoing. It is difficult to indicate a timeline for completion of the acquisition of a site for the school in question as it is dependent on the outcome of current negotiations and also on the complexity of the conveyancing process.Once a site has been acquired the project can progress to architectural planning.  I assure the Senator that my Department is cognisant of the school's current accommodation constraints. The Department received an application for temporary accommodation from the school. Subsequently, it issued approval, in principle, to the board of management for the rental of two science laboratories - one being a technical graphics or design communication graphics room and one general classroom - as an interim measure, pending delivery of the permanent school building. The responsibility for the installation of this accommodation has been devolved to the school authority for delivery. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Seanadóir faoi choinne an seans labhartha leis an Seanad inniu ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	For the purposes of clarification, it is important for me to point out what my role is, as Minister, in site acquisitions. I do not issue instructions to buy a preferred site. There is a memorandum of understanding, which is an engagement between the local authority - not just Fingal County Council but all local authorities - and the Department of Education and Skills. As part of that process, there is a communication between departmental officials and Fingal County Council to ensure a number of preferred sites are put on the table. It is up to them to ensure the communication is open and transparent. The Senator has stated a county councillor said that there is no engagement ongoing between officials-----

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As far as I am concerned, my officials are engaging. That process has started. Now we have to-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Now we have to ensure we prioritise the younger people who are looking for a satisfactory building for their education. That is my priority. The Senator has raised an issue and claimed that there is a blockage in communications. Let us get to the bottom of the matter. Let us find out and continue the work that we do on a bipartisan and cross-political basis. In my engagement, whether it be with the Senator or Senator Reilly, I am happy to find out what the problem is. Let us find out what it is and get to the bottom of it. Importantly, I do not decide-----
