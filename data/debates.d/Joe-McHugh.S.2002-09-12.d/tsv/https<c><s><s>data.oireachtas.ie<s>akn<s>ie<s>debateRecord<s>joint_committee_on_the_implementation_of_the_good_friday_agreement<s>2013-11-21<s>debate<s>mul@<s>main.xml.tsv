JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am delighted to welcome the very Reverend Dr. Norman Hamilton from the Presbyterian Church, accompanied by Reverend Trevor Gribben and Reverend Dr. Roy Patten. This time last year this committee met in Belfast. We all know what happened a number of weeks later but it was nothing to do with us. We are very aware of the challenges that present in urban Belfast and want to have an open conversation about them. I invite the witnesses to make their presentation and then the committee members will respond with observations and questions. Hopefully we will have a good, open and frank discussion.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for rudely interrupting Rev. Gribben, but I need to suspend the meeting for approximately ten minutes because members have been called to vote in the Chamber. As Ms Michelle Gildernew, MP is not required to leave, the witnesses can stay here and have an audience with her. The suspension will give them a chance to reflect. We will be back.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for the interruption.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Rev. Trevor Gribben for those words.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	With their agreement, we will now take questions from membes. I ask them to keep their contributions brief because time has gone against us. I ask the three reverend gentlemen to be conscious of the need to keep their answers brief and share the questions between them.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It would be helpful. We will begin with Deputy Frank Feighan who will be followed by Deputy Jack Wall.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Jack Wal, who will be followed by Ms Michelle Gildernew, MLA
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Ms Michelle Gildernew who will be followed by Deputy Brendan Smith.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As five more committee members are offering, I make another appeal for brevity. I call Deputy Brendan Smith who will be followed by Deputy Seán Conlon.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Michael P. Kitt who will be followed by Deputy Martin Ferris.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our final speaker is Senator Mary White.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank members of the committee. I failed miserably in calling for brevity, but there was a reason for this. We go to Northern Ireland and do a lot of outreach work. People are interested and members of the committee are passionate about making the North and the South better places in which to live. The delegates will have detected from members' contributions that they have thought about them and want to be part of this process.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise to Reverend Hamilton, but there is about five minutes to go before the vote takes place. Would it be possible for him to sum up? We will meet again after the next session. We will meet informally and have an opportunity to talk then.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will take Reverend Hamilton up on that offer. Reverend Gribben has approximately two minutes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank all three delegates; their attendance is much appreciated. This is the beginning of the conversation and we will take up their invitation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise to the delegates for the delay in reaching them. Between votes and other distractions, we are behind schedule. I welcome the representatives of the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland and look forward to getting their insight into the journey from prison to peace and efforts towards conflict transformation by way of bottom-up projects. The bottom-up approach is of particular interest to the committee in its deliberations. I am aware of some of the delegates' work, having recently attended a Prison to Peace conference in Armagh. It was an interesting discussion which gave me a taste of what they were seeking to achieve. I commend them for their work. The committee does not claim to have a monopoly of answers to any of these issues. Our objective is to have an open door policy which facilitates a variety of opinions and shades of opinions. We respect people's different viewpoints and try to provide a space for their expression. We hope the delegates will find a welcoming forum for their views today and we will also have input from members. I will not go through the advice on privilege which has been circulated to delegates. I am sure they will bear it in mind. I invite Ms Kilmurray to make an opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Ms Kilmurray. I now invite questions from members, beginning with Deputy Frank Feighan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Ferris for that. Does Mr. Kevin Mulgrew wish to lead in the response to those questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does anybody else wish to comment on the issues raised? If not, I will take questions from Deputy Smith and Ms Gildernew.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We can reflect on it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is no pressure.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before allowing Mr. Kevin Mulgrew to respond, I note the gremlins are at us today, as another vote has been called. I will keep the meeting going and perhaps one person also should remain behind, thereby allowing the other members to leave. As Ms Michelle Gildernew is still here, we can keep going.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As Ms Gildernew had finished her questioning, Deputy Kirk is next.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No, that is helpful. Mr. Dunbar wants to come in and he will be followed by Mr. Howcroft.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Dunbar for his input. The issue of a bill of rights is raised regularly at the committee, as he will be aware.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I think you are a Strabane man, Paul, are you not?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On Monday, I learned that there are 300 ex-combatants in Strabane alone, which is not a big place. It gave me some perspective as regards numbers. It was stated that it is not just a Six Counties problem, which is correct. To turn it the other way, the solution is not just a Six Counties solution. The flag is also being flown for Cork. I know the good work that all the witnesses are doing to try to move things forward. This committee is trying to provide space for everyone involved. In two weeks time, we will have representatives from victims' groups here. I do not have to tell those attending the committee today about the complexity of moving things forward, but we try to keep it as simple as possible. We appreciate and respect the perspective of every group that comes here.The committee will continue with its outreach programme in Northern Ireland. We will be in Derry and Donegal in January with an invite back to Belfast later in the new year. The committee’s door is always open to the delegations. Civil servants will be examining today’s proceedings to identify the issues and concerns raised. This will influence future developments. I agree there are frustrations with the peace process 15 years in. However, it is still in its infancy and we have a long road to go. We certainly want to be with the delegations on that journey. If there is any way the committee can assist, our door is always open.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The committee fully supported this project from day one. I will ask a full member of the committee to propose this.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are negotiations ongoing. Is it agreed that we send a letter to the SEUPB secretariat seeking more time and space? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	He certainly has.
