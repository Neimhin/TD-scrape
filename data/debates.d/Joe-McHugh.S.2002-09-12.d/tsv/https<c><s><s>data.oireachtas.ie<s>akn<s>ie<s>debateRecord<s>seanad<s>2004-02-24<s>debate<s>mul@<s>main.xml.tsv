JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I seek an update on the proposed debates on one-off rural housing and job creation in the BMW region. I seek clarification on the progress since our successful debate on the Irish language. We had a very magnanimous debate on having Irish included as a working language in the EU. Has the Minister been contacted and is he working on behalf of this House? We must send the clear message that this House serves a democratic function. This House gave cross-party support to the call for the use of Irish as a working language in the EU. As this has not happened to date, we must show a sense of purpose on this matter.
