JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an chomhchoiste fearaim fáilte roimh an Aire, Angus Robertson chuig an cruinniú inniu. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Angus Robertson and his team, Mr. Frank Strang, Mr. Ewan Crawford and Ms Katy McNeil, to today's meeting. The flight to Edinburgh is only an hour, so we are neighbours. In the few seconds we spent speaking prior to the meeting, we managed to cover everything from the beauty of Edinburgh to rugby and football, all things cultural and, of course, our close relationship. We are engaging today on the topic of post-Brexit relations. We will begin with a note on privilege and some house-keeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech which might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who intends to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I will members partaking by MS teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the grounds of the Leinster House campus. In order to limit the risk of spreading of Covid-19, the service encourages all members, visitors and witnesses to continue to wear face masks when moving around the campus or when in close proximity to others, to be respectful to each other's physical space and to adhere to any other public health advice. I thank all present for their indulgence and I now call on Mr. Angus Robertson to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Robertson. We appreciate his short introduction because, like him, members will get more value out of the engagement as well. I call Deputy Richmond. He will be followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Robertson for those comprehensive responses. I presume Deputy Ó Murchú had intended to ask the same questions. Will we move on to the next speaker?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. I think I detected three questions, perhaps four, in his contribution. The Deputy asked about interactions with the Westminster Government, the timeline for EU membership and the framework discussions. There might be something else as well.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will generously allow the Deputy a supplementary question but there are other members waiting patiently to come in. We are against the clock.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is an informal get-together afterwards and we will have a further opportunity to converse.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Robertson and his team for a very good engagement.I know the topic was Brexit but we could not-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy may ask a very specific question and cut the preamble.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is a shortened preamble.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I was intrigued by the statistic Mr. Robertson had that 2% of Scottish people agree with Boris Johnson that the UK got a good deal from Brexit.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The topic today was Brexit but the debate among the members was laced with the Ukrainian situation. It is just with us. It is very difficult for people from Ukraine. I met with the Ukrainian Ambassador last night. She is so tired. She is meeting and talking with people and creating awareness. The committee had a private meeting this morning. We are grappling with this issue. What can we do? How can we help? We will reach out to the Ukrainian Ambassador and ask her to come before the committee next week.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That sounds like a very good idea. We will have upwards of 100,000 Ukrainians in our country over the period of time ahead. Many people have opened their doors already and are willing to take them in. The majority of the people who will come here want to go home again. Most refugees want to go home. Many individuals struggle with this at an individual level in terms of what they can do to help. Not to bring football into it but the World Cup is as symbolic a competition as one could get in the sporting world. Three more countries from Europe will compete to qualify for the remaining places, including Mr. Robertson's country. The Scottish FA has been very generous in facilitating and trying to postpone the match. I will not ask Mr. Robertson for his opinion because I do not want him to get into bother with his Scottish authority. I am not talking on behalf of anybody other than myself. My opinion is that FIFA should look at symbolically facilitating Ukraine in order that it does not have to go through the process of a semi-final and a final and even at postponing the match until June. As Mr. Robertson said, this will be long term. Half of the FC Dynamo Kyiv footballers are fighting today in the trenches.Footballers are fighting in the trenches. People have died since this meeting started. There could be a symbolic gesture like that, without being a detriment to Scotland, Wales or any other country that is trying to qualify. Maybe FIFA should in some way facilitate Ukraine to play in Qatar without having to go through a semi-final and a final. It has paid a lot and more than earned its place at this stage. I know a former First Minister, Henry McLeish, spoke on this issue. He was referred to by The Scotsman on Monday. That is a personal opinion. Guím gach rath ar na finnéithe amach anseo. Tá fáilte roimh Angus Robertson aon am. Tá an doras oscailte. Ar son an choiste, gabhaim buíochas leo faoi choinne an taispeántais inniu. Beidh seans againn anois labhairt faoi chúrsaí go neamhfhoirmiúil.. We will have a chance for an informal session and hopefully we will continue the conversation.
