JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Last week at the Business Committee we had a battle on our hands to get extra time and we are sitting late on Thursday as well. We are completely under pressure with Government legislation but if people want to sit longer tonight or tomorrow I am happy to do that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is up to the Business Committee.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I totally accept what Deputy Martin is saying on this. Last Thursday morning there were no statements on this important matter but we decided to give it time. If the House wants extra time I am happy to agree to adjourning the debate and trying to find extra time later in the week but that is not my decision. I am only one member of the Business Committee.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Níl.
