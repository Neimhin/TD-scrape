JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have a few questions.  Is the Garda adequately resourced with financial expertise?  Has there been a putting together of brains to ascertain whether there has been malpractice or other misdemeanours within the banking industry, specifically within Anglo Irish Bank?  Are there enough accountants involved?  Are enough civil servants in the Department of Finance assisting the Garda investigation?  During the week a HSE spokesperson stated that 2,000 people were working in HR in the HSE, but that only 800 were needed.  With such public service fat, are we diverting all the resources with the skills and expertise to ascertain what went wrong, where it went wrong and how we deal with the obvious outcomes?Populism was mentioned by the three absentee landlords in charge of the country who have left, but who blame the Opposition.Some people want blood.  They want prosecutions and they want justice to be served.  However, I spoke to a gentleman earlier who is in the middle of a house repossession and I asked him whether he wanted blood or a bed to sleep at night.  He said, "Blood is not much good to me if I do not have a bed to sleep in".Ageism is a problem within the Government with Ministers having no appreciation for the level of negative equity facing my generation.  These people are affected through no fault of their own.  They bought at high prices because they needed a home and now they are in negative equity of between €200,000 and €300,000.  There is a vicious circle.  Banks need capital and their shareholders will not vote for a package to bail out people facing mortgage default.  Mortgages are assets and each month the banks say they have money coming in.  On the other hand, they are advertising liabilities, that is, savings through the broadcast media.  They are, therefore, promoting liabilities while they need capital.  They have what they consider to be assets in mortgages but 300,000 people will default over the next 18 months.  The banks will not have capital and they need to realise, along with their shareholders, that their shares will become irrelevant.  The reality is it is an ageist problem not to sort out people in negative equity who will not have a pillow to put their heads on within the next 18 months.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In recent days there has been a conversation through the public domain in my constituency about fears and anxieties concerning future funding for Donegal Hospice.  In the response from the HSE, I hope for confirmation and reassurance for existing patients and those who have contributed in a voluntary capacity through their time and financially over several years.  It is equally important that we reassure those directly and indirectly involved in the hospice that there will be an answer to their concerns and reassurance for the wider community in Donegal, which has been extremely active in the genesis of the hospice movement through the continuation of the care and voluntary contributions to the hospice.There is concern about the reduction in posts at the hospice from January 2011.  At present there are three junior doctors working under a consultant along with other staff.  We are at a period where we must consider reductions and funding withdrawals as a result of the financial situation.  However, in the answer from the Minister of State I hope for reassurance for the people of Donegal, the patients and the volunteers in this movement so that even if there is a withdrawal of staff, we can have proper standards of patient safety.  That is the matter I wish to highlight tonight.  Will the Minister of State and the HSE reassure the public of Donegal and those involved in the hospice movement?  This includes every person who has contributed time or a euro in a bucket in voluntary fund-raising and the organisations that have put their hearts into this movement.  A hospice is not part of the Government.  It may be a wing of the Government in terms of the Government providing financial input but it is part of the fabric of our society in Donegal.  It belongs to the people and the people require answers on future commitments to patient safety.  Patient safety is key to my raising this matter.  Reassurance can only be provided through the Minister of State and the HSE, for which the Minister of State and the Minister for Health and Children have accountability.  I want assurance provided to the families, to the patients and to the wider Donegal community.  The Donegal community not only contributes to this but has been an integral part of the hospice movement in Donegal for years and intends to be part of it for years to come.
