JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Tánaiste, an Teachta Varadkar, ar son an choiste. Táimid ag dúil go mór leis an díospóireacht atá ag teacht. The Tánaiste is also Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I also extend a welcome to his officials. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. To anyone watching this meeting online, I point out that Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely. Only I, as Chairman, and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room.  We have had an intense degree of consultation and exchanges with many groups. I know the members will be interested to hear what the Tánaiste has to say and we are looking forward to the engagement. I call on him to make his opening statement. 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As we are experiencing some feedback, we will suspend briefly.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Tánaiste. We will move now to questions from non-committee members. I call Deputy Mairéad Farrell first, as she is substituting for Deputy Brady.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Tánaiste.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There will be time for supplementaries later. Deputy Whitmore is waiting. Before I call her, I want to let members know that Senator Keogan is participating in the meeting this morning, but as she is not on campus she has submitted her question to me to ask on her behalf. What will be the impact of the ICS on the taxpayer?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Tánaiste. Apologies to Deputy Whitmore. I know she was raring to go before I interrupted. I invite to put her questions now.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	My generosity and latitude have been stretched. I have not allowed other members to put supplementary questions. People will get a chance to come in again if we have time at the end. We will move on to Senator Boylan, followed by Senator Higgins.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before I bring in Senator Higgins, Deputy Duffy has indicated and has the floor.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Senator came back in and asked the question in different ways. Will she give the Tánaiste space to respond because a number of members have supplementary questions as well?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have a number of supplementary requests. Can I impress on everybody the need to be as brief and specific as possible because the Tánaiste will respond to the question? Will speakers just ask their questions? I will allow them back in again but if they could be very specific and brief, I would appreciate it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will let the Tánaiste respond to that and he can include his wrap-up as well as that is all the questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will conclude after the Senator’s contribution. We are being as flexible as we can.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Arís, gabhaim buíochas don Tánaiste ar son an choiste agus dá oifigigh as ucht a theacht go dtí an díospóireacht inniu. Go raibh maith agaibh fá choinne an anailís, an léargas agus a thuairimí faoin ábhar seo. Is léir go bhfuil níos tuairimí ann ar an ábhar seo. Gabhaim buíochas leis na cuairteoirí agus baill an choiste as an díospóireacht chuimsitheach inniu.
