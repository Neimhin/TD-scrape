JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have not received any apologies. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are looking forward to our conversation on the EU response to Covid-19. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Gerry Kiely, head of representation in Ireland for the European Commission, and Ms Noelle O'Connell, CEO of European Movement Ireland. As we know, Ireland is not the only country grappling with Covid-19. As many other member states face challenges in controlling the virus, this engagement seeks to inform us on the measures being taken at an EU level to assist member states in their efforts. I will read a note on privilege before we begin. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I also advise the witnesses, who are giving evidence from locations outside the parliamentary precincts, to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on whether or not or the extent to which the evidence to be given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime.If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call Mr. Kiely to make an opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Mr. Kiely. I call on Ms Noelle O'Connell, European Movement Ireland, to make her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Kiely and Ms O'Connell for their contributions. I will call members in order now, and I will take two at a time. Deputies Howlin and Richmond have indicated. I ask them to be specific regarding to whom they are directing questions. I call Deputy Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Ms O'Connell want to start? Who wants to reply?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank both witnesses for their presentations. They both used phrases such as "air travel", "ports", "border", "mobility", "movement of goods and essential services", "green lanes" and "EU traffic light systems." In a surreal way, therefore, we could be listening to a presentation on Brexit. At this 11th hour, as the perfect storm of a deadly second wave of Covid intensifies and as the Brexit deadline of 1 January 2021 looms, can we separate the discussions on Covid-19 and Brexit? Do they have to be considered in a more joined-up manner? Ms O'Connell made a point about whether we can separate extremism, disinformation and populism from discussions on the pandemic. That is the first question. My second question is in a similar vein to that of Senator Doherty. It concerns the opportunities that arise. When we reflect on this crisis in 20 or 30 years, questions will be asked as to whether we responded quickly enough and whether interventions were made at an early juncture. The sum of €750 billion has been flagged for a considerable period. Covid has been with us since March so we are four months from our first anniversary. When will member states see some of the money? I am aware that Mr. Kiely has answered that question already. A more pertinent question is whether we could be more deliberate, efficient and reactive in spending the money.In light of the work that Noelle and her team at European Movement Ireland, EMI, have done on research with regard to our citizens feeling their voices are not being heard, the longer we talk about money being available and not being drawn down or spent, it creates a weakness. Mr. Kiely referred to a figure of €5 billion flagged for Brexit. With Ireland being the EU member state most exposed, is €5 billion enough? What assurances can the EU Commission give to ensure there can be a quicker turnaround in advancing payment to EU member states?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas as na cuir i láthair agus gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe ar an gcoiste as an díospóireacht agus a gceisteanna tábhachtacha freisin. Táimid ag dúil go mór le comhoibriú agus díospóireacht ar Covid-19 agus ar an mBreatimeacht amach anseo.
