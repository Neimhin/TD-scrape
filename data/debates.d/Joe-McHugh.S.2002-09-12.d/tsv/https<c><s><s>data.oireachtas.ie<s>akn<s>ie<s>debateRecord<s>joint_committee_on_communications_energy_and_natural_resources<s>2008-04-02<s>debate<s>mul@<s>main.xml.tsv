JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being late and welcome Mr. Faughnan.  I thank him for his comprehensive contribution and I thank Deputy Liz McManus for raising this issue.  It makes nonsense of environmental strategies when diesel, which is less environmentally harmful than other fuels, is more expensive than petrol.  Naturally, the punter will choose the least expensive option, which in this case is more harmful to the environment.  The joint committee should develop a strategy, creative or otherwise, to address this problem.Given that I have been accused by the Chairman of digressing on previous occasions, I do not propose to do so again.  I will, however, give an example of the ludicrous lack of connectivity in transport.  Yesterday morning I had to travel from Dublin to Donegal to attend an engagement.  I flew from Dublin to Derry with 11 other passengers on a 36 seat aircraft.  I do not know what fuel is used to power aeroplanes but I assume the practice of transporting 12 people from A to B in this manner damages the environment.  Incidentally, although it is the fourth largest city in Ireland, Derry does not have a direct rail link to the Republic and has poor road infrastructure.On my arrival in Derry, I had to travel a further 60 miles by car to Letterkenny and then onwards to Carrigart.  Following the engagement, I returned to Dublin by car, which took a further five hours.  Having started my journey at 7 a.m. yesterday when I took a taxi in Dublin city, I went to bed at 1 a.m. this morning after a bowl of cornflakes.  It is only 167 miles from Dublin to Carrigart.Mr. Faughnan is an advocate who frequently features in the media.  He has considerable experience and knowledge of possible solutions and strategies.  My experience highlights to me that the debate must move on.  A new committee on climate change has been established.  While an exceptional amount of jargon is used to describe what we are trying to achieve, it amounts to no more than a regurgitation of what is said on CNN and Fox News.  The country needs a collective kick in the backside.  We hear about environmental challenges and the steps needed to protect the environment but we are not taking basic, simple steps.  We must sit down and draw up strategies to deliver proper alternatives for travelling from A to B.It is ridiculous that it took me 18 hours to travel 167 miles and back yesterday.  We talk about the carnage caused in road traffic accidents.  Car drivers have no choice but to drive because of the poor public transport infrastructure.  It is time we started to focus on more creative fuel choices and public transport alternatives.  While I am aware the latter area is not Mr. Faughnan's remit, it is clear he realises that a proper public transportation system does not preclude the use of the car.  We need to get realistic about this issue and drop the jargon.
