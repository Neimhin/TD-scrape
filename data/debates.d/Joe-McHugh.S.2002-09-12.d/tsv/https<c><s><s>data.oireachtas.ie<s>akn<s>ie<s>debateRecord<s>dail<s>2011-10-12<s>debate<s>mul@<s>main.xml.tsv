JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I applaud the Minister for seeing sense in his consultation with the credit union movement.  His decision to refer this particular aspect to the Commission on Credit Unions is wise.  It is important to note that in our democratic model we have Opposition and Government sides, but the backbenchers on the Government side have a democratic role to play in Government.  I reiterate my thanks to the Minister for taking our concerns on board.  This was a wise decision.  The credit union movement is in a healthy state, with over €1.7 billion in reserves,  €12 billion in assets, personal loans of €5.6 billion and personal savings of €11 billion, which means that the total membership of 2.7 million people have average savings of €4,000.  That is indicative of a very healthy credit union movement.  The credit union movement is very important in peripheral areas of our constituency, where it provides not only an economic framework but also a socio-economic model which is beneficial to communities.  I know that in certain sectors, for example, students are finding it more difficult to get loans, but the credit union is a very important resource.The debate on this Bill is an example of democracy working.  The Irish League of Credit Unions put forward a very good case and it is very much aware that the Commission on Credit Unions is a good model for it to work through.  They are open to new regulatory frameworks.  It is very important and I know the Minister will be working very closely and liaising with them.  The voices of those of us on the backbenches were heard and I thank him.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was worthwhile to give my Government colleague latitude because he was giving the House very valid information.The Government amendment mentions the commitment to the North-South consultative forum in the St. Andrews Agreement and it is important that I reiterate Deputy Hannigan's observation and insight as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement that it is important to get it up and going.  There should be an onus on both Administrations to get it going as a priority.  It provides an opportunity, particularly at a time of reconfiguration in the community and voluntary sector at grassroots level.  I acknowledge certain funding constraints exist and the community and voluntary sector will face certain challenges, but the positive news is that the sector is alive and well.I acknowledge the Ceann Comhairle's role and proactive involvement with Willie Hay, the Speaker of the House in Northern Ireland, in trying to get the political mechanism of the parliamentary forum up and running.  It is important that we have a dual focus, and the consultative forum should be pursued vigorously alongside the efforts of the Ceann Comhairle.While the sector does face reconfiguration, this presents an opportunity.  There is much close connectivity between the voluntary and community sectors North and South and much good work is done.  However there is also much duplication, and the Government amendment places emphasis on reduced duplication.Last week, I spoke at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester and made the point there is an emphasis on duplication in Northern Ireland at present, led by the two Government parties.  The word used by people down here is "ameliorate" but there is an austerity programme in Northern Ireland with a realignment of services.  We should pursue more aggressively a realignment of services on a North-South basis.  We need to engage more with the Conservative Party and Liberal Democrat Party Government in the UK to pursue this agenda.  It is not good enough to focus on the Good Friday Agreement aspects between Stormont and Westminster, as there is a third tier which is east-west North-South linkage.  It is important because it presents opportunities with regard to economies of scale.  We always ask why certain projects fall between two stools.  Greencastle ferry cannot get mainstream funding——

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am over time.  Three minutes was a bit short.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will conclude by stating if we are serious about the focus of the Good Friday Agreement we should not consider Stormont and Westminster only.  We must also consider the proceeds of North-South realignments and this must be done by challenging the mindset which exists between Stormont and Westminster.
