JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with Senator Brian Hayes with regard to the constitutionality of the dual mandate. I also agree with Senator Jim Walsh that our party was in favour of the theory behind the dual mandate but we are not happy with the way the Minister has presented it.Senator Brian Hayes has already called for a debate on Northern Ireland. It is imperative that we have such a debate soon because legislation is proposed which relates to the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda Síochána and which will change the landscape. We should use the debate as a foundation upon which to build and move forward. Policing is the key, not just for Northern Ireland but also for the South.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The debate on this Bill should make us reflect on our own lifestyles and health. This Bill is appropriate and important because it introduces competition to health insurance. BUPA and VHI hold a monopoly. As a 32 year old male I have never been targeted by BUPA or VHI so I will take this opportunity to talk about men's health and health insurance.Statistics prove that men do not look after themselves, be they young or old. They think they are indestructible, that nothing will break. Senator Feighan will agree that soccer is the only forum where private insurance companies target young men. That forum presented my only opportunity to think about health insurance and the chance that something might go wrong with my health. A large percentage of men are introduced to health insurance by their wives or, in Senator Feighan's case, his mother.When we create this new authority, we should also try to get more men interested in health insurance. If I am paying for my health insurance, I might take more interest in the product I am buying – my health. We should use this as an opportunity to promote men's health. Senator Glynn will agree that men do not go to GPs or look after their health until something is wrong. People say that a man who has a mild heart attack is lucky because he gets a warning.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Many men do not, as the statistics prove. There is no point in our talking about health insurance if we do not recognise that men do not buy into these schemes because they think they are indestructible. Every young man, and I even include Senator Feighan, who is 40, in that—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Only a child.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We think we are like Robocop. That is why I welcome the Bill. It introduces competition into an area where BUPA and VHI enjoy a considerable monopoly. I have never received a mail shot from either organisation. Their advertising does not have any impact on me. That being the case, it means they do not need my custom because they have the market tied up.Competition is important but we should also use this opportunity to look at men's health and tie them into this equation.
