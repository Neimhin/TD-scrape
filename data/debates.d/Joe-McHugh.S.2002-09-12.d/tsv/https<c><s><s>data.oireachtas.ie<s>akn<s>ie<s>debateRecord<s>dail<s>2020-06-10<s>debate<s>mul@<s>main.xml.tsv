JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Cheann Comhairle as a chuidiú agus gabhaim buíochas leis an Choiste Gnó fosta fá choinne an t-am a ofráil inniu. Táim fíorbhuíoch as sin toisc go raibh mé ábalta Dún na nGall a fhágáil chun dul go dtí Teach Laighean ar maidin agus beidh mé ábalta dul a luí i nDún na nGall anocht fosta. A Cheann Comhairle, today's session will focus on the provision of a summer programme and the steps I intend to take to support those students with significant special educational needs and those who are at greatest risk of experiencing educational disadvantage. Last week, when I was in the House, I was conscious that the Business Committee had also scheduled this full session on the issue of a summer programme. I am happy to be here today, in advance of bringing proposals to Cabinet, to hear further from Deputies on the topics concerned. On foot of the constructive engagement we have had in this House in recent weeks, I know Members will bring constructive suggestions and proposals to the House today. I have asked my officials to ensure that we will look at these proposals and will see how we can facilitate them. In introducing a summer programme designed to support children, especially those at risk of regression in their education because of the steps required to combat Covid-19, I will have the support of this House. It is worth reiterating that a lot has happened across the education and skills sector during the 13 weeks since schools, colleges, universities and other settings closed on 12 March. Between now and the end of August, the Government intends to do a lot more, including the provision of targeted supports through a summer programme.  I said last Thursday in this House that the pace at which issues have been identified and addressed over the past three months is a credit to those who work in the sector, the students and their parents. Specifically in regard to the summer programme, that intensity of work has continued over the past few days. I stated that I would return to Cabinet with more detailed proposals this coming Friday, in conjunction with more detail on the wider school re-opening planned for the end of August. I expect to be able to make further announcements at that stage. Normally each summer the July provision operates to benefit more than 10,000 children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities and those with autism. I believe that it is essential that a summer education programme runs this year for those most in need. It will help children to reconnect with learning and assist their return to school in the autumn. An education programme will also help to reduce regression for those at greatest risk of this happening.  In developing proposals for a summer education programme to support children with significant special educational needs, my thinking has been informed by a number of core principles. The programme should contribute to the overall well-being of the child and the family. Supports must address regression and its impact on reintegration and transitioning to planned educational settings for next year.A school-based programme and a home-based programme need to be provided. Supports should be targeted at those students with the greatest needs. Where possible, some degree of flexibility on the operation of the scheme, in terms of timing and duration, should be permitted while recognising the need for equity of summer provision as far as possible for those to whom it is provided. Those children who would normally qualify for the July provision programme should be included. Where possible, some expanded provision to include other children with significant special educational needs should be included, with a focus on those at greatest risk of regression. The programme must be of a high standard and as far as possible it should complement the programme of support being developed by the HSE. There is a need, as far as possible, to integrate the summer programme with a more general return to school in the autumn. The programme has to be operated in a way that is informed by public health advice, is workable and is offered in a way that ensures parents want their children to participate. Normally in summer, school completion projects and DEIS literacy and numeracy summer camps are run in DEIS schools. From speaking to principals and teachers, I know some children at risk of educational disadvantage have found the remote learning experience challenging. However, SNAs, teachers and principals have stayed connected with their students and I acknowledge their role in this regard. We all share a genuine concern that children and young people who may have disengaged as a result of this experience may struggle on return to school. The learning loss that typically occurs for the students during the school summer holidays is likely to be significant. In the current situation, by September 2020 these students will have missed out on formal education since March. A summer programme aimed at those most at risk of educational disadvantage in order to rebuild that connection between student and school is vital. I want a summer education programme to run, recognising that students with special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage need to be prioritised. I assure parents that in the coming days I will be in a position to give them a green light for their children to participate in a summer programme. The programme will be a stepping stone to help those who most need support. It will help children to renew relationships, retain connections with school and learning and help to support ongoing social development and well-being. These programmes can only run with the support of schools, principals, teachers, SNAs and other staff. I know the efforts those working in the education sector have made and the lengths they have gone to in order to support their students. I emphasise that any programme will be voluntary in nature and it will be a matter of individual choice as to whether schools or teachers feel they can participate. I ask those schools, teachers and SNAs who feel they can do something over the summer to help in this endeavour and I ask that they would choose to do this. I cannot pretend that this is a small request given the challenges we have all faced since the pandemic first arrived, but I know that for those who can their contribution to the lives of the most vulnerable children will be truly appreciated and hugely rewarding. I also know that public health guidance to schools and the provision of appropriate supports will be important elements in ensuring that any summer programme can take place. I will return to the Cabinet on Friday to set out the shape of this year's summer programme. I know the positive impact a programme will have and I want to see it happen but we must do so in a safe way for all concerned. Before I conclude I want to make some broader references. I can confirm that since I was last in the House, when I provided an update on how the work on calculated grades for this year's leaving certificate was progressing, the online portal through which schools upload school level marks opened. This happened on Monday, as planned. I was delighted, as I am sure was everyone else in the House, to see us enter phase 2 of the roadmap to the reopening of society. I want to see the maximum return to school possible in late August and September. I will also be updating the Cabinet on Friday on the planning in this regard. The Government and I are committed to the delivery of a summer programme and once I have brought proposals to the Cabinet on Friday I will be in a position to announce the details concerned. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle arís as an seans labhairt inniu. Táim cinnte dóchasach go mbeidh díospóireacht iontach dearfa againn maidir leis an gcéad bhealach eile fá choinne na dtuismitheoirí agus na bpáistí uilig leis na riachtanais speisialta, maidir leis na dúshláin atá le baint amach thar na míonna atá imithe thart, maidir leis an mbearna atá i gceist i gcúrsaí oideachais agus maidir leis an nasc idir an scoil agus an baile.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy will be aware, this is a voluntary scheme. The July provision programme always was voluntary. It depends on demand so once we announce the guidelines on Friday there will be an opportunity for the parents to register with the Department in the first instance. That is the most fundamental part of this proposal. It is a scaled up proposal. It is not based on the July provision programme last year for 10,000 students. We are looking at doubling that. We are looking at the possibility of going a stage further and being more inclusive but the detail of that will be revealed on Friday. The information that everybody will want, particularly the parents, is not just the information on what is available and how to get it but it is also on how they can plan their summer around that. That information will be available on Friday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We can continue to have the conversation here about what the Deputy is looking for and the information the parents are looking for this Friday. We will have the guidelines on Friday. I am bringing them to Cabinet. We will have the final guidelines and details. It will be an expanded scheme. As the Deputy knows, last week I announced I wanted to include Down's syndrome in the scheme, and it will be included. We are also looking at incorporating school completion, for example, and expanding the literacy and numeracy programme we have in 70 DEIS primary schools into post-primary schools. We are looking at a massive increase in the capacity of that scheme, but it will rely on the volunteerism of schools and teachers. From soundings and the leadership we are getting from the likes of the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, at primary level, the indications are quite strong that there is a lot of goodwill and good feeling towards the programme. Ultimately, however, we have to know what the demand is so parents will have an opportunity to register on Friday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy was here last week when I said we would be back again next Wednesday and I would bring a detailed submission and guidelines to Cabinet on Friday. That has not changed. I cannot determine when I am and am not in here. I am absolutely delighted to be back, and today is an opportunity for Deputies, as representatives of their communities and constituencies, to put forward advice as to who they want to see included. The Deputy knows that on Friday we will have the guidelines and a roadmap for the reopening of schools in August and September. He knows these things, so there is no point in coming in here making a song and dance about lack of information or saying we do not have this or that. He already knows this. It is important we are clear, and I will continue to engage here. Today I see all the same faces back again when I look around. They have made constructive suggestions, and I know they will do so again today.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry but I did not catch that. The Deputy said not a-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Let us deal with the Deputy's first question on traditional July provision. Last year, 70% of the summer programme was home based. Out of 4,000 schools, 232 signed up. We will find out within the next three days - after formal contact with the schools and once we have got approval from the Cabinet - what type of feedback we will get from the schools. Our contacts with them so far have been quite positive. Schools will have issues until they know what the working protocol will be. In providing those guidelines, we will be guided by health advice at all times. We are discussing the safety of these children, many of whom have complex medical needs and profound intellectual disabilities. As such, we are very conscious of the work protocol. As to ensuring there is confidence in the scheme working, it relies on its voluntary nature. Deputy Lahart raised the question of whether that should be changed but it is the nature of the scheme. The feedback we are getting from teachers, tutors and SNAs is that they want to be part of it. We will continue working closely with the sector. That is why we have been engaging intensively with the educational stakeholders. From next Friday, schools will know exactly what is happening.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need to establish what is the demand. Parents will have the opportunity to register on Friday, so that will give us an indication of the demand. From an information point of view, provision is not just broken down into school-based and home tuition. There are other school settings and settings outside of school where parents can come together in a group of ten in a community-based setting, such as Spraoi agus Spórt family centre in Carndonagh, County Donegal, Juniper Tree Autism Services in Athlone, Autism Support Louth & Meath, Early Start Education preschool in Rhebogue, Limerick, and Bagenalstown Family Resource Centre in Carlow. There are opportunities for parents to come together there as well. They also have the opportunity of home-based tuition which was 70% of provision last year, so if 70% went for home tuition last year it is going to be heavily weighted in that direction this year. I am confident and ambitious and I know the Deputy is ambitious as well, though he is being sceptical today. He will be familiar with Lower Glanmire national school in New Inn, which did it last year. I hope that the likes of the 232 schools that did it last year will do it again this year, but obviously they have to be confident in doing that themselves.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The contribution prior to Deputy Feighan's contained some more technical questions in respect of which information will be provided on Friday. The Deputy asked about parents requesting home tuition. That is very much part of this scheme and we will have more detail on it. The protocol on work practices for the tutor coming into the house needs to be mapped out before that happens. I reassure parents that the home-based tuition that happened last year and in previous years will also be an option for this year. On opening up and all that, I will be bringing a memo to Cabinet on Friday and we will have a roadmap. Two Sinn Féin Deputies spoke about parents' fears of regression and the gaps that are very obvious in their child's education, something we have also identified in the Department. That is why we are very anxious to have this more expanded summer programme. It will also be a different summer programme where we will work very closely with the Department of Health. One of the pilot projects I was really anxious to progress in my time as Minister was the school inclusion model where we have teachers working side by side with the health professionals, including speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. We will ensure that the co-operation between the Departments of Education and Skills, and Health over recent weeks will not be lost. I assure Deputy Feighan that I have engaged intensively with the Connacht-Ulster alliance. My colleague, the Minister of State, Mary Mitchell O'Connor, has been very proactive. She has been to Galway a number of times. She has been to Sligo and has been up to LYIT in Letterkenny. Dr. Seán Duffy has been appointed as executive lead. I agree with the Deputy that he has the experience and skill set to drive it forward. I expect an application for the Connacht-Ulster alliance technological university to be submitted in quarter 4 of this year, which with time flying by will be very shortly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, this might cover a lot of the other questions that have been raised on the summer programme. On Scoil Chrónáin, I will be happy to ask one of my officials to reach out to her in that regard. There is anxiety and a need to bring clarity to the summer programme as soon as possible. I get that, the frustration coming from parents and the need for that clarity. That is why I am very focused on bringing a properly worked out memorandum to Cabinet on Friday. To answer Deputy Higgins, we will bring clarity to this on Friday. Parents will have an opportunity to register on Friday and we will make that process as easy and as simplified as possible. I have no interest in a bureaucratic process here. In the past it took six to seven weeks to register for the July provision. We are not doing that this year. We want to do it more quickly within the space of a couple of weeks. That is the position that I am finding myself in and I am putting pressure on my officials to make this happen in as speedy a way as possible. On the Down’s syndrome issue raised by the Deputy, there has been an ongoing campaign by the Down’s syndrome representative groups and I know voices in this House, in my own party and across the floor have been voicing this for years. This is the right thing to do which is to be as inclusive as possible. It is also important that we bring clarity as to who can apply and will be covered on Friday. There was an issue last week as to whether, for example, 65% of autism students in the mainstream be excluded. They will not be excluded; they will be included. I will bring clarity to that on Friday as well. Another question concerned any issue which may arise regarding supply of teachers. On another question raised, if there is an issue with the supply of teachers we will look at other creative ways around this. Two Deputies have made suggestions regarding retired teachers. If that is needed we will look at every possibility because the expectation has been created now that this is going ahead. It is going ahead and will do so in a comprehensive manner but at the centre of this is the child. We will make it work and ensure that the parent has a choice to have a school-based setting, but obviously if the school does not volunteer to open that school option will not be there and the home-based setting will be an option as well.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his contribution. As for the different analyses of last week's contributions from the officials and what happened on Friday, basically what happened on Thursday was under certain health advice but on Friday changed everything. On Friday, the NPHET advice was that schools will reopen and the school summer programme could go ahead. When we were given the green light, obviously everything moved into a more expansive phase also. My officials know where I stand on this. I want to be as inclusive as possible and I want to be as ambitious as possible but I am also a realist. I am aware that when one is relying on the voluntary effort of schools to open up, combined with the choice of parents as to whether they want to use the home-school programme or the school-based programme, one is dealing with a number of unknowns. The known aspect that we have is through a consultation. The Deputy asked what consultation there has been. We consulted the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, which is the representative body for more than 126 special schools in the State. The association has been very honest and upfront about where it sees the challenges. There were discussions on the summer programme but the association is also thinking of August and September. We have to balance the NPHET advice and the protocols we have on what can work, be it home-based or school-based.We have to ensure parents have the confidence to send their children to schools if the schools should decide to open. The Deputy is correct to ask about the measures that will be in place in relation to hand sanitisers and equipment to ensure schools are clean enough. All those details will be provided on Friday through the guidelines. I will get back to the Deputy on the number of SNAs working with Tusla, because that number is changing all the time. On the question around summer works, our protocol and protocol guidelines are developed in Tullamore in the planning and building unit. We have a budget for this year and that budget has not changed. The budget for the building programme was decided on last October. The Department is working closely with schools which are ready to go to tender or which are ready to go to construction. We are working through those. The Deputy's specific question was around summer works and he is correct in saying this is the time to get that work done, when the schools are vacant. That will go ahead in any schools that got funding for summer works for this summer. This is the time to do emergency works as well. I am glad to say that in the past number of weeks work has restarted on the Western Building Systems schools with which we had issues. Obviously, the workplace guidelines that construction workers work within in general apply within the education sector as well. I wish to return to the issue of the summer programme. The reason I want to have an expansive summer programme is that we have identified, as has the Deputy and as have parents, that there are gaps in education. There is regression, and the Deputy will have had constituency representation on this and will have had direct contact with parents. Parents can see that there has been a regression in their son's or daughter's progress. Equally, schools have been very proactive in reaching out. I am hearing great stories. For example, in Scoil Mhuire, Glenties, the SNA has arrived at the house and waved in the window at the student over the past couple of months. Principals are staying in touch with parents, staying connected. However, it is no substitute for the physical presence within the school. That is why the focus of the summer programme will be on reconnecting. It is a focus on education. There will be a reconnection to ensure that the move back to school for many vulnerable students in August and September will not be as big a leap as it otherwise would have been. I said last week that I would be in here today without the guidelines because I am bringing it to Cabinet this Friday, but on Friday parents will have the opportunity to register. That will give us an opportunity to see what the level of demand is. We are going to work very closely with those parents to make this happen.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the comments made by the Deputy. I do not know how much longer I will be in my current position. One of the things I have greatly valued during my time in the Department is that its officials are very open-minded and good to work with. There are times when we have differing opinions, but that is life and it brings discussion and an energy to the Department. On the issue of the summer education programme, there has been intense and focused work at departmental level. That is not to take away from the other big issues that arose in recent months, such as calculated grades for the leaving certificate, the junior certificate cycle or dealing with all of the other conundrums for which, basically, there is no manuscript. One of the things I value and very much respect within the Department is its response to any issues or challenges that arise. We have a challenge to meet on this issue. The Deputy is correct to ask about what happens if a school says "No". That has occurred in the context of July provision. A particular school with which I am familiar has a phenomenal reputation. It has ASD classes and a rich tradition of school inclusion, but it has never opened the school for a summer-based programme. However, it worked to ensure that tutors were provided for the students. A very significant stand-out figure is that under a traditional programme, 70% of July provision is home-based. That means that out of 4,000 schools, 232 would open. However, I am confident that as a result of engagement, not just at official level but also between the likes of the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, the Catholic Primary School Management Association, CPSMA, and other umbrella groups, we will be in a strong position to try to facilitate parents as best we can. The programme is voluntary in nature, but it is trying to give parents a choice. The parents to whom I, Deputy Ó Ríordáin and every other Deputy speak are under pressure. They have had a tough few months. I am a parent with three children and I know the stressed environment that arises from balancing working from home, such as trying to do a web exercise relating to the leaving certificate with departmental officials, with trying to help with Irish homework. It is difficult to jump from office to kitchen. I know the intensity of juggling home schooling and work. There are additional pressures for the parents of children with serious to profound intellectual disabilities. I get that. That is why I think Deputies will comprehensively facilitate this summer programme as best they can by using their contacts and network, whether in Glanmire, Darndale, elsewhere in Dublin or Letterkenny, to try to encourage people to show leadership and make this work. I believe we will do so.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are three strands, if the Deputy wants to break it down into specifics. There is a health-based strand, and I am working very closely with the Minister, Deputy Harris, and his officials are working closely with mine, with regard to children with complex medical needs. There are potentially 600 students in that category. I am meeting the Minister, Deputy Harris, at 3 p.m. to go through the work we have done and to come up with a roadmap for those children. There is also the traditional July provision, which 10,000 students availed of last year, and that has been the average for the past couple of years. Some 70% of those were based at home and 30% were based in school. I want to add to that July provision and, in particular, I want to ensure that those with Down’s syndrome are included as they were not included before. That is additionality to the July provision which is going to be new. I want to re-emphasise that there are many students with specific disabilities in the mainstream. They are not going to be excluded and they will be included also. The third strand is disadvantage, which I know is the Deputy’s specific concern. We are looking at school completion and literacy and numeracy at both primary and secondary level. There are 70 DEIS schools in the literacy and numeracy programme and we want to add to that. That is another area of additionality.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	NEPS has continuously been directly involved with the schools since 12 March and, in fact, it would have had a significant role in determining the cancellation of the leaving certificate in terms of the impact on well-being and mental health of students. NEPS has a critical role. Part of the weakness and the negative we in the Department have identified is that, because of the regression, it is about reconnecting with the schools. From engagement with parents, including individual engagements I have with parents, I know parents want to see a stepping stone. This is a stepping stone to re-engagement and reconnecting with the school in August and September. If students need counselling support or any other support, that range of supports is there through NEPS and will be provided.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There will be further clarity on the range of openings. One thing I have identified, as have my officials and the team with which I work, is that as the summer programme has a home-based strand and a school based strand, there could be different starting points. Registration starts on Friday and one will have a very simplified process. I do not want a bureaucratic process in terms of conveying basic information to the Department. We want to start that process. We are looking at July but obviously there could be an overlap into August, potentially, for some of the school-based programmes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There always will be individual examples and cases. In the main, since 12 March schools have stayed connected and have not closed. While school buildings have closed, the education has not closed. Parents of children with special needs have seen ongoing engagement, be it the SNAs or principals staying in touch. Maybe that did not happen in all cases but in the main, that is the feedback we have received. The physical presence in the school is what has been missing and that is why we want to reconnect. We feel that this measure is a stepping stone for a lot of children who potentially have regressed. It is also an opportunity for parents to acknowledge assistance. One parent to whom I spoke this morning could not praise the SNA highly enough in terms of providing an ongoing connection. The measure is about reconnection. Yes, we need to be mindful of any gaps or teachers who need support because while we all have come through this pandemic, some of us have been affected in a more negative way than others, especially those who have lost loved ones.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The details of the scheme will be discussed on Friday and I will provide the information at a public level. With regard to the specific concern of the parent in Lucan who does not have a school opened in the general area, and perhaps never had, we call it home-based tuition but it does not necessarily have to be in the house. It can be as creative as possible. There is a lot of evidence in this regard. The relationship between the tutor and the student is important. There will be protocols, including health protocols and guidelines, on how it should work. I do not want to speculate today. I will wait until Friday to announce what it will look like. There are options for that parent in Lucan. It is about ensuring the subsidy can go directly to parents to ensure they can decide what is best for their children.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The pupil-teacher ratio and the allocation of teachers are all part of the budget and I will not change the budget midway through the year. I get the Deputy's point and it was raised quite extensively in the House in discussing the challenges we will encounter in August and September with regard to extra resources. This is why I am engaging very closely with education stakeholders to ensure the roadmap we will provide on Friday for school reopenings will incorporate some of the concerns the Deputy has raised. With regard to the school looking to retain the teacher, there is an independent appeals process and I suggest the school goes through that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is a matter for the Business Committee. I was here last week and I was here two weeks before that. I am second to the Minister, Deputy Harris, as the most frequent ministerial visitor to the House. I am happy to be here again today but last week I said quite clearly with regard to coming here today that the memo on the roadmap would go to the Government on Friday.To respond on the needs of the parents, the Deputy is correct in saying that parents want certainty and clarity on this. I will ensure that once we issue the guidelines on Friday, not alone will they have clarity but they will also register. This is Wednesday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have 70,000 teachers in the primary and post-primary sectors. The pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools will decline naturally because of demographics. Speaking as a former school teacher, the fewer pupils one has in a class, the better the teaching environment for the teacher. That is a given but the challenge we have in the annual budget is deciding how much money will go into certain areas. This is an example of one of those conflicts. I remember last September and October arguing back and forth with the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe on the need for more money for education. There are choices between third level education, special needs education so on. We are spending €2 billion out of €11 billion every year on special needs education but it is still not enough. The pupil-teacher ratio should also be lower. Commitments were given during the election to that effect and we all agree we should work towards that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know the Acting Chairman has raised this issue as well and I am conscious that Deputy Brophy has raised it on a number of occasions. I am aware of the issue and my officials are examining it with a view to finding a solution.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his contribution. He asked a question around resources that will go into the summer programme. Obviously, it is a demand-led scheme and is based on volunteerism. Last year, the July provision cost a little over €16 million. We are looking at an expanded scheme this year. This involves bringing in other groups. We will be looking to add significantly to the €16 million investment. Certainly, financial resources will not be a barrier in respect of this new summer programme. The challenge lies in the supply of schools in terms of school openings and teachers and tutors coming forward, as well as the availability of SNAs. Teachers and SNAs have been highly engaged. Obviously, on the basis of his contribution the Deputy holds SNAs in high regard and I agree with him wholeheartedly. There are 17,000 SNAs in the country and they are the epicentre of every school. Students know them by their first names and on a highly personal basis. A report was completed during my term as Minister on what needs to be done for SNAs in terms of status and ensuring they get the proper professional qualification and recognition. Those recommendations need to be implemented because they are really important. The Deputy also mentioned school secretaries. This is something for which I campaigned when I was in opposition and on the other side of the House and I wanted to see it brought to a conclusion during my term. That did not happen and at present, the issue of school secretaries and caretakers is with the Workplace Relations Commission. I hope progress can be made. It will be a budgetary decision for an incoming Government. There are a series of choices. In any event, I agree with the Deputy on secretaries and the responsible role they play. As someone pointed out during a previous debate, they are the glue of the school and are really important. As for the priority of university status for the south-east region, we are on the same page. Whether it is a university for the south east or the north west, if we are to really focus on regional development, we need to have a university in the south east. I have spoken to officials in the higher education section of the Department in recent weeks. There is momentum at the minute. The application is being made ready and I believe we will be in a strong position for a university in the south east towards the end of the year.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy spoke about school places for children with special educational needs. What has happened here is that this is not just a Dublin or Cork based issue any more. Obviously there was a lot of pressure last year in Dublin 15. I did enact the legislation to which the Deputy referred but critical to that legislation was the co-operation of school authorities. We had a tremendous focus on the ground, engaging with the principals. I want to acknowledge, in particular, Monsignor Dan O'Connor who was pivotal in ensuring that we got the extra places. There may be issues in Offaly or other parts of the Deputy's constituency with regard to places. Obviously, school principals may have reservations and concerns about what this would look like and whether they would have the proper resources to create the best environment for their students. It is about having that leadership at a local level as well. Enacting the legislation is one thing but having a spirit of co-operation on the ground from management authorities is also critical.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his contribution and his proposal. We are keeping the conversation line open on early intervention classes, and there will be more detail on same on Friday. I agree with his point about the transition from preschool to primary. We are engaging on it and will provide more clarity on Friday. He raised a range of issues concerning needs and schools knowing what the score was. No one more than I wants to get that information out there as quickly as possible, but the guidelines will be out on Friday. Parents can register and schools that are interested will be able to let the Department know. The Deputy asked who was responsible. The Department of Education and Skills is responsible because we signed a cheque for €16 million last year. My Department is responsible for the continuation of this specific summer programme and the expanded July programme, but the Department of Health is involved where complex medical needs students are concerned and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is involved in terms of school completion. There is a wide interaction between a number of Departments.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank both Deputies for their contributions. If we went with last year's July provision, we could announce it and everything would be out there. The reason there has been a delay is because we are incorporating two other Departments, the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs on the disadvantaged side. Deputies can tell their constituents that children with severe and profound intellectual disabilities will qualify. Children who were eligible for July provision last year will qualify again this year. In addition, children with Down's syndrome will be included. We are considering a number of other areas to try to be as inclusive and responsive to the gaps Deputies identified in terms of regression. We want to utilise the time this summer for the summer programme to act as a stepping stone to reconnect with schools in September. Parents are worried about regression, the gaps in education and disconnection from schools, their peers, SNAs and teaching staff. There are challenges therein and a confidence issue because we are opening up as a country and people are making small steps towards going back to business premises and shops. These steps are slow and there are concerns and fears on the part of the education community, which I acknowledge. That is why we are working with stakeholders. We have consulted AsIAm, Down's syndrome representatives and Inclusion Ireland. Their voices have been critical to ensuring that we have a comprehensive programme. On Friday, we will have the guidelines and information available to parents who will be able to register from that point. I am hopeful and confident about July provision, and I know everybody in the House is ambitious for our most vulnerable community. We will work together to make this happen. Deputy Fitzmaurice is correct that schools need more certainty, as do SNAs in terms of their job security. The front-loaded model deferred for a year because of Covid-19 will be introduced in the 2021-22 school year. If there are specific examples of students who need SNA support this September, there is a mechanism for them to appeal on those grounds.
