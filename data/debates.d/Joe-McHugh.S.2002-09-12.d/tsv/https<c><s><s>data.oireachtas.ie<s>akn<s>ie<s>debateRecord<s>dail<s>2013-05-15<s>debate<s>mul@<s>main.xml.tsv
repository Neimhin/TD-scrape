JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá lúcháir orm a bheith anseo ag an díospóireacht seo faoi ábhar iontach tábhachtach 15 bliain i ndiaidh shíniú Chomhaontú Aoine an Chéasta. I am pleased to contribute to this very important debate 15 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. I acknowledge the role played by members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement who visited Belfast prior to the flags protest and, more recently, to evaluate opinion at both community and political levels. The peace process, 15 years after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, is very much in its infancy. Developments in recent months have been a wake-up call which has highlighted the fragility of the process. It is important to note, however, that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland share an overwhelming desire not to return to the dark days of the past. Much effort is being invested in the peace process at civic, community, church and political level in the North and it is important to acknowledge this collective effort being made by former combatants, church leaders, community activists and civic society. Let us not forget the politicians in Northern Ireland. While criticism from the sidelines often dominates the narrative, it is important to point out that change is slow, especially in a society where some people are segregated by concrete walls and less than 7% of education provided in the jurisdiction is integrated. Notwithstanding this, the warm welcome afforded the First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, in Derry at the official opening of the Peace Bridge is very much a sign of progress. Equally, the warm reception received by the Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, at the official opening of the Skainos Centre in east Belfast also offers testament to the progress that has been made. Politicians in Northern Ireland cannot travel alone on this important peace journey. Westminster and Dublin still have a very important role to play, whether in terms of engaging at North-South ministerial level or North-South inter-parliamentary level or in day-to-day contact on important matters such as health care, transport or agriculture. The important work of the North-South bodies needs to continue apace and where pragmatic and practical solutions for enhanced co-operation are an option, they should be grasped immediately. Fifteen years on from the Good Friday Agreement, citizens need to see tangible economic benefits from cross-Border co-operation, examples of which include the planned radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin Hospital which will open in 2016, the Narrow Water Bridge which will connect County Louth to Warrenpoint and the A5 road connection through the north west. The east-west strand of the Good Friday Agreement should not be ignored either. I acknowledge the work of Deputy Frank Feighan who chairs the British-Irish sovereign committee. Deputy Feighan has shown excellent leadership and dedication on the decade of commemoration. I also acknowledge the ever present interest of the US Government in the peace process. Through the work of the US embassy in Dublin and US consulate in Belfast, the US Administration is kept abreast of ongoing developments and progress. Outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement include an Irish language Bill, a Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, a charter of rights for the island of Ireland and a civic forum. It is of the utmost importance that these matters are kept high on the agenda. What was normal in Northern Ireland in the past is different from what is normal in the North today. A British army checkpoint in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, has been replaced with a hairdressing salon. On a recent trip to Belfast, I was able to roll down the car window to get directions to Coláiste Feirste, as Gaeilge, from a city council employee. That a recent five part television series, "The Fall", could be based in Belfast and not be about the Troubles is progress in a society that is becoming normalised. The irony of a programme depicting a serial killer on the loose in Belfast being considered a reflection of a normalised society will not be lost on many dark humoured citizens of the city. It is important to create a space for politicians and civic society in Northern Ireland to develop their vision, one which is based on consent and accepts difference. Interwoven in this vision is the serious business of grappling with legacy issues. The weight of the past cannot be ignored. The Parades Commission is working tirelessly with communities to avoid contentious parades. With more than 4,500 parades taking place annually, this can be a very difficult task. The progress we have observed in recent days with regard to a parade in Rasharkin and good work being done in other places such as Castlederg are very welcome. I acknowledge the role of all involved in seeking a way forward. As a Donegal man and an Ulster man, I am aware that Ulster people are often accused of being a little "thran". For those who are not familiar with Scottish vernacular, this expression means that Ulster people do not like being told what to do. This could help explain to PhD students seeking to explore voting trends the reason County Donegal consistently votes "No" in referendums. On the other hand, the people of Ulster are big enough and bold enough to know that this peace journey, which is very much in its infancy, will require help along the way. I ask Deputies to reach out to our neighbours who are only a few miles up the road. I look forward to working with them on issues of concern to all of the people of this island, North and South.
