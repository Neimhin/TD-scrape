JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Much needs to be said in such a short time but I will focus on the primary aspect of BreastCheck in particular. According to the Minister of State, there will be a commencement of the national roll-out of BreastCheck in 2007 but what does this mean? Should we not be in the process of rolling it out now? I do not understand what commencement of the national roll-out of BreastCheck in 2007 means. This sends out a negative and sinister signal to 130,000 women who are not availing of the service at present because, as stated by my colleague, Senator Cummins, they live in a certain part of the country. In the 2004 programme 50,000 women on the east coast availed of BreastCheck, 1,687 needed to return for assessments and 309 were diagnosed with cancer. Interventions were made and they are undergoing treatment. However, 130,000 women in the north west and west cannot avail of BreastCheck and have been told today that the roll-out will commence in 2007. I request clarification on this issue.I will make a specific point about secondary care. Currently, Letterkenny has a temporary surgical oncologist but needs a permanent one as staff cannot otherwise create reliable action plans. I wish to focus on tertiary care and an important point about radiotherapy treatment, on which I want immediate clarification. The Tánaiste met the Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, Mr. Shaun Woodward, MP, and it has been agreed that the new Belfast cancer centre, which was due to open next March, will not treat patients from County Donegal. This centre will treat people from a population base of 1.5 million but the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has stated Mr. Woodward said it will not treat Donegal patients. This is a fallacy as Mr. Woodward, speaking on Highland Radio, stated categorically that the Belfast centre will treat patients from County Donegal if a bed is available. Northern Irish patients will come first while patients from counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim will come second if beds are available. This is the most sinister development of cancer care services in this country, where we can lie to the people and tell them——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——they will be treated.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why did it not state that?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why was the word "if" not included?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a difference between "will" and "if".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will this guarantee patients from Donegal treatment in Belfast? It will not. It should state "if", not "will".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I want clarification on that because this is sending out false signals and inaccuracies to the people living in the north west, who pay their taxes but cannot get investment in roads or cancer services or funding for 70 extra beds in Letterkenny General Hospital. My colleague, Senator Cummins, hit the nail on the head, that we do not have a population base big enough to cater for public-private partnership and, as a result, no private investor is willing to come in to Donegal or the north west on any project, be it roads, health, etc. That is why we did not get gas connection and proper road infrastructure.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is a problem. We should be subsidising people who pay their taxes and deserve equitable treatment. Equitable treatment is all we seek.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are not playing politics. We are representing our people.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have not been political; I simply want clarification.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is not in the Minister of State's speech, which states that they will be treated. Will all Donegal women be treated?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	And all areas of Donegal?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not political. It is about women getting a service to which they are entitled.
