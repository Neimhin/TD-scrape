JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It has been an interesting presentation and it is good to see positive work being done.  The group is ahead of the posse as many people are only dabbling with potential ideas.  Does the group have any contacts in Donegal or does its network extend that far?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know him.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will it work in Donegal?  The witnesses are not worried about the climate.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Donegal Creameries will have the largest organic farm in Europe, amounting to approximately 3,000 acres.  There is a possibility of reaching out to that company because it is interested in organic crops and renewable energy sources will form part of that.  Deputy Power hit the nail on the head in that it is our job to convince our network of farmers and constituents who have idle land of this crop.  There is a mentality of getting subsidised and leaving fields idle so we must challenge that in order to get farmers back farming.I would have been involved in setting potatoes in a 12 acre field years ago.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I assume harvesters are used.  Can a machine put the crop in the soil without drills?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is similar to corn.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is the autumn season in farming, as the Chairman will know.  There are slatted houses lying empty and farmers who cannot get stocking credit from the banks.  Beef is a sustainable industry in terms of the market.  Is Ms Kehoe receiving any indications from banks that they will look more favourably upon this type of industry than on existing practices?  At the moment farmers cannot get credit.
