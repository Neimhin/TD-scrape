JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	We have been working on that issue and I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Ring in that regard. I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív that the Minister longs to answer such questions in the Dáil. However, that would have meant putting back the other ministerial questions but we now have agreement he will be coming before the Dáil in the next couple of weeks.
