JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Given the misbehaviour of some of the class this morning, perhaps we should have a discussion on school discipline?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps we should join the INTO's campaign on class size?  There may be a problem with class size here that is giving rise to unruly behaviour.Senator O'Toole referred to the Border, midlands and western region.  He made the point that it has not been highlighted.  My colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, has raised this matter on a monthly, if not weekly, basis since this House was constituted.  We already know the figures.  In the mid-term review of 2003, there was an underspend of €400 million.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are now coming to the end of the cycle and that figure has doubled.  Anybody working in the Civil Service or in policy who thinks constant reinvestment in the east will provide a solution to the mass urbanisation and traffic congestion is wrong.  The solution lies in investing in infrastructure in the west.  If we can provide critical access to the west, the north west and the south west in terms of roads, infrastructure, ports and airports, we will offer a solution to people in the east.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When the people of the east are considering what way to vote, perhaps they should look to the development of the west as a solution.  If we invest in the west, it will make their lives easier and they will not have as much traffic congestion.  The IDA may be able to invest in places like Donegal, Mayo, Galway and Kerry if proper access and infrastructure is provided.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The west can provide a solution to the problems of the east.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. a1a:In page 6, line 19, after "sea" to insert "or an oyster bed".These amendments were resubmitted because before this was put to the Dáil, there was a general consensus that the native oyster would not be subject to law and that people in the native oyster industry would not be subject to new proceedings.  I have tabled the amendment to have it on record, although I do not propose to press it.The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Gallagher, will be familiar with the Foyle and the serious problems many of the area's major stakeholders and practitioners are experiencing in the areas of mussels or oysters.  Many of those involved in the industry find it difficult to develop a sustainable zoned management strategy.  Any strategy must be developed from the bottom up.I am glad departmental officials are in the House.  We must focus our efforts on moving forward with the new legislation with all the stakeholders and not just the representative organisations.  There are active harbour committees on either side of Lough Foyle but we must also convince practitioners of future plans and strategy.  Through his colleague, Deputy Keaveney, the Minister of State, a native of County Donegal, will be familiar with the challenges which lie ahead on the Foyle.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Kenneally's question was broadly in line with a question I intended to ask.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 6a:In page 26, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(3) In—(a) subsection (2)(a), ‘freshwater fish’ means any fish living in freshwater, other than a kind of fish that migrates to and from the sea, and(b) subsection (2)(e), ‘shell-fish’ means any aquatic mollusc or crustacean having a shell and includes all aquatic bivalve molluscs of the Ostreoida order, particularly members of the Ostreina and Pectinina suborders.”.Much of the discussion in the Dáil referred to freshwater fishing.  The practitioners on the ground and those involved in the industry were very appreciative of the movement which allowed many of their recommendations and suggestions to be taken on board.  The Minister has also added fish such as sea bass and tope to this list of definitions.  The amendment is similar to that taken in the Dáil.  I wish to record the appreciation in this regard.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I, too, welcome the passing of the Bill.  I offer a guarded welcome also to the work of the commission.  Its work was difficult because the advisory forum set up on both sides of the Border did not really have the right mechanisms in place due to the fact the Assembly was not up and running.  Now we expect the Assembly to be up and running, it is important we have a proper working advisory forum that works in tandem with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD, and the harbour boards on both sides of the Border.The Bill provides us with the opportunity to develop an effective loughs agency.  However, it is important to involve and bring all the stakeholders on board on the issue.  There is a feeling of disenfranchisment among stakeholders and it is important to get their agreement and that of all the relevant groups on this.  I hope that will be achieved through this Bill.  No doubt, our Department officials will ensure this happens.  The only way proper licensing will happen is through the commission, but it must work under the authority of a proper working advisory forum.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to be associated with Senator Brady's comments.  While we are considering the big picture we also need to get the detail right.  I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister's officials for all their endeavours.To digress for a moment, will the Minister use his good offices and direct line to the born-again squeaky green Taoiseach who is going to Donegal tomorrow where he will perform several duties?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Probably, and counting at this stage because he will be under serious pressure from his many candidates in that constituency.  Could the Minister use his good offices to encourage the Taoiseach to go to a conference in Redcastle which is considering the environment and alternative energy sources?  The Minister is probably aware of Inishowen Rural Development Limited, IRDL, a hard-working group which is studying best practice models in Sweden, Norway and Finland which they will discuss tomorrow.  As the Taoiseach is on the green warpath he may find time tomorrow to call into the Carlton Redcastle Hotel.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I referred to examples of best practice as the Minister will appreciate.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister brought the nuclear issue into the debate.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was referring to best practice.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It has many other examples of best practice.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  A report has been presented today to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and it is an indictment of the level of investment in the past ten years.  I will talk specifically about the interdepartmental report, launched in Donegal in July 2006, and the task force report commissioned by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.A plan was supposed to have been put in place by the Government for Donegal but it has not materialised.  Today's report on the Border, midlands and western region identifies negatives and gaps apparent to the public in Donegal for some considerable time.  The region encompasses a number of counties but no county has suffered as much as County Donegal as a result of the lack of investment.At the end of June 2005, the total spend was 50% of the original forecast.  That followed a mid-term review in 2003 which found there had been a €400 million underspend in the BMW region on infrastructure and ancillary investment.  There was a 36% underspend on agriculture and rural development, a 41% underspend on sea fisheries development and a 35% underspend on industry.The BMW regional assembly commissioned a study whose results, to say the least, are alarming.  An audit of innovation report was produced in 2004 which showed a disproportionately low number of new company start-ups in the BMW region; an overall low level of company performance and growth; a number of weaknesses in innovation; low levels of research and development, venture capital and entrepreneurial culture; weaknesses in the ICT and pharmaceutical sectors; an absence of links with third level institutions; and vulnerability due to lack of or poor infrastructure in air services, telecommunications, road and rail networks and energy.The innovation report was presented in November 2005 to the Taoiseach, with suggestions for improvements and solutions for places such as Donegal and the greater BMW region.  The audit was produced in 2004.  This is 2007 and little or no progress has occurred.  I was part of a team that commissioned the report, Creating a More Inclusive Labour Market, two years ago.  We presented a series of key recommendations to assist the labour market in Donegal and regarding key areas of investment.  These have not been realised either.County Donegal has a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit despite the successive lack of investment by the Government.  In the face of the constraints presented by peripherality and the lack of road and rail links, telecommunications and broadband infrastructure, we have managed to fight the fight.  Rather than talk about the past, I call on the Minister to outline a map for progress in County Donegal.  The Government must implement policy as it should be implemented.  The underspend of €400 million in 2003 on the BMW region, including Donegal, can no longer be justified, especially given what will happen in Donegal in the future.  The new institutions will be up and running as a result of the re-establishment of the Assembly and we must work closely with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, with Donegal County Council and with the people we represent.There have been lame duck excuses for not investing in the west, such as that offered by the Department of Finance two years ago which stated that the reason for pumping investment into infrastructural projects in the east was to clear the bottlenecks.  It is time Government representatives and Ministers realised that the solution to the problems in the east is to open up infrastructure in the west.  If proper infrastructure and access can be provided in counties Clare, Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, IDA Ireland will start to source potential business for those regions.  If we provide free access to the west of Ireland, we can provide a solution to the bottlenecks in the east.We need a strategy that will work and that encompasses every aspect of infrastructure, from rail to broadband to port and airport solutions.  We must have that strategy.  An opportunity was missed in the past ten years.  People in the north west and west will no longer accept the lame duck excuses for successive investment in the east of the country.  The solution lies in opening up the west and north west.  We do not need any more excuses for the lack of progress and for not following the policy that has been mapped out for almost 20 years.
