JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will make a couple of brief points.  An integrated transport infrastructure was supposed to be provided as part of the Good Friday Agreement, for which people on both sides of the Border voted in 1998.  I am concerned that there is no evidence of integrated or joined-up thinking in the work of the National Transport Authority.My colleague, Deputy Coveney, spoke about Bus Éireann in the context of the school transport issue.  I am aware that the Department of Education and Skills is responsible for the Bus Éireann tendering system.  It is envisaged that a new tendering system will come into operation in September 2011.  Does the authority have a role in that regard?  Perhaps the officials can clarify whether it does.  Many of those who are operating under the old scheme are aware that a new scheme will be introduced.  It was indicated to me that information on it would be provided before Christmas, but it does not look like that will happen.  Perhaps the delegates can clarify the matter.Is there any point in asking about integrated ticketing in Sligo?  I will not waste the delegates' time if Sligo is outside their remit.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The remit of the National Transport Authority has been extended to Galway, Limerick, Cork and Waterford.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is encouraging.  Perhaps that can be referred to in future contributions.  It is not that we are more sensitive in the north west.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Historically, we have been used to playing second fiddle.  The north west should be mentioned in the authority's plan.  I am aware that Letterkenny was mentioned in the smart programme.The fuel rebate scheme is a significant issue in rural areas.  The rebate paid to Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus is €276 million.  The lifting of the rebate in service routes and school routes in rural transport areas is a big problem at the moment.  Are there any plans to review or re-evaluate the scheme to try to help private operators?  It is not fair that private operators which provide public services are not treated in the same vein as public operators in urban areas.That is all I have to say.  I am a little concerned by the lack of reference to areas outside Limerick.  I do not mean any disrespect to Cork, Galway or Waterford when I say that.  If the authority is to provide for an integrated system, it needs to bear in mind that integrated transport is one of the fundamental tenets of the Good Friday Agreement.  We should seek greater connectivity between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  While the National Transport Authority will clearly engage in this area, the matter has not been mentioned.
