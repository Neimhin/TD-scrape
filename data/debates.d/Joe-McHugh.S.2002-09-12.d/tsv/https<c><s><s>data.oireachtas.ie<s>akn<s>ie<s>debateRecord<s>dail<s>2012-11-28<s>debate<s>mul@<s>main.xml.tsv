JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. I wish to raise this issue again in a public forum. In July for many members from within the fishing community and along the west coast from Malin Head to Valentia it was a case of déjà vu or ground-hog day coming back to bite us with respect to the Malin Head and Valentia scenarios. The reality is that we are faced with a situation in this country where reconfigurations are taking place throughout the State boards. All sectors, bar none, are included in the reconfiguration options. Let us consider the process since July. I wish to acknowledge the type of political process that has been employed. In fairness, it has been cross-community, cross-sector, cross-Border and cross-political in nature. There has been constructive engagement and this reflects the mood of the people from within the coastal voluntary services, within the fishing community and internally within the staff of the Coast Guard. I am keen to see how far advanced this constructive mechanism has come. I commend individuals from within the Coast Guard. I recall the Minister travelled to Malin Head on 27 July. He was accompanied by Chris Reynolds, head of the Coast Guard. That served as an interesting forum to discuss the various permutations within the sector. Certainly, we had a disagreement on what would represent the best mechanism to start off the conversation. I was keen to bring in various sectors and members of the community. In fairness, the Minister was insistent that he wanted to find out what was happening in the area and what services were being employed. The divisional manager at the Coast Guard station was interested in putting forward ideas to the Minister and these ideas have been put back into the system.The Minister stated he would not accept any recommendation made in the Fisher report until he had his own thought process analysed. The hearings by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications provided people with another opportunity to put across their points of view. It is welcome that extra time has been provided to allow Fisher consultants to undertake a further review. While I am regularly critical of consultancies for the sake of having them, this one allowed people time to get their heads around different reconfigurations. I have raised the issue today because of the indicative timeframe of the end of October given in regard to a possible announcement on the issue. We are now approaching December and the Minister has had time to consider the further review undertaken by Fisher consultants. It would be welcome if he could update the House on the current position in terms of a decision being announced.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister's reply, in particular the sentence which states the three centres will remain open. This will be welcomed by all those involved in the sector, be it at voluntary or professional level in the Coast Guard, the fishing community or coastal communities in general. This outcome is the result of the application of common sense at the helm with due consideration being given to need closely aligning with process. It has been a lengthy process. While the current process commenced in July, the issue has been with us for the best part of 30 years. I acknowledge that the Minister is awaiting completion of the action plan. It is hoped the reconfiguration and insight provided by personnel within the Coast Guard will be closely considered. I know that people within the sector have the capability, vision and expertise to make this work. I acknowledge that operation of the three centres, given the constraints in terms of the recruitment embargo, will be a challenge. However, those involved can make this work. I compliment the staff who have shown vision in this process. I also compliment them on not falling into the trap of making a political football out of this sensitive and important matter. I also acknowledge the Minister's role in this matter, in particular informing us in advance of the announcement of receipt of the report in his office in July. He said at the time that he was prepared to listen and would not react or be forced into a decision based on a consultant's report. It is welcome that he and his officials have engaged on the issue. I acknowledge the work of his officials who attended the recent joint committee meeting. I do not intend to get involved in a discussion on his comments on that meeting which were directed at particular individuals. The officials have been competent throughout this process and had a keen listening ear to proposals from politicians across the political spectrum and community sector.
