JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State and his delegation and apologise for being late.Some homework can be done on this issue quickly, easily and pragmatically.  Oyster licence approval is pending in places such as Trawbreaga Bay in north Inishowen.  Workers are on protective notice and will cease to operate if they do not receive licences; this is a simple bureaucratic issue.  I previously tabled a parliamentary question, including the licence number, and can pass on the details to the departmental officials after the meeting, if necessary.I will not go into the question of Marine Harvest, as it is no longer a Donegal company; my colleague, Deputy Tom Sheahan, will address the matter.  It is now a west of Ireland company which flies the flag for salmon farming.  It is awaiting grant allocations for operations in Bantry Bay and is not included in the BMW region.  Deputy Sheahan will address the grant allocation from the European Union that is €1.2 million short.  Fish are produced in Bantry Bay and processed in County Donegal where there are 224 experienced staff with an average of ten years' experience.  If grant approval is not given to the operation in Bantry Bay, there will not be the processing spin-off in County Donegal; it is all interlinked.  Therefore, it is important that grant approval is given.The Minister of State came to Greencastle and Killybegs and has taken the whitefish sector seriously with reference to area 6.  He went back to the European Union to negotiate on mesh size and to get Irish fishermen back into area 6.  However, while on paper the latter has occurred, some fishermen do not have any days at sea, based on fishing effort in previous years.  Others have one or two days at sea, which makes no sense.  Fishermen on 12 m boats fall under the same criteria and only have one or two days at sea.  A fisherman in Greencastle telephoned me to say he had a €40,000 mortgage on a boat, three young children and only two days at sea; this does not make sense.  I know the target date for renegotiation is 2012 and that the Minister of State will say we should watch out for the Hague preferences but we should use the yardstick of 2012 to try to construct a practical methodology for fishing effort.  The sizes are not working and dead monkfish are being discarded overboard because, as Deputy Creed mentioned, fishermen are afraid of the criminal sanctions that may face those who bring them ashore.  The system is not working.  Spanish and French fishermen can land fish without the attention of bailiffs and officers.  This is not a case of paranoia among fishermen because the feeling is felt throughout the country.  This is an island nation and it is facing discrimination with regard to its No. 1 natural resource.The yardstick is 2012 but another will be evident in October: the Lisbon treaty.  If the Taoiseach is still at the helm of the country in October and intends to have the treaty passed in a second referendum, he will need the support of coastal communities which are not comprised solely of people living in Bantry Bay, Castletownbere, Greencastle, Killybegs and Wicklow, Deputy Doyle's constituency; this matter runs through the thread of the fabric of who we are.  This is an island nation and we must fight for the proper treatment of Irish fishermen to allow them to work, even on a small scale on small boats; this is in the interests of conservation and sustainability.  As the dole queues get longer, people will be unable to put bread on the table for their children.  I will not point out what the Minister of State and I know fishermen will do, as people who need to put bread on the table.  We may have all the rules in the world and there may be threats of criminal charges, court cases and so on but if people in coastal communities cannot work and put bread on the table, they will go fishing.
