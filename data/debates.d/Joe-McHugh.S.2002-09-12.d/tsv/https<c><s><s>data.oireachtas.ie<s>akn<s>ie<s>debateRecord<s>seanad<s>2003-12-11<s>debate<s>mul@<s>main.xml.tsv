JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A commitment was given in the 2002 election on the Irish language. On the other side of the House Senator Ó Murchú is a persuasive advocate for the language but it is not recognised officially at EU level. We should keep our eye on the ball regarding a vote that is coming up at EU level at which we will have an opportunity to make Irish an officially recognised language. There are three important aspects to this issue. First, if an Irish applicant were to apply for a job at European level, he or she would need two languages. However, Irish is not recognised as a second language in that context and such an applicant would need to have French, Spanish, German or some other European language. Addressing this issue would present an employment opportunity for Irish citizens to work in Europe. Second, it is a matter of national pride that Irish should be recognised as an official language. We have been negotiating for such recognition since 1972. In 1972, under a Fianna Fáil-led Government, the ball was missed. Fianna Fáil is good at going back 30 to 40 years in regard to Fine Gael. In 1972, we had an opportunity to make the Irish language recognised at European level. I am not a politician who tends to go back that far—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	—but that is done by some Members on the other side of the House. In 1972 we missed the ball in this regard and we should not miss it again. There are up to 20 or 21 other recognised European languages and even accession states are being earmarked as countries whose languages will be recognised at European level. Is the Government not interested in the Irish language?
