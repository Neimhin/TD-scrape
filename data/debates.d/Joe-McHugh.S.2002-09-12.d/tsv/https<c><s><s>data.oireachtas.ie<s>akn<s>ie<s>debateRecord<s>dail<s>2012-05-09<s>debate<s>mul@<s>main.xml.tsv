JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Minister does not have an input in the design of the junior certificate but his intervention with regard to the need to include some road safety training in the junior certificate programme could be critical.  A few years ago I visited a secondary school in my county.The teacher told me she had a group of boys in the class whom she could keep engaged only by promising that if they were quiet and participated in class she would take them out afterwards and show them the engine in her new car.  There is an interest in the mechanics of the car, among boys in particular, although I do not exclude the female student population.  We should harness this positivity.  We should look at what is happening in Finland, in that country's education process, whether it is the use of simulators, having self-evaluation or even bringing driving instructors into schools.  We can tease out the details but I welcome that the Minister is exploring the idea of incorporating this into the junior certificate.  I look forward to his work with the Minister for Education and Skills.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome this announcement which is significant.  As regards the reduction of 9%, when the wheel is not broken it is important not to fix it.  Having spoken to many people in labour-intensive restaurants, the real difference in moving from 13.5% to 9% is whether it permits them to stay in business.  That is how significant this matter is.  The Minister is working on a range of measures, be it the tourist visa waiver, on which he is working with Minister Deputy Shatter, or his announcement, in an Irish Independent supplement entitled “Tee Time in Donegal”, of links courses in the north west recently.  He can help to create the proper environment at a political level or dimension but grassroots leadership is also required.  Last weekend Daniel O’Donnell, a household name in the UK and in Ireland, opened a Daniel O’Donnell visitor centre in Dungloe.  I spoke to Jim White, a former Member of this House, last weekend and he told me he will be bringing 10,100 German tourists to Donegal between now and October.  Local leadership will be shown once a proper political environment is provided.I welcome this measure.  It is a good news story for people in the restaurant business.  That business is labour intensive and this measure will mean the difference between restaurants staying or going out of business.  It is a positive announcement.I wish to refer to a previous question related to the traditional patterns of tourists.  There is a traditional triangular tourist trail.  Tourists who came into Dublin would have gone to Killarney, travelled to Galway and perhaps up as far as Mayo and then back to Dublin.  That is the extent of the lifespan of the tourist trail.  We have to change that and we will do it.  We will look at the spin off from Derry being the City of Culture next year, our being a host port for Tall Ships Race this year and the Royal Portrush staging the Irish Open.  There will be spin offs for counties such as Deputy ‘Ming' Flanagan's if we start to work with our northern counterparts.  Let us create a new triangular trail.  Let us get tourists into Belfast, over as far as the Giant's Causeway and into Donegal.  Let us be positive.  A day such as today is a positive one and I welcome this announcement.
