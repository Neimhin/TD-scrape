JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Are there instruments in the National Asset Management Agency Bill to deal with agricultural credit?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Taoiseach is aware, many farmers were forced into building slatted houses under the nitrates directive and farmers have contributed â‚¬534 million in inputs alone towards the banks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There should be provision within the banking sector for them.  As the Taoiseach knows, cattle prices are falling and farmers are being pushed to the wall because there is no agricultural stocking credit available.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle would know from his own constituency that stocking credit for farmers to provide the money to buy feed and livestock is not available and it is destroying agricultural activity, as my colleague, Deputy Crawford, and the leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Kenny, pointed out this morning.  Farming enterprises form part of the small and medium enterprise sector and we should use our position to bring forward instruments within the NAMA legislation.
