JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Fuaireamar leithscéal ón Seanadóir Chambers. Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Uasal Rupert Schlegelmilch agus an Uasal Colin Brown. They are very welcome. Mr. Brown is head of unit for legal aspects of trade and sustainable development and investment. I extend a warm welcome to Mr. Schlegelmilch who is acting deputy director-general at the Directorate-General for Trade in the European Commission. We look forward to today's engagement. Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Witnesses participating in this committee session from another jurisdiction are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I ask Mr. Schlegelmilch to make his opening statement, and apologise if I am not pronouncing his surname in the proper way.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Schlegelmilch for his clear and concise introduction to what is a rather complex area, to say the least. I call Deputy Howlin, followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Mr. Schlegelmilch want to come back in?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Schlegelmilch for that comprehensive answer. I will move on to Deputy Harkin to be followed by Senator Martin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Brown and call Senator Alice-Mary Higgins.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Brown and Mr. Schlegelmilch. I know Deputy Ó Murchú, who is a committee member, wants to come in. We are really tight for time at the moment. Senator Higgins has got a comprehensive reply. If she wishes to ask any additional questions, I ask her to do so succinctly and directly, because I do not have time for any more statements.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Ó Murchú we are under serious pressure here.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy and call Mr. Schlegelmilch.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Can I suggest that Mr. Brown corresponds with Senator Higgins, if there is any information following this meeting?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Brown, the members, our visiting member, Senator Alice-Mary Higgins, and Mr. Schlegelmilch for their time today. This was an enlightening session, but it was also circumspect, in digging down into the detail. We are very grateful for that. Go raibh maith agaibh.  That brings us to the end of this public session. We will go directly into private session.
