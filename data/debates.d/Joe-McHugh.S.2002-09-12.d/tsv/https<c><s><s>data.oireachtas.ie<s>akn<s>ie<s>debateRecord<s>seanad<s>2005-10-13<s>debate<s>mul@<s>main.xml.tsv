JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I concur with what previous speakers have said. Domestic violence against women is only a political issue in respect of funding and intervention and we are all singing from the same hymn sheet on this sensitive and delicate matter. Some â‚¬20 million per annum is provided for services for female victims. That is a great deal of money and it acknowledges the fact domestic violence against women is a major problem. We need ongoing intervention and communication between the Departments concerned. This is an issue that will not go away and we should focus closely on it.Most of the arguments and discussions today have been in respect of domestic violence against females. I wish to refer to a letter which was recently sent to the editor of The Irish Times by Ms Mary T. Cleary of the AMEN group. I understand that a report was launched this summer by the National Crime Council in association with the Economic and Social Research Institute which contained some startling figures with regard to domestic violence against males. I am glad this letter appeared in The Irish Times because the statistics are startling and frightening and it is important they be put on the record. A total of 15% of women and 6% of men suffer severe domestic abuse. A total of 29% of women and 26% of men suffer from domestic abuse when the categories of severe and minor abuse are combined. The next figure baffled me. A total of 13% of women and 13% of men suffer physical abuse. There is parity of esteem between the genders in this respect.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Exactly. A total of 29% of women, or one in three and only 5% of men, or one in 20, report these incidents to the Garda. While I do not wish to take from the arguments regarding domestic violence against females, there is an issue if only one in 20 males report domestic violence to the Garda. The three figures I have highlighted must be considered and evaluated. We must ask whether we are addressing the needs of the male gender. Is the issue of domestic violence being addressed from the perspective of a single gender or is it being examined holistically from the perspective of both genders? This is something we should examine closely. Before my colleague Senator John Paul Phelan makes his contribution, I want to ask one question of the Minister of State. On 21 September, the AMEN group met the Minister of State and asked whether he was in a position to provide funding to the group for male domestic violence. While I am open to correction, my understanding is that at the time, the Minister of State did not reject the request outright. However, it was made clear that it was highly unlikely that the group would receive any ongoing Government funding to provide support for male victims of domestic abuse. Is this true? If this is not the case, what is the Minister of State's position with regard to providing funding to male victims of domestic violence?
