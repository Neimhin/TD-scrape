JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh na baill agus na rannpháirtithe eile atá i láthair don chruinniú seo. Tá deis againn inniu díospóireacht agus comhrá a bheith againn i dtaobh forbairt agus dul chun cinn na Gaeilge. I welcome members to the meeting and also the contributors to today's discussion. It is an opportunity to examine ways by which to develop the Irish language and, in particular, the outstanding issue of the implementation of the Irish Language Act in Northern Ireland. I hope the debate will be engaging. We are joined by a number of guests to discuss the issue. I welcome Ms Linda Ervine of the East Belfast Mission; Mr. Niall Ó Catháin, Glór na nGael; Ms Janet Muller from POBAL; and Mr. Aodán Mac Póilín, Iontaobhas Ultach. I became more familiar with POBAL recently when I was in Belfast with Ms Muller at the launch of a document. She is very welcome to Dublin. POBAL is the Irish language umbrella organisation in the North. It was established in 1998 during a period of great political, social and economic change. Its work has since focused on advocacy and the issue of community development. It recently launched a document on the 15 years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, collating personal views of members of the Irish speaking community.POBAL recently launched a booklet entitled the Good Friday Agreement Pledge 15 Years On, collating personal views of the Irish speaking community. Ms Ervine is the Irish language officer of the East Belfast Mission. This committee is fully briefed on the work that goes on in east Belfast as we have been in the Skainos Centre a number of times. She is very welcome to Dublin. Her work relates to the promotion and understanding and knowledge of the Irish language among the Protestant, Unionist and loyalist community in that area. Glór na nGael is an award winning Irish language group in rural Carntogher in County Derry and will be aware of a group from my parish in Na Dúnaibh and may be involved in some bilateral cross-Border collaboration with it. No doubt Glór na nGael is aware of the good work being done by the group in my parish and vice versa. Glór na nGael runs an Irish language centre, gaelscoileanna and naíonraí among other activities. Iontaobhas Ultach is an independent charitable trust based in Belfast. Its principal aim is to promote the Irish language throughout the entire community of Northern Ireland. A core objective is to encourage cross-community involvement in the language. I welcome the representatives of all of these groups and look forward to their contributions. Before I call on our first contributor, I want to advise the witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only cognisant evidence in regard to the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas or person outside the Houses nor an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I invite Ms Ervine to make her presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Ervine for her contribution and call now on Janet Muller to make her contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat, Ms Muller. As a vote has been called in the Dáil, I propose that we suspend the meeting for ten minutes. The witnesses, MPs and Senators who are present should feel free to have an informal chat. I apologise for having to suspend, but the Deputies present need to vote. We have to be strict about these things.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will resume in public session. I apologise, but it is good to see democracy in action.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegates for their contributions. We will now hear from members of the committee, who will be followed by Members attending the meeting.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will hear from three more committee members and the delegates can then decide which of the contributions and observations they want to zone in on.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I now call Senator Brennan, who will be followed by Senator Ó Clochartaigh.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will hand back to the witnesses to answer those questions. Out of all the meetings I have chaired, I have never witnessed such a range of interventions, which highlights the passion and desire on the part of members to maximise the importance of the Irish language. There were many personal observations that do not need a reply but in the remaining time, if the witnesses want to make their own observations on those contributions, that would be appreciated.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Ervine.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na baill ar fad agus leis na rannpháirtithe a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht. Bhí an cruinniú inniu iontach tábhachtach agus bhí an t-ábhar agus an díospóireacht tábhachtach chomh maith. I thank the delegates. The meeting has been invaluable, as members have been given an insight into where the challenges lie. There are two aspects to the solution - the importance of reaching a solution in a timely fashion and also the issue of how to allow people the space and time to deliberate without damaging the language. The delegates and members have come up with proposals, on which we should formally follow up. We have written formally to the SEUPB inviting it to appear before the committee; no doubt members will be able to make a direct intervention on behalf of the delegates.  On the second issue relating to the broadcasting fund, subject to the agreement of members, we can write formally to the Taoiseach who has continual engagement with the British Prime Minister. Is it agreed that we formally contact the Taoiseach? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will give Mr. Mac Póilín time and when it is ready, he can sent it to the clerk to the committee.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Ó Catháin's comments are helpful. I am aware the Special EU Programmes Body has, until now, operated via local authorities. This has been done for reasons of financial prudence because the local authorities have financial expertise available to them. Notwithstanding this, we should be conscious of groups such as Glór na nGael and Coiste Céim Aniar in my parish of Rosguill. If Glór na nGael believes Foras na Gaeilge, an Irish language umbrella group, has expertise in accounting and finance and would be able to provide prudent financial management, the committee will certainly convey that message.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We all agree on that. On the issue of the North-South Ministerial Council and possible cutbacks in funding for representative groups in Northern Ireland, the appropriate persons for the joint committee to contact are the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley, and the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure in the North, Ms Carál Ní Chuilín. I am aware that funding has been extended until the end of this year and deliberations and negotiations are set to continue. I propose that the joint committee formally write to the Ministers on the issue. Is that agreed? Agreed. The joint committee tries as best it can to promote itself as an honest broker in terms of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We are a little handicapped in this respect as we do not have Unionist representation. However, the absence of Unionist representatives makes us more conscious of the need to strike a balance. What we can offer to the groups before us is constant involvement and engagement. Significant dialogue appears to be needed to achieve the outcome our guests are seeking. If the committee can assist in this conversation, those present should feel free to contact us as part of their deliberations. As Mr. Mac Póilín pointed out, his organisation is meeting increasing numbers of Gaelgeoirí and Irish language groups.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We can include a transcript of this meeting in our correspondence with the Taoiseach on the Broadcasting Act. It may also be worthwhile to circulate the various proposals and suggestions to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to a timetable. While I may be reading the position incorrectly, it may not be helpful to refer to a timetable. What appears to be required from the joint committee in terms of pursuing this issue is greater engagement on how we achieve the desired outcome.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for interrupting, but the Government has clearly stated it supports an Irish language Act. This legislation needs to be implemented and there is no question about the fact that we are on the same page on the issue.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is not a problem. The committee can reaffirm its support for an Irish language Act. Clearly, a conversation is needed on how we will achieve that outcome. That is the area in which the committee will act by assisting this conversation in the best way possible. I propose to conclude the meeting.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are clear that, as an implementation committee, we are working towards the implementation of outstanding elements of the Good Friday Agreement, including the Irish language Act, a bill of rights and the establishment of a North-South civic forum. I will conclude proceedings as we have exceeded our time. I thank members and the contributors for their excellent presentations and look forward to working with them in future.
