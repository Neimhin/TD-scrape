JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Fred Barry, CEO of the National Roads Authority, NRA, to discuss the development of road links along the Border region. Mr. Barry is accompanied by Mr. Michael Nolan, head of regional and programme management with the NRA. We look forward to exploring how infrastructure development can be progressed to the benefit of citizens and the economy both North and South of the Border. Before I call Mr. Barry to make his presentation, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only cognisant evidence on the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. We look forward to a good morning's work. In addition to members of the committee, we have been joined by a number of Members from counties Leitrim and Sligo with an interest in connectivity. While we appreciate that Mr. Barry's remit is in the southern jurisdiction, we are looking at the long-term vision and the potential for connectivity. I do not doubt that members will have many questions and observations to make.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	What does Mr. Barry mean by "several" years?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I wish to clarify that they were invited.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	A vote has been called in the Dáil, but we have a few minutes in which Mr. Berry can reply.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before Mr. Nolan comes to deal with this, may I suggest that we suspend the sitting for the vote in the House.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will resume in public session. Mr. Barry was going to pass over to Mr. Nolan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	He has had a chance to reflect on what he really wanted to say.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask Mr. Barry to clarify what are the plans for the southern side of the N2 with regard to Monaghan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is interesting. I ask Mr. Barry to elaborate. The TEN-T corridor is the Belfast-Dublin-Cork route.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Could a public-private partnership arrangement be included?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I note there is a vote in the Seanad, Senator White.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Representatives were invited but they indicated they would not attend.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No, it came from Transport NI.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask members to brief as there is another delegation due here at 11.30 a.m. That is InterTradeIreland and I am sure this conversation is important to its work as well. I appreciate the patience of the witnesses.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Deputy O'Reilly wish to come in? His colleague from Cavan mentioned every road in Cavan in his absence, so he would just be-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Deputy O'Reilly have any specific questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is Senator Moran happy with the Narrow Water Bridge-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will have two final contributions, from Deputies Ellis and McLoughlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegates. It is important to point out that this occasion was not only about a meeting today. We appreciate that our visitors attended and we acknowledge their input to the conversation. It is also important that we express the viewpoint of the committee on Transport NI, which has nothing to do with the delegates. That message can be conveyed. I ask the members from the North to work with us and try to explore the possibility of having a meeting with their colleagues in the North. I will pick up on Senator White's point although I will not get into the areas where I disagree with her. In regard to forward planning, there are great examples where the national roads design office, NRDO, is doing its work, especially in Donegal town. I remember that in the early 1990s, the NRDO had a design ready for the Clar-Barnesmore project. This point can be clarified but I understand that €7 million was supposed to go towards a project in Dublin which was not ready. The next thing we knew was that Clar-Barnesmore was ready to go because the design had been done. The Deputy's message is the right one. Obviously the delegates are working within funding constraints. However, we could try to lay out a vision, have the design made and the preparatory work done. For example, there is a design for the Letterkenny-Lifford-Strabane section. Everything is a precursor to something else happening. The Lifford-Strabane bridge is ready to go but the A5 project must be done first. This is where the political fear creeps in. If one big project is not ready to go, what happens to the rest of the funding? As a committee, we ask the delegates to stay in touch with us and help us to try to arrive at a degree of consistency in developing a vision. A vision is quite simple. We can look at all the inter-city connectivity from the capital to areas throughout the country and see all the good work the NRA has done, providing fantastic roads to Galway and Limerick, the south east and Cork. Then we look at the missing pieces of the jigsaw. This is not about entitlement. There may have been a bit of parochial politics today but this is more than that. It is about disenfranchisement, neglect, partition and all those elements of an entire geographical section of our country that was isolated as a result of lack of connectivity. We want to work with the delegates. If they can help us then we, as a committee, will help them to work towards their ambitions and aspirations. I ask the members to use their influence in their own positions, even if only to create public awareness of the work going on behind the scenes. I am aware that officials are meeting at very high levels within Departments and local authorities, but the public must be made aware of this work. Members of the public will say these roads are not going to go ahead simply because the funding is not available. There is a negative attitude towards the ambition that we, as politicians, are trying to realise. Whatever the visitors can do to help is welcome, even if it is only to raise more public awareness about how the committee could act as a facilitator. We have met on this issue before. It is important to keep them alive. It is about fairness, justice and equality and about looking at the benefits of opening up an entire section of this country that was never opened up before. We are all singing from the same hymn sheet in that respect. We will not suspend the meeting but will take the next part of the session. We invite the delegates from InterTradeIreland to take their seats.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for the delay in starting this part of the meeting. I am sure the members of the InterTradeIreland delegation, and those they represent in the work they are involved in, will have been interested in the subject matter of the first part of the meeting. On behalf of the committee, I welcome the officials who are in attendance at this meeting to discuss the issue of all-island economic development. I welcome Mr. Thomas Hunter McGowan, who is InterTradeIreland's chief executive officer; and Mr. Aidan Gough, who is the organisation's strategy and policy director. The members of this committee are familiar with Mr. Gough because we have bumped into each other before. We look forward to hearing more about the work that InterTradeIreland is involved with at local level, with particular reference to the global and cross-Border implications of that work. Before I invite Mr. Hunter McGowan to make his presentation, I advise him and Mr. Gough that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by it to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only cognisant evidence on the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I ask Mr. Hunter McGowan to proceed with his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. We will now take questions from three members and then we can have a response on those.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses. I have had positive feedback from businesses that have been in contact with InterTradeIreland, which itself may not always get feedback. The organisation is based only in the Six Counties as a service provider. It does outreach work and comes to different counties and so on.From an organisation point of view - the witness need not answer if he does not wish or if it is politically difficult to do so - would it be of value to have a foot in some form of structural sense outside of Northern Ireland? 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is something for the committee group to consider. I thank the witnesses for their attendance. The committee will be happy to do any work that will add value to the work of InterTradeIreland.
