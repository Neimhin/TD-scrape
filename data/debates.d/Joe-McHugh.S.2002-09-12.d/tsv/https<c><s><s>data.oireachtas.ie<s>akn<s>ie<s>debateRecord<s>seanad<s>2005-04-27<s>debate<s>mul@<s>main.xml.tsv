JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I raise this issue on the Adjournment with more than passing interest. I have a personal interest as Scoil Eoin Baiste, Carrigart, was the school in which I started my education, in 1975. I spent eight years at the school. From my vague memory of entering the school in 1975, I recall that it was one of the finest — if not the finest — national schools in the county at that time. However, 30 years have elapsed and times have change, as have educational needs.The school extension was promised in 1999. In various elections since then, there has been much posturing and shadow boxing and many promises have been made. The staff and the board of management have had enough. They met last Monday in the parochial hall in Umlagh with parents of the school and public representatives. There is a belief among staff and parents that because this school has disadvantaged status under the Breaking the Cycle programme, the need for a school extension should be a priority.There are four classes sharing the same toilet, which creates a problem of circulation among the students. One student is paraplegic and suffers from cerebral palsy. The student requires a hoist and changing area. The area currently being used is the small toilet used by the other classes. There is a serious issue of personal dignity for the student, the staff and the student's personal assistant. There is no general purpose room in the school. There is a PE instructor in the school, but there is no possibility of facilitating the new PE curriculum that is to be introduced. There are five staff members, along with a German teacher, a home liaison teacher, a PE instructor and a learning support teacher. That makes a total of nine staff who can all be there at any given time. The staff room is not adequate for this and there is a need for expansion.I know the Minister of State will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Education and Science. The board of management, the principal, staff, parents and students want the funding for the extension of the school to be expedited. In 1975, this was one of the most modern schools in the county, but 30 years later it needs change.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response. The school staff and board of management intend to lobby hard to achieve this. The Minister for Education and Science will be hearing from them as their lobbying will be a very professional operation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State is absolutely correct.
