JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation. The document submitted makes for very interesting reading as it provides conference centre statistics on a worldwide basis. Germany, one of the original Community member states, has 36 conference centres dotted around it. There are three in Berlin alone with a capacity of 16,000 seats. Greece which became a member state at the same time as Ireland has 13 centres. Portugal and Spain which also joined with Ireland have 11 and 36 centres, respectively. We have two, of which one, the RDS, is not felt to be up to scratch while the other, Dublin Castle, lacks capacity. Finland which joined the European Union in 1995 has nine centres, while the United Kingdom has 41. If we were to be a little facetious, we could claim an interest in the Waterfront Hall in Belfast with its 2,235-seat capacity.Dublin Chamber of Commerce has identified a need and is very interested in its parochial dimensions. As a Donegal man, I believe there is a need for a large-scale conference centre in Dublin. I attended an event on Saturday, Donegal Person of the Year, which had to accommodate 1,000 people. While I acknowledge that the function involved a meal rather than a conference, the Burlington Hotel was not able to cope with the numbers involved. Dublin does not have adequate capacity to host significant events.We are not discussing the parochial problem of a stand-alone conference centre for Dublin. Spain provides a perfect example of what I mean. I travelled to Tenerife for a conference and with other delegates took a connecting flight from Madrid which did not entail any hassle. The conference centre we attended is very successful. To be parochial, although there are airports in Derry and Carrickfinn, there is no reason to regionalise and decentralise the conference centre concept. If a centre in Dublin can attract high value clients who are prepared to spend money, the economic benefits will be felt nationally.Mr. Geoghegan opened the debate to take in the status of tourism. While there is a national problem, tourism in the north west has been in the doldrums for seven to eight years. We have suffered from tourism decline. I have never advocated the style of tourism popular at the Cliffs of Moher and the Ring of Kerry where people are packed onto a bus and a location is bombarded on the basis of numbers. There is a case to be made for discussing the conference centre idea in a wider context. If we aim to provide a high value product, we must put the necessary infrastructure in place. I will certainly advocate doing so, whether in Dublin or on a regional basis. The number of parliamentary questions Deputy Deenihan has tabled on the conference centre project is evidence that the Fine Gael Party will not be found wanting in supporting the proposal. While the joint committee is not intended to be political, we are discussing a political issue which will require political will to resolve. It is important to move forward.Incentives have been provided at the Waterfront Hall, including VAT return arrangements. In the context of subsidies or otherwise, will the delegation outline the wider economic benefits of providing a 7,000 seat conference centre in Dublin?
