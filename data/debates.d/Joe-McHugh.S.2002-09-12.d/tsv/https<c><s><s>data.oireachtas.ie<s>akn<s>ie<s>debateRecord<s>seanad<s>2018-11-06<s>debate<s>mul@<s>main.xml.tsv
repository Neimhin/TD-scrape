JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht an cheist seo a ardú. Aontaím léi go bhfuil an-tábhacht ag baint leis an ábhar seo. I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it gives me the opportunity to clarify the current position relating to my Department's plans to meet the demand for school places in the Fingal area and in St. Joseph's secondary school, Rush. My predecessor, Deputy Bruton, announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the four years from 2019 to 2022. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department on the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. This announcement included three new post-primary schools to be established in the Fingal area as follows: a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede-Howth D13 school planning area to be established in 2019; a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Blanchardstown west D15 and Blanchardstown village D15 school planning areas as a regional solution to be established in 2020; and a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede-Howth D13 school planning area to be established in 2021. In addition to the new schools announced, my Department’s capital investment programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified. The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. With regard to St. Joseph’s secondary school, my Department received an application for additional accommodation from the school. I am pleased to advise the Senator that it recently issued approval, in principle, to the board of management for the rental of two science laboratories, one technical graphics-design communication graphics room and one general classroom, as an interim measure, pending delivery of the permanent school building. The Senator will also be aware that a major building project to provide a new replacement school building for St. Joseph’s secondary school, Rush, is included in my Department's six-year construction programme. A site is required for this purpose and this is currently being pursued.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I absolutely take the important issues the Senator has raised very seriously. We have to plan for the future. The context for planning does not relate only to schools but to housing. Where there will be more housing, there will be additional pressures. As part of the ongoing conversation regarding where people are going to live and go to school and how they will travel to school, I take the Senator's point. Fingal is a big geographical area and there are more than 8,000 places in post-primary schools there alone, which gives one a glimpse of the population dynamic that exists. I also accept what the Senator stated in the context of ensuring that this matter is kept on the radar. A number of her colleagues have also raised this issue with me. In my short time in this new post I have seen that the pressure on high-population areas to ensure that they have quality educational centres is very important to the politicians who represent those areas. However, I want to work in tandem with the different frameworks that we have including the capital plan for the period 2016 to 2021. Obviously, we also have the ten-year capital plan. The latter provides more than €8.4 billion for education, which is double the money provided in the previous ten years. All of that funding will be needed. Pressure is coming on the sector. When it comes to land acquisition, as prices rise we have to ensure that we get in there as competitively as possible, although when a need is identified and increases in population are projected, I will certainly pay very close attention.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ní raibh an Seanadóir ró-mhall. Bhí sé ceart go leor. I thank him for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to update the House on the current position regarding the provision of a permanent school building for Ballinteer Educate Together national school, which is a co-educational school under the patronage of Educate Together. The brief for the project we are discussing is the provision of a new 16-classroom school and a two-classroom special needs unit, together with all ancillary accommodation, on the St. Tiernan's Community School site at Parkvale, Balally, Dublin 16. This project, which is included in the six-year capital programme of the Department of Education and Skills to proceed to tender and construction in 2018, was assigned to the Department's rapid design and build delivery programme in March 2018. Architectural planning commenced immediately. An application for planning permission was lodged with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in September 2018 following a pre-planning meeting with the council. A notification of decision to refuse permission was received by the Department's consultants on 2 November 2018. A copy of this notification was received by officials in the Department yesterday afternoon. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council outlined two reasons for its decision to refuse planning. First, the proposed exit-only link onto Wyckham Way, which is a heavily trafficked distributor road, would endanger public safety by reason of traffic hazard or obstruction of road users and the proposed development would therefore be contrary to the proper planning and development of the area. Second, the proposal to utilise the existing access to St. Tiernan's Community School through Parkvale to serve an additional 16-classroom school is not acceptable on the grounds of the impact on the residential amenity of existing Parkvale residents. The proposed development would be seriously injurious to the residential amenity of Parkvale and would therefore be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area. The remarks I have made in reply to the Senator are obviously in the public arena. They arise from the decision that has been made by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Officials from the Department of Education and Skills will now review this decision. I appreciate the disappointment of those who have been campaigning on this issue for eight years. I assure the Senator that having reviewed this disappointing decision, the Department will consult its advisers and technical team to decide how best to make progress with this project. The possibility of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála will be considered in that context.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I reiterate my disappointment at the delay. A school community does not just arrive but, rather, results from a campaign involving many people who have expectations and hopes for the project. When a roadblock is encountered, it can be very difficult. I will ensure that there is contact between my officials and the chief executive of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Drawing on his days on that council, the Senator will have suggestions and opinions that might help to move this matter forward. Obviously, the decision on whether to take the matter to An Bord Pleanála is under consideration.
