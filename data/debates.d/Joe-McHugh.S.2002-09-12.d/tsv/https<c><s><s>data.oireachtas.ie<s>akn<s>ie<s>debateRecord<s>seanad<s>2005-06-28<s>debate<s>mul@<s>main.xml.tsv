JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I concur with the Leader of the House in regard to the grouping of the amendments which make the legislation straightforward. Other Ministers could do likewise because it makes it easier to work with legislation.Many small fishermen who operate one or two person boats have called for changes in the red tape and the constant bureaucratic difficulties and blockages they must overcome to acquire or renew licences. What commitment will the Minister of State give today to facilitate the small fisherman who wants to stay in business and operate at a lower level than the large fishers?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	These amendments have been discussed in the Dáil and most found a general acceptance. The main concern of Members of my party when the Bill was debated in this House was that the enforcement of these laws will require substantial resources in terms of co-ordinating efforts between the Garda, harbour authorities and county councils. The latter may introduce by-laws and so on in this area. I wish to put on the record that we chose not to table a number of amendments during previous Stages of the Bill because their financial implications meant we did not believe they would be accepted.Fine Gael does not have a problem with the second group of amendments. However, I draw the Minister of State's attention to the financial implications of all the regulations that are being introduced. How will this be financed and what commitment will be given by the Department of Finance in this regard?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Minister of State clarify whether the provisions regarding vessels less than 15 m refer also to jet skis? Are all mechanically propelled vehicles of less than 15m covered by these regulations?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State alluded to this during the previous debate in the House and I welcome his commitment in this regard. Most of those who own jet skis are dedicated to partaking of the sport they enjoy in a safe and responsible manner. There does not seem to be an affiliated grouping for the sport but many experienced jet skiers have called for strict regulation in terms of the purchase and licensing of jet skis. I welcome the Minister of State's intervention in this regard.It is important to reassure the public that the majority of those who use jet skis are responsible people who wish to abide by the law, including the international laws of coastal zoning. I welcome any regulation that can be introduced to assist them in enjoying their chosen sport in a responsible manner. Jet skiing is a sport enjoyed by many hard-working people. However, there is also a reckless element engaged in the sport which includes those who put the lives of swimmers and others in danger. There must be regulation in regard to the purchase of jet skis and a proper licensing and age requirement. At present a 12 year old can buy a jet ski without any licence or certification. This is a matter that must be discussed.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to support the earlier signature motion. Each local authority will be different, even those in Sligo and Donegal that have the same type of coastal zones. If there must be a consultation process between the Department and local authorities, an attempt should be made to liaise with jet ski users as they are the people who see the risks. I do not know if they have a network or umbrella grouping. Perhaps Senator MacSharry might be able to help us out on that point as he is much younger than I am and he jet skis every weekend. Jet ski users also see other risks. Friction exists between jet skiers, water skiers and other players off the coast and consultation should also occur between local boat clubs within the different regions.Regulations are important but the question of the Garda Síochána and the Coast Guard enforcing them is a grey area. I have already asked my own leader, Deputy Kenny, to raise an issue regarding quads and motorcycles in a special area of conservation in my locality by means of parliamentary questions. I can speak with the Minister of State afterwards on this matter. The Garda Síochána and the local authority cannot come together to enforce the law. I know it is outside the Minister of State's brief but he would have a special interest in the matter as it relates to Donegal.In my parish a golf course was not allowed to be developed over sand dunes in a special area of conservation but scrambling, quad and motocross races take place every weekend in that area. The Garda and local authority know about it but the law is not being enforced. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has already replied to me stating it is against the law, yet we are introducing similar laws here. I wish to highlight that grey area.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Without mentioning the name of the child involved, I raise this matter in light of an individual case at Ballyheerin national school, County Donegal, of which details have been supplied. This child has been receiving one-to-one support through the facilitation of a resource teacher on an ongoing basis. The work that has been achieved to date, according to his parents and the school principal, can be summed up by stating that the child has been blossoming due to the help or facilitation that has been offered.I emphasise that this is not a severe case as the child has only a moderate learning difficulty. However, if he is making progress as is the case, a point echoed by his parents and the school principal and staff, we should study this closely. If the child does not get a continuation of sustained learning resource support, what will happen down the line? Is it not an obligation on us, as legislators, and officials within the Department of Education and Science to continue with support if it is working? It is working, it is not broken, so why are we trying to change it?That is in regard to the individual. The bigger issue concerns the whole ethos behind clustering. I would agree with the idea of clustering, namely, the grouping of small rural primary schools and the appointment of good, dedicated resource teachers to work in them. There is a cluster in the region in question, made up of Doaghbeg, Cashel, Croaghross, Drumfad and Tamney national schools, and including Ballyheerin national school. The combination of those rural primary schools work together for the overall betterment of students with special learning difficulties. Should we not be working extremely hard to try to facilitate the students in these schools?To refer to the ethical dimension, the consequence of this one child losing 3.5 hours of resource teaching means that the teacher who has worked in a dedicated manner in all of these schools will, unfortunately, lose his job. It is a double edged sword. On the one hand, a student is losing out and, on the other, the rural area is losing a dedicated support teacher. I am not saying there is anything sinister in this. However, I would ask an obvious question on the grounds that in a similar rural area across Lough Swilly, there is a similar problem with clustering. The deficit at a school in that area — ScoilChoilmcille, Malin, school roll No. 146310 — is perhaps one hour, but this will possibly result in the loss of another dedicated, professional and highly motivated teacher.Although I can assume the content of the Minister's reply, a bigger issue is at stake. We are introducing clustering as a way to ensure that disadvantaged rural schools, many in CLÁR areas, are facilitated in terms of special needs supports while, on the other hand, the reduction of a few hours means that the schools involved do not get the dedicated core staff required to carry out special needs teaching. It must be asked whether children with moderate learning difficulty are being discriminated against in terms of the special learning support they require. Are they discriminated against as a result of budgeting or the Department's ability to fund a special needs teacher?It is a complicated issue and I have no evidence on it. However, to consider the issue head-on, one would wonder whether it is a numbers game, a financial game or a sinister attempt to keep hours down so rural areas will be deprived of special needs support. I have given two examples. I ask the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to re-examine the total roll number at Ballyheerin national school, which was supplied with notice of the Adjournment matter, and the case at Malin, which I do not want to discuss at length as I do not have as much knowledge on it as on the case at Ballyheerin.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. While I am not able to give forensic detail on whether the school applied to the SENO, as far as I am aware it did. If the case is not documented on the system this may be the opportunity for the school to do so. I will advise the board of management of the school accordingly.
