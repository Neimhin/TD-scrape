JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious of the time and aware that another MEP is to contribute so I will be as brief as possible.Regarding the fishermen's frustration, MsMair√©ad McGuinness may agree with me that farmers got the "poor mouth" label, and that is also happening to the fishermen. That must be nipped in the bud because fishermen are currently trying their best in terms of conservation and are even engaging in scientific experiments. For example, fishermen involved in the crab industry last November found that they did not have adequate hours at sea for fishing, and had to stop fishing for a period of seven days. Meanwhile the French and British fishermen had innumerable hours, which meant we had to go to the British fishermen to seek extra hours. This resulted from a decision made at central Government level in 2003, at a time when European exchequer funding and Irish Exchequer funding went into the rebuilding of the crab fishing fleet, although we did not demand extra hours at the time.I am not in total agreement with Deputy Eamon Ryan but in terms of where we are going, or where we are at, do we know what the right hand and the left hand are doing at Commission level, at central Government level and at fishermen's level? It is not adding up. We are investing millions of euro in building our fleet but at the same time are not getting extra hours. That is what happened with crab fishing last November. I have contacted my colleagues about this issue at European level. This is not an easy matter to explain here in a minute or two but it is important that we push for extra kilowatt hours for the crab industry because the only people engaging in any scientific research regarding the crab industry are the fishermen. Neither Europe nor central Government is engaging in it. That is something on which we should keep a close eye.In terms of the wider electorate, we should be instilling confidence in the European project. As citizens of the European Union, that is what we should always continue to strive towards. If we are trying to do so, the matter before us is simple. We have a very simple matter before us today relating to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. It is for the Cabinet to decide how to move forward with this legislation. If we continue to blame the European Union for decisions that can be made at Cabinet level, it will further erode already dwindling confidence in the EU.Perhaps I might use another example. When an environmental health officer visits restaurants, hotels and so on to check whether there are proper facilities, we are the first to give out to the EU, which we blame for imposing sanctions and draconian laws and rules regarding how we handle cleanliness and health needs. That is wrong, since it is the Government, at central level, that is accountable to the electorate and that makes those decisions. The same is true of this very simple measure before us today; it is a decision for central Government. This rests squarely with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher. I am not being political, since I am aware that this forum is not intended to be such, but if we are to instil confidence in the European project, we cannot always blame the EU for decisions made in Dublin.
