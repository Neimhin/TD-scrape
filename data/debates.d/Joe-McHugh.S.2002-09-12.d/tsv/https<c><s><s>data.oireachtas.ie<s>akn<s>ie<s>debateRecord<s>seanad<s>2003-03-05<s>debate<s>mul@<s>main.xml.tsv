JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I concur with what has been said about tourism and I ask the Leader to arrange a speedy debate, especially on the need for a greater emphasis on community led tourism. It would be excellent for the country if the Americas Cup were held here. Tourism should be addressed in tandem with a review of internal aviation. Flights should be able to come from Farranfore to Carrickfin without having to go through Dublin. In welcoming the Americas Cup we should bring tourists to Knock, Carrickfin and Sligo.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would like to compliment Senator Terry on bringing forward this Private Members' motion. The Minister acknowledged that there are inadequacies in the system and that it needs to be reformed. Senator Feeney's attack on Senator Terry was out of line.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Feeney attacked my colleague for highlighting the inadequacies of our democratic system.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator undermined the motion before the House. This is the first time that the Minister has acknowledged that there are inadequacies – he put up his hands and said that reform is needed. In effect, he acknowledged Senator Terry's work. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, who is a member of the Progressive Democrats Party, has acknowledged that there are problems, but the Fianna Fáil Party has not accepted that. Perhaps this highlights a difference between the two parties in the Government.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The vivid cracks in the coalition between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were evident during last night's debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 and are evident again today.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Such differences are dangerous.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Terry for introducing this motion and facilitating this timely debate. We should recognise her as the real reformer in this House.
