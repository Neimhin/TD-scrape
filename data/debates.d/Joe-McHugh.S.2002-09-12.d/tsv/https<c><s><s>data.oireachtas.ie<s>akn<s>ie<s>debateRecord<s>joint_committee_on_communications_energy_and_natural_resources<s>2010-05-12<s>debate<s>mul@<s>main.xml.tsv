JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Chairman for facilitating this meeting and welcome the delegation from An Post.  I have a few general questions before I turn to a more specific issue that I wish to raise.I am delighted to hear that, as is well known, there is ongoing involvement with the Garda Síochána to enhance security measures to combat burglaries and criminal activity.  Is there an appreciation of the lack of Garda cover in Border areas beside large urban centres?  I refer, in particular, to Derry city, the fourth largest city in Ireland.  It is well known and articulated by the public in east County Donegal that their experience being in close proximity to a large city such as Derry is not in parallel with that, for example, of people living in suburban areas of Galway or Cork.  When working with the Garda, does An Post take into account the fact that in the case of many post offices there is not a similar pattern of Garda presence as in the case of post offices elsewhere?I refer to the security training conducted in 2009 to which Mr. Daly referred.  Did it constitute an increase on the training conducted in 2008?  At what point in 2009 did this increase in training take place?  Was it at the beginning or the middle of the year, or did it take place throughout the year?I refer specifically to Carrigans post office.  I raise this issue on behalf of the community, rather than on behalf of the post office or its staff.  I am aware of the ongoing investigation which I do not wish to prejudice.  However, I raise the issue because it is in the public domain at both national and local level.  I wish to break up the question into three parts.  Is An Post satisfied with the level of support it has given to the postmistress since the robbery?  The delegates may not have such information to hand, but I certainly will seek an answer on this point after the meeting.  Second, what security training has An Post provided for the aforementioned postmistress since the robbery?  Third, what positive message does it wish to send to post offices faced by different obstacles in large suburban areas along the Border — I mentioned Derry city in this regard — which do not enjoy a similar level of Garda resources?  What message of confidence does it wish to send to such post offices to assure them the company is working in close liaison with the Garda to ensure the availability of additional security measures?As a public representative, I fear that this concern and obvious anomaly in respect of Garda resources in Border areas is not being taken into consideration by An Post.  Unless this is being done, I ask the delegates, as representatives of the company, to put in place a work plan, whereby it will take into consideration the fact that there are fewer gardaí present in Border areas and will send a message of confidence to the aforementioned post offices in suburban areas of large urban centres.  From my contact with the local community in Carrigans, it is becoming evident that the investigation mechanism employed by An Post is not being operated in an even-handed manner.  I seek balance and fair play in this regard.  Moreover, An Post should take into consideration that each case is not the same.  Given that one can have fewer Garda resources in heavily populated areas, each location should not be treated the same.  That is my request this morning.I acknowledge the delegates have appeared before the joint committee as messengers which I certainly am not in the business of shooting.  However, I wish to use them as a conduit to report back to An Post that the local community feels aggrieved and seeks fair play with regard to the ongoing investigation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	How did the roadshow training compare to 2008?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When did the roadshow begin in 2009?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When was the Carrigans post office robbery?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Before the security roadshow?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Daly may not accept my observation that there is an unevenness to the handling of my investigation and he is entitled to his opinion but I reiterate that there is a problem, which has been highlighted by the community and a number of people in the area.  A roadshow began in April and May 2009 as a result of an increased tiger kidnappings and heightened security awareness but the robbery took place in February before the security measures and security training were introduced.  That has to be taken into account as a fact in the context of how this postmistress is being treated because it is easy to lock the door after the horse has bolted.  A robbery took place in February before any of the security training provisions were put in place in April and May 2009 and that has to be taken into consideration in this investigation.  I stand by my analysis and observation regarding the unevenness of the handling of this investigation and I will continue to put it on record.  It is my job as a public representative to do that.  The officials are present as messengers.  I have never been in the business of shooting the messenger but I want Mr. Daly to take a strong message back to the investigation team that there is a problem and the investigation is not being conducted in a fair manner.  Will he pass on that information?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate and respect that.
