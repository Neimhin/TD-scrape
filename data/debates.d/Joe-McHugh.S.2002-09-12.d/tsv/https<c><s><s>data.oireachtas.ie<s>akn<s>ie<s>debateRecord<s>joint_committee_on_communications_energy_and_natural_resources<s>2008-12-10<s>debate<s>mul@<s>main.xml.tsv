JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  The most startling paragraph in the presentation is about our, and the Italians', reliance on fossil fuels.  There is a small section on renewable sources of energy.  Mr. Quinn spoke about the â‚¬22 billion investment that is planned.  With regard to our commitment to sustainable green energy processes and the future in that sector, many individuals in County Donegal who are applying for planning permission for windmills are encountering obstacles.  The people who are successful in establishing windmills find it difficult to get on the grid.  What is the ESB's commitment to facilitate that process?My second question is for Mr. McManus.  Is there a facility to encourage community groups?  I am aware it is not his job to help community groups to become sustainable but there is a strain of thinking throughout the western world that we will have to become more focused on the social economy.  It is not a return to communism but there is a focus on how community or social groups can become self sufficient by using their own resources to provide energy for their own communities.  Is there a commitment from the ESB to facilitate that process?  Mr. McManus will probably tell me it is not in his remit but there is an opportunity in that area.  Groups are grappling with that idea, even if it is only at the embryonic stage.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	With regard to instilling confidence, community groups are seeking to set up their own microgenerators.  Construction might begin in 2009 and they could be set up by 2010.  Could Mr. McManus give them confidence?
