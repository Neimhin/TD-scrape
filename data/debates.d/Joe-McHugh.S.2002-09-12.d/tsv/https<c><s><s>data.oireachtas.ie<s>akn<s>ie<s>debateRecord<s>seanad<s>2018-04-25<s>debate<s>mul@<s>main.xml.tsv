JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Ar dtús, tugaim aitheantas don Seanadóir fá choinne an tseans labhairt ar an t-ábhar tábhachtach sin inniu. Táim thar a bheith sásta a bheith ar ais sa Seanad. I thank the Senator for raising the matter. The census of population 1926 is an historic collection of great value and interest for historians, researchers, the general public and the diaspora. There has been great interest in previous releases. While I acknowledge the historical significance of and keen interest in these data, it is not possible to release the records at this time.  The Statistics Act 1993 prevents the release of census forms until 100 years after the date of the relevant census for reasons of confidentiality. The 1926 census of population was undertaken under the 1926 Statistics Act, which did not permit any access to census records at any time. However, the Statistics Act 1993 repealed the 1926 and 1946 Acts and provided for the release of census forms from the 1926 census and all later censuses 100 years after the date of the relevant census. The 100-year period strikes the right balance between facilitating legitimate historical and sociological research while protecting the confidentiality of census data and the integrity of CSO procedures. The CSO considers that any amendments to the 1993 Statistics Act to allow for the early release of the census data before 100 years have passed could seriously undermine public confidence in the CSO and damage the credibility of the present day confidentiality guarantee.  The confidentiality of all statistical returns from individuals, households and business, including the 1926 census records, is guaranteed by law, and this guarantee is the cornerstone of all CSO surveys, not least of censuses of population. Independence, objectivity and the guarantee of confidentiality are the core values of official statistics which have helped create a positive image of, and ensure public trust in, official statistics in Ireland. Any action that could lead to a weakening of that public trust would be detrimental, not just to the census of population but also to the broader activities of the CSO covering areas such as economic, business and social statistics. Concerns about data protection are increasing all the time and it is vitally important the CSO maintains the trust of all sectors of the community in this regard. In addition to the legal and confidentiality issues, practical issues arise. Extensive preparatory work is required to prepare the 1926 census returns for digitisation as no database-microfilm exists, as was the case for the 1901 and 1911 censuses project. The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht established a 1926 census working group, comprising officials from the relevant organisations, that is, that Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office, to consider how best to enable the publication of the 1926 census records. The task of preserving and digitising the 100 year old documents would have to be undertaken by the National Archives. There is a three stage process, as follows: one, conservation of the 100 year old census forms; two, scanning; and three, indexing and digitising the information so that people can quickly identify and find the specific information they seek. The project will require significant additional financial, staffing and infrastructural resources in the National Archives. The archives are working towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the census, including a warehouse development plan and increasing its cohort of archivists as funding allows. As the necessary capacity is being acquired, the census project will be a priority for the National Archives once the decade of commemorations projects have been completed. For the reasons outlined, while the Government fully understands the importance of the 1926 census, regrettably, it is not possible to facilitate the early release of these records.
