JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is now clear that scientific advice from Teagasc on nutrients for grasslands, tillage and other crops was not fully reflected in the legislation brought forward in December 2005. That is why there is an impasse. In the meantime the Teagasc authority and the Minister for Agriculture and Food have asked scientists from Teagasc to review the current standing of that advice. Last Monday a document was presented with a series of recommendations, such as increasing phosphorus levels in soil where they are low, which will not have a detrimental effect on water quality. In addition, there are recommendations for nitrogen limits on farms with a low stocking rate, which will not contravene EU water guidelines. Arguments are also advanced for a significant lead-in time for pig, poultry and mushroom farmers.I call on the Minister for Agriculture and Food and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to take heed this time and listen to these common sense recommendations because farmers have been up in arms since December and before.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	New technological advancements are also recommended, such as the development of organic manure, for which we must have higher grants for people wishing to invest.
