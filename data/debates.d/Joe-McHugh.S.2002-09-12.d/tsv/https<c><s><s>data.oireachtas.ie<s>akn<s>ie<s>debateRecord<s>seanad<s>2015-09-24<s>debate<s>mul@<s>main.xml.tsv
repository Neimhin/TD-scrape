JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. I acknowledge that her colleague, Senator Hildegarde Naughton, has been in contact with me on a regular basis about it. Since the air service is the subject of an ongoing public procurement process, I have been advised that it would not be appropriate to make any comment on that process or to say anything that might prejudice it in any way or prejudice any appeal that might be made with regard to the outcome of the procurement process by way of a judicial review to the High Court.From the outset, it has always been my aim to ensure there is a continuation of an air service for the Aran Islands. As required under the relevant EU regulation, my Department commissioned a comprehensive review of the need for a PSO service to the Aran Islands in 2014. This review was published in May last year. The review covered the period 2003 to 2013 and I am satisfied that it was both rigorous in its investigations and fair in its findings. The review recognised the importance of the air service to the island communities and its contribution to island life.  At the same time, the report recognised that the cost of providing the air service had increased dramatically by 136% during the ten-year period under review, that the efficiency of the programme had deteriorated over the period in question and that the continuation of this trend into the future was unsustainable. Based on the report's recommendations and mindful of the need for value for money in providing this service, my Department requested that the Office of Government Procurement, as the agency charged by the Government with administering procurement services for the State, undertake a tendering process in order to put in place an air service contract for the period from 1 October 2015 to 30 September 2019. Prior to this tendering process being undertaken, officials from my Department met representatives of the island communities in order to listen to their views on the service. The tendering process was undertaken in accordance with the requirements of EU Regulation 1008/2008 which governs public service obligations and air services. I am sure the Seanadóir will appreciate that, as Minister of State, I had no involvement in the procurement process itself following my decision that a PSO air service should continue to be provided. I am, of course, well aware of the issues the Senator has raised about the mainland departure point for the air service and the type of aircraft to be used.  On Galway Airport being included in the request for tenders, I would like to make it clear that, from the time this PSO route was originally established under EU regulations in 2001, both Galway Airport and Na Minna Airport were identified as mainland departure points. This allows for the widest possible competition and consequent potential for value for money, which must be a central component in any service to be paid for out of the public purse. It is important to emphasise that this tender competition, in so far as it pertains to the inclusion of the mainland departure points of Galway Airport and Na Minna Airport, does not in any way deviate from previous tender competitions for this service.  On the type of aircraft that can be used to provide this service, the request for tenders allowed for all types of aircraft, as Regulations (EC) No. 1008/2008 does not define or limit the categories of aircraft to which PSO routes may be offered.  I have met representatives of the island communities on a number of occasions since the announcement of the preferred tenderer and their concerns about the tendering process and the future of the air service have been brought to my attention. I assure the Seanadóir and everyone concerned that I will continue to endeavour, within the scope available to me, to ensure an air service that serves the interests of the islands continues into the future. I am conscious of the time pressures and that the current contract comes to an end at the end of this month. I am aware of the meeting that took place in Galway yesterday. I ask today for space to allow the people in the Office of Goevrnment Procurement tasked with the responsibility of carrying out the process and the officials from my Department to evaluate a number of issues which have arisen in the recent past. I also acknowledge the fact that there have been a number of meetings on the islands, some of which were attended by politicians. I understand 18 politicians went to the public meetings on the three islands. The feedback I am receiving from various politicians is that all those meetings were held in a very dignified way and I acknowledge that fact also.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the first question relating to the meetings I had with the island communities prior to this tendering process, the message was loud and clear that they wanted to keep their air service and I ensured there was a protection in place to keep it. To repeat again, once I gave permission or the green light to the Office of Government Procurement to take charge of this process, I was outside that process. The Senator would be the first to tell me if a politician was interfering in an independent process. She would tell me I should not be involved in it. I came into politics in 1999, a time when there was tribunals about this and that where politicians did get involved in processes. It is important to make that statement. I spent a wonderful time on the Aran Islands a number of years ago. As a politician and as Minister of State with special responsibility for the islands, I wanted in the first 12 months of my tenure to go to the islands I had never visited. I had never been to Sherkin Island, off the coast of Cork, or Bere Island, where I had a wonderful experience. I had never been to Tory Island, but I have been there now. I have an outstanding invitation to Inishbofin, where there was an issue with bus transportation services. We sorted that issue and I would like to acknowledge the leadership shown on the island. I look forward to going to the Aran Islands and to the ongoing conversations and communications that need to happen. I appreciate the Senator's giving of the space to do that, but I am also conscious of the fact that the end of the month is near.  I once again acknowledge agus m'aitheantas a ghabháil don cheannasaíocht chumasach ar na hoileáin. Chuala mé go raibh na cruinnithe éagsúla ar na hoileáin iontach dínithe. Chuala mé fosta go bhfuil an cumarsáid atá ar siúl idir an comhairle contae agus na daoine sa Teach seo agus sa Teach eile iontach dearfach agus go bhfuil cumarsáid oscailte ann. Chuala mé an díospóireacht agus cím na deacrachtaí atá ann. Tá cuid mhór deacrachtaí ann ó thaobh achan rud ar na hoileáin idir pholasaithe éagsúla agus eile. Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl agus caithfear a chur in iúl arís m'aitheantas don obair chruaidh atá á dhéanamh ag na daoine san OGP. Ba orthu a raibh an dúshlán maidir leis an bpróiseas tairisceana. Tá an próiseas fós beo agus sin an fáth nach bhfuil mé ábalta cur isteach air.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Cím é sin agus tuigim an tábhacht agus an ceangal liomsa mar Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta. Tá dualgas ollmhór orm ó thaobh na hoileáin de. Táim anseo agus tuigim go bhfuil an dualgas seo orm agus go bhfuil ról tábhachtach agam ó thaobh mhuintir na n-oileán. I take my position very seriously and understand I have a specific responsibility in the Department. I ask that the Office of Government Procurement and my officials be allowed to have that important conversation. New information is coming through and time is required, but I am conscious that the service to the island is key, that the current contract is coming to an end at the end of the month and that there is a need for leanúnachas or continuity of service after 1 October.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the role the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, has played in the preparation of this Bill. It is an extensive Bill and he has remained interested in it and been in contact with me. Tá acmhainneacht mhaith ag baint le geolaíocht ilghnéitheach na hÉireann ó thaobh fosaithe breise barainneacha mianraí a aimsiú de. Tá córas cuimsitheach rialaitheach i bhfeidhm againn do gach céim ó thaiscéalaíocht go forbairt mianraí, lena n-áirítear pleanáil le haghaidh dúnadh agus feabhsú mianach faoi dheireadh. Tá sé seo fíorthábhachtach agus is cúis mhuiníne san earnáil é. Déanann an reachtaíocht nua seo comhdhlúthú agus nuachóiriú ar an gcód sin in aon reacht amháin. Tá ár ngealltanas an cód rialaitheach a choinneáil cothrom le dáta ar na príomhchúiseanna a mheasann suirbhéanna idirnáisiúnta Éire a bheith ar na tíortha is fearr maidir leis seo go leanúnach. I am very pleased to be in the Seanad again and to have this opportunity to present the Minerals Development Bill 2015 for the consideration of the House. The Bill will repeal a suite of Acts dating from 1940 and replace them with more up-to-date legislation so as to provide a modern regulatory regime for exploration and development of minerals, whether in State or private ownership. At 251 sections, it is one of the largest and most comprehensive Bills to come before the Oireachtas. Before proceeding with a summary of the detailed provisions, I would, first, like to offer some background to the minerals sector and existing legislation. Minerals exploration and development is currently regulated through the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999. Exploration for economic deposits of minerals is carried out under prospecting licences, while mining of any such deposit requires a State mining lease, in the case of State minerals, or a State mining licence for privately owned minerals. Both exploration and mining are undertaken by private enterprise, although the Bill does retain a power for the State to undertake prospecting also. I would like to make two things clear. In the Bill the term “minerals” does not include water, stone, sand, gravel, clay, turf, peat or topsoil. Nor does it include petroleum, which is regulated under separate legislation. There are, therefore, no provisions in the Bill relating to oil or gas exploration and development, or to any technique used in that industry such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Hydraulic fracturing is not a technique applied to prospecting or mining for minerals. I know that many Senators and Deputies have previously voiced their opinions and concerns about hydraulic fracturing, but that is a matter for discussion on another occasion. The term "mining" refers to the extraction, or development, of mineral deposits and in the Bill this activity is also referred to as "working". I will now turn to the context of mining and exploration in Ireland to give some background. Ireland is one of the leading zinc and lead mining countries in the world and continues to attract high levels of exploration interest and investment. An assessment of the contribution of the minerals sector to the economy which was published in 2013 indicates that it is an important sector and a vital contributor to the regional economy in the vicinity of operating mines. The report, by independent economic consultants Indecon Limited, focused on 2012, when there were still three operating zinc and lead mines. Indecon made the following key findings. In 2012 Ireland was Europe’s largest producer of zinc metal in concentrate and the tenth largest in the world and still holds that position today. In that year Ireland was Europe’s third largest producer of lead metal in concentrate and 12th in the world. The direct output value of mining in Ireland in 2012 amounted to €426 million. During the same period exploration and mining activity supported over 1,300 jobs directly, with another 1,900 supported indirectly. Braitheann breis is 3,000 míle duine go díreach agus go hindíreach ar thaiscéalaíocht. These jobs are provided on a broad regional basis, which is important.  Exploration and mining companies contributed a total of €56 million in taxes to the Exchequer during 2012. The State also benefits from payments made by mining and prospecting licence holders in the form of royalties, licence fees and payments which amounted to €9 million in 2012, and from indirect taxes and revenues. The broad contribution to the economy was estimated to be over €800 million, when the direct and indirect impacts of the wages and salaries of workers and the exploration expenditure of the companies are taken into account. I will now turn to current legislative provisions.The minerals sector is significant therefore and in order to continue to attract private investment a single national system for regulating mineral exploration, as well as clarity on the ownership of mineral rights, is essential. The Bill will replace legislation, dating from 1940, with modern streamlined statutory provisions. The minerals industry is currently regulated by the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999 comprising five statutes: the Minerals Development Act 1940; Part III of the Petroleum and other Minerals Development Act 1960; the Minerals Development Act 1979; the Minerals Development Act 1995; and the Minerals Development Act 1999. These Acts included provisions for: regulating minerals prospecting and development; a statutory vesting of the exclusive right to work minerals in the Minister, subject to the payment of compensation; acquisition of other rights necessary for efficient development of minerals, subject to payment of compensation; and payment to the State of rents and royalties from the extraction of minerals. The main objectives of the Bill are: to provide a modern regulatory regime for exploration and development of State minerals; to provide for regulating, in accordance with the principles of social justice, the exercise of private rights over minerals, and ancillary rights, while reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good; to provide for the continued vesting in the Minister the exclusive right of working, selling or otherwise disposing of private minerals which are not in course of development, subject to payment of fair compensation; to provide for preparation and implementation of rehabilitation plans for abandoned mine sites; and to provide for consequential amendments. The Short Title of the Bill is, "An Act to make further and better provision for the development of minerals in the State and for that purpose to repeal the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999 (other than certain provisions of the Minerals Development Act 1979) and the Minerals Company Acts 1941 to 1950, to make consequential amendments to other Acts, and to provide for related matters". The principal changes introduced by the Bill relate to the modernisation of the legislative code applicable to the minerals sector; the procedures for compulsory acquisition of ancillary surface rights; the basis for calculation of rents and royalties; and the basis for payment of compensation in respect of private minerals. The Bill will provide for greater transparency and predetermination of financial terms which will streamline the permitting process and bring other aspects of the regulation of the minerals sector into line with best practice, having due regard to the constitutional protection of property. The Bill does not directly address environmental matters because these are considered to be more appropriate to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and local authorities. Moreover, the legislation which established the EPA specifically prohibits conditions in mining permits designed to limit or control environmental emissions. Nevertheless, my legal advice is that the Bill must take appropriate account of these matters, in particular to address obligations under the Aarhus Convention which has been ratified by Ireland. The Aarhus Convention concerns access to information on the environment, public participation in environmental decision-making and access to justice in that context. The implications of the convention for exploration and mining were carefully considered in close consultation with the Attorney General’s office, and the provisions in the Bill in that regard have been drafted accordingly. The Bill is divided into eight Parts and the following is an overview of each Part. The first Part of the Bill provides standard provisions, namely, the Short Title, commencement arrangements, scope and interpretation. It provides that the Bill will apply to all minerals within the State or within designated areas of the continental shelf and that, for the purposes of the Bill, as in previous legislation, minerals do not include stone, sand, gravel or clay, turf or peat, or petroleum. Part 2 addresses the administrative practice for prospecting licences from application to surrender, including public notice and consultation prior to issuing of licences and payment of compensation for damage or nuisance arising from prospecting activity. It introduces a new type of licence, known as a retention licence, where a prospecting licence holder has discovered a mineral resource that cannot for the time being be worked due to environmental, access or other difficulties. This Part also provides that the Minister, in assessing the public interest of an application, takes into account the economic benefits to the region as well as the environmental impact of the proposed exploration programme. It provides for making regulations setting out conditions for a prospecting or retention licence. A new requirement is that prior written consent will be required for boreholes, trenching and bulk sampling. Airborne geophysical surveying is a matter for the civil aviation authorities but provision is made here requiring prior notice of such surveys and submission of data. Part 3 relates to working minerals. The Minerals Development Act 1979 vested in the Minister the exclusive right to work minerals, with the exception of a small number of existing mines in operation at the time. It also provided for the granting of that right to third parties under licence, subject to the payment of compensation to the mineral owners. These arrangements will be continued under the Bill. It has long been stated policy that an application for a permit to mine will only be accepted from holders of a current valid prospecting licence over the relevant area. That will now have a statutory basis. The main thrust of the changes in this area is to eliminate the difference between State and private minerals from the development perspective, providing greater predetermination and clarity of terms, financial and non-financial. Previously, there were leases to extract State minerals and licences for private minerals. Now there will be a single instrument - a mining licence. Part 4 deals with ancillary rights. To extract minerals safely and efficiently it is necessary to carry out a variety of other activities, referred to as ancillary rights. Existing legislation provides that the holder of a State mining lease or licence is entitled to “enter on the land on or under where such minerals lie and use such land in such manner as may be reasonably necessary for the working of such minerals or for any purpose incidental thereto”. By today’s standards, this gives too broad a scope. Current legislation also provides for compulsory acquisition of land and rights over land necessary for efficient working of minerals. The Bill will clarify rights necessary for working minerals and will divide these into “ancillary underground rights” and “ancillary surface rights” for licences issued henceforth. It will also bring the compulsory acquisition procedures in line with modern best practice. I consider it necessary to have these compulsory powers in place even though they are rarely, if ever, used. Part 5 deals with rehabilitation. This Part is based on Part 9 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 and deals only with “orphan” legacy sites. It is the responsibility of current mine operators to properly close and rehabilitate the sites when activity ceases. Mine operations, through the planning process, are subject to environmental impact assessment which requires detailed closure plans, with financial sureties to fund their implementation, aftercare monitoring and maintenance. Part 5 provides that, in certain circumstances, the Minister may, having consulted the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, designate a former mine site or adjacent land as a rehabilitation area. The Minister may only designate such a site where a mine has been abandoned or where operations have permanently ceased and it is necessary for the safety of the public or animals or to address major environmental damage. Once an area is designated as a rehabilitation area, the Minister may develop or adopt a rehabilitation plan and may implement it or authorise a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency to do so. That does not affect any obligations of former lessees or licensees who had been responsible for the mine site, owners or occupiers of sites or any other person who may have obligations. The Minister may recover through the courts any expenditure incurred by the implementation of the plan. The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, acquire private land, either by agreement or compulsorily, for the purpose of implementing a rehabilitation plan. The Minister must undertake a public consultation process before making a rehabilitation acquisition order. If considered appropriate, the Minister may appoint a hearing officer to hold an oral hearing to evaluate objections. Part 6 relates to the Mining Board. The Mining Board has been in existence since it was established under the Minerals Development Act 1940 and adjudicates on various issues arising under the Acts, including compensation to private mineral owners. This Part provides for the continuation of the board which consists of a chairperson and two ordinary members who are appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister. The chairperson shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing. Each ordinary member shall be a property arbitrator under the Property Values (Arbitration and Appeals) Act 1960. The provisions relating to the board are being updated in line with current best practice. New provisions in the area of ethics are provided in line with current legislation regarding other statutory boards. Part 7 relates to enforcement and miscellaneous issues. This Part mainly contains standard provisions, restated or updated where necessary. Penalties in respect of offences such as unlawful prospecting or working of minerals are brought up to date in line with current practice. Injunctive powers are being provided for continuing offences and in the case where the Minister might be prevented from undertaking rehabilitation work. Provision is being made for the appointment of inspectors to enforce the Bill. A requirement to notify the Minister of boreholes drilled for reasons other than prospecting or mining is a restatement of existing provisions in the 1940 Act.The vesting in respect of intellectual property rights in the Minister relating to the processing of data collected under the Minerals Development Acts and this Bill is also being provided for. This Part also deals with the registration of minerals that were exempt from statutory vesting under the 1979 Act and other miscellaneous matters. Part 8 of the Bill which involves transitional provisions repeals and consequential amendments, provides for various transitional arrangements, including the continuation of any licences granted under previous Acts on the terms under which they were granted until they are renewed under the revised legislation. Applications for prospecting licences or mining leases and licences that are made before enactment of the Bill will be deemed to be for licences under the Bill unless the Minister has already given notice of his intention to grant a licence. Chapter 2 sets out the Acts which will be repealed by the Bill. Chapter 3 lists amendments to other Acts as a consequence of the Bill. The Schedule contains a list of substances which for certainty are included within the definition of "minerals". This list is not exhaustive, as the definition of "minerals" contained in section 2 describes the term as meaning "all substances, including scheduled minerals". It may, therefore, allow other substances to be defined as "minerals". A similar Schedule to the 1940 Act has been reviewed with some additions and deletions. For example, chalk, flint and chert have been removed because experience has shown that their inclusion was not helpful. Mineral oils and natural gas have been removed because the 1960 Act provided for the separate regulation of oil and gas exploration and production. Other substances have been added, including industrial minerals that were not important in 1940 but have since gained significance such as andalusite, garnet and sepiolite. The Schedule also includes definitions of "dolomitic limestone" and "silica sand". Government approval for the publication and introduction of this Bill was given subject to any technical or drafting amendments that may be agreed between the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Attorney General. My Department has been liaising with the Office of the Attorney General in the interim. I propose to introduce a number of such amendments on Committee Stage. In particular, amendments will be proposed to give effect to certain obligations under the Minamata Convention on mercury which was signed by Ireland in 2013 and will prohibit primary mining of mercury. Other amendments will take account of legal advices in relation to the Aarhus Convention and will refine provisions that are already included in the Bill. I look forward to early consideration of the Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad. I ask Senators to table any proposed amendments as quickly as possible to allow time for their full and fair consideration. I will consider all amendments tabled. I look forward to an informed, positive and constructive debate on the Bill in this House and a fair wind for its passage through the Dáil. The Bill is important to improve and consolidate the legal framework underpinning the minerals sector which has been of great economic and social benefit in the past, as it will continue to be in the future. I am happy to commend it to the House.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I am keen to draw on some of the contributions made. I thank Senator Mark Daly for his support for the Bill. We had an extended conversation around safety, the nature of previous legislation and what happens after. He referred to the taxpayer bearing responsibility for the aftermath. We could use the example of Avoca mines. It will possibly take in the range of €50 million to put together a proper plan to deal with all the issues in Avoca. That is a great deal of money, which is why Avoca is an example of where the Department is trying to deal with an issue after the event. It is happening on the ground and great work is going on at local and community level. There is potential in the area and great ideas are coming from the community around potential industrial heritage tourism projects. The major issue is safety and that is where the Department is focused. That is an extreme example. There are existing ring-fenced closure funds for the likes of Galmoy and Lisheen mines. There is ring-fenced money for those sites going through the process of closure. Lisheen mine will be closing soon. The adequacy of bonds is an example of one of the issues we can tease out and on which we continue the conversation. One Senator referenced the language of legislation and made reference to the CPO. This is in the legislation, but it will probably never happen. Reference was made to the taxpayer ending up with the bill. To familiarise myself with mining activity, something with which I was not familiar prior to getting this post, I have been to Avoca and Navan. I have been down the Boliden mine in Navan. It is something else to drive into the mine and see what is going on there.It was very interesting to hear the first-hand account of people from the area who have spent decades mining in Navan and their very sharp focus on health and safety and doing the job as professionally as possible within the various constraints and challenges regarding environmental and community considerations. Senator Catherine Noone mentioned legacy mine sites. I do not want to revisit that matter. She referred to the economic output of €426 million, consideration of the Aarhus Convention and the outcome of public participation. Public participation is critical at an early stage. We have it in the aftermath in County Wicklow, which is positive, but this must happen before, during and after. Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh referred to dolomitic limestone, an isue which is being re-examined. He also has concerns about privatisation. I assure him the State can take privately-owned minerals. The Senator also posed questions about prospecting in sensitive SACs in Connemara. As he knows, if the proper processes such as, for example, an environmental impact study are undergone in respect of an SAC in Connemara, houses can still be built there. The fear on the part of the people in such areas is the cost of going through the process. Mineral mining can happen in SAC areas. Having a prospecting licence does not give someone the green light to mine because there are local authority and environmental impact considerations that go with it. Wearing my other hat, I am aware that there is a big debate regarding Inland Fisheries Ireland which will require legislation to establish who owns the rivers. We really need to get to the bottom of all of these considerations regarding ownership going back not decades but several hundred years. Senator Fidelma Healy Eames acknowledged the work of the Royal Irish Academy's pairing system. I launched the scheme several months ago. It is a good scheme because we are all, whether Deputies, Senators or councillors, practising politicians and there is constant tension between science and community. There is a black and white scientific approach which can sometimes upset communities but we need to bridge the gap. The best way to do so is through schemes such as the pairing system and I wish the Senator well with it. She asked whether the legislation recognised the rights of the citizen. Of course, it does. It brings the community in at an early stage. With regard to exemptions from the Planning Acts, there is obviously a role for the planning authority also. Senator Aideen Hayden referenced the fact that the legislation has been in preparation for five years and she referred to the former Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte. I would like refer to Frank Sheridan who retired this summer. He was a very dedicated official who was very much involved bringing the legislation to this point. I also acknowledge the other officials and former officials who have brought Bill to where it is at today.  Senator Aideen Hayden also spoke about abandoned sites and I mentioned Lisheen and Galmoy. There has been much community engagement and positive work in Avoca and the local authority is also involved. I have visited the site with Deputy Andrew Doyle. Acute safety issues arise there and it is on these that the Department is focusing. Senator Hayden acknowledged the Tellus programme. What she said is correct because that programme has been phenomenally beneficial, not only to the Department but also to local authorities in the context of examining water tables and other environmental considerations. The data being collected through geochemical and airborne surveying are critical and will help us as we deal further with the legislation.
