JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Members are a little tied for time.  Will this meeting continue during the Order of Business?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Okay.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise because I must leave the meeting in advance of Mr. Goan's presentation.  What are RTE's plans for the digital switchover?  Will it be on a phased basis?  How many digital channels will be available?  The perception in Donegal is that RTE is Dublin-centric.  There is a cultural and historical vacuum in terms of what RTE could be tapping into.  I do not simply refer to Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal but the entire north west of the country.On the issue of the Good Friday Agreement, does RTE have an integrated broadcasting strategy in terms of what is happening in Northern Ireland and in the Republic or is that being worked on at present?  BBC and UTV are providing a very good service to County Donegal, making cultural and historical television programmes which are of interest to people in the north west.  I believe we have an obligation under the Good Friday Agreement to develop an integrated broadcasting strategy and I hope Mr. Goan will be able to allude to some level of ongoing co-operation in that regard.  I do not mean to be dismissive of the type of programmes that are being made because certainly from a current affairs point of view, RTE makes a big effort.  However, the perception persists that the only time RTE comes to County Donegal is when there are car crashes or job losses.  There is a vacuum there and a need for a greater focus on special interest topics.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I asked about the cultural and historical aspects.  I was merely relaying perceptions on the issue.  I have a duty as a politician to relay these perceptions, just has Mr. Goan must defend RTE.In regard to the Good Friday Agreement, are negotiations being held on an integrated broadcasting strategy?  Under the Good Friday agreement we have an obligation to integrate various strands of strategy on issues from the marine to tourism.
