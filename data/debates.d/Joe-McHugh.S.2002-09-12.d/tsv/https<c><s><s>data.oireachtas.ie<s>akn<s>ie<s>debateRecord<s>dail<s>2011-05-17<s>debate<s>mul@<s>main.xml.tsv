JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of relatives of the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on 17 May 1974, a day when the greatest loss of life in a single day of the Troubles occurred.  I also commend Justice for the Forgotten on its ongoing efforts.  I first made contact with it when I was a Member of the Seanad in 2002.  The progress of its members and their journey has been a difficult one in dealing with their personal losses and trying to create a positive agenda of reconciliation and truth, not just in respect of the specific incidents but for a plethora of incidents over the years.  I acknowledge the comments by the Taoiseach, who said he will make this a matter of priority in communication with the British Prime Minister this week.  The Minister for Justice and Equality has reiterated the commitment by the Government to continue the ongoing dialogue to ensure we get access to records.The major question is how to address all the pain.  How do we address the hurt on all sides, including the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry, the Omagh bombing or Greysteel in a cumulative way and address in an individualised way the individual hurt in circumstances that are so different?  The consultative group of Dr. Robin Eames and Denis Bradley aspired to bring together all of these elements and set out a series of targets and strategies.  Unfortunately, that report will only be remembered for the recognition payment of €12,000, which was a sensitive element of the report that was not accepted.  This points to the fact that this is not just about remuneration but goes much deeper.  Whether we are looking at an independent legacy commission or, as Deputy Adams pointed out, a truth commission, a formula must be devised that is totally inclusive, open and transparent.The symbolism of today's visit may be overstated but I do not overstate it because it is part of an ongoing journey of reconciliation.  It is an acknowledgement of all the work across all of this island over recent years.  I refer to the peace and reconciliation forum and the major work at community level through Co-operation Ireland, the International Fund for Ireland, INTERREG and all the bodies working with the single intention of having a more peaceful community and creating a reconciliation forum to create the environment where people from different backgrounds can live together and accept the diversity that is so rich in this country.I acknowledge the work that has led to today.  What is significant about today is that it is part of an ongoing journey of reconciliation between the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  To build upon this is the next chapter.  I am conscious that complacency could creep into the east-west and North-South collaboration.  Such advanced movements have been made since 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement and matters having evolved to the point that we can move on.  I am a firm believer that to know where we are going, we need to acknowledge and accept what has happened in the past.With that in mind, I wish to record the massive challenges in respect of sectarianism.  That is still in existence and a number of new peace walls have been built since the Good Friday Agreement.  There are too many peace walls between interface areas and that type of sectarianism is a challenge.  It manifests itself in many ways, including in sports through the Northern Ireland football team and Rangers and Celtic matches.  That sectarianism is the next big challenge as a community on a cross-Border and east-west basis.The next Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement must be all-inclusive.  For five years, as some newer Members may be aware even though they were not part of this House, we did not have Unionist representation on that joint committee.  We must work together on a cross-party basis to ensure it happens.  Deputy Ó Caoláin is on record as being in agreement with that point.  The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is another forum that should have targets and an agenda rather than meeting two or three times a year and discussing issues relevant to the day.  Perhaps we should have more proactive engagement on that level because it is contained in the Good Friday Agreement for east-west co-operation and collaboration.  I acknowledge the symbolism of today's state visit from the Queen.  It is part of an ongoing journey of collaboration and co-operation.  I look forward to continued collaboration on a North-South and east-west basis.
