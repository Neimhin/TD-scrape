JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún atá curtha síos ag an Seanadóir Trevor Ó Clochartaigh maidir le Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin. Táim buíoch de bhaill an Tí seo mar gheall ar an spéis atá léirithe acu san ábhar seo atá gar do mo chroí. Ní miste a aithint go bhfuil tionscal na turasóireachta thar a bheith tábhachtach do gheilleagar na Gaeltachta. Tá sé tábhachtach chun fostaíocht a chruthú do phobal na Gaeltachta ar an mhórthír agus go deimhin ar na hoileáin Ghaeltachta, agus na hoileáin lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht. Sa bhreis air sin, tugann an turasóireacht deiseanna don Ghaeltacht an teanga agus an cultúr a chothú, a cheiliúradh agus a léiriú don domhan mór. Cuireann teanga agus cultúr na Gaeltachta iontu féin gné faoi leith leis an turasóireacht sa tír ar fad. Tá gné úr ag baint leis an turasóireacht sa Ghaeltacht anois le Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin atá forbartha ag Fáilte Éireann. Níl aon dabht ach go gcruthaíonn Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin ár gCamino féin anseo in Éirinn. Tá an cheathrú chuid den tSlí, atá 2,500 km ar fhad, ag dul tríd an Ghaeltacht, ó Chionn Mhálanna tríd an iarthar go dtí an deisceart. Is cinnte go bhfuil Slí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin ar cheann de na tionscnaimh thurasóireachta is rathúla atá forbartha le blianta beaga anuas agus go bhfuil sé ag déanamh difríochta nach beag do chúrsaí turasóireachta sa Ghaeltacht ach go háirithe. Maidir le ról agus tacaíochtaí Údarás na Gaeltachta i ndáil le cúrsaí turasóireachta, tuigim gurb í an aidhm atá ag an údarás ná an Ghaeltacht a fhorbairt mar cheann scríbe turasóireachta i gcomhar le Fáilte Éireann. Déantar é seo i gcomhthéacs na turasóireachta cultúrtha agus an tábhacht a bhaineann léi do gheilleagar na Gaeltachta agus don gheilleagar náisiúnta araon. Tá scéimeanna tacaíochta airgeadais ar fáil ó Údarás na Gaeltachta le tograí cultúrtha turasóireachta a bhunú agus a fhorbairt, lena n-áirítear tograí atá suite sna ceantair Ghaeltachta gar do Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin. Tuigtear dom go gcuirtear tacaíocht ar fáil do thograí turasóireachta cultúrtha trí ghnáthscéimeanna deontais an Údaráis, ina measc: staidéar féidearthachta nó taighde agus forbairt, deontas caipitil, deontas fostaíochta, deontas oiliúna, deontas do sheirbhísí comhairleoireachta, forbairt scileanna taighde margaíochta agus deontas rannpháirtíochta in aontaí trádála. Tuigim go mbeidh an t-údarás ag díriú i mbliana ar thacaíocht a thabhairt dá gcuid cliaint agus iad ag cur Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin chun cinn trí tháirgí nuálaíocha a chur ar fáil a bhfuil baint acu le teanga agus le cultúr na Gaeltachta i measc rudaí eile. Muid ag caint ar ról an Údaráis ó thaobh na turasóireachta de, ní fhéadfainn gan tagairt shonrach a dhéanamh don obair cheannródaíoch atá ar bun aige maidir leis an fhorbairt ag Teach an Phiarsaigh i Ros Muc. Mar is eol don Teach, tá an fhorbairt seo ar cheann de na tograí caipitil atá á maoiniú ag an Rialtas mar chuid den chuimhneachán ar 1916. Tá an tionscadal seo faoi cheannaireacht Údarás na Gaeltachta mar chuid de ghrúpa stiúrtha atá déanta suas de Chomhairle Contae na Gaillimhe, Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí, Fáilte Éireann agus mo Roinn féin. Tá mé ag súil go ndéanfar dul chun cinn suntasach in 2015 le go mbeidh an tionscadal críochnaithe in am do Cháisc 2016. Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis an Teach seo a chur ar an eolas faoin tacaíocht atá Údarás na Gaeltachta ag tabhairt do thograí agus do ghnólachtaí atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht ar Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Bhí mé ag caint faoi na scéimeanna fhoirmiúla atá ar fáil trí Údarás na Gaeltachta, ach tá ról leathan ag an Rialtas. Is é an nasc idir an Rialtas agus pobal na Gaeltachta an ceangal is tábhachtaí. Tá suim mhór agam, agus b'fhéidir go bhfuil suim mhór ag an Seanadóir freisin, sa teanga Gaeilge. Mar shampla, tá croí Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, na ceantair iargúlta agus na ceantair atá cultúr agus stair flúirseach acu. Is ansin atá na deiseanna móra. Nuair a bhí an tAire, an Teachta Paschal Donohoe, i dTír Chonaill coicís ó shin, dúirt sé gurb í an obair mhór atá ar siúl anois ná infheistíocht a mhealladh isteach sa Ghaeltacht. Tá an bealach ann. Is bealach fada é - 2,500 km - ach is é an ceangal idir an Rialtas agus na dream phobail ar an talamh an ceangal is doimhne. Chuala mé tuairim an tSeanadóra faoin gceangal seo. Ar dtús báire bhí sé ag labhairt faoi oileáin na Gaeltachta. Sin an deis mhór. Bhí seans mór agam anuraidh. Chuaigh mé go dtí Oileáin Bhéara agus Sherkin lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht agus bhí mé ar Oileán Thóraí. I mí Eanáir thug mé cuairt ar Árainn Mhór. Fuair mé cuireadh ó Oileáin Árann cúpla seachtain ó shin agus táim ag súil go mór leis an turas go dtí na hoileáin sin amach anseo. Tá ceangal mór idir oileáin na Gaeltachta agus na hoileáin lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht trí Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin agus ba mhaith liom obair leis an Seanadóir agus le Baill an Tí seo maidir leis na deiseanna a bheas ann amach anseo. Gabhaim buíochas arís leis an Seanadóir as ucht an cheist. Beidh gach duine ag labhairt faoi Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin. Tá plean ar siúl. Tá ceangal idir na Ranna ábhartha go léir agus tá ról mór ag an cheangal idir na dreamanna ar an talamh agus an Rialtas. Ba mhaith liom obair leis an Seanadóir agus a chomhghleacaithe i gContae na Gaillimhe. Tá deis ann. B'fhéidir go bhfuil seans ann go mbeidh ceangal le Port Láirge agus Contae na Mí fosta. Tá athrú ar siúl. Tá daoine i Meiriceá, san Astráil agus i dtíortha eile thar lear ag caint i dtéarmaí dearfacha faoi Shlí an Atlantaigh Fhiáin. Tá deis mhór ann do na daoine agus na ceantair faoi bhrú le dífhostaíocht agus eisimirce.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	This amendment is a technical amendment to the definition of a remote bookmaking operation to clarify that the definition encompasses the business and activities of a remote bookmaker or remote betting intermediary. Section 13 is also amended to introduce a similar definition for a bookmaking operation. The Bill provides that a licensed bookmaker may accept remote bets to a value of the lower of €250,000 or 10% of annual turnover. A licensed bookmaker who accepts remote bets to a value beyond this threshold will be obliged to take out a remote bookmaker’s licence. A technical amendment is made to section 13 which, for the avoidance of doubt, clarifies that the threshold value applies to any one calendar year of a bookmaker’s licence. The remaining amendments to sections 13 and 14 are technical amendments to rephrase the meaning of the term licence final day, in relation to a bookmaker’s licence, a remote bookmaker’s licence and a remote betting intermediary’s licence in order to remove any doubt about when these licences fall due for renewal.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senators for their invaluable and informative contributions and acknowledge that everyone has expressed a caveat.It is a regulatory Bill that is specific and interim. It is about betting and creating a level playing pitch for both the traditional bricks and mortar establishment on the high street and online betting. I hear the frustration and also a sense of urgency about the pertinent societal matters. That is coming through strongly in the debate. Senator Craughwell referred to the example of a €15,000 debt building up over a short period of time and an adult gambling €80,000 using a smartphone. These are serious issues that we must grapple with. Senator Mary Ann O'Brien also referred to the sense of urgency and the need for the gambling control Bill to be made a priority. The general scheme of the gambling control Bill was approved by the Government in July 2013 and the scheme is with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel awaiting formal drafting. At this stage, it is not possible to indicate when the Bill is likely to be published. I will speak to my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and the viewpoints of Senators will be listened to. Senator Maurice Cummins referred to children and those under 18 years. It is an important matter, as is his point about totes. I am repeating myself in saying that this is a regulatory Bill. Let us consider the frustration of the traditional bricks and mortar betting house having to pay a 1% levy when online competitors do not have to pay. The Bill provides for the regulation of all remote bookmakers and betting exchanges offering betting services in Ireland. Senator Cáit Keane referred to exchanges, which the Bill covers. This must be seen as the first phase of a more enhanced regulatory environment being prepared by the Minister for Justice and Equality. The general scheme of a new comprehensive Bill on gambling was approved by the Government in July 2013. Gambling control legislation will bring together, under a single enactment, the regulatory environment for all forms of gambling. The Government has indicated that the tote should be brought within the scope of the scheme following an examination of the issues involved. I hear what the Senator is saying about the tote but that will come under the forthcoming legislation. The House acts as an important springboard for forthcoming legislation in the short and medium term. Having been a Member of the Seanad for five years, the moral compass of the House is as finely tuned as ever in terms of the important issues at stake. Senator Michael D'Arcy referred to the wider legislative discussion, which will happen within the gambling control Bill. We are all grappling with the magnitude of the new ways of gambling and such rapid change in terms of the Internet. We might think that Facebook has been around a short time or a long time but it has been in existence for 11 years. Phenomenal change has happened in a short period. Any opportunity to discuss the wider aspects of Internet usage is a conversation that must be focused on. Senator Mary Ann O'Brien referred to Internet safety day taking place yesterday. This House has a role to play in that discussion. Senator Cáit Keane is correct that the Bill is about revenue collection and introducing a regulatory and licensing regime for online betting. Senator Sean D. Barrett echoed the sentiments and the amendment proposed by Senator Gerard P. Craughwell. That will be to the forefront of the gambling control Bill but I am not in a position to say when it will happen. The Senator's sentiments and his sympathy to the amendment are clear. In this regard Senator Mary Ann O'Brien emphasised speeding up the enactment of the gambling control Bill. I hope this debate will act as a catalyst in focusing the Minister on this. I will speak to her personally on the matter because many challenges exist. While betting offices on the high streets close at a certain time of the evening, someone can wake up at 1 a.m. and bet online. There are serious issues related to this. I do not propose to accept the amendment, but I hear the sentiment expressed by the Senators and his genuine and sincere concerns about the totality of gambling. The Senator drew parallels with warnings on cigarette packages and a similar message on gambling. That will be dealt with in the wider context of the gambling control Bill. I will not accept the amendment because I am confined by the specific nature of this interim legislation, which is about regulation to level the playing pitch for online and off-line and to examine the licensing regime and revenue collection.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I again thank Senators again their contributions. I know that they are reinforcing their original contributions which I take as sincere and genuine. This highlights the degree of frustration felt in trying to have a very important issue placed on the agenda. In line with Senator Darragh O'Brien's point, I will find out where the Bill is at in the drafting process. I will seek clarity on the issue before the next Stage. Senator Gerard P. Craughwell tabled the amendment. While there is a distinction to be drawn between gambling and betting, it is very hard to have that conversation without introducing wider societal issues, but it is only right to do so as they are interrelated. We are very familiar with the term "putting off until tomorrow what we can do today", but I am going to take back to my colleagues the very clear and loud message I have heard today. While the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has specific responsibility for this legislation, there is also a role for the Minister for Justice and Equality. There is a strong message for the senior Ministers which, no doubt, the Leader of the House will also carry back. However, we must consider what is practical and achievable within a short period because, given that there is possibly only one more term after this one, we are operating within tight time constraints. At the same time, however, if we can have clarity on the current position, we will seek to provide it. Senator Sean D. Barrett addressed a different section, about which there are issues I want to raise at a later stage.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Section 8 replaces section 5 of the principal Act. This section sets out the application process for a certificate of personal fitness to hold a bookmaker's licence for a person resident outside the State to the Minister for Justice and Equality. A person seeking a certificate of personal fitness must provide notice in two daily newspapers circulated in the State of his intention to make such an application, between two weeks and one month in advance of making the application. A period of not later than 56 days is provided within which the certificate is granted or refused. The section also provides a basis for refusing a certificate and for penalties for making or providing false or misleading statements or information in the course of an application for a certificate. On the Senator's question regarding whether there is an opportunity for third party objections or where objections should be lodged, I would point out there is a 56 day period of time. I will find out for the Senator whether the objection should be made to an independent person or whether it should go directly to the Minister or whether the objection should be made at a more local level. However, there is an adequate period of time before the certificate is granted or refused for an objection to be lodged. Also, the application is in the public domain for a period of two weeks through the newspapers. These time periods together should ensure that if there are third party objections they are facilitated. I will check out how contact is to be made with the appropriate person to lodge an objection. In the context of the gambling control Bill, the purpose of that Bill is to provide for a regulator. Perhaps we should have a similar point of contact in regard to this Bill and that bears consideration.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The section provides for the establishment, maintenance and publication of a register of remote bookmaking operations of all remote bookmaker's licences and remote betting intermediary licences by the Revenue Commissioners and stipulates the details to be included. It also provides for the removal from the register where a licence is revoked and that the Revenue Commissioners will publish the register of remote bookmaking operations on the Internet or in such other form as they consider appropriate.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for the delay in responding. The note is in English.  The Bill provides that a person in the State who fails to comply with a direction from Revenue to stop providing Internet access, advertising or promotion services to an unlicensed remote operator is committing an offence. The amendment provides for the penalties that will apply to such an offence. Section 29 inserts sections 32A and 32B into the principal Act to provide a mechanism to allow Revenue to prevent unlicensed operators from carrying on businesses in the State. These sections will prohibit Internet service providers, advertisers or persons promoting products from providing services in the State for unlicensed remote operators. Revenue may issue compliance notices to these service providers. The service providers may appeal a compliance notice to the District Court which will either affirm the notice or direct Revenue to withdraw it. A person who fails to comply with a notice by the specified date shall be guilty of an offence. The amendment sets out the penalties that will apply on conviction for an offence of failure to comply with a notice by the specified date. The Revenue Commissioners have been given temporary responsibility for enforcement against unlicensed remote operators pending the establishment of the gambling regulator under the proposed gambling control legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The amendments extend the period of registration of a bookmaking premises to two years, bringing the period into line with the new two-year period of a bookmaker's licence. They rephrase the meaning of the term "registration final day" to remove any doubt as to when the registration of a bookmaker's premises falls due for renewal and bring the date of renewal of registration under the Finance Act into line with the Bill. The amendments clarify the grounds on which a bookmaking premises can be removed from the register of bookmaking premises. In addition, a technical amendment is proposed to section 39 to ensure certain amendments of the Finance Acts which align the Acts' provisions on the registration of a bookmaker's premises with the provisions of the Bill will be enacted immediately on enactment of the Bill.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	With regard to amendment No. 16, while there has traditionally been a link between revenues accruing from betting taxes and the allocation to the horse and greyhound racing fund, there is no hypothecation of these revenues. All receipts from betting go to the Exchequer. The funding of the horse and greyhound industries is primarily a matter for discussion between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the annual Estimates campaign. Having said that, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has stated any increase in revenues as a result of these measures will allow the Government to provide additional funding in certain areas, including the horse and greyhound industries. In this regard, the Government has provided an additional €6 million a year for three years for the horse and greyhound racing fund. However, I reiterate that the funding for these industries is a matter, in the first instance, for the Ministers concerned. On taxing other forms of gambling, it is the Minister's intention to examine the options available in this regard. However, the priority is to ensure a regulatory framework is developed for the gambling sector and this will be brought about through the proposed gambling control legislation. On amendment No. 17, the Minister has consistently said his priority is to extend the existing system to the remote sector in order that all betting activity is included in the tax net. Once there is a level playing field, all other options around the rate and type of tax can be explored. It is the Minister's intention that all of the options available in this regard, including the taxation of other forms of gambling will be fully explored. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendments. It would require a dedicated evening to deal with the broader issues Senator Sean D. Barrett raised regarding the horse and greyhound industries. The additional funding provided in budget 2015 is to assist the industries in continuing to enhance Ireland's reputation on the world stage and in recognition of the significant positive impact they have, particularly through the creation and retention of direct and indirect employment in rural communities. There certainly is scope for a conversation around where the money goes, but the strong message I am getting from colleagues at local level is that the contribution of both industries to employment and local communities is extremely substantial. That is why it is important to ensure continued funding for the horse and greyhound racing fund.
