JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills	2002-09-12	None	A range of resources are available to support schools in dealing with identified additional educational needs, including needs which may arise for children who are experiencing homelessness. These include National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, supports and Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, supports. Identification of need and early intervention strategies are considered key components to supporting children who experience homelessness. NEPS works with schools through the Department of Education and Skills continuum of support framework. The NEPS model of service works through a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to support schools to meet the needs of individual pupils. NEPS psychologists can provide advice and guidance to principals and teachers on individual students' needs and in the development of whole-school approaches to support inclusion, participation and integration. DEIS is the main policy initiative of my Department to tackle educational disadvantage. DEIS provides additional supports, through the DEIS school support programme, to schools identified as having the highest concentrations of pupils from disadvantaged communities. Schools can use the additional resources to meet the identified needs of their pupil cohort, including the additional needs that may arise for pupils experiencing homelessness. DEIS schools can also avail of home school community liaison and school completion supports provided by Tusla's educational welfare service in relation to school attendance, retention and progression which can be areas of particular challenge to pupils experiencing homelessness. In addition, the Department of Employment and Social Protection runs the school meals programme, which provides funding towards the provision of food to some 1,580 schools and organisations benefitting 250,000 children. My Department is also represented on the homelessness inter-agency group established by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to co-ordinate the State's efforts to tackle homelessness.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is a fair enough suggestion. Anecdotally, I am picking up more examples of the prevalence of child homelessness in feedback from teachers dealing with children in homelessness. It would be a wise and important suggestion to ensure that all the information on whatever supports are available is provided to schools. Reading excerpts from the report of the research carried out by the Children's Rights Alliance, one of the areas highlighted is a failure to retain predictability in educational continuity. That is important in education. I will ensure that boards of management and school principals are aware of the available supports.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tackling educational disadvantage has been one of the positive outcomes of the work of the Department over the past number of years. Currently, we are reviewing the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme and educational disadvantage. Educational disadvantage changes and evolves and new issues and challenges arise. As part of our review of DEIS, we are using data we are compiling from postcodes on where people are living and also information on unemployment issues in regard to certain families. We need, however, to be adaptable regarding the changing nature of educational disadvantage. Over the past five to ten years, homelessness has certainly become a major issue. My officials are aware of that and I will ensure, whatever measuring instruments are used to tackle educational disadvantage, that continuity of education and the disruption and lack of certainty for families and children going to school is part of any analysis in the future.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	 My Department is aware that the establishment of special class provision in some schools and communities can be challenging. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is responsible, through its network of special needs organisers, SENOs, for the development, delivery and co-ordination of education services to children with special educational needs, including the establishment of special class and special school placements. For the 2018-19 school year, 160 new special classes have been opened. That means there are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared to 548 in 2011. There are 1,196 autism spectrum disorder, ASD, special classes.  The greater proportion of children with autism attend mainstream classes, but some require the environment of a special class or special school. Enrolment in a special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he or she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day, even with appropriate supports. The placement decision is based on a recommendation made by a relevant professional. While it is not always possible or practical that a special class placement would be available in a child’s local school, the NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, it is satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand nationally.  From time to time, the NCSE identifies local areas where additional provision is required.  In those circumstances, SENOs work with the schools and families concerned to resolve the issues involved.  The Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, when commenced, will assist in addressing this issue in areas where the NCSE is of the opinion that there is insufficient education provision for children with special educational needs. Section 8 of the Act, which will commence from Monday, 3 December 2018, will provide the Minister with a power, after a process of consultation with the NCSE, the board of management and the patron of the school, to compel a school to make additional provision for the education of children with special educational needs.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue because we have been grappling with it over the past ten to 15 years. The statistics from 2011 reported 548 special classes. That is now up to nearly 1,459. We are making gains but, at the same time, affording choice to parents has to be at the heart of that provision. I refer to whether they want their children to go to a special school or a special class or if they need ASD provision. The increase in the number of ASD units throughout the country has proved to be a significant success. That is attributable to the great work of the SENOs and the NCSE, as well as the work the Deputies did on the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which gave the Minister for Education and Skills the power to compel schools, where there is insufficient supply of ASD classes or special classes, to ensure that provision is made.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I accept the sincerity of the Deputy's contribution on this very important issue. In my early meetings with the officials in this area, I raised the question, even prior to the 3 December change, of compelling schools in cases where there is insufficient supply, a problem with a class or a need for an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, unit. My message to officials from day one has been to look with favour on any building request from a school for an extension which will accommodate an ASD unit and free up another classroom. That is the message coming across from Deputy Funchion as well. It is important to ensure equality of access for parents who want the best standards for their son or daughter. If they want their son or daughter to be in a mainstream school they cannot be disadvantaged. If they do not have a special class or ASD unit they are disadvantaged. That is the philosophy behind compelling the Minister to ensure this happens where there is an insufficient supply.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy is aware, over the course of the mid-term break my Department undertook structural assessments on all 42 school buildings constructed by Western Building Systems since 2003, following the identification of significant structural issues at Ardgillan community college in Balbriggan during an assessment undertaken by a structural engineer at the school on 19 October.  The safety of school students and staff has been and will continue to be my Department's overriding priority. I would like to acknowledge the impact this has had on students, parents, school principals, staff, patrons and boards of management of all 42 schools, in particular the 23 schools where precautionary measures were carried out. I would also like to thank all concerned for their patience and understanding over the last several weeks. My Department will now be moving as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations at the 42 schools and, following on from this, to implement the permanent remediation works required.  The Department fully intends to pursue the company through all contractual and legal channels for the cost of the precautionary measures and the remediation work. It is also my intention to initiate an independent review of the Department’s design and build programme, including aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight, both before and after implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014.  This will also involve the role and responsibilities of clerks of works, project managers, architects, designers and other professionals.  This will be an independent review conducted by a person or entity outside the Department and will be informed by the more detailed structural investigations to be carried out in the next phase of the programme.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In regard to statutory powers, we are working with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor on how we can begin a review and what powers it will be given. I will keep the Deputy up to date on that. In regard to the current situation, last week I was in Tyrrelstown along with the Taoiseach. We met representatives from KSNPM who have been working through this. We met with members of the board of management and the principals of both schools in Tyrrelstown. We are still trying to get the first and second floors into a fit state for the students to come back in the next two to three weeks. That is the focus. In regard to KSNPM's involvement, at no point in this process was the firm involved in any certification of compliance. The responsibility at all times, on any project before or since the 2014 legislation, is with the contractor, the builder, the architects and the design team. At no time was KSNPM involved in any certification of compliance. Second, KSNPM's knowledge of the buildings was very helpful during the process that took place over the Hallowe'en break when we were under pressure to get work done in a very speedy way. My first personal contact with KSNPM was last week. I met a few of the firm's officials and I would like to acknowledge all the work they did over the last several weeks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are going to undertake a review immediately. It has to happen quickly. That review will be independent. We are going to look at every aspect, including KSNPM, Turner & Townsend, the contractor and the Department's own clerks of works, which since 2017 have been appointed on every site. Second, it is important to put on record that we have set up an independent unit within the building unit in Tullamore. We now have dedicated officials working on this issue to take it through the independent review and to do everything to make sure that the remediation and precautionary work is paid for. A lot of scaffolding and fencing was required. Some of it was imported at short notice. At the three school campuses at Ashbourne, for example, 3 km of fencing went up over a weekend. That costs money, and the taxpayer will want to know who has paid for anything that costs money. My officials are determined to look at culpability and accountability and follow the people who put children's lives at risk.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his question. This year alone, my Department will spend in excess of €400 million on access measures for further and higher education students. This includes circa €380 million on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit approximately 78,000 further and higher education students. In terms of access initiatives, under the national access plan approximately 16,000 students are expected to be assisted in 2018 through the student assistance fund at a cost of €9 million, whereas 12,000 students are expected to be assisted through the fund for students with disabilities at a cost of €10 million. Approximately 400 students will benefit from the 1916 bursary fund under the programme for access to higher education, PATH, at a cost of €2 million. The national student accommodation strategy, NSAS, was published in July 2017 to enable an enhanced supply of student accommodation as part of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan. It set a target of 7,000 additional purpose-built student accommodation bed spaces to be delivered by the end of 2019 and construction of at least 21,000 bed spaces by 2024. This initial target is expected to be exceeded, with over 10,000 bed spaces either completed or on site as of October 2018. The Government is also developing measures to provide better rent predictability in purpose-built student accommodation in the forthcoming residential tenancies (amendment) Bill. Finally, the block grant paid to higher education institutions includes a specific weighting to promote access to higher education. This involves an additional premium for all eligible access students. This takes account of the cost of additional measures to support the enrolment and retention of students from under-represented backgrounds. For those from targeted socioeconomic groups and mature students, this is applied for the first two years of course duration to reflect the higher support needs during this period. For people with disabilities, a further weighting is applied for the entire length of the course to reflect the higher support resources required.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are two aspects to access to third-level education. The first is providing the platform to ensure students stay on after the junior certificate to sit the leaving certificate. I came across a very positive story at Larkin community college in Dublin's north-east inner city. When I spoke with the principal and staff at the college, I was informed that there is an 80% progression rate from leaving certificate to third level, including for trades and apprenticeships. It is an ambitious school and it is able to compete on the points scale as well, with students getting into the top courses and universities. There are examples of the fact that people will get to third level if the support system is provided. The Deputy's second point related to the barriers of cost and I can pick that up in my county, with parents deciding whether it is affordable to send a son or daughter to college in Dublin. These are the questions on the minds of parents. We need to continue an all-of-Government inclusive support. I acknowledge Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil for tabling their motions, which we support, seeking to ensure that we can have more supports in high-pressure zones and where the rental costs are high. We must continue to work in an all-of-Government and inclusive manner because this is such an important matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is no question but that this brings pressure on students and parents when they are trying to provide the best education for students. I know some students go on their own and do not have that support. I realise that there is pressure. There is an acknowledgement that we must ensure there is accommodation on campuses. A number of important provisions in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, which was passed by this Oireachtas, facilitate higher education institutes in borrowing money from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of financing student accommodation provision on campus. That is happening not just in the capital but throughout the country. Universities and other third-level institutions are considering ways to make more accommodation available for students. There are also rapid planning applications for student accommodation developments with in excess of 200 student beds. They are made directly to An Bord Pleanála. We must continue to focus on affordability and what universities can do. We should also acknowledge that universities and other third-level institutions are under financial pressure as well but we must examine ways to keep affordability at the heart of this conversation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy and acknowledge that this is an issue of concern. When I walk down the corridor and meet Deputies and Senators from north County Dublin, it is the only matter they raise. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years up to 2022, including six new primary and two new post-primary schools to be established in north Dublin. The four year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for additional school accommodation in other areas in the future. Based on the current analysis, this need can be addressed through either planned capacity increases in existing schools or additional accommodation or extensions to existing schools. Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools. The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. I know that the issue for the Deputy is the here and now, what happens today and what happens in September in the context of enrolments. I am working very closely on this with my officials to see if we can expedite the land acquisition, provide temporary accommodation and ensure that we meet the basic needs of students next September.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As politicians, we all live in the here and now and we all face challenges in terms of young people who are protesting for the right to appropriate school accommodation. There is a drive on now to acquire the site for St. Joseph's. The project is included in the Department's six-year plan up to 2021. The capital funding has been ring fenced and there is no question of this not happening. We must try to move forward within the time constraints and pressure. We must bear in mind that there has been an explosion in housing in north county Dublin. We are constantly hearing in this House that the Government is not building enough houses but there has been an explosion in the provision of accommodation in north county Dublin in the last five years. However, that is not an excuse for not acting. I will bring the concerns of colleagues from north county Dublin back to the officials in the building unit in my Department and ensure that this issue is kept on the radar. In respect of St. Joseph's school, the Department will be providing two science laboratories, one technical graphics, design and communications room and one general classroom as an interim measure. The main issue is completing the site acquisition.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is no solace in repeating for the Deputy what I have said already. Obviously the population in the area has been growing over the last ten to 20 years. Our geographical information science, GIS, system is factoring in recent house building and family formation in the context of future planning. That is why we have identified the need for 42 new schools nationally. There is obviously a gap in this area and that is something of which I am very conscious. I will continue to liaise with colleagues on this issue and keep the pressure on with regard to the land acquisition. The Deputy is correct in saying that there are similar issues in Skerries and other parts of north county Dublin. In terms of school planning areas, the list includes Beaumont, Whitehall, Swords, Scribblestown, Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Donaghmede, Castleknock, Carpenterstown and so on. There has been a population explosion in north Dublin with which we must deal and this is a priority for me.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht a bheannachtaí. Beidh mé sásta an teanga a bhogadh ar aghaidh san áit seo. Beidh mé tiomanta é sin a dhéanamh agus beidh mé ag iarraidh cuidiú, taithí agus comhairle an Teachta amach anseo maidir leis an bhealach is fearr chun an teanga a bhogadh ar aghaidh sa Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. Tá an-áthas orm a bheith ceaptha mar Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna agus tá mé ag súil go mór le bheith ag obair leis na páirtithe leasmhara maidir leis an Ghaeloideachas. Bíonn mo Roinn ag obair le comhpháirithe i saol an oideachais agus le páirtithe leasmhara ar bhonn leanúnach. Chuaigh Gaeloideachas i dteagmháil leis an Roinn le gairid chun cruinniú a eagrú. Tá oifigigh sa Roinn i dteagmháil le Gaeloideachas i láthair na huaire chun dáta a chinntiú don chruinniú seo agus meastar go dtarlóidh sé go luath. Beidh ionadaíocht leathan ar an gcruinniú seo ó mo Roinn agus déanfar iarracht forbairt a dhéanamh ar chomhrá roimhe seo agus ar fhorbairtí a tharla idir an dá linn. Tá mé ag súil le rannpháirtíocht leanúnach le Gaeloideachas agus le páirtithe leasmhara eile. Chomh maith leis an scéal seo, tá teachtaireacht amháin agam faoin ról atá agamsa sa Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna. Dá mbeadh aon bhailiú nirt de dhíth maidir leis an Ghaeilge, tá mé ag iarraidh a chur in iúl do na páirtithe leasmhara éagsúla timpeall na tíre - an Roinn agus na daoine, comhlachtaí, dreamanna agus grúpaí atá freagrach as an teanga - go bhfuil mé anseo chun an Ghaeilge a bhogadh ar aghaidh. Táim tiomanta é seo a dhéanamh.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	B'fhéidir go mbeidh.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Táim dóchasach go mbeidh an cruinniú ag dul ar aghaidh roimh Nollaig mar fhreagra ar cheist a haon. Maidir leis an dara ceist, agus an ról i dtaobh na teanga agus na scoileanna nua lánGhaeilge, bhí cruinniú agam leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga an tseachtain seo caite agus bhí mé ag labhairt leis faoin dúshlán sin. Is é mo thuairim phearsanta dá mbeadh aon éileamh láidir i leith na scoileanna úra go mbeidh mé ag amharc ar an mbealach chun níos mó cuidithe a thabhairt don bhforas pátrúnachta nuair a bheidh siadsan ag lorg an chéatadáin chéanna maidir leis an éileamh sin a bhaint amach ag na tuismitheoirí. Táim ag obair i gcomhar le mo chuid oifigeach faoi láthair maidir leis an mbealach is féaráilte agus is cothroime maidir leis sin fosta. Bhí cruinniú dearfa agam leis an gCoimisinéir Teanga an tseachtain seo caite agus beidh mé ag breathnú ar an mbealach is fearr maidir leis an gcothroime seo a choinneáil leis an iarratas a bheidh á dhéanamh acu amach anseo.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Bhí €2.3 milliún d'acmhainní ar fáil maidir leis na scoileanna lánGhaeilge sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Beidh €5 milliún ar fáil an bhliain seo chugainn in 2019 maidir le na hacmhainní, an tacaíocht agus an cuidiú atá de dhíth sna scoileanna sin. Dá mbeadh aon cheist i dtaobh na scoileanna éagsúla taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht a mbeidh ag iarraidh sruth Gaeilge - tá scoil thar barr i Sligeach agus i bPort Laoise chomh maith mar shampla maidir le sruth Gaeilge - bheadh suim agam maidir leis na scoileanna sin ar spéis leo an Ghaeilge a bhogadh ar aghaidh le sruth Gaeilge, bheinn sásta é sin a dhéanamh fosta. Beidh suas le €5 milliún ar fáil maidir leis na hacmhainní do na bunscoileanna agus na meánscoileanna istigh sa Ghaeltacht an bhliain seo chugainn, Dá mbeadh aon de na scoileanna éagsúla taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht, cibé acu lánGhaeilge nó le roinnt Gaeilge iontu, beidh mé sásta suí síos leo.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not know whether the Deputy was listening when I was responding earlier. The answer to this question is a little different. It is a variation of the previous response so I will put it on the record. The safety of the school students and staff has been my priority from when the initial invasive work was done in Ardgillan on 19 October. It continues to be my overriding priority. I shall give a summary of the outcome. Nineteen schools were cleared to open in full without any precautionary works, 19 were enabled to open in full following external precautionary measures in the form of fencing around all or part of the building and protective decking, and three were enabled to open, initially at ground floor level only, following the implementation of both internal and external precautionary measures. The latter relates to two schools in Tyrrelstown and Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in Lucan. One building, namely phase 1 of Ardgillan Community College, closed completely. Internal precautionary works are currently ongoing on the upper floors of the three schools that were opened initially at ground floor levels only. I assure the Deputy that the Department's priority is to have these works completed to enable all three schools to open fully and the students who were temporarily decanted off site to return in the coming weeks. I acknowledge the impact this has had on parents, staff and boards of management in recent weeks. I thank them not only for their patience and understanding but also for being proactive. They have been proactive in ensuring whatever measures needed to be put in place would be put in place. I was in Tyrrelstown last week. I watched how the work was organised. It included gardaí, stewards and staff decanting students on a day-to-day basis in the rain. It was exceptional work in a short period. Let me focus on what happens next. We will move as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations in all 42 schools, even the 19 that did not have any structural issues. Following this, the objective is to implement the permanent remediation works required.  It is also my intention to initiate an independent review of the Department's design-and-build programme, to include aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight, examining aspects both before and after the implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014. This will be an independent review conducted by a person or entity outside the Department. This review will be informed by the more detailed structural investigations to be carried out in the next phase of the programme.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy's point on responsibility to the taxpayer. We are in a responsible position and have to ensure not only that there is value for money but also that if we are sending young people into schools, they are safe. My officials were working in the understanding that the schools were safe structurally. There is a massive break of trust in terms of who signed off and who was ultimately responsible.That is why I want the independent review to examine all aspects of the process, beginning with procurement. The idea that we must have people looking over the shoulder of a bricklayer to check whether wall ties have been installed is not normal in construction. There must be a degree of responsibility. However, if checks are necessary before the cavity walls are closed to ensure wall ties are of the right place and number, that will be done.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the point raised by Deputy Pringle regarding culpability and responsibility, it is very important to point out that under the 2014 legislation and previously ultimate responsibility lies with the contractor and design team. There has been an average 18% increase in the cost of private sector construction, including of houses, hotels and apartment blocks, because of the delay involved in ensuring a fire officer inspects the project and ensures every step has been properly completed On the speed of the works, many of them were built within a 24 to 26 week period. That is not to say that rapid build cannot be done properly. Rapid build construction is being employed to deal with the housing crisis and for several student accommodation projects, as was raised earlier. It works if it is done properly. The message that must go out is that whether a building is to be completed in 24, 36 or 42 weeks, it must be done properly. There was obviously carelessness and unacceptable standards in the construction of these schools. A Supplementary Estimate was submitted for the Department of Education and Skills. We do not have a specific figure for the costs because we must first undertake a comprehensive assessment of all 42 schools. In regard to the timeframe that Deputy Byrne mentioned, I refer to the decanting of students from Gaelscoil Eiscir Riada in Lucan and the two schools in Tyrellstown. It was envisaged that the works on the first and second floors would be completed as a priority in the coming weeks. That work is continuing, with working hours extended after 3 p.m. and at weekends. We hope to get those students back into their schools. The second piece of work, which is significant, will be a comprehensive analysis. We have set up a new section in the building unit to deal with it. Once that has been completed, we will maximise the holiday period to progress any work that is required.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. We have worked closely together on this issue for too long. We are on the same hymn sheet in terms of trying to get the issue resolved as a matter of priority. I look forward to continued engagement on the issue. As the Deputy is aware, the education campus project to which he refers is included in my Department's capital programme 2016 to 2021 and the money required will be ring-fenced. Negotiations with the landowner in respect of the preferred site option to accommodate the campus are under way. The Deputy will appreciate that negotiations in respect of site acquisitions are, by their nature, sensitive and for that reason I am not in a position to provide further information at this time. However, I assure him that all parties are working to bring matters to a conclusion at the earliest possible date and Department officials will continue to keep the relevant school authorities appraised of progress. In that regard, a meeting between school authorities and Department officials has been arranged for later this week. When the site acquisition is complete, the next stage of the process involves the project for the campus progressing to architectural planning. At this stage it is premature to give a timeframe for completion of the building project. I acknowledge that the local community, including the parents who have sons or daughters in the three schools, have been waiting patiently for the campus. The issue must be taken very seriously as they have been waiting almost two decades for it to be resolved. I look forward to continued engagement with the Deputy on the issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not get into a political argument on the issue. Frustrations manifest themselves in many ways. We have a tremendous opportunity to bring together three great schools on a Crana College campus, including a Gaelscoil and a Gaelcholáiste.It is an ideal scenario. The Government's priority has always been to provide the funding. The funding is ring-fenced under the 2016-21 programme. There is no question about that. The delays are being caused by negotiations with a private owner. At this stage, all parties should be afforded the space to ensure these sensitive negotiations are carried through in a timely way. We need to ensure we get the proper result for the community. The various partners involved in this project, including Donegal County Council and Donegal Education and Training Board, DETB, are all on the same hymn sheet.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We still need a decision to be made. There is engagement now. It is at a heightened level, as it has been in recent months. I hope we get a successful outcome here.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important to point out that, as Minister, I am not involved in any of the negotiations on this matter. The officials in my Department are working on it. I assure the Deputy that they are providing the necessary focus to try to bring this to a conclusion as speedily as possible. I am conscious of the frustrations, dreams and visions of those whose sons and daughters have attended these schools and have come out the other end. If all partners and stakeholders can work to bring this to a conclusion as soon as possible, that will be met with a tremendous drive. The Deputy spoke about the energy in these three schools. Like him, I am in touch with the principals and the teams in the staffrooms on a daily basis. There is an energy to drive this project. The development of this physical building would be a tremendous bonus to future education in this area.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A building project at this school that primarily involves the replacement of existing temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation is included in my Department's six-year construction programme. The project will consist of an extension to include 12 mainstream classrooms, a two-classroom special needs unit and some refurbishment works to the existing accommodation. The schedule of accommodation for the project has been finalised and provided to the school authority. The project brief has also been finalised. It was advised to the school recently that it is intended that the project will be progressed under the Department's ADAPT programme. ADAPT is an accelerated programme which uses a professional external project manager to co-ordinate and drive the respective design teams on each project. My Department will be in further contact with the school when the project manager has been appointed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are two aspects to the larger project. It is important to appoint an ADAPT project manager. The Deputy is articulating this strongly and my officials are listening to her. She mentioned the existing prefabs in the context of today's stormy conditions. Two of the school's older prefabs have been in poor condition since Storm Ali earlier this year. While I understand that some repairs have been carried out to the prefabs under the school's insurance policy, a condition report prepared at the school's request has indicated that further remedial works are needed. The Department has advised the school to complete an emergency works application form with a view to undertaking remedial work to these prefabs pending their replacement as part of the proposed building project. The Deputy and the school authorities are trying to do two things. They want pupils to be able to get on with their daily lives in the education system. They are keeping the larger project in mind as well. They are keen to ensure the prefabs are of a standard that meets all the safety requirements. I am taking on board what the Deputy has said.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are dangers with giving the specifics of a timeframe because people can be disappointed when there is no movement on that timeframe. It is intended that the process of procuring a project manager will be initiated shortly. We could get into a more definitive explanation of what is meant by "shortly". Some people might think it means before Christmas and others might think it means after Christmas. In fairness, many school authorities and young people are resilient. They will put up with lower standards if they know things are certain to come down the line. I get that as well. People like to be kept in the picture and in the know. I will get my officials to give the Deputy a direct call on this matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have had a number of conversations about this issue. I apologise to the students for being unable to meet with them last week; I was at an event at the Aviva Stadium. I thank them for their correspondence. A major capital project for the provision of permanent accommodation for the school referred to by the Deputy to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 1,000 pupils is being addressed through my Department's capital programme. My Department has been liaising with Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, KWETB, with a view to providing the new 1,000 pupil school on the site of Bray Institute of Further Education, BIFE, in a campus-type arrangement.  The site in question is almost 12 acres.  It was envisaged that the master planning of the site would also provide an opportunity to put plans in place to provide modern fit-for-purpose accommodation for BIFE through a multi-million euro investment.  Unfortunately, my Department understands that the board of the ETB does not agree with this approach. My Department will have to consider this development and the next steps to address the long-term accommodation needs of the school.  This will be done as a matter of priority given the urgent need to find a permanent home for the school. With regard with the school's interim accommodation, the lease on the school's temporary accommodation on Putland Road is due to expire on 30 April 2019 and the property is up for sale. My Department’s preferred option for interim accommodation is for the school to remain in this location.  Accordingly, my Department has indicated to the owner of the property that it would be interested in exploring the potential to licence or lease the property from the purchaser should the purchaser be amenable to such an arrangement.  My Department is also exploring other options should it not be possible for the school to remain in the Putland Road property.  In this context, it is engaging with the patron body of the school and KWETB regarding all other short-term accommodation solutions.  My Department is meeting with the patron and school management tomorrow regarding the accommodation issues.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is an important ongoing issue. I spoke to my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, about it yesterday. Looking at it in a common sense, value for money way, the BIFE site is 12 acres and owned by the State. It will not cost money to acquire, and, therefore, it is an option. There is also a constraint on the Putland Road site because there is a protected structure on it. It is a smaller site of some 4.3 acres. We have to ask whether the school can do what it wants to do on a 4.3 acre site. The Deputy believes it can. We need local engagement now more than ever. I have spoken to the Minister for Health, about this matter, and Deputy Brady has raised this on a number of occasions with me. A meeting of minds is required at tomorrow's meeting. The formal decision by the board of the ETB to reject the BIFE site as a preferred location was only taken earlier this week. We have to take that on board. From a taxpayer's point of view, it must be acknowledged that the officials were considering a site that would not cost anything. The Putland Road site would cost money, and it is also zoned. I do not know what the valuation of the site is or what it might cost. Patronage was awarded in 2013 and the school was up and running in 2016. Education is the most important issue, and I will focus on that. We need certainty on what the next stage will be. Tomorrow's meeting will be crucial in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No student sitting his or her leaving certificate examinations will be left out. Alternative temporary solutions are being worked on, and we have been focusing on this issue. The significant question is how to address the long-term issue here. The meeting tomorrow is a follow-up to consider the decision made by the ETB. There must be a meeting of minds, and there must be focus on the long term. The short-term issues will be dealt with. Certainty is also needed. There is no point in my saying that the school will be located at a certain site. That would do a disservice to the community and the process in place. It is good that the ETB has now made a decision. I understand the Deputy's frustration. This matter has been ongoing for a number of years. However, we need certainty, and I believe things will happen quite quickly after tomorrow's meeting.
