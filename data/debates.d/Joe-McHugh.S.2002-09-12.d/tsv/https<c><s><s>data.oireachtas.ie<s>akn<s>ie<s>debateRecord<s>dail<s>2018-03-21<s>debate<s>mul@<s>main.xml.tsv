JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I move:That the Resolution of Dáil Éireann of 13th July, 2016, as amended by the Resolution of the Dáil of 3rd October, 2017, regarding the Citizens' Assembly is amended by the deletion of 'but in any event not later than 29th March, 2018' and the substitution therefor of 'but in any event not later than 27th April, 2018'."Ceadaíodh Tithe an Oireachtais Tionól Saoránach a bhunú faoi réiteach i Mí Iúil 2016 le rith i gcomhair bliain amháin ón dáta a bhí an chéad cruinniú aige. The assembly was asked to consider five topics and to report back to the Houses on each one when it had completed its deliberations.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ndiaidh an sínte i Mí Mheán Fómhair a chuaigh thart, bheadh an t-am suas ar 29 Márta i mbliana. Following an extension last October, the assembly's term is due to expire on 29 March 2018. The assembly has now considered four of the five topics listed in the resolution. The final meeting to consider the remaining item, that of fixed-term parliaments, was scheduled for the weekend of 3-4 March. However, due to the adverse weather conditions caused by Storm Emma, it was deemed necessary to cancel the meeting in the interest of safety concerns for assembly members, suppliers and staff. Rescheduling the meeting before the assembly's term expires has not proven possible due to the unavailability of members, with the St. Patrick's Day holiday, the approach of the Easter holidays and the difficulty in securing suppliers and a venue. The chair of the assembly, Ms Justice Mary Laffoy, has therefore requested a further extension of the assembly's term to the end of April to allow for the completion of its work programme. Under the circumstances, I consider this request reasonable. The Citizens' Assembly and the Constitutional Convention before it have been bold and innovative exercises in deliberative democracy. Their work has helped inform and shape our political decisions. Tá siad tar éis léargas fiúntach a thabhairt dúinn maidir leis na rudaí atá tábhachtach do dhaoine agus na torthaí a bhainfeadh siad amach dá mbeadh na sonraí agus an t-am acu. The 99 citizens of the assembly have given a significant amount of personal time to considering the diverse and demanding topics put before it. The assembly's sessions are streamed live. Anyone who has listened in will realise the complexities involved and how thoroughly each topic to date has been considered. Gabhaim buíochas le baill an tionóil agus leis an gcathaoirleach fá choinne an sár-obair atá déanta acu agus an díograis a chur siad isteach. Tá an tionól neamhspleach den Rialtas. The assembly operates independently of the Government and decides on all matters relating to its operation, including its rules of procedure, arrangements relating to its membership, the timing of its meetings and, subject to the resolution passed by the Houses, the prioritisation of its work programme. Recognising the importance of the eighth amendment of the Constitution, the assembly devoted five weekends to consideration of this topic and submitted its report to the Oireachtas, which referred it to a committee of both Houses, as detailed in the resolution. Two weekends were accorded to consideration of how best we respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population and the report and recommendations have been submitted to the Houses of the Oireachtas. The assembly considered over the course of two weekends how the State could make Ireland a leader in tackling climate change and a further weekend was devoted to considering the manner in which referenda were held. The work of the assembly to date has helped to inform and shape our political decisions. With one more topic to consider, the assembly is nearing completion of the work that we in the Oireachtas asked it to do. The assembly proposes that the final weekend meeting to consider fixed-term parliaments will take place before the end of April, subject to this short extension being approved by both Houses. Tá sé tábhachtach, fá choinne an tionóil, go mbeadh mí breise aige chun a chuid oibre a chur i bhfeidhm. Gabhaim buíochas fá choinne labhairt sa díospóireacht. I commend the motion to the House.
