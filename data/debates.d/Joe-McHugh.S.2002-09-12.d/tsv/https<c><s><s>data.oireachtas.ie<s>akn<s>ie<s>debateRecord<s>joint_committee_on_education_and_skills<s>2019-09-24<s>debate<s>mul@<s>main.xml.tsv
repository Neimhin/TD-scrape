JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis an gcoiste fosta. I thank the joint committee for its invitation and affording me the opportunity to speak about the issue of reduced timetables. I also thank the representative bodies who presented on the issue at previous hearings for their input and contributions.  The basic aim of the Government is to use our economic success to build a fair and compassionate society. Equality of opportunity is at the heart of our vision. As I stated on many previous occasions and reiterate today, each and every child has a right to an education to enable him or her to live a full life and realise his or her potential. I have made my position clear that all pupils enrolled in a school should attend for the full day, unless exempt from doing so for exceptional circumstances. Reduced timetables are not in any way a standard aspect of a child’s experience of school and must not be allowed to become such; rather, they are an exceptional measure. While it may be necessary in some circumstances to use a reduced timetable, for example, as a means of assisting the reintegration of a pupil into a school routine, such arrangements should only be put in place in limited and time-bound circumstances.  Officials of my Department have been working closely with officials from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla which is within the remit of that Department in the monitoring of and reporting on this practice to address the issues raised in the committe's interim report. A set of guidelines is being prepared jointly by my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide clarity for school authorities and parents or guardians on the reporting of reduced timetables in schools to ensure their use is limited to those circumstances where it is absolutely necessary and, where in the rare circumstances such usage occurs, schools follow best practice, with the interests of the student to the fore. As is normal practice, prior to finalising the guidelines, my Department, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla are arranging for a consultation process with education stakeholders, including the school management bodies.  Provision of support is critical and I want to highlight the investment the Government is making. This year’s education budget is €10.8 billion. This highlights the Government’s strong belief in and commitment to the power of education. Nearly €1 in every €5 of this year’s budget, or about €1.9 billion, is being invested in supporting children with special educational needs, including those with challenging behaviour, in school. This is the highest ever level of Government expenditure on special education. It provides for a continuum of special educational provision to be made available to children with special educational needs, including those with challenging behaviour, in order that, regardless of the level of need of the child, educational provision can be made for them.  The number of special education teachers has increased by 37%, from 9,740 in 2011 to over 13,400. The number of special needs assistants, SNAs, has risen by 51%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,950. Schools can now allocate additional teaching support to a child whose challenging behaviour is having a significant impact on his or her ability to learn in school. Children do not need a special educational needs diagnosis to access these supports and parents or guardians will no longer be required to have their child receive such a diagnosis. Schools may also access SNA support for children with additional care needs, including challenging behaviour. All schools can access in-school supports and continuous professional development through the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to assist teachers in working with children who display challenging behaviour.  The number of specialist placements for children with complex special educational needs has also been significantly increased by the Government. Over 1,050 additional special placements have been provided in the new school year. There are now 1,621 special classes, compared to 548 in 2011, including 1,355 to cater for children with autism. Some 125 special schools, including a new special school to be established this year, also provide specialist education for students with complex special educational needs. These schools provide over 8,000 places compared to 6,848 in 2011. I note that the committee questioned whether SNA support was the most appropriate in dealing with a child’s challenging behaviour. As committee members are aware, the view of my Department and that of the NCSE is that students need the right support from the right person at the right time to achieve his or her full potential. To that end, a preschool and an in-school therapy demonstration project is being undertaken in 75 preschools and 75 schools to provide in-school therapeutic support for students. In addition, €4.75 million was allocated in budget 2019 for the trialling of a new school inclusion model of support to include in-school provision of behavioural practitioners, psychologists and regional support teams to build capacity in schools to meet the needs of their students. The outcome of the pilot scheme will inform future policy and service provision, including the provision of behavioural support.  The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, works with both primary and post-primary schools and is concerned with learning, behaviour, social and emotional development. The Government has recognised the valuable input of the NEPS for pupils and schools. Over its lifetime it has increased psychologist numbers from a sanctioned level of 173 whole-time equivalents in 2015 to 204 whole-time posts, with a commensurate increase in investment, from €18 million to €20.75 million per annum in the period.There are 190 posts in the system, with recruitment to fill 14 new posts and vacancies under way. Supports are also provided for DEIS schools, at an overall cost of €125 million for 891 schools serving approximately 190,000 pupils to improve attendance, retention and school participation.  Enhanced capitation payments for Traveller children in the system are provided, at a cost of €1.1 million. Actions are being progressed under the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy to improve education outcomes for Travellers, including a pilot project to target school attendance, retention and participation, commencing this September. Additional supports have been provided to support this pilot project in the form of home-school-community liaison officers funded by my Department, in addition to Traveller education workers funded by the Department of Justice and Equality and educational welfare officers employed by Tusla.  In summary, I anticipate that the guidelines and notification system will allow us to monitor the use of reduced timetables and, ultimately, address the issues raised. If parents have concerns about the use by a school of a reduced timetable for their child, they can contact their local educational welfare officer who has statutory responsibility for ensuring the rights of the child to an education are upheld and will advise them on the most appropriate action to take. My Department will continue to work closely with Tusla's educational welfare service and the NCSE to ensure that where in the very limited number of cases a reduced timetable is deemed to be necessary, such measures will be used for time-limited periods only.  I again thank the committee for highlighting this issue. I am aware that it is an interim report and that the committee will be working on new proposals and suggestions in the not too distant future. I look forward to working with and hearing from it in that regard. I thank the groups and individuals who have contributed. As a Government, we have demonstrated and will continue to work to realise our commitment to ensuring all children receive the fullest possible education. I am also very conscious that there are challenges and that parents and children are facing them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their contributions. There were a number of questions but there were a number of suggestions as well. That is helpful. As I stated at the outset, this committee did quite a bit of the heavy lifting around this issue. When one considers that the committee submitted its interim report in June - I propose to take the Chairman's last suggestion first - it would be important to keep the committee involved right through the consultation. I am happy to provide a copy of the committee's report to the stakeholders. In fact, many of the committee's suggestions and recommendations frame these guidelines. On top of that, in response to Deputy Jan O'Sullivan's question on a timeframe, I would like to work within quite a tight timeframe on this consultation. It will be up until 18 October. We are looking at this year to try to get something in there and get something working for the new year or the new term. Let us work together on that. I would be happy to include the committee on that. On Deputy Thomas Byrne's questions, first of all,every child has a legal right to education. The Deputy spoke about the evidence and the lack of evidence. Let us face it, the committee was working on anecdotal evidence but the Department was working on anecdotal evidence as well. The idea of this exercise and of these guidelines, is to find out the scale and the nature of the issue we are dealing with here.That will determine where resources will flow thereafter and how practice will be shaped. The Deputy mentioned behavioural issues and there are medical and mental health issues. As I stated previously, the position of the Department is that all pupils who are enrolled in a school should attend school for the full day unless exempted from so doing for exceptional circumstances, such as medical reasons, and that reduced timetables should not be used as a de facto suspension or as a behavioural management technique. That is what was happening, it was being used as an intervention in such cases. That is still very much the case and my position has not changed. There will be a process and guidelines. The principal will inform Tusla and if reduced timetables must be used, there must be a reason, as well as an outline process and continuum explaining that this part of the reintegration. We are going to be very clear and transparent around that. The Deputy also mentioned issues regarding when a special school in Dublin 15 will open. As far as I am aware, the training for the entire team has been completed and consequently we now are in a position to start. I will inform the Deputy as soon as I have that information readily available but we are on the cusp in that if it does not happen next week, it will be the following week. One demand from the parents was very clear. As they want it done in a phased process, that is something we are adhering to as well. The Deputy also made a point about resources and training. As there is no point in having a guideline on reduced timetables if we do not put adequate resources, training and support into schools, that will come hand in glove. Deputy Catherine Martin referred to scepticism. When one embarks on anything new that has been basically left out and where there has been a gaping hole, it is a case of figuring it out and doing so properly. That is why the consultation with the key stakeholders will be so important. I mention in particular the parents' council. Members spoke about empowering parents. Their voice will be really important in that consultation. The Deputy asked what will happen when the parent says "No". That parent will be empowered, will have a right to say "No" to a proposed reduced timetable and will have the right to state this is still a de facto suspension. If parents are not satisfied, there is a process to deal with this by appealing directly to the Department through section 29 of the Education Act. We must be very clear and continue to empower the parent in that regard. In terms of the consultation with NEPS, the guidelines are underpinned by the principles that a reduced timetable or reduced day should never be used as a sanction, offered as an alternative to a sanction or used as a behavioural management tool. It should be applied proportionately and should last only as long as is necessary to facilitate a return to school on a full-time basis. The guidelines should be read in conjunction with relevant guidelines from Tusla, including developing a code of behaviour, guidelines for schools and a statement of strategy for school attendance. Other resources include information on NEPS and support from the Department. It is important that lines of communication are always open. We are all trying to achieve the aims set out in the school inclusion pilot, whereby we have the HSE and the Departments of Education and Skills, Children and Youth Affairs Health working hand in glove together. That is why we will be informed by the school inclusion pilot.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, it would be treated as a suspension.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, they have a right of appeal.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, it is being used as a sanction.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is what we are trying to do in this regard. We are trying to ensure that the information we have includes the scale and extent of the issue and to find out if there are resource deficiencies or a weakness within the school system. We are not informed at the moment because we have only anecdotal evidence. What we are trying to do is to ensure we get the process right first. That is why the guidelines will be so important, as will be the consultation with the educational partners and members' continued observations, in ensuring that the parent and the young person will know what the transparent process is. We are not starting from scratch or a blank page but we have a very complex issue where parents and students naturally feel aggrieved on the one hand and we have issues in schools on the other hand, where members of boards of management, principals and teachers will state they do not have adequate resources to work through the situation. It is about informing ourselves of the scale and extent of the issue. That is the reason I do not want to see this used as a behavioural mechanism. I acknowledge it is being used as a tool for dealing with behavioural issues and as a sanction at present and I want to move away from that. Deputy Catherine Martin also asked about the higher limit on the use of reduced timetables. While six weeks is a long time, a plan must be put together. Senator Gavan referred to one hour a day. It is not acceptable that one could have one hour per day over a period of six weeks. There must be a progression. It could be one hour a day on the first day and then there must be a progression towards reintegration within that period. Six weeks is the one that has been suggested for the consultation. The feedback varies on whether that period is appropriate. We are open to receiving feedback on it. There is no reference to gender but there is a reference to ethnicity.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, my personal opinion is that a young person is a young person whether they he or she is male or female. This is about equal treatment for each individual.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is something to consider for inclusion. The Deputy also referred to the need for more consultation and suggested an annual report. The data we receive will be important in informing the Department as to where resources are needed and where they should be directed. She also raised the issue of capacity, which is something of which I am very conscious. We must ensure there is sufficient capacity and support under the new model for schools. I have already covered the Deputy's point on the need for the complaints structure to be transparent.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Ó Laoghaire spoke about anecdotal evidence, which I have covered. The Department is working on anecdotal evidence on this particular issue. I accept and agree with many of the recommendations in the guidelines, most of which came from the report. The Deputy referred to regulations versus guidelines. No matter what issue one is dealing with, it is usually, in the first instance, covered in guidelines and circulars that are given to schools. Once we have a system in place whereby Tusla is informed when a reduced timetable is being introduced, that information will be recorded and will form part of the data. On the scale and nature of resources, the Deputy referred to reintegration, process and flexibility and there being no excuses as to how things were done in the past. I agree there is no excuse for allowing a situation to emerge where a child is being disadvantaged in his or her constitutional right to an education. That is an issue which we are all working to resolve. There is no specific sanction where a school is not complying in this regard but I intend to ensure we are informed as to the scale and extent of the resourcing need.If extra resources are needed in these areas, we will certainly do that. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan observed that 27% of education and welfare officers were aware of schools using reduced timetables and highlighted an information deficit in that regard. She said a more robust collection of data was required. The Deputy spoke about parents' consent and an equal power relationship but I also talked about the voice of the child. She mentioned different groups having a different story, the importance of getting this right and the role of the inspectorate. The Deputy will be aware that the specific role of the inspectorate in the Department of Education and Skills is to examine the quality of learning and teaching. The inspectorate will continue, in the context of the work, to evaluate the effectiveness of schools' implementation of specific interventions and initiatives and to provide up-to-date information to the system. On the timeframe, the consultation period ends on 18 October. Senator Gavan made a reference to one hour per day, which is unacceptable, and not having a plan as to how to reintegrate that student back into education. Data collection is key, and that is a gaping hole. We do not have those data and if the practice was and is being used as a behavioural tool, that is not acceptable. I referenced the social inclusion pilot because the Senator also mentioned autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes, the difference between primary and post-primary and where the investment is going. We have 4,000 schools. Currently, we have upwards of 1,500 special classes. Some schools are providing up to four classes. Others are providing one class. If we do a quick mathematical summary of that, less than 25% of schools have special classes. It is an enormous challenge to try to get that right. As the Chairman pointed out, we are investing a great deal of resources - one out of every five euro - in special education but we still have a long way to go. Parents today are having difficulties accessing special classes in preschool and primary school and at post-primary level. That is a major challenge that we want to meet head-on. The Department of Health has a budget of €17 billion and the Department I preside over has a budget of nearly €11 billion. I see enormous potential for much greater collaboration between the two Departments.  Mention was made of behavioural issues. The school inclusion pilot will look at speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, the potential for physiotherapy, even though it is not in the pilot, but also to have a behavioural therapist in the school. We are trying to get from where we are now to a place where there is much more joined-up thinking and integration at an interdepartmental level and between State agencies.  Senator Ruane's contribution on empowering parents was very interesting. She referenced Tallaght, although she did not want to highlight any school in particular. I have fond memories of Tallaght, having done my teaching practice in St. Mark's school, in Springfield. The present-day classrooms are in a different country to the classroom I was in back in 1993 . I went in as a student teacher, stuck to the subject area and got on with it. It was a different scenario to the classrooms I go into in either primary or secondary schools. There is much more complexity. If something is needed in terms of empowering parents in their decision-making as to what is best for their sons or daughters, we will have to be open to that. The Senator referenced medical situations. Perhaps there could be a reduced timetable for a particular day. We have to be open to all the new ways of thinking in terms of how we deal with complex issues. I refer to the notion of having some sort of support for parents to help them make the decision. I am reminded of when I was a youth worker in Letterkenny. When parents would approach me informally about something that was happening in primary school, they were looking for my advice and advocacy. It may not have been right all the time but they were reaching out and had a level of trust. That goes back to all the different informal places, whether it is community groups, youth groups or whatever. The Senator may have hit on something that I have experienced in terms of helping parents make that decision. I would like to explore that further.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I think I am required to deal with a Topical Issue matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was very obedient and switched my phone off. The Chairman asked me to do that.
