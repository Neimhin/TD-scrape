JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The House is almost 12 months into the debate on adoption, although it has been ongoing for many of the families involved.  Almost a year has passed since e-mails started to come into our offices, yet many families are still in limbo and in the dark in terms of marking out a way forward.The tone of many of the e-mails sent in the past year was angry, but politicians could sense in the electronic correspondence the degree of expectation and hope felt by those families.  Many people had planned on having their children before Christmas.  However, hopes have been dashed and expectations have not been realised.  It is important that we work on this legislation with a mixture of empathy and forthrightness.  We can try to do something about this situation.Post-adoption sensitivities must be factored into the matter.  I am also aware of the sensitivities surrounding child welfare and safety, as my colleague, Deputy Clune, pointed out.  The central thrust of the Hague convention is to put the best interests of the child to the forefront.  No parent in Ireland does not accept this philosophy, but many of the people in this position are bothered by the facts that they cannot see whether the office has any vision and that they do not know to which countries they can go.The Bill must make allowances for couples currently involved in the adoption process.  Many couples have been waiting for four, five or six years.  They do not know how the adoption legislation will impact on them.  Will they be allowed to go to non-Hague convention countries?  For example, many of the countries that have signed up to it allow people to adopt from countries outside it.  Putting this fact on the record is important.  On enactment, where will the families currently in the adoption process that have received referrals stand?  This question has been asked by many families involved in the process.We need to quantify how many parents are involved in the adoption process or are seeking to enter it.  In terms of the bilateral agreement with Vietnam, we were given figures of approximately 250 or 280 families, bordering around the 300 figure.  The total figure is a conundrum.  We need to engage with them.  Granted, they do not necessarily believe that they have been paid lip-service.  In fairness to the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, he has taken on board many concerns.  However, there has been lip-service in terms of mapping a way forward.  Leaving aside all of the emotive words that politicians can sometimes engage in, the people in question are looking for the way forward to be mapped.When the Adoption Bill goes through, will families be allowed to work with non-Hague convention countries?  Will they be able to engage with the UK, the USA, Spain and France?  These are the types of question that they need answered and, as Deputy Clune pointed out, need to be answered quickly.  Many people are reaching the maximum age threshold and, in one, two or three years' time, will be restricted from adopting.  This is a sensitive issue.I am conscious of Deputy Reilly's entrance.  How is the Acting Chairman doing the mathematics?

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Bill's transitional measures must allow sole applicants and couples to continue in the process.  What will happen to couples who are four, five or six years into the process and do not receive referrals before the Bill's enactment?  This is another question that has been highlighted by many prospective parents.  I have been in contact with a considerable number of them in my constituency and county.  Could they be allowed a better mechanism of engagement?  They do not feel involved in the discourse.  Rather, they feel as if they are out on a limb.  They have good suggestions, since many of them have gone through the post-adoptive previously.  They also have considerable experience that people in the Department of the Ministers of State, Deputies Haughey and Barry Andrews, could use to their benefit.  This matter must be considered.I have suggested that the other Hague convention signatories be considered, including the UK, the USA, Spain and France.  The convention states that international adoption should be in the best interests of the child and does not prohibit member states from dealing with non-member states.  When passing the legislation, we should take this idea on board and not restrict ourselves to negotiating with non-convention countries only.Having raised this issue a number of times, we on this side of the House have been cognisant of the surrounding sensitivities and have not turned it into a political football.  Approximately one month ago on my local radio station, I was told by a mother of a woman going through the adoption process that she did not want to have it turned into a political football.  It has not been, but we need to show a resolve in terms of mapping a way forward for prospective parents.  We also need to appreciate that someone going through an adoption process is equal to someone who is going through the biological process of bringing a child into the world.  This is the key issue.  I know of someone who went through the adoption process and had all of the preliminary work carried out but, at the 11th hour, the Russian child was taken from her grasp.  She mourned the child in the same way as if she had had him or her herself.  We must be sensitive and comprehensive in terms of how we allow the Adoption Bill to fit into the Hague agreement.
