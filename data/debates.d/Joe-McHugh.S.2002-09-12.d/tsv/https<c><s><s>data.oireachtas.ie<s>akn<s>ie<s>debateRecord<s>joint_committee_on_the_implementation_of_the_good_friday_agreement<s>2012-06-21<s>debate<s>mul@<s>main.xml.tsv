JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the proposer and seconder and look forward to working with members of this committee.  I commend Deputy Joanna Tuffy and wish her well in her new role on the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection.  I thank her for her work on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  She certainly did things differently and brought meetings into Northern Ireland, something on which she must be commended.  I know her predecessor, Deputy Dominic Hannigan, worked at that as well.  I am open to whatever suggestions the committee has on how and where we hold meetings.  Deputy Joanna Tuffy has set a good precedent.  I also welcome Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick who replaces Deputy Alan Farrell.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Ms Margaret Ritchie, MLA, Deputy Joe O'Reilly and Lady Sylvia Hermon, MP.  Rather than reading out the lengthy instructions on mobile telephones, I will ask those present to switch off their mobile telephones as they interfere with the sound system.  The minutes of the previous meeting had been circulated.  Are there any matters arising?  No.  As there are no matters arising, the minutes are agreed.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The next business is a discussion with members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Business Trust.  I welcome the delegation from the trust which is led by Mr. Leslie Cree, MLA, and Mr. Glyn Roberts and includes a number of familiar faces.  The group has been here for 48 hours and is having a productive time, both from a political and business networking point of view.  I presume there has also been a social aspect to the visit, which can be more productive from a political and business point of view than formal engagements.  Our guests appeared before the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and held a number of other meetings yesterday.Before inviting Mr. Cree to commence proceedings, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Cree to make his opening presentation.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I open up the debate to members for questions.
