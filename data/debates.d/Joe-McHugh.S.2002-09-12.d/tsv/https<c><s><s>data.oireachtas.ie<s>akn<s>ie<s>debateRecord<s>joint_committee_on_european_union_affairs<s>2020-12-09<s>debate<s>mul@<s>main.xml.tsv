JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Harkin. We are looking forward to this morning's engagement on what is a live and relevant topic. Yesterday was a significant and historic day in Anglo-Irish relations and vaccinations and was a cause for celebration on both sides of the pond. Well done to everyone involved. The matter the committee will discuss today is the future relationship between the EU and the UK. We were encouraged by positive news yesterday about the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill. While committee members may still have a few questions about the Bill, the situation has moved on in some regards. It is a busy time for the House of Commons and I thank our guests for taking the time to engage with us. Before we begin, the witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I wish to advise those witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regimes. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. We have decided in advance that there will not be opening statements. Mr. Benn might give us a brief introduction to his team before we start firing a few questions across the way.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Benn.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses. That was a good opportunity for them to set out their stalls and we are grateful for the overview. If it is agreeable to Mr. Benn, I might take one committee member and Mr. Benn might nominate one of his colleagues to respond. I want to get every committee member in, but we only have half an hour or so left. I call Deputy Calleary, followed by Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Calleary nominated two of the witnesses, so I might invite Deputy Howlin to speak now so that he might ask questions of another of the witnesses. This will work. I am confident and optimistic.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses for their overview, insights and answers. The next two contributors are Deputy Seán Haughey and Senator Lisa Chambers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses. With the agreement of the committee, I propose that we extend the public session to include a final question from Deputy Ó Murchú. If it is acceptable, we will then go straight into private session.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank all our guests for their insight and analysis. It is good to have a fisheries expert, in Dr. Whitford, as part of the team. It was always going to be a complex issue and it will be difficult in the hours to come. We are very grateful. If there is anything we can do on this side to advocate for the evolution of our colleagues' committee into a different form, with their continued involvement, we will do our bit. We have found some common ground, including on the Beatles. We know how serious this matter is and that it is about the bread-and-butter conversations that are happening in coffee shops, whether in Newcastle, County Down, Letterkenny, Cork or Kerry. We live on an island here. We need the flow of goods. There are fears around the timelines for distribution of goods, which is something that people are very conscious of, but with a willingness and desire to come to an understanding, the next day or two are really important.Our guests' committee has been advocating strongly for a future relationship. We have the cornerstone - Mr. Kinnock advocated for the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which has institutional ties. It seems to have been around for a long time. It evolved from the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body but has only existed since 1990. There have been a number of significant interventions on an east-west basis, including Queen Elizabeth's visit in 2011 and President Higgins's first state visit in 2014. Major foundations have been laid down in the relationship. No matter what happens, the main thing we must do is keep that relationship strong. Our committee would like to continue working on a parliament-to-parliament basis, albeit not necessarily on just a Dublin-London basis. We can do it on a regional basis as well and keep looking at new ways of working together. Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe as ucht a theacht go dtí Teach Laighin inniu. I thank the witnesses for coming to Leinster House, albeit in virtual form. We will see one another again in 2021. Before we conclude, I propose that we go into private session to continue our engagement.
