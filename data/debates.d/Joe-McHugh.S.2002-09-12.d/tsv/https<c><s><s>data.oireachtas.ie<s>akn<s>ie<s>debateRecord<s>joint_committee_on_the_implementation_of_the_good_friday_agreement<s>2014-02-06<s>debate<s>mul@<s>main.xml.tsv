JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome from the Department of Health Ms Bairbre Nic Aongusa, assistant secretary; Mr. Paul Barron, assistant secretary; Ms Audrey Hagerty, principal officer; Mr. Charlie Hardy, principal officer; Mr. Tom Monks, assistant principal officer; Ms Louise Kenny, assistant principal officer; Mr. Keith Comiskey, assistant principal officer; and Ms Helen O'Brien, higher executive officer. I look forward to our discourse on the development of North-South co-operation in the health care sector, which affects many people and how the EU director on patient mobility will impact on how patients access services in the future. I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. The committee would like to explore new opportunities and would like the meeting to be as engaging as possible. We are not here to scrutinise ongoing work. We are interested in what opportunities exist in proper North-South health care provision, which are practical, pragmatic and sensible and which follow common-sense protocols. I call Ms Nic Aongusa to make her presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	With the agreement of members, we will take the next presentation before taking questions. Is that agreed? Agreed. I call Mr. Barron.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Barron. The directive has not yet been transposed into Irish law. Will Mr. Barron give us a timeframe on when this will happen?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	To give a practical example, if Deputy Seán Conlan needed his hip replaced he could telephone a private hospital, and not just a public hospital, in Stuttgart, have the operation there, pay for it himself and be reimbursed for the amount it would have cost to have had it done in Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	After putting Deputy Conlan on the spot I call on him to speak.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. I call Dr. Alasdair McDonnell and he shall be followed by Deputy Seán Crowe.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes, Dr. McDonnell did and he said he was going to be brief.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	With regard to Donegal, I will not defend the indefensible and I do not do Donegal sensitivity but I came across a statistic yesterday that there are 5,000 frontier workers in the north west. There is quite a lot of mobile occupation and we are nomadic people in Donegal.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. McDonnell was using Donegal as an example and there are other counties as well.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Members went over time because this is such an important issue. It is also an emotive issue but there are practical solutions to hand. We want to help and we want to contribute. I will give the witnesses an opportunity to respond but before doing so, I wish to acknowledge the fact that 2016 is the target for the opening of the radiotherapy centre in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which will cater for a catchment area population of 500,000. That is very welcome. I wish to pick up on a point made by Deputy Feighan and others about paramedic and ambulance cover. I do not know what the situation is in County Louth but I am aware there is good co-operation between Altnagelvin Area Hospital and Letterkenny General Hospital. I am not sure that the public is aware of that, however, so we have a job to do in terms of letting people know the true situation.  I am not seeking a comment on the tragic case of Ms Porter who died at the side of the road in Carndonagh, having waited for 50 minutes for an ambulance, because that is currently the subject of a HIQA inquiry. I welcome the fact that such an inquiry is taking place. A few miles down the road from that incident, however, there were ambulances at Altnagelvin. There were also ambulances outside Letterkenny General Hospital but Ms Porter's family could not get an ambulance for their mother, who was dying at the side of the road. On top of that, the helicopter service was en route from Malin Head to Sligo at that time. There are opportunities for joined-up thinking.  The Minister for Health is on record speaking about the potential for Enniskillen, Sligo, Altnagelvin and Letterkenny to co-operate in the context of air ambulance and paramedic services. I invite the witnesses to comment on that. What is the current standing of the proposal in the Department? Sometimes we as politicians talk about cross-Border co-operation as if it is a simple matter. At a political level, the Health Minister, Mr. Edmund Poots MLA, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, are working together and agreeing solutions but sometimes the implementation proves difficult. Perhaps the witness could elaborate on the difficulties they are encountering. Are there turf wars or cultural barriers? Is it the case that people have a difficulty with doing something new? Is it down to the human condition? Are we creatures of habit, used to doing things in a certain way? The witnesses are responsible for the Twenty-six Counties.What are the difficulties and what are the barriers to the common-sense practical solutions we naive politicians think should happen in the morning? This may be something we need to find out. I thank the members for their contributions and leave the last analysis and feedback to our guests.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious that we have another presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In fairness, there is a conflict of interests.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Of all the joint ministerial representations North and South, the most high profile public advocates of pragmatic cross-Border co-operation are the Health Minister, Edwin Poots, MLA, and the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious of the time. I call Mr. Barron.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Barron and I am conscious that Ms Gildernew wishes to make a brief contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegation who have shown commitment to cross-Border co-operation. While one can get caught up in issues concerning quality, quantity and so on, the wide range of people who are present in today's delegation is a sign to members that the Department is committed to the process. A range of issues exist, such as the provision of paediatric cardiology in Belfast and Dublin, and loads more questions remain. However, it is good to have a point of contact, even today. Can the joint committee liaise with Ms Nic Aongusa if issues arise? Is it okay for the joint committee to use her as a point of contact in respect of health issues?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Senator Moran wish to make a suggestion?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes, the Senator should revert to the witnesses in respect of any specific questions that were not answered.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will now meet the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors, Ms Kathryn Stone OBE. It is not the first time the committee has met Ms Stone. Some of us met informally last May. We welcome her back and appreciate her being here. We are looking forward to her informing us about the work of the commission in promoting the interests of victims and survivors. I also welcome Mr. John Beggs, secretary to the commission, who is accompanying the commissioner today. We look forward to hearing about their ongoing valuable work. Before I invite Ms Stone to make her presentation, I wish to advise that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances. However, if they are directed to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence. They are directed that only comments related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now call on Ms Stone to proceed with her presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Will Ms Stone indicate a date for the conference?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am sure members will have suggestions and feedback on the Haass discussions. We held a session to consider the disappointing outcome of the discussions and members will reflect our reaction as a committee.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will give Ms Stone and Mr. Beggs the final word. On the definition of "victim", I will cite as an example somebody not from Northern Ireland but who was intimidated outside it. This person was threatened back in the 1970s, told not to go back to Northern Ireland and has still not returned. There were no physical consequences or bereavement, but the family has had this hanging over them for the best part of 40 years and probably longer. Is there a conversation happening about how to deal with the silent victims of the conflict who do not fall into any particular category? There was no single event. Ms Margaret Irwin is present.Justice for the Forgotten lists a figure of 160 victims outside of Northern Ireland, if I am citing the contributions correctly. Do these silent victims who suffered severe intimidation and threats fall into that category?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We appreciate the attendance by Ms Stone and Mr. Beggs. Does the commission's remit cover someone who is a victim of the Troubles as a result of something that happened in the Six Counties but who is now domiciled outside them? If not, what advice would our guests give us for putting the individual in touch with other services? Is there a pathway for someone outside Northern Ireland?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In practical terms, if we have details of individuals domiciled outside the Six Counties, can we pass them on to the commission?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank our guests. We will adjourn until Wednesday, 26 February, when we will meet the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.
