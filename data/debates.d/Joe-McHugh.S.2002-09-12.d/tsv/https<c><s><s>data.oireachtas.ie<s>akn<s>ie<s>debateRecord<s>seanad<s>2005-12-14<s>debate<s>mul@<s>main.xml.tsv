JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain, has made a significant announcement of funding to build a motorway to Derry city, bypassing Dungiven.It is an ambitious plan and is to be welcomed from a northern and north-western perspective. He stepped outside the box and acknowledged there needs to be a transport link from Derry to Letterkenny, bringing more advanced communication and greater co-operation from the Administration in this State.The Government must now meet with the Northern Administration on a significant scale because a dual carriageway from Letterkenny to Derry will mean a journey of one hour from Letterkenny to Belfast and will result in economic, social and tourism development, which are key to the prospects of the north west. I know I sound parochial. Senator Norris reproached himself for talking about Iraq all the time and I know I talk about the north west all the time but I see potential and opportunity, as has the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
