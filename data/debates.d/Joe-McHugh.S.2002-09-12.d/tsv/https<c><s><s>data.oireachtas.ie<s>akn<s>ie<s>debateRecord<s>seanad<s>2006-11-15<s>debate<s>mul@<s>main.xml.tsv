JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Since I tabled this matter last week there has been a considerable change in terms of the Labour Court outcome to the case in question.  Prior to that, the Irish Nurses Organisation and the Psychiatric Nurses Association hoped for a more positive outcome in terms of their core demand to reduce the working week from 39 hours to 35 hours.  The INO and the PNA will get together to try to formulate a strategic approach to getting their just entitlements and rights within the public service.From working closely with local authorities and other State agencies, the Minister of State knows that only one arm of the public service works a 39-hour week, namely, nurses.  This is a discriminatory practice and it would be wrong to revert the matter to be dealt with by benchmarking.  The Labour Court was in a position to deal with it, but did not do so.  For the Health Service Executive to kick the matter back to touch is the wrong way to go about this business.  In the early 1990s, benchmarking did not work in respect of this issue, anomalies in pay conditions for nursing staff or anomalies in working hours.  I ask the Minister of State to have a serious consultation with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on this matter because the anger within the two organisations is growing.  That anger is justified because of the way they have been treated, but it can be dealt with if we intervene at this stage.  If we kick it to touch and leave benchmarking to deal with the issue, it will not be dealt with.  We procrastinated before and that will happen again.The Minister of State knows from his constituency that most nurses and nursing staff are female and work in arduous conditions with long and anti-social hours which put them under great stress.  There are also males in the sector but the majority are female and it is discriminatory and sexist.  The Government should not take its eye off the ball because their anger is building.  The decision was made last Friday and now it is Wednesday.  There is a meeting next week and I advise the Government to heed the demands of the Psychiatric Nurses Association and the Irish Nurses Organisation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Can the Government not train more nurses?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I only suggest it for that part of the public service.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Would it be money well spent?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am struck by the emotive nature of the Minister of State's response.  This is not a like-for-like demand.  I am talking about a woman or a man who has worked in the nursing profession for perhaps 25 or 30 years.  One cannot compare somebody with the skills and expertise of a nurse with a junior doctor just starting his or her career, who may also have to work 39 hours per week.  Looking at different levels is a dangerous road to go down.  The Minister of State knows, as he stated at the end of his response, the value of the contributions nurses make.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Minister to intervene.  He should not use emotive language to suggest what nurses should do.  He should become involved before it escalates because the nurses will ballot and may do so in a way not to the Government's liking.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It did not work in the 1990s.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not suggest it accept all the claims.  The Government should talk to the unions and listen to them.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not here to make a political issue of it.  I am speaking on behalf of the nurses.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Equal rights.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What equal rights?  They work more hours than the average public servant.
