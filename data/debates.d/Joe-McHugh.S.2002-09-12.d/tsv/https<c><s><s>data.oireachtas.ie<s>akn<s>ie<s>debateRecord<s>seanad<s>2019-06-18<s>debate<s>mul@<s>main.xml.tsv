JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir fá choinne an cheist. Bhí an ceart aige faoin Aire atá freagrach as an cheist seo. Tá sé as láthair ag an bhomaite. Tá brón orm fadúda sin ach má eíríonn aon cheist as an fhreagra seo, beidh mé sásta teagmháil a dhéanamh le mo chomhghleacaí chun aon bhearna a líonadh nó sonraí a fháil. In 2011, public officeholders became liable to pay class K PRSI of 4% on their officeholder income. Payment of the class K PRSI charge does not establish any social insurance entitlements. Prior to 2011, this income was exempt from PRSI and then, as now, social insurance entitlements were established and protected based on their non-officeholder activities or by paying voluntary contributions. This class K charge was introduced for public officeholders because, unlike employees and the self-employed, they did not pay a 4% contribution on this income. With the abolition of the PRSI earnings ceiling for employees in 2011 and the introduction of the 3% universal social charge on self-employed earnings over €100,000, also in 2011, this meant that public officeholders had a lower marginal rate of income tax, universal social charge and PRSI when compared with other workers. As a measure of solidarity with those workers, the Oireachtas voted to apply the 4% class K contribution to public officeholders. Public officeholders are now not the only group paying class K contributions. Since 2013, modified rate contributors, including civil and public servants recruited prior to 1995, who also have earned and unearned income from self-employment pay class K PRSI on this previously exempt income. In 2014, class K was applied to the previously exempt income of employees and occupational pensioners under 66 years where they have unearned income only. These class K charges yield nearly €40 million per annum for the Social Insurance Fund from over 88,000 contributors.This would have a significant impact on the future health of the Social Insurance Fund.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In terms of the education component on a general level, participating in this debate has been an education in and of itself. If there are any specific education related matters, I am more than happy to facilitate a communication plan in that regard. The next budget is scheduled for 8 October. There will be a lot of deliberations and conversations on where we are going in regard to that budget. The approach to that budget will be in keeping with the challenging times ahead in terms of heightened expectations, lower growth rates and Brexit. In the context of the specific issue raised by Senator Craughwell on class K PRSI, I am sure conversations will be happening within the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection in advance of the budget.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir fá choinne an cheist seo, ceist atá iontach tábhachtach do scoileanna speisialta timpeall na tíre. Tugaim aitheantas do na daoine uilig atá ag obair iontu - na múinteoirí agus na daoine eile - fá choinne an cheannaireacht a léiríonn siad sna scoileanna atá i gceist. Tá míbhuntáistí ann maidir le hárachas. Táim cinnte go bhfuil obair de dhíth ach tá dul chun cinn déanta go dtí seo freisin. Tá sonraí agam anseo. I thank the Senator for raising this matter. My Department is aware of issues relating to significant increases in insurance costs in some special schools. St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe was the first to raise this issue through my colleagues in the Oireachtas.I want to acknowledge my colleagues for bringing that to my attention. The issue the Senator is raising relates to Saplings special school in Carlow. We have made progress over the last period in discussions with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education. The increased insurance costs of special schools appear to be due to annual increases in insurance costs generally and, in some cases, increases in claims. The Department of Education and Skills is working as a matter of urgency with relevant Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and with the State Claims Agency to seek a resolution to the issue of increased insurance costs in special schools. A number of options have been identified to address the issue. These include the development of a group insurance scheme for special schools. The National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education is engaging with its member boards of management in this regard. A meeting of the boards and patrons took place on 6 June to discuss the matter and the options available. This meeting was attended by an official from the Department. The group scheme proposal appears to be the most viable option at this stage. The importance of all schools signing up for such a scheme was emphasised at the recent meeting. All school representatives who were in attendance were in favour of exploring the group scheme option. Although the Department of Education and Skills has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to a small number of schools that recently experienced difficulty in paying insurance premiums, it is not sustainable for the Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums. I know this is a cause of concern for schools as well. Officials from the Department have been in contact with Saplings special school in Carlow on this matter. Representatives of the school have been briefed on the situation. I hope a speedy and cost-effective resolution can be secured for impacted special schools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator never misses an opportunity.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for not being present at last week's debate. I had another engagement.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am working closely with the special schools on this important issue. Approximately €1.9 billion, or almost 20% of the education budget of €11 billion, is spent on special education. There are things we get right, things we miss and things we get wrong. Much of what we do is focused on collaboration. I believe the idea of schools working together as part of a single entity represents the way forward. The first time this matter was raised with me, I learned that an insurance company had asked St. Teresa's special school to pay its annual premium with a single cheque. This approach can cause a difficulty for schools. I do not want to see schools looking for the capitation grant to increase for this specific purpose. I believe that if we can get the schools working together and get the premiums into a reasonable sort of place, it will be seen that the collaborative approach represents the way forward. Ba mhaith liom arís mo bhuíochas agus m'aitheantas a thabhairt do na daoine uilig a bhíonn ag obair sna scoileanna speisialta. Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go bhfuil córas sa Teach seo a thugann deiseanna dúinn bealaí a aimsiú chun bogadh ar aghaidh. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir arís fá choinne seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar seo.
