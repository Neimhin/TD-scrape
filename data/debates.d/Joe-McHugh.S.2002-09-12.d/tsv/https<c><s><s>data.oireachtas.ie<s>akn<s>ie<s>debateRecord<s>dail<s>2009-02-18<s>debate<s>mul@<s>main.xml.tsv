JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Taoiseach's emphasis on labour intensive infrastructural projects.  School buildings were mentioned as a possibility.  To what specific projects does the Taoiseach refer?  Does he consider rail development labour intensive infrastructural development?  If he does, will the Government include rail as a possibility to be rolled out under a new national development plan?In regard to the north west gateway, there are question marks as to whether Project Kelvin is going ahead in terms of location rather than funding.  There are issues around that.  I know the Taoiseach will suggest I table a parliamentary question on the matter but I would like his office to examine the issue because it is a project that affects both sides of the Border.  I ask the Taoiseach to examine that project because of the question marks hanging over it.Other than school buildings, what specific labour intensive infrastructural projects are envisaged and does the Taoiseach consider rail development to be part of that?
