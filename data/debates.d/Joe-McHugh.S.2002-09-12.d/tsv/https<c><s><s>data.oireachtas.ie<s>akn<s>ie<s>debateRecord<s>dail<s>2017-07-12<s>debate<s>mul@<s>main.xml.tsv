JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	It is proposed, notwithstanding the Order of the Dáil of 11 July, that the proceedings on No. b10, motion re defence – proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the deployment of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force to serve as part of EUNAVFOR MED, Operation Sophia – be brought to a conclusion after 80 minutes, if not previously concluded, be confined to a single round of speeches by a Minister or Minister of State and the spokespersons for the parties and groups, or a Member nominated in their stead, and all Members may share time.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Yesterday Deputies raised an issue about the time. The Taoiseach offered to give extra time and we agreed to that under the Standing Order this morning. Obviously, the Deputy has raised an issue we can reflect on.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	However, we have a very heavy schedule. We have moved many items of legislation around. We are tight for time up to Friday. However, the House has agreed at least to debate it. That was agreed yesterday and was agreed here today again.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It will be in the voting bloc tomorrow anyway. The time for the debate has been allocated today. We moved a lot of other legislation around. It was agreed this morning to take the extra time. The Taoiseach offered the extra time yesterday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There will be possibilities during the voting bloc tomorrow if that is agreed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy might as well do the Taoiseach's job.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am trying to be helpful. Luaigh mé pointe amháin. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, níl mé ag cur isteach. Ba phointe amháin é.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a pointe amháin, a fair point.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I did.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat. Ní raibh mé ag iarraidh teacht isteach ach déarfaidh mé cúpla focal. Tá mise istigh sa Roinn cultúir, oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta. Tá mo ról i leith an teanga agus mo ról i leith na Gaeltachta fite fuaite. Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, tá Údarás na Gaeltachta freagrach as pleanáil teanga. Ní raibh an Teachta ag úsáid an focal "teanga" anocht. Tá muidne sa Rialtas, agus an Taoiseach, Teachta Varadkar, go háirithe, ag spreagadh an teanga. Táimse timpeall an bhord Rialtais. Táimse freagrach as an teanga agus as an nGaeltacht. Tá nasc agus ceangal idir ár gcultúr, ár n-oidhreacht agus an teanga. Is é sin an fáth ar cheap an Taoiseach mise. Sin mo phointe, ach dá mbeadh an Teachta ag iarraidh freagra maidir le ról an Taoisigh i leith cinntí maidir le cibé a bheas freagrach as na Ranna éagsúla ábhartha, sin scéal difriúil.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Aontaím.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I wish to check which amendment we are discussing. I am lost.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Which amendment is the Deputy talking about?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, he is discussing procedure.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	An bhfuil an Teachta Ó Cuív ag plé nó an bhfuil sibhse ag plé-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Cén leasú a bhí sé ag labhairt faoi?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	But-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá tú ag magadh.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá sé sin okay.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tuigim. Tá brón orm.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Dochreidte.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	That will be organised if the debate stops at 11 p.m. However, it may not resume tomorrow. It may be resumed on Friday. We will have to figure it out.
