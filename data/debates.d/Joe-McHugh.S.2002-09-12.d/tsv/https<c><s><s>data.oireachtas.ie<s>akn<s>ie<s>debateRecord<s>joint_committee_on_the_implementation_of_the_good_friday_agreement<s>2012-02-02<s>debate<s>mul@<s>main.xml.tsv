JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Chairman and acknowledge the good work done by Deputy Hannigan, the Chairman's predecessor.  He wanted to find out more about Northern Ireland and he visited the area.  I acknowledge the role he played.  I welcome Mr. Owen Paterson, MP.  It is great to have him here as this is important.  I acknowledge Mr. Julian King and wish him well in his new role.  I also note his hands-on efforts with the very successful visit of Queen Elizabeth II, as they were instrumental in the visit going well.  His able deputy ambassador, Mr. Andrew Staunton, has a keen knowledge of my county.I am conscious of the benefits of the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and the bank of good will that has been created following the visit.  I am a little concerned about the "Johnny come lately" school of politics, where politicians are playing catch-up on positive interrelationships on an east-west, North-South basis.  There has always been good will and friendliness on the ground, with people in England welcoming Irish people over there; that has never been an issue.  English people are also welcomed over here.  Business people interact on an east-west, North-South basis, and there will be an interconnector between the UK and Ireland in September.  There are businesses straddling North and South and business has been working on a North-South, east-west basis for decades.Politicians, as usual, have been "Johnny come lately" in trying to get their act together on a North-South, east-west basis.  In 1998, the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland signed up to the Good Friday Agreement calling for east-west and North-South interaction.  We are here today with no Unionist representation.  I was in London on Monday and there was no Sinn FÃ©in representation.  I know circumstances can lead to certain individuals not being present but there is an apparent reticence - indifference may be too strong a word - on the part of politicians and their total commitment to North-South, east-west parameters, which the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland bought into in 1998.How important is the North-South parliamentary forum structure that has still not happened if we are to develop positive interrelationships from a business and political perspective, North and South?  How important is the British-Irish Council, now based in Edinburgh, but which has still not been officially opened?  I know there has been progress on it.  Without getting into a discussion on the consultation of Scottish independence, I know Alex Salmond has overtly and publicly committed to that council construct in Edinburgh.  How important is the council on an east-west basis, which is tied into the democratic Good Friday or Belfast agreement?  How important is the North-South parliamentary forum, which is still not set up, to the North-South relationship on this island?
