JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I urge the Leader to seriously consider debating with a Minister the motion I tabled on rural development, community infrastructure-services and depopulation. It is on the Order Paper and she might recommend that it be dealt with during Private Members' time. My mandate comes from the county councillors who elected me. I am delighted to have been elected to this House but it was a tough and gruelling task. I have not yet contributed to the debate on Seanad reform.I would like the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to give me an updated position regarding funding towards the Letterkenny leisure centre.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share my time with Senator Cummins.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are a number of cross-Border institutions which I can discuss from a Donegal perspective. They include the peace and reconciliation fund, the international fund for Ireland and the INTERREG programme. All of them have done much good work in the last five years for which I congratulate them.The current situation has reached an impasse but, from my perspective, the glass is half full rather than half empty. As a Donegal man I never saw the Border in the first place because socially, economically and politically the two areas are interlinked. I sit on a political cross-Border group with members from Derry and Strabane local councils. People from the Bogside and Waterside in Derry and from Northern Ireland generally have bought land in Donegal. The area is a social melting pot. Economically, Donegal's greatest business comes from the North. Business in Letterkenny is thriving because of the spending power of people from Northern Ireland.The politicians who represent the people of Northern Ireland on both the Unionist and Nationalist sides must come clean. We have been working together but they are not conveying that message. We need honesty. I welcome this debate because people are being honest. Language is important. There has to be honesty in the messages being delivered by Unionists and Nationalists in their speeches. That also applies on this side of the Border. Until that happens there will not be peace in Northern Ireland.The kernel of the problem in Northern Ireland is sectarianism. When young people in County Donegal are asked to debate the Northern Ireland issue they read from Sinn Féin scripts. They still talk about 300 years ago and about getting Brits out of Northern Ireland. They continue to use this language but that is no longer reality. We are living in a working community, North and South, and we should demand honest language from both the Unionist and Nationalist representatives in Northern Ireland.I could talk all day about this issue but I have no more time.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and bring forward this matter in the light of a letter I received recently from the Letterkenny and District Trade Union Council which seeks to have the Redundancy Payments Act amended immediately to provide in cases of redundancy for a minimum of three weeks' pay per year of service without reference to age. The legislation currently provides for half a week's pay per year of service for those under 41 years of age and a full week's pay per year of service thereafter.I refer to this matter in the light of what has happened in County Donegal, but without wishing to pre-empt doomsday. We have lost many factory jobs in recent years, an example of which is the closure of Fruit of the Loom at Inishowen, Milford and Raphoe. Given the economic climate further redundancies may be imminent. The payments currently provided for are not acceptable and the people to whom I have spoken who have been made redundant agree that they are insufficient given present circumstances.I have already mentioned to the House the fact that the IDA still targets large factories for County Donegal. However, we do not have the infrastructure to accommodate them. There are no provisions to implement infrastructural improvements and no funding available for large-scale road projects or broadband connectivity. To take employment seriously in Donegal – the county with the highest rate of unemployment as all political parties attest – we must reconsider our approach. The IDA and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must seriously look at finding the best way forward to achieve job sustainability. It has been proven that large-scale factories do not work in County Donegal. I have already proposed that we examine the promotion of indigenous industry to harness and foster local job creation. If we do this, we will avoid having to speak constantly of redundancy payments and job losses, as is the case at the moment.Tonight in this Chamber I reiterate the demand of Letterkenny and District Trade Union Council for a change in the legislation because in the current economic climate its insufficient provisions constitute an embarrassment to those who have put in years of service. They are entitled to compensation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I welcome the work that has been done by the Redundancy Review Group and I hope agreement can be reach on pay increases.
