JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Pat Colgan and Mr. Shaun Henry to the meeting and thank them for all their good works and courtesy in respect of different groups seeking information and guidance.  A high point in respect of the witnesses is their accessibility.  I have visited their office in Belfast.  Their team is very accessible and helpful.I wish to ask three or four questions.  First, is the bottom-up approach.  A small community group from Na DÃºnaibh, an Irish language group, got in touch with me.  How can the PEACE programme facilitate small groups in terms of trying to access project money in the area of language-cultural tourism?  There is a barrier whereby the only vehicles available to drive it are the administrative and accounting expertise.  Obviously in dealing with large amounts of funding as in the case of the Special EU Programmes Body, there is a need to have checks in place.  If there are small community groups in Scotland, Belfast, Donegal, Cavan and Sligo, how can they be facilitated to come together?  Is there a mechanism in place to bring in an accountancy firm or some recognised body to drive their application per se?
My second question is on the escalation of the peace walls in Northern Ireland.  I appreciate this has been referred to in the context of funding.  Do the witnesses see an opportunity within its new round of funding to drive the whole interface funding applications given that in 1998 there were 17 peace walls but that number has escalated to 53?  Is there a facility to help different community groups at the interface level to drive that agenda?My third question refers to broadband and here I will be parochial.  Senator Keaveney mentioned Culdaff.  There are small pockets in Donegal that have been left out of that community project, in which the witnesses have been involved with Donegal County Council, including Churchill.  There are a few weak links.  Is it possible for the witnesses to contact their partners with a view to assessing the present situation?  Project Kelvin is great for the north west.  However, with extra funding there could be joined-up thinking in terms of providing broadband infrastructure into the Inishowen Peninsula and obviously this will attract the attention of Senator Keaveney.  It would not require much extra funding to bring the Project Kelvin link to Buncrana.  It goes through Manorcunningham and into Letterkenny but there is also an opportunity to bring it into the Inishowen Peninsula.  The Inishowen Peninsula is bigger than County Louth and has a population greater than that of County Leitrim.My final question is on real tourism.  At present we have a joint motion between the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and Scotland, Wales and all the relevant islands, Northern Ireland within Ireland, signed up to by all parties from all political persuasions to investigate the possibility of a cost-benefit analysis in respect of tourism.  Obviously we will look at the whole north-west linkage and all-island co-operation.  I am also cognisant of the Chairman and his contribution to that motion because today the first phase of the western rail corridor is opening.  There is a massive drive towards getting the second phase up and running and there will be a drive to have it extended to Sligo.  There is a great opportunity for an all-island rail link on our doorstep.  What is the best vehicle to drive it in terms of pursuing a funding application?  Does it have to be a joint local authority link up?  Does it have to be through the Parliaments, given that the motion has been passed and approved unanimously by the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly?  Given that Scotland comes under the umbrella of the new round of funding, is there an opportunity for the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish Government to drive an application?  Would that be the vehicle to drive an application for funding for a cost-benefit analysis?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	An anomaly has emerged in the past few weeks in regard to a cross-Border gun club.  Members from this side of the Border are not being issued with licences for guns in order to be part of this club.  It is a classic example of the sort of administrative challenges we need to overcome.  Is there a way we can try to move this forward?  The obvious way would be to invite the Chief Constable of the PSNI and the Garda Commissioner to the committee, which was done at the British-Irish Interparliamentary Assembly.  It is a major anomaly.Members of this gun club, which is located in the North, from County Donegal had licences up to the changes in the administrative process for getting gun licences.  Despite all the positives, possibilities, etc., which go with cross-Border activities, we need to address this anomaly.  With the Chairman's experience and advice, we may have an opportunity to drive this forward.
