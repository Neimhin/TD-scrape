JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Sheahan for raising this timely issue, especially in light of the publication of a new climate change Bill this month. If and when enacted, it will become the first climate change Bill this country has ever had. We are looking to 2020 and 2050, at our energy mix and our reliance on fossil fuels. It is important that we begin this conversation. The Government is acutely aware of the financial challenges faced by families and businesses from high electricity prices. However, it is important to note that the electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised and competitive and they operate within national and European regulatory regimes, supported by legislation. Responsibility for electricity and gas market regulation is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, which is an independent statutory body. The CER is focused on actions to mitigate costs for business and residential consumers, such as rigorous scrutiny of network costs, deeper integration with European energy markets and the delivery of a truly competitive market in the interest of customers. The commission continues to monitor the electricity and gas markets to ensure that competition continues to develop and that customers benefit from competition. The Department liaises with the CER on these matters on an ongoing basis. At a national level, electricity and gas prices are no longer regulated by the CER. The competitive energy market results in choice for consumers and businesses in terms of suppliers, products and prices, and this exerts downward pressure on prices. The reduction in wholesale gas prices since the beginning of 2014 has led to a reduction in the wholesale electricity price. It should be noted that wholesale electricity prices tend to reflect the price-setting fuel in the market, which is natural gas, not crude oil. It is worth noting that only 1% of electricity was generated from oil in 2012. Lower wholesale gas prices in 2014 compared to 2013 should have a knock-on impact on retail prices, and that is reflected in the latest EUROSTAT figures published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, on 9 December last. However, I should caution that wholesale gas prices have been rising since the summer of 2014 and this rise is likely ultimately to feed through to retail electricity and gas prices. The SEAI report shows that all business consumption bands in electricity and gas experienced reductions in average prices in the first half of 2014, ranging from 0.7% to 4% for electricity and 6.7% to 12.9% for gas. Similarly, in the first half of 2014, EUROSTAT figures show a reduction of 5.7% in the average price of gas in the residential consumption band with the largest share of the market. The average price of electricity in the residential consumption band with the largest share experienced a reduction of 1.3%. Electric Ireland, the larger supplier of electricity in this country, reduced its unit rate for domestic customers by 2% in November 2014. Consumers can, and in many cases have, mitigated electricity and gas prices by shopping around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers. I encourage people to continue to do so. Measures such as comparison websites, approved by the regulator, are there to assist people in this endeavour. Even if customers wish to remain with their existing supplier, they should contact that supplier and insist that they be placed on the best possible offering. I realise that energy supply companies have not automatically passed savings on to their customers, but I expect that savings will feed through to domestic prices in due course.However, all supply companies offer competitive deals to customers who switch or engage with their suppliers. For example, a customer can go online today and achieve a discount of approximately €150 per annum by switching from the standard rate electricity offering. A customer can achieve a discount of more than €150 on gas by switching from the standard rate. That equates to a saving of more than €300 a year by switching electricity and gas suppliers. However, I fully appreciate that some customers, particularly older and more vulnerable people, are reluctant to switch or feel unable to do so . In this situation I urge all stakeholders, including the energy companies and the regulator, to make the more vulnerable customer categories aware of the most competitive offerings available and to facilitate their transition to the best value deals in the market. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is scheduled to meet the chief executive officers of the various energy supply companies next week to outline the Government's concerns regarding these matters and to impress on them the need to offer their customers the best value available in a competitive, liberalised market. I will convey the Senator's observations and suggestions to the Minister in advance of that meeting which will provide an opportunity to have a broad-ranging discussion. As the Senator correctly pointed out, if prices in certain sectors are going down there has to be a knock-on effect for customers. I thank the Senator for raising this matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will provide the 2013 figures for the number of customers who switched providers. A total of 266,224 electricity customers and 117,002, gas customers switched providers. I take the Senator's point that certain categories of customers are used to working with their supplier and we should facilitate them. There is a role for the Commission for Energy Regulation to raise awareness for them. The Senator has been of assistance by raising this matter today. The difficulty with the geography and the type of energy mix in this country means there is a significant 85% reliance on fossil fuels. We are working towards the target of a 40% increase in the use of indigenous renewables by 2020. However, the reality is that we are still relying 85% on fossil fuels, including gas and peat. For example, Italy has a similar reliance but it also relies on hydroelectricity for 25% of its fuel. Holland has a similar trajectory but it has its own oil and gas supplies. While these are constraints, they are not excuses. We need to make a determined effort to ensure that we work towards a future use of a renewable mix. I attended a conference this morning in Carton House, Maynooth, which dealt with the topic of how to introduce more competition and how we can work with our counterparts. I was involved in efforts to set up a bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland in my capacity as Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. This did not come to pass but I do not think we should give up on the subject of interconnectivity, be it on a British-Irish basis, on a European basis or a connection with France. We need to consider all this mix. We must be conscious of the opportunities as well as the constraints. We have a single, all-island market which is creating more competition. Scottish and Southern Energy plans to launch a plant in County Wexford this year, next to Senator Cullinane's part of the world. There is a plant in Cork, next door to the Senator's county, at Aghada and Whitegate, which was opened in 2010. The vast bulk of our purchase of gas comes from the United Kingdom. These are the challenges but they are not excuses in that we must continue to work towards facilitating more competition to ensure a downward pressure on prices for customers. While the economy is moving in the right direction, people are still getting bills through the door. Senator Sheahan knows well the challenges faced by people. They will have a few more pounds their pockets at the end of this month but they still have bills such as car insurance, the tax bill, the television licence fee and the electricity bill. The Senator has raised a very important issue and I thank him.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I had a good conversation with the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, yesterday evening, and, as the Senator knows, I am taking this commencement matter on his behalf. Community hospitals are a critical and integral component of the overall health system. Even at the beginning of this month, when the conversations were focused very much on general hospitals and trolleys and blockages at accident and emergency departments, a key component was filtering and fluidity between the hospital and the primary community hospitals. For example, when I was in Letterkenny General Hospital last Friday we got a statistical breakdown of the demographics, which revealed that the vast majority of patients were over 75 years of age. It is important that we keep a firm focus on the critical need for community hospitals and that the Minister for Health is acutely aware of that. I would like to thank Senator Cullinane for raising this issue, as it enables the Minister for Health to provide the House with an update on the plans for a new community nursing unit for Waterford. As Senators are aware, it is Government policy to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not feasible, the health service supports access to appropriate high-quality long-term residential care, including the provision of financial assistance under the nursing homes support scheme. Providing public residential care for older persons forms a significant and crucial part of the services. The overall objective is to protect the viability of as many units as possible within the funding and staffing resources available. Therefore, improving the supports available for older persons is a significant commitment in our programme for Government. As we are aware, all developments must be addressed in light of the resources available and based on priority of need. HIQA has indicated that a number of units do not fully meet the standards one would expect to find in a modern nursing home. This is not surprising, given the age and structure of many of our public nursing homes. Currently, funding for the community nursing unit programme focuses on the upgrading and refurbishment of existing facilities to achieve HIQA compliance. The Health Service Executive is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services. This includes provision of the appropriate infrastructure to support service delivery, such as the facilities at St. Patrick's Hospital. Given that demand for capital finance for the community nursing unit programme far exceeds the funding available, investment must be allocated as objectively as possible based on the HSE's assessment of priorities of needs. The HSE has identified Waterford city as a priority location for a new community nursing home unit. The design team has been appointed. Currently it is projected that a planning application could be lodged with the local authority in the second quarter of 2015. Following the award of planning permission, it is expected that the project will progress to the tendering and construction phases in late 2015. As with all capital projects, the community nursing unit infrastructure programme, which includes this project, must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer. There is limited funding available for new projects over the next multi-annual period 2015-2019, given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place. Therefore, the reason capital funding is not ring-fenced by project is to ensure the HSE has the flexibility to manage within its voted capital allocation in the event that one or more of the hundreds of construction projects under way at any time do not progress as scheduled. Indenting rather than ring-fencing enables the HSE to leverage its capital allocation efficiently, so that it delivers the maximum number of priority projects for the funding available.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator and will convey his question to the Minister for Health. The important thing that is stated in black and white here is that Waterford city, as the Senator has correctly pointed out, has been identified based on priority. That is the first important component. The Minister for Health has outlined the reasons why the voted allocation of capital funding does not happen at this stage but must go through a process. No doubt the Senator's own role as an Opposition spokesman on this issue and as a Waterford Senator means he will be keeping this on the agenda. No doubt his good colleagues in the Government will be heard loud and clear as well. The fact is that it has been identified and prioritised. I will pass on the question regarding whether HIQA has a hierarchy of priority nationally, or where it fits into HIQA's schedule, to the Minister for Health and will ask him to contact the Senator directly.
