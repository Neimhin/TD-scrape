JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the previous speakers who spoke of the tragedy in County Donegal at the weekend. The tragedy has caused a sense of numbness in the Inishowen Peninsula. Five young people from Inishowen and one young person from Derry have lost their lives. Inishowen is a close knit community and this has sent shockwaves through the peninsula, but the families and the community in general affected by road death in Donegal feel something must be done. I am in agreement with Senator MacSharry in terms of calling for a debate in this House. Such a debate would be appropriate and timely.Geographically, Inishowen is inextricably linked to Derry, which is the fourth largest city in Ireland. When Garda resources are deployed to Inishowen account is not taken of the fact that Derry is a neighbouring city. Inishowen receives a great deal of car traffic from Derry and we do not have Garda resources. Our sympathies are with the families who have lost loved ones.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Resources are the key factor for Inishowen. It is important that this is done sooner rather than later.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to raise the difficulties at St. Eunan's secondary school in Letterkenny, an all-boys secondary school that used to be a boarding school. In particular, I am concerned that the school does not have enough space to accommodate its current enrolment of 800 students. The school's authorities are experiencing major problems in facilitating its teachers and students within the existing school building. I would like the Minister for Education and Science to outline the timeframe within which the school's extension will be completed and to clarify the stage to which the project has progressed. The proactive and hard-working teachers and parents who are involved in the school's new board of management structure want to know where the proposed school extension stands. A meeting was arranged with the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, when such details were sought last February. The board of management was told to collate the school's enrolment figures and to give that information to the Minister. Although the board was very good and did its homework as it had been told to do, it recently found itself in limbo when it was told that the project had been returned to stage one.I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will be the bearer of good news this evening. I hope he will tell me that the project is no longer at stage one, but has been progressed to a further stage. The Minister of State is normally the bearer of good news and I hope tonight will not be any different in that regard. I seek clarification about the current status of the proposed school extension. It is not good enough, from a health and safety perspective, that the school is having such difficulties in seeking to accommodate 800 students. I ask the Minister of State to clarify the progress that has been made in respect of the extension of the school building at St. Eunan's college. I would like him to make clear the stage to which the project has progressed. When will it progress to the next stage?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No. I went to a mixed convent school.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State has spoken about demographics. It is important to note that Letterkenny, like Derry, has gateway status. Many commentators have said that Letterkenny will have city status at some future time. I do not think demography should be an issue at this stage. Letterkenny is a heaving town that has seen a great deal of development. Whether that development has been done in a planned fashion is a debate for another day. Letterkenny does not have any demographic problems which mean that the level of enrolment does not necessitate the proposed extension. The problem I have raised is that the school authorities and the board of management of St. Eunan's college are unable to facilitate the present student numbers, whatever about increased numbers.I would like to conclude by mentioning some of the investment that has been made at the college. I read last weekend in a local newspaper, Donegal on Sunday, that one of the Deputies for Donegal North-East has welcomed the installation of heaters at St. Eunan’s college. I will reserve my comments about the need for a Government party Member to issue a press release welcoming the purchase of heaters by a school. The real issue faced by St. Eunan’s college is its need for an extension. I would like one of the Government Deputies representing County Donegal to submit a press release saying that the extension in question will be advanced from phase one to phase two as quickly as possible. They should not make any more silly press announcements welcoming heaters.
