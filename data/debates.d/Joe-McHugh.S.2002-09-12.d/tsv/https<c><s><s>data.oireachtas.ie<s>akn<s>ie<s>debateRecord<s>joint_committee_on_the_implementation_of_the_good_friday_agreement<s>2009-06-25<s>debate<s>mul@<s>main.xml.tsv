JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  It is important to have these meetings.  That we are focused on the economy today is significant in the times we are in.I refer to the swings and roundabouts argument.  History has a way of marking the future, with past performance being an indicator of future performance, but we must go beyond the argument that eventually southern trade will come back when the swings and roundabouts go the other way.  It is not a good enough argument to wait for it happen.  The society and the economy, both North and South, have moved on.  Cross-Border trade is not a new phenomena.  It happens in Europe, with Italians purchasing goods and services from the French.  There is cross-border movement across the EU.  The problem at the moment, as pointed out by our colleagues, is that it is one-way traffic.  It is a dangerous impasse for Border businesses at the local level.  The main challenge is survival and being able to pay wages at the end of the week.  Many Border businesses find themselves at such a point at the moment.  At a meeting last Monday, a small businessman with 15 staff said he finds every Thursday a nightmare because he does not know if he has enough money to pay wages.  These are the challenges in the Border area.Another example is a company that has relocated from Texas to Donegal.  Having worked with Enterprise Ireland and Enterprise Northern Ireland, it would be better for the company to locate in Northern Ireland.  The company wants to locate in Donegal because of connections to the area but, having done the research with Enterprise Ireland and Enterprise Northern Ireland, it finds it would be economically more favourable to locate in the North.  This anomaly must be addressed.  This is a protectionist argument from a Donegal man who wants the company to locate there, but every effort should be made to satisfy the wishes of the company on geographical location.  There should not be barriers to entry, as seems to be the case.Small businesses in Donegal do not have a level playing pitch when tendering for Government contracts.  This is because of the sterling differential, to which Deputy Ó Caoláin referred, and the cost differential.  Companies in the South are at a disadvantage because of cost anomalies and currency anomalies.  This is another challenge.There is no point in politicians, North and South, considering the protectionist argument because it is not the way forward.  The way forward is to create synergies, North and South.  There are areas where we are more competitive in the South.  We should focus on these to try to drive competition on both sides of the Border.  We want to become competitive in the EU context, not just in the North-South context.  We have the capacity and capability to drive that agenda.  Deputy Crawford hit the nail on the head in referring to a jobs plan.  The joint business council could drive the jobs plan, in association with this committee and the North-South Ministerial Council.  The idea that the situation will turn around again in three or four years, like swings and roundabouts, and that then it will be the time for Northern Ireland to capitalise on the fair wind behind its back, is nonsense.  The nonsense that we can build sustainable jobs and businesses along the Border on the basis of swings and roundabouts must be removed from the agenda.  We must examine a concrete plan whereby we create sustainable jobs North and South.I represent a new generation of politics.  This is not because I am young or have different ideas.  In the past 50 years politicians have focused, correctly, on securing peace.  They have done the job in securing peace, although it is in its infancy.  That must be commended and this committee has commended the job done.  However, the new generation of politics is about securing an all-island economy based on sustainable job creation.  That is where we should pitch ourselves.  The joint business council is working on this but we must look at the question of survival of businesses that are turning off their lights and are unable to pay wages on Thursday. That is not sustainable job creation and the committee has an obligation to use its voice to push for a joint jobs plan for both parts of the island through the North-South Ministerial Council.
