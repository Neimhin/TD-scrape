JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an gCathaoirleach fá choinne an tseans labhairt le linn na ráiteas faoi chruinniú na Comhairle Eorpaigh a tharlóidh an tseachtain seo chugainn. As the Taoiseach indicated, I will focus my remarks on the external relations item of the European Council meeting. This is to consist of a broad, strategic policy debate on Russia and a likely exchange on Syria. This is a timely and welcome opportunity to review the EU-Russia relationship in all its aspects. The course of European history teaches us the value of stable and strong relationships between Russia and its neighbours to the west. In the long term, it is a strategic goal for Ireland and for the EU to have just such a partnership with Russia. However, notwithstanding that, we must be frank about current realities and the situation as it presents itself today. Unfortunately, there has been a marked deterioration in relations between Russia and the EU in recent years. The conflict in Ukraine has come to be the central defining issue, although there are also grave concerns over Russia's role in the Syrian conflict. It must be acknowledged that there has been no major change in policy by Russia or any indication that it is seeking to improve the relationship with the EU. That is regrettable, but it is a reality that we cannot wish away. In March, the EU agreed a set of principles to guide our relations with Russia. Ireland fully supports the way forward that has been outlined. We believe there is merit in seeking a selective engagement with Russia on foreign policy issues and specific sectoral areas of interest to the EU. However, we must be clear that any resumption of selected dialogue should be gradual and that it would be used by the EU to seek a change in Russian behaviour. As I said, the conflict in eastern Ukraine remains of paramount importance. The fragile security situation in eastern Ukraine is a matter of deep concern. It is difficult to believe that two years on from the signing of the first Minsk agreement, we are still calling for a stable ceasefire. The path for a resolution of the conflict is set out in the Minsk agreements. The EU has been very clear and consistent in linking the economic sanctions imposed in 2014 to the complete implementation of the Minsk accords. The decision to impose such measures on Russia was not taken lightly - far from it - but this is an indication of the seriousness with which the EU regards Russia's actions in destabilising eastern Ukraine.The sanctions are intended to encourage Russia to use its influence to help ensure the full implementation of the Minsk agreements. Before this can happen there needs to be an urgent de-escalation of hostilities in the conflict zone. The criteria for amending the sanctions are clear and provide the sole basis upon which future decisions and assessments will be made. We also have repeatedly made clear the EU will never recognise Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and that has to remain an important principle in our approach. Ireland, together with its EU partners, remains very concerned by the ever worsening situation in Syria, in particular we are all shocked and outraged at the appalling scenes of suffering from Aleppo. The excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate use of military force against the besieged population of Aleppo constitutes a clear violation of international law. Given its role as a key supporter of the Assad regime, our concerns have been directly conveyed in the clearest terms to the Russian authorities at the direction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. I join him in urging Russia to use all its influence in Syria to end these inhumane actions against a defenceless civilian population.  Despite these negative elements, the EU still needs to look to its values and to act in accordance with them. It is of great importance that the EU maintains its support for civil society in Russia which continues to be very vulnerable. The shrinking space for independent civil society and the ongoing harassment of human rights defenders, journalists and opponents is deeply troubling. We desire a strong and stable relationship with Russia over the long term, and that goal will guide our thinking, particularly at the European Council discussion this week. We do not expect any significant change in the EU's approach to its relationship with Russia at present. That concludes my wrap-up statement but I will respond to Deputy Ryan's question on the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and the summit that will take place on 27 October. There will be an accompanying declaration clarifying that CETA will not affect public services, labour rights or environment protection. To address the issue raised by Deputy Paul Murphy, this House will have a chance to vote on the deal because the Government insists on it.
