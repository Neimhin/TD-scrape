JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to the Chamber and acknowledge the pending meeting with representatives from the Duchenne muscular dystrophy group.  I have just been informed that a delegation from that group will meet the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and I acknowledge the Minister of State's ongoing involvement.  I have been highlighting this issue with the Minister of State on a regular basis, both inside and outside the House.At the outset, I affirm Fine Gael's support for this Bill, which serves to further implement the national cancer strategy that was first established in 1996 by a Fine Gael Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I wish to pick up on a few points raised by Deputy Paul Connaughton and obviously there are swings and roundabouts in respect of centres of excellence.  As a Galway representative, Deputy Connaughton highlighted the positive aspect of Galway being a radiotherapy centre for the west.  However, when employing hindsight and when extrapolating on all the reasons Ireland entered a phase of what one might call the adoption of international best practice, I believe there will be a fundamental analysis of the mistakes made here when we took international best practice as a winning formula not simply for health, but for many other sectors.  I do not believe one can compare like with like and I refer in particular to Professor Tom Keane as head of the national cancer strategy.  One cannot compare the Canadian experience and health model to the model in Ireland because we do not have a similar type of public transportation infrastructure.  Obviously, I allude to the position in County Donegal, in which cancer patients must rely on paramedics to go to Dublin and must engage in five-hour trips in the back of an ambulance.  When comparing like with like, international best practice may be a misnomer.Ireland's number of consultant radiation oncologists per million citizens is the lowest in western Europe.  Each consultant supervises a case load four times larger than those suggested in a number of international guidelines published in the mid-1990s.  A total of 319,599 Irish citizens were diagnosed with cancer between 1994 and 2007, of whom 11,102 were patients from County Donegal.  A 41% increase in the number of cancers is expected between 1994 and 2015, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer.  There will be a major increase in the number of patients with the more common adult cancers that require radiation oncology treatment such as breast, prostate, lung and non-melanoma skin cancers.As I noted earlier, 11,102 Donegal residents were diagnosed with different forms of cancer between 1994 and 2007, out of a total of more than 319,000 Irish citizens who were similarly diagnosed during that time.  I have extrapolated a few figures from the National Cancer Registry and have compared the results for a few different counties to six seats in the DÃ¡il.  A total of 897 patients in County Donegal were diagnosed with lung cancer, compared to 798 in County Kildare.  There were 1,127 Donegal prostate cancer diagnoses, compared to 1,098 in County Kerry.  A total of 204 leukaemia cases were detected in County Donegal, versus a comparable figure of 140 in County Meath.  An obvious trend emerges in this respect.The reason I have extrapolated these figures is because of the anecdotal evidence I encounter every time I go to a wake in County Donegal.  I attended a wake in my native parish last weekend at which the son-in-law of a man who had just passed away from cancer asked why more people from County Donegal are in St. Luke's Hospital than from anywhere else.  While this is anecdotal evidence, it must be investigated.  The Department should investigate this issue because it is a question on the lips of every citizen in County Donegal.  When one visits St. Luke's Hospital, one will find statistics to prove that more patients from County Donegal go through its doors than from any other county in Ireland.  It is a worrying statistic and is a trend that is highlighted in the figures from the National Cancer Registry.  There is anecdotal evidence in every parish in County Donegal and the Department must investigate it.  People speculate that it could be a result of the outfall from Chernobyl.  Obviously the issue of diet is raised but people in Donegal do not eat any different foods than the rest of the country.  Consequently, this issue should be investigated and I call publicly on the Department of Health and Children to investigate this serious issue in County Donegal.The national cancer strategy is imperfect and I refer to concern that none of the eight centres of excellence will be situated north of the Dublin-Galway line.  Moreover, there are demographic arguments for a centre of excellence north of this line.  I note the view expressed last week by Professor John Crown, head of cancer services at St. Vincent's Hospital, who stated last week that having four centres in Dublin and none in the north west is crazy.  The cross-Border organisation Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT, has informed me that a commitment exists to consider the radiotherapy services provided in the north west.  However, a few questions arise therefrom.  What is the current position on a north-west arrangement?  Second, will the respective Ministers, Deputy Harney and Mr. McGimpsey MLA, sign the agreement for a radiation unit to serve the north west in Altnagelvin Area Hospital?  If so, when and on what date?  In the ongoing absence of a radiation unit, will the Minister guarantee that Donegal patients will continue to be afforded the opportunity of going to St. Luke's, to Belfast or to Galway?  The key question on the lips of Donegal residents and of my constituents in Donegal North-East is whether there will be equal access.  If a radiotherapy model based in Altnagelvin Area Hospital, County Derry, is agreed to, will there be equal access for the good citizens of County Donegal?  As for ongoing work at Letterkenny General Hospital, the new medical assessment unit and an accident and emergency unit are under construction at present.  However, fear also exists in respect of the downgrading of services at this hospital and I ask the Minister of State to allay such fears.Medical experts advise that the closure of St. Luke's Hospital is desirable and Fine Gael accepts that by 2014, it will not be operating as a cancer treatment hospital.  However, due to the high numbers of its residents who attend it, County Donegal unfortunately has a special relationship with St. Luke's Hospital.  The hospital has always sent a consultant to Donegal once a fortnight for consultations with cancer outpatients.  Previous speakers have referred to the unique culture at St. Luke's Hospital.  Psychosomatic medicine is an interdisciplinary medical field and it is impossible to quantify its effects.  Consequently, while one bows to medical expertise when considering oncology treatment, one must rely on what one hears, experiences and knows when addressing psychosomatic considerations.  Although the hospital is in the middle of the city, it gives calmness to its patients and their visitors.  Its buildings, staff, gardens, parking facilities, medical facilities, religious features and pathways contribute to the atmosphere to which many speakers have referred.  Patients who do not need constant care stay at the Friends of St. Luke's Hospital hostel, at which their families also can stay.All Members are familiar with the prayer, "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things that I can and the wisdom to know the difference".  The lay-out of St. Luke's allows longer-term patients and their families to give newer patients and their families courage and wisdom.  The atmosphere confers serenity and acceptance.  Patients rely on one another and learn from one another.  Patients' families rely on other patients' families and the staff are patient, honest and firm.  This compares to the chaos that applies in some other hospitals.I am pleased that the proposed facility at St. James's Hospital will include the St. Luke's name.  The CEO of St. Luke's will lead the management team of the new facility.  In addition to radiation oncology expertise, the director of physics at St. Luke's, Dr. Brendan McClean, will be centrally involved in setting the specifications of the PPP for the whole network.  The chairman of St. Luke's, Mr. Padraic White, will chair an implementation oversight group to report on progress on the overall plan.  Where will outpatients and their families at St. James's be accommodated?  Outpatients of St. Vincent's and their families avail of bed and breakfast accommodation that surrounds that hospital, especially along Merrion Road.  St. James's does not have these ancillary provisions.  In 2005 the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, launched the national network for radiation oncology services.  At that launch she said:The government recognises that, as well as facing the trauma of cancer treatment, many patients have to face arduous, long journeys for radiation treatment.  This is not what anyone wants for cancer services in our country or in any region of it.  With the inclusion of Waterford and Limerick in this network, and the arrangements being made in the North West, we will be keeping patients' travel times as low as possible while delivering top quality care for patients throughout the country.With that in mind, will the Minister commit to improving the transportation system that is provided to cancer patients from the north west?  Every Monday a bus leaves Letterkenny for Dublin with oncology patients and every Friday the same bus brings patients home.  Other than that, there is a very fragmented service, to say the least.Patients whose treatments start, for example, on Tuesdays, do not have a transport service.  That needs to be addressed urgently.In recent months I came across an example of a patient from Quigley's Point in Inishowen, County Donegal, who left Letterkenny General Hospital in the back of an ambulance, accompanied by two paramedics and a nurse at 4.30 a.m. to arrive in Dublin for a 9.30 a.m. appointment.  He waited for an anaesthetist for two hours only to find out that the anaesthetist would not be turning up.  He arrived back in Letterkenny General Hospital at 8 p.m. following the return journey, which was a 15 hour round trip.  That example highlights the simple errors that could be avoided within the health system.  It is an indication that the system is not working when a man aged over 70 was required to make a 15 hour trip only to find out that an anaesthetist was unavailable.  It is evidence of a lack of care within the system in terms of getting that information to Letterkenny before the gentleman in question had to endure an arduous journey.No stopover is provided for patients en route to Dublin from Donegal.  Patients are dependent on the kindness of persons in service stations and the fact that paramedics and nurses make an extra effort and buy tea and coffee for them en route.  I heard of one gentleman whose father had to use the toilet facilities in a service station in his pyjamas and slippers at 2 a.m.   The floor of the toilet in the service station in question was wet.  What kind of system are we providing for patients in comparison with the provisions for animal welfare?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Legislation for motorway service stations was introduced in this House last year.  One can see new service stations being built on the M1 following the enactment of the legislation.  There is no reason for the Government not to consider small stopover centres at the mid-way point between the north west and Dublin because we will not be able to provide services in every back yard around the country and patients will require transport to centres of excellence.  We should afford people dignity if they are in a state of ill health and making arduous journeys.  Providing a stopover facility would allow them to get a cup of tea.  Such a facility would not even have to be staffed.  There is no need for extra personnel or resources.  We are talking about a stopover to which paramedics would have a key.  That is something worth considering in terms of affording dignity to patients.Deputy Connaughton referred to palliative care and the voluntary work carried out in hospices.  The models designed by voluntary groups throughout the country are a model of best practice we should examine.  We should consider the genesis of the hospice movement and the types of transportation infrastructure that were introduced on a voluntary basis.  The people on the ground know what is best.  When introducing legislation we should look at what is happening on the ground in terms of best practice rather than getting caught up in international best practice.  What is best in Finland, Sweden and Canada will not work in this country.  We have a population of more than 3.5 million and we are living in a country with poor infrastructure in terms of public transport.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is something we need to address.  On that note, I will finish.
