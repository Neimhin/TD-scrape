JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	How much time do we have?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is it not longer than that?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is the debate not continuing until 8 p.m.?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am glad to have this opportunity to speak.  I will highlight one comment made by the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, prior to the budget which was that he was committed to ensuring that no sector would avoid a cut.  In fairness, he has achieved this; not one sector has been left out of the budget.The question of leadership, or a lack thereof, is raised.  We have a petrified paralysed Government more afraid to make decisions than to think about positive action and proactivity.  This is at a time when there is anger, disillusionment and apathy in the country.  I believe apathy is far more dangerous than anger and it has entered this stage, which the Minister of State knows from travelling the length and breadth of the country.We have a crisis.  The budget was an attempt by the Government to get the country back on track towards recovery.  This certainly will not be the case.  We have had two years of nervous anticipation and expectation of cuts and more cuts.  As John Maynard Keynes pointed out, it is the expectation of cuts rather than cuts themselves that can be more dangerous to an economy.  I spoke to a small shopkeeper in Letterkenny who was able to point out to me that his sales in the three weeks prior to the budget were down 20%.  It is this type of nervousness in the economy, the issue of leadership and the paralysis surrounding and associated with the Government that has left the country in a perilous state.While accepting that we have to make hard decisions, we must also accept that we have to make changes including to the type of governance employed in the country.  I do not think the budget has done so in any way.  It is very big on theory but the specifics have been left out.  Cuts of more than €742 million will be made in health but we have not been given specific information on them.  Last year, €90 million was allocated to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF; this has been reduced by €5 million to €85 million.  While €5 million is a lot of money, we are still spending €85 million on getting rid of gridlock and queues in our health services and on accommodating people who cannot otherwise avail of hospital services.I have just received a note with clarification on the slot.  I believe it will run until 8 p.m.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, I will use all of the time.The NTPF represents acceptance by the Government that health service provision is not working.  More than 2,600 patients have been referred from Letterkenny General Hospital to other hospitals, many of them to Ballykelly hospital, a private hospital in Northern Ireland.  This raises an issue.  If we want to keep money in the State and are trying to create economies and to use Government money in a worthwhile fashion why are we abdicating responsibility for performing operations?  Consultants in Letterkenny General Hospital are being paid but they are idle as they do not receive the resources to carry out orthopaedic surgery.  In this day and age, why are we sending patients across the Border to Ballykelly hospital?  While Ballykelly hospital and the surgeons there provide an excellent service, and the patients who have gone there speak very highly of it, why are we not considering a model whereby we do not have to send them there?  We have beds——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am speaking about proper leadership and the budget yesterday which, as far as I am concerned, missed the point completely in terms of challenging how the country is governed.  It is a missed opportunity.  I speak to people in my constituency who, no matter what industry or business they are in, are strangled by red tape.  Business, potential business and expansion of business are choked because people cannot carry out their business activity on a day-to-day basis.  The people of the country are in a maxed out state in terms of surviving on a day-to-day basis never mind a week-to-week basis.  The budget was a missed opportunity.The country needs to evaluate where it is in terms of debt, negative equity, people not in a position to pay back their mortgages or loans or to pay their rent and get by on a day-to-day basis.  This is the problem with the level of anger that has moved on to apathy, and the level of apathy that has moved on to disillusionment.  Yesterday, people wanted some form of leadership that would have proven the Government was willing to make hard decisions but it did not happen.
