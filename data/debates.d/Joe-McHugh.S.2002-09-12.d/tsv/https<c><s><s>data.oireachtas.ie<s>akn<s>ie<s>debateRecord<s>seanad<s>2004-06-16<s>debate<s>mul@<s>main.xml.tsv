JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Now that the local and European elections are over and the dust is settling, there will be considerable discussions and post mortems about various aspects of the elections. It would do justice to the electorate to have a debate on the electoral registers. I spoke to many people in County Donegal who came out to vote and found their names had been struck off the register without knowing who had done this or why. It is a disaster and crazy for people who pay taxes to be unable to vote. Having thought long and hard and discussed the matter with many people, including this morning with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, I believe the vote should be linked to a person's PPS number, which would entitle everyone on reaching 18 to a vote even though there would be issues for those who leave or emigrate. We require a debate in this House to allow us to prevent people from becoming disenfranchised and permitting them one vote only. At present some people have two or three votes in different electoral wards in one county.
