JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Haughey. Deputy Howlin would like to make a point.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is a worthwhile suggestion. Is it agreed? Agreed. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Today's engagement is on the topic of the European Year of Youth. Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh Mr. Ivailo Kalfin, executive director of Eurofound, and his colleague, Ms Mary McCaughey. From the National Youth Council of Ireland the youth representative to the European Youth Forum, Mr. Mark McNulty, will be joining us in a few minutes. Joining us online from Léargas are Ms Lorraine Gilligan, executive director, and Ms Emma Grainger. Our guests are all welcome. Before we begin, I must read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I will ask any member participating by MS Teams prior to making his or her contribution to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I welcome Mr. McNulty from the National Youth Council of Ireland who has joined us. I call Mr. Kalfin to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr Kalfin provided a lot of statistics and useful information and I thank him for his contribution. I will take the three organisations together, if that is okay with members, and then we can take questions afterwards. I call Mr. McNulty, from the National Youth Council of Ireland. He is a youth representative for the European Youth Forum.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. McNulty for that challenging contribution to facilitate the voice of young people. I think that the Brussels bubble term could be used again, so I thank him for that. I call Ms Lorraine Gilligan, executive director of Léargas, to maker her contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Gilligan and Ms Grainger for their contribution. Once again, it gives us a lot of food for thought and certainly gives us an insight into different funding streams and different works. We will move on to the members. I make a dual plea, directed at the questioners and the people answering the questions, to please be concise and clear, with brevity at the heart of it, so we can have a robust conversation over and back.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy raised a number of questions there. There was a specific question directed at Mr. Kalfin relating to the research and then three or four questions for all three organisations. I will start with Mr. Kalfin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Gilligan and Deputy Calleary. I am going to change the order of contributors. I beg the indulgence of Deputy Ó Murchú but Deputy Harkin is under a bit of time pressure. Would Deputy Ó Murchú agree to facilitate Deputy Harkin at this stage?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is Deputy Harkin ready to go?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We all agree with that. I will start with our guests from Léargas, for whom a couple of the questions were intended.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will go Mr. Kalfin again, if he would like to start off.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Gilligan looks very interested in coming in.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Kalfin, Ms McCaughey, Mr. Mark McNulty, Ms Gilligan and Ms Grainger for coming here today. This has been a useful conversation. It is the first conversation we have had in the committee. If there are avenues that we could go down to keep the conversation going, that would be important. As Mr. McNulty pointed out, he referenced the Brussels bubble and Deputy Callery mentioned the potential Dublin bubble at Leinster House. However,there is also a bubble at local and regional levels. We need to try to help all those great organisations that are doing that work on the ground at grass roots level, whether it is Foróige, youth services or other voluntary agencies. A committee member will be happy to help. I am reminded of a youth group from Lifford about a quarter of a century ago standing on a stage in Letterkenny with placards which read "Why speak when nobody listens". To this day, it has been a most effective message from young people. It is not just about listening, it is also about participation. Following that conference in 1996, the Donegal Youth Council emerged and is still there. People from the council, like Ewan Sweeney and Janet Gaynor from the HSE really knew the importance of youth participation at a local level. Those different youth representatives at a local level have grappled with serious issues from bullying to youth suicide to simple measures, such as getting shelters at a bus depot for those going to school. They dug down at a local level. If there is a role we can play it at a national level in terms of trying to help at a regional level - the buzzword at European level is "subsidiarity" level, we are here to do that. Go raibh maith agaibh uilig faoi choinne an phlé inniu agus an taighde atá déanta agaibh fosta ar son na ndaoine óga. Tá an rannpháirtíocht iontach tábhachtach faoi choinne na ndéagóirí, iad siúd atá scoite amach ón bpobal agus atá i mbaol fosta. Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe agus le baill an choiste.
