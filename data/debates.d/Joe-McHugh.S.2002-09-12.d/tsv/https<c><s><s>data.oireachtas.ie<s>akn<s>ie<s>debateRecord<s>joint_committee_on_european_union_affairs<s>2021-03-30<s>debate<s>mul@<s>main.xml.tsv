JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Tá quorum againn anois agus táimid i seisiún poiblí. Fuair mé leithscéal ón Teachta Marian Harkin. Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Uasal David O’Sullivan go dtí an cruinniú inniu. Táimid ag dúil leis an díospóireacht faoi Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. Tá an tUasal O’Sullivan anseo inniu i gcumas pearsanta agus is léir go bhfuil taithí agus léargas aige ar an ábhar seo. Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such direction. For witnesses attending remotely, that is, outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity for legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I invite Mr. O'Sullivan, who is very welcome, to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I know the witness does not have the detail but would the language requirements be the same for those posts? Would they need at least three languages in terms of European jobs?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I want to remind Senator Martin that we do not identify persons and to bí cúramach faoi sin. I call an tUasal O'Sullivan arís.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Not to piggyback on Senator McDowell's question but on the issue he raised about comparative and competitive advantage, the answer is a simple "Yes" or "No". Does Mr. O'Sullivan see CETA having any disadvantage for our country as it is now in terms of investment?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We do not have enough time for another round of substantive questions but we have enough time for quick-fire questions. I will try to set a precedent with a quick question and ask that Mr. O'Sullivan, with his agreement, to give quick-fire answers. His answers have been very comprehensive and the information is really important. Deputy Howlin will be followed by Deputy Ó Murchú and then I will take members in order. Canada ratified CETA in May 2017 and six countries have yet to ratify the SPA, including Ireland. Why has Canada not ratified the SPA?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Senator made a very skilful double intervention.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Glaoim ar an duine deireanach, an Seanadóir Martin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Anois an duine deireanach deireanach, le cuidiú Dé, an Teachta Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí fá choinne na gceisteanna suntasacha agus tábhachtacha a bhí acu inniu. Gabhaim buíochas arís le Mr. O'Sullivan as ucht a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht inniu agus fá choinne na freagraí cuimsitheacha, an t-eolas agus an léargas a thug sé. I thank Mr. O'Sullivan. Members will concur with me in our total appreciation for his being part of this debate and also for his comprehensive answers and information today. Exploratory talks for this agreement started over 14 years ago and there has been much information and toing and froing about it. We are doing our duty as a Parliament to complete this important phase and that is reflected in the number of committees within the Houses of the Oireachtas that want to participate in and contribute to this debate. Upwards of nine committees want to participate in this particular topic. That is an indication of how seriously we are taking our democratic duty. There is a lot of road to go yet as regards getting more information and bringing in legal experts. Some members are anxious for that to happen and we will have further presentations next week and the week after. We will work throughout Easter on this. Arís, I thank Mr. O'Sullivan for his time, information and insights and for being part of this debate today. It is the first of our public sessions and our committee will focus on three areas. I acknowledge my colleagues and particularly the leadership of Deputy Howlin in conducting that scoping exercise over the last number of weeks to ensure we focus on our competencies and what role we have in holding this issue to account. Arís, go raibh maith agaibh uilig. Our committee is here for Mr. O'Sullivan if he is available at any other stage.There was a question that Mr. O'Sullivan did not have an answer for, which was asked by Senator Keogan, and perhaps we might engage with him to get an answer on it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The next public meeting of the joint committee will be held at 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 6 April.
