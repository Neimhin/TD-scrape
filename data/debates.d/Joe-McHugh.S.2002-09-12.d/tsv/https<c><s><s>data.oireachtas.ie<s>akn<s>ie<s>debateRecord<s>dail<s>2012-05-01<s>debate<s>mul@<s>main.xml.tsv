JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister.  He will be aware of the plans and consideration given to closing RTE's London office in September of this year.  I applaud the fact that RTE is taking its cost saving measures seriously.  At a time when all businesses are rationalising and examining cost benefit analyses there is no reason RTE should be any different.  However, leaving aside the rationalisation aspect, the political perspective in terms of what we signed up to in 1998 is that we have a North-South and an east-west dimension.  To digress somewhat, the RTE office in Belfast enhanced its services following the agreement in 1998 but there is an east-west dimension also.  We now have a British-Irish Council office, with its secretariat set up in Edinburgh.  We are examining enhanced co-operation, building on existing good relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland, and there is a political perspective in that regard, especially in light of the BBC offices located in London, throughout the United Kingdom and also in Belfast.  It also has an office in RTE at Donnybrook.My point is about journalistic perspective.  While we must rationalise, and if that means closing an office I will agree with it if there are savings to be made, we still must have journalistic perspective.  I am not a journalist but it will not be good enough if we contemplate introducing a reactionary journalistic perspective to the United Kingdom.  It will be inexplicable if we decide to take the human resource out of the United Kingdom.  We can consider different permutations in terms of how that can be done.  We can examine the model in Donnybrook where the BBC has a desk and also the possibility of an RTE desk being facilitated in London.  That is an issue on which we must think outside the box.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Minister does not have any direct authority over decisions taken by RTE, I will bypass him and address my comments to the public service broadcaster.  "Out of sight, out of mind" is a common saying in business.  We want to build on the events that took place 12 months ago when Queen Elizabeth paid a symbolic visit to this country and spoke of creating a space for bridge building and developing new relations.  In that context, it is inexplicable that RTE has decided to withdraw a human resource element from the United Kingdom.  I do not say this lightly.  The Minister is a person who calls a spade a spade.   I ask him to use his office and articulate the importance of RTE having a human resource element in the UK.  If a significant event takes place in Britain, there is no point buying a Ryanair or an Aer Lingus ticket and instructing a journalist to board the next flight to get the story.  Stories develop and relationships are built.  I hope the Minister will issue guidance and we will see common sense prevail in this matter.
