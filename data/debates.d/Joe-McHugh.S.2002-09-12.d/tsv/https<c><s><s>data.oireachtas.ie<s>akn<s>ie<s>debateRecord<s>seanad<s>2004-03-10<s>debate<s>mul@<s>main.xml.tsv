JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He should contact Senator Bannon.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He has not gone away.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are all singing from the same hymn sheet regarding planning guidelines and trying to accommodate and facilitate people in rural communities. That is what we all want to do. Without people, there can be no communities. We have been requesting a debate on planning, rural housing and once-off housing for approximately 18 months.The Minister and members of the Fianna Fáil Party stated that Fine Gael is not in favour of rural housing. That is not the truth. We are in favour of rural housing and we are trying to engage in a debate on the matter.Planning is not an exact science. We have all served on local authorities and we know about the difficulties involved in obtaining planning permission, the fights with planners, etc. We are trying to engage in a debate in order that people in rural areas will be facilitated.I wish to comment on the process which led to Fianna Fáil using its recent Ard-Fheis as a local election launch pad in terms of the announcement of once-off housing. When did the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting in Sligo take place?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The information provided by the Minister of State will be useful to my contribution. Preparations started in September and the outcome of the meeting to which I refer was that rural housing would be the focus.RTE facilitated the process by placing a good spin on the issue of once-off housing in September. A few weeks later, Brian Dobson travelled to Galway to interview the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, in respect of such housing. This created momentum, expectations were heightened and people thought that there would be a relaxation of rural housing laws. Between late December and early January, a quiet time for the media, the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and rural housing were the subject of a full front page report in one of the tabloids. I do not know whether it was The Irish Times or the Irish Independent.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise. I am from Donegal and we sometimes do not even get newspapers because we live so far away.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There was a major build up and people's expectations were high. Everything was waiting for the Ard-Fheis to be used as the launching pad. Everyone on this side of the House was aware of what was going on.We have now been presented with the guidelines and they are only that. There is a consultative process and the guidelines are not set in stone and no legal mechanism has been created. They are only guidelines.I am a local representative and I still serve on the council. I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, is not present because he would admonish me in that regard. After I was elected to the council in 1999, we formulated a county development plan which recognised the need to facilitate people in rural areas. Every item included in the guidelines announced by the Minister is already contained in that county development plan. I do not understand how the situation has been improved or matters progressed. Even though my local council has its own county development plan which facilitates people in local rural areas, these people are still being turned down for planning permission. There are various reasons for that. The guidelines will not have an impact in terms of environmental issues or matters relating to location and settlement patterns. The specifications in the guidelines will not address problems of this nature in Donegal.What is the position regarding the regional planning guidelines which will be enacted on 30 March? Do they contain a legal mechanism? As far as I understand it, under the regional planning guidelines we will not be able to tell individual local authorities how to formulate their plans. As matters stand, local authorities have the autonomy to make their own decisions within the regional framework. How can we put in place a blanket guideline for the entire country at central government level when the regional planning guidelines indicate that there are too many settlement criteria and pressures involved? There is a view that this matter must go back to local authorities, which will argue that it must go further to a decentralised level. The system cannot work on a centralised basis. For example, the pressures and settlement patterns which exist in the east of the country do not match those in Galway or Donegal. Each local authority has autonomy and I find it difficult to accept that the guidelines will change the pressures that exist.Under Better Local Government, we were promised additional staff and resources in respect of planning. My local authority's planning office is under-funded and under-resourced. A senior planner indicated last week that the staff there work until midnight. How can we relax the planning laws if the resources are not in place? I want planning restrictions to be relaxed and, as already stated, Fine Gael is in favour of one off housing. However, the Government cannot state that it is in favour of such housing if it is not prepared to provide the necessary resources.In the past year in Donegal, the most difficult thing for a local representative to do was to organise or hold a site meeting. I intend no disrespect to the planners in the county who have been snowed under by paperwork, administrative work and bureaucracy. That is the fundamental difficulty with the guidelines. We must be sensible and we must be in a position to say to local authorities that we will relax the guidelines and make it easier for people to build houses in rural areas. However, that will not happen until we provide the resources. Senator Glynn referred to this matter when he referred to the checking of plans etc.People's expectations have been heightened. I have received telephone calls on a daily basis since last weekend from people who were turned down for planning permission on numerous occasions and who are now determined to resubmit their applications.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What confidence will they have when they discover that nothing has changed within the county development plan, that the policy has not been altered and that they will again be refused? That is wrong, it sends a negative message and it does nothing to instil public confidence.I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, will convey my views to the Minister, Deputy Cullen. I intend no disrespect to the Minister of State but I am disappointed that the Minister is not present. Am I allowed to talk about the Minister in his absence?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister can, at times, be erratic. When we tried to engage him in debate earlier, he became defensive. Senators Paddy Burke, Bannon and others from my party have been calling for this debate for a long period and it would have been good if the Minister could have remained in the House for the duration of it. I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister that we do not have the resources to implement these guidelines.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Senator.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are probably members of Fianna Fáil.
