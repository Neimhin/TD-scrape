JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for tabling the question. Broadband is a subject close to my heart and he is right that people in Donegal faces the same challenges as in Kerry. I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on the matter. The State only intervenes in the competitive telecommunications market where there is evidence of clear market failure and such intervention is always subject to EU state aid approval. The national broadband scheme was one such intervention. Let me be clear on this matter: there is no question of services being withdrawn following the ending of the scheme. 3 has confirmed that, following the expiry of the scheme, it will continue to provide coverage throughout national broadband scheme areas on a commercial basis, and that customers should see no change to the level of service or speeds provided by 3. It has also announced plans to extend 4G coverage across all of the NBS coverage areas within the next three years offering significantly faster mobile broadband speeds. I understand that former NBS customers who choose to stay with 3 can avail of the same choice of broadband plans and tariffs as those offered by it in non-NBS areas. Furthermore, there is now a choice of commercial operators offering broadband services over a diverse range of technology platforms throughout much of the area previously covered by the NBS. Through the national broadband plan, the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland. This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas. The commercial sector is currently investing approximately €2.5 billion in new infrastructure and services. These investments are delivering high speed broadband to homes and businesses across Ireland for whom low speeds would have been the norm just two years ago. The pace of investment is encouraging and is having tangible impacts on communities across Ireland. The Government has made clear its intention to ensure all citizens and businesses can access high-speed services, regardless of where they are located. The national broadband plan, therefore, aims to supplement the significant commercial investments with a State-led intervention in the areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is finalising a mapping exercise which will identify the precise areas of commercial investment and those areas that require a State-led intervention. The Minister and I intend to publish a series of interactive maps later this year for public consultation where operators and citizens can give feedback, with a view to ensuring that we correctly identified all of the areas requiring intervention. These maps will be dynamic and subject to change as future commercial investments are announced or rolled out. Publication of the maps represents an important milestone in the overall project. It will feed into a detailed implementation strategy which will be of published in 2015, in tandem with an application for EU state aid approval. The detailed plan will be the subject of a full public consultation and we will move quickly thereafter into formal procurement for a winning bidder or bidders to build the network. The proposed State-led intervention will involve a substantial network build-out which will be capable of carrying even higher broadband speeds, as new and more bandwidth-demanding services emerge. It will extend to locations in every county in the State identified as having no current or planned high speed network.This challenging programme is being progressed as a priority project within my Department. The national broadband plan, which is being progressed in stages, will deliver quality, high-speed connectivity to meet the needs of present and future generations in all parts of Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are on the same page when it comes to the importance of broadband. The Senator alluded to the rural electrification programme in the 1920s and we are in a similar space now in that broadband has become the new electricity in terms of its importance. There are demands for service in rural areas and it is important we reassure customers of 3 that the service they currently receive will continue. Wearing my other hat as Aire Stáit gnóthaí Gaeltachta, I have started a dialogue between the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht through Údaras na Gaeltachta on how to move this issue forward. I have also had discussions with my party colleague from Kerry, Deputy Brendan Griffin. I would be interested in hearing the Senator's views on how we can progress matters. I know the Gaeltacht does not cover all of Kerry, but an organisation such as Údaras na Gaeltachta has a very important role to play in terms of trying to attract businesses to the industrial estates and páirceanna gnó in rural Ireland. I know that some companies provide their own broadband, but not every company is in a position to do that. There are massive challenges in all of this. The Senator referred to the possibility of communities building their own ducting. A group based in the north west called ERNACT made a presentation some months ago to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and referred to Sweden as an example of such a model operating in practice. That information was relayed to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and I have had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Alex White, about the new national broadband plan. The Minister is quite serious about it and committed to it. It is important we make that big leap that is needed, similar to the one taken in the 1920s - an léim mor chun tosaigh. A big leap is needed and I am interested in working with the Senator on any suggestions he may have for Kerry. Counties Kerry and Donegal are unique in some respects, although they and have similar strengths and weaknesses and face similar challenges. We had our differences a number of weeks ago, but we in Donegal will get over that.
