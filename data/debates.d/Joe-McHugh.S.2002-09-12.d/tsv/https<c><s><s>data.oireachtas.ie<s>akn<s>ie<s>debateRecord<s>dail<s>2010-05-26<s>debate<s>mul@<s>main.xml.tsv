JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The 18th century Irish philosopher and parliamentarian, Edmund Burke, formulated and enunciated two models of parliamentary representation.  The first was a trustee model of parliamentary representation where constituents elect representatives as trustees.  This trustee has sufficient autonomy to deliberate and act in favour of the greater common good and national interest, even if it means going against the short-term interests of the constituency that elects the representatives.The second model enunciated by Edmund Burke was a delegate model of representation whereby constituents elect representatives as constituency delegates.  The delegate acts as a spokesperson for the wishes of the constituency and has no independence from the constituency.  This model does not provide representatives with the luxury of acting in conscience.  Instead, the representative acts as the voice of constituents who are literally not present.Mr. Burke, an Irishman, was speaking in a different time of a different parliament with different traditions in a different country.  Historians of Irish politics sometimes point to the Confederacy of Kilkenny, 1642 to 1652, as the genesis of parliamentary democracy in this country.  It is significant that our colleague, Deputy Hogan, has initiated this amending legislation.  It would do the Minister of State, Deputy White, well to look at this as a starting point in her argument rather than the hypothesis she put forward earlier.This House's legislative foundation dates from the 1920s, and this Fine Gael Bill seeks to amend an Act that is relevant only to the model of representation citizens of this State have developed over the past 89 years.  This is a uniquely Irish model that borrows from both of Edmund Burke's prototypes but mirrors neither.  In matters of legislation, Members of Dáil Éireann are somewhat entrusted by constituents, but are predominantly delegated.In matters of legislation, constituents elect Deputies to work as part of parliamentary parties.  In that regard, Deputies are often derided for lack of originality.  There is additionally a significant extra legislative role.  I refer to constituency work, which is not always legislative but is nevertheless inherently parliamentary as Irish people understand it.  That service is something the Irish constituent demands and rewards, although some high profile columnists and intellectuals deride this model of representation as post-colonial, parish pump and gombeen.Some of these matters interface with the legislative process.  Others do not, but all are part of the Irish political process as Irish people understand it and participate in it.  These are the matters that are important to the Irish people.  In legislative matters, Deputies serve as trustees and delegates for constituents.  When frustrated in dealings with the State and State agencies, constituents turn to Deputies to make representations for them.Ultimately, our parliamentary democracy is based on access.  Through his or her Deputy, the citizen feels part of the legislative process and is confident that he or she has a representative in his or her dealings.  We are legislative and representative intermediaries.  The Deputies who provide these services are the ones who receive the largest mandates at election time.I have outlined the role of parliamentary representative as I, a practitioner, and the Donegal North-East electors, the participants, understand it.  The voters of Donegal South-West, Waterford and Dublin South are currently denied access. They do not have the same intermediary service available to voters in other constituencies.  These intermediary services are part of the functioning of the State.  This Bill seeks to ensure that citizens are not denied this service, which citizens have designed over 89 years ago, for more than six months.
