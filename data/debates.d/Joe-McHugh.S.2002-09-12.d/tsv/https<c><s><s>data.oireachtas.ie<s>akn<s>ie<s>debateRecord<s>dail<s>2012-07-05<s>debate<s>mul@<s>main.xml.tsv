JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall.  I acknowledge the role of the Friends of Letterkenny General Hospital in raising €500,000 of necessary funds towards a cardiac catheterisation laboratory in Letterkenny.  The group intends to raise a further €700,000 to bring the total funding to €1.2 million.  This represents a vast amount of fund-raising.  This is an example of the positive effort of so many groups throughout the country.  They are aware of what is needed in a particular area and they are willing to put their shoulder to the wheel.The group is not working separately but in conjunction with management and consultants.  This is not a separate fund-raising initiative.  The United Kingdom NHS has pointed out that in 2015 there will be a significant deficit in cardiac catheterisation capacity in Northern Ireland.  Letterkenny General Hospital has the only HSE-employed interventional cardiologist in the north west.  Funding has been approved for a second cardiologist there.  It has the capacity to build on an existing strength.  The danger with cross-Border co-operation and all the associated challenges is not to acknowledge the strength of one particular hospital.  Altnagelvin Area Hospital has its strengths and Letterkenny General Hospital has its strengths.  There is a real opportunity here to build a critical service that will facilitate not only the population of Donegal or north Leitrim but also patients from Derry to Tyrone.When we discuss cross-Border synergies and co-operation it is important to place a value on the existing strengths and capacities at particular hospitals.  If there is an interventional cardiologist in Letterkenny, the only one in the north west, approval for a second cardiologist and community commitment and involvement in respect of fund-raising, then we should bring all of this together and tap into the goodwill.  As legislators, we will not be rewarded in any way by the community if we bypass its wishes.It is important to note the proactive role of the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland, Mr. Poots, and his close co-operation and working relationship with the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  They have worked to analyse possible solutions in these straitened times.  Perhaps in five or ten years time there will be a whole new landscape.  Altnagelvin Area Hospital could work with Letterkenny General Hospital and Erne Hospital could work with Sligo Regional Hospital.  We need to ensure at the beginning that the turf wars that have prevailed in hospitals and that will continue to prevail in future do not become the  raison d’être of service provision.  There is a capacity at Letterkenny General Hospital to provide this cardiology service.  The team, the commitment and funding are in place as well as Government approval for a second cardiologist.  We should honour this and we should be careful about how we move in the advanced co-operation between two hospitals on different sides of the Border.  Everyone has the same overall objective, that is, to provide quality service for the people living in the north west.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for the extensive response.  It is possible to read between the lines of what she has said.  In fairness, the Minister of State is working within the realm of existing policy with respect to potential hospital trusts within this jurisdiction.  From reading between the lines I detect an openness to considering cross-Border synergies.  I have no intention of putting words in the mouth of the Minister of State.  A really welcome feature of the response is that there is a broad vision not only for existing policy within the Twenty-six Counties but also for determining whether we can have some form of cross-Border co-operation.I call on all stakeholders within hospitals - there is a lot at stake and that is why we use the term "stakeholders" - to examine the broader picture.  There will be turf wars, suspicion, fear and misunderstandings, but there are opportunities.  There is an opportunity to provide a high-quality service in the north west.  Bearing in mind that Galway, Dublin and the southern region are facilitated, the response this afternoon implies the north west will be represented in some shape or form.I know the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to digress a little on cross-Border co-operation.  Yesterday was a significant historic day for North-South relations.  The North-South Interparliamentary Association, which was set up yesterday, will be the first formal mechanism to allow communities and citizens, rather than politicians, north and south of the Border to lobby and campaign through a joint mechanism.  The Ceann Comhairle is co-chairman with Mr. William Hay, whose family originally comes from Donegal.  I have a personal interest in the latter's geographical connections.  I congratulate the two co-chairmen, who have equal status, on their vision and for pushing forward this mechanism.  It will help the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and all the other Ministers interested in cross-Border synergies to pursue realistic goals.  I look forward to working with the Ceann Comhairle on the body and to continuing work with the Minister of State and Minister on cross-Border synergy.
