JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus baill an choiste. Tá mé iontach sásta leis an gcuireadh theacht os comhair an choiste, ionas go mbeidh díospóireacht againn ar an ábhar seo. Má tá aon cheisteanna ag aon duine ina dhiaidh seo, beidh mé sásta iad a fhreagairt. Gabhaim buíochas le baill an choiste go léir as ucht an deis a thabhairt dom a bheith anseo leo. Tá oifigigh ó mo Roinn liom ar mo chlé agus ar mo dheis. I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here this morning and for its consideration of my Department's Supplementary Estimate. Following approval by the Government, my Department is seeking a net Supplementary Estimate of €68 million. This is the lowest supplementary requirement from my Department in recent years. It represents a variation on the Department's overall net allocation for 2019 of less than 0.7%. My Department has provided detailed briefing on this Supplementary Estimate, but I will briefly outline the key elements for the information of the committee. There is an additional pay requirement of €52.3 million in the school sector across several subheads. For context, the pay allocation for the schools sector is more than €5.3 billion in 2019, so this represents a variation of around 1%. The main drivers of the additional demand are in the areas of substitution, additional costs for teacher supply initiatives, demographics and some technical issues in the education and training board, ETB, sector.  An additional €19.9 million is required for school transport in 2019. Around 90% of the additional cost relates to the provision of transport for children with special educational needs, which has been the main cost driver in the scheme over recent years. The remaining 10% relates to general costs in areas such as increasing fuel costs and demographic increases. An additional €9.9 million is being sought for the State Examinations Commission, SEC. As members of the committee know well, the SEC is responsible for the development, assessment, accreditation and certification of the State's second level examinations. The SEC was required to incur a range of additional costs in 2019, in large part due to the need to implement changes to the marking process to facilitate earlier leaving certificate appeals timelines as a result of a High Court judgement. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of all staff members within the SEC, who have been very proactive and responsive to these changes.  Some €7 million is sought to cover additional expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation due to a higher level of approvals required to meet immediate school accommodation needs, along with a €1 million contingency for some uncertainties around the level of rental approvals before the end of the year. Some €0.4 million is sought to cover the knock-on costs in the education and training sector arising from the Government's decision to award a Christmas bonus payment to recipients of social protection payments. A number of participants on SOLAS-funded further education and training programmes are in receipt of a training allowance in lieu of their Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection benefits. The Government has made a decision that these participants will also receive a Christmas bonus. The final issue on the expenditure side is €9 million to provide for the knock-on costs in the higher education sector of a pay deal which was agreed in the health sector for medical consultants. This will cover the cost of pay arrears which are due to be paid to academic medical consultants. An estimated surplus of €31.5 million in appropriations-in-aid is being factored into the 2019 Supplementary Estimate to offset these expenditure pressures. The Department has received additional receipts of €39.1 million in European Social Fund moneys over the amounts profiled for 2019. These are reduced slightly by a €7.6 million shortfall in superannuation receipts as a result of technical issues regarding the treatment of these receipts.  I am happy to discuss these issues in more detail and I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the help provided by this committee by proactively making proposals, etc. Today's engagement is important. As the committee examined the PISA results in recent weeks, it identified areas in which we are making gains. The DEIS scheme has been mentioned. It is great to see that the gap is being bridged at the lower levels. It is getting closer. The support we provide to more vulnerable and disadvantaged students is far in excess of other OECD countries. I know this committee focuses on such matters. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned the number of teachers who might retire, the special needs area and the increase in SNA salaries. I will provide some specific figures in that regard. An additional €2.1 million is required to cover SNA salary costs, which are higher than expected, mostly because the increase in SNA posts in 2019 has exceeded the provision in the Revised Estimates Volume. The number of SNAs will reach 17,000 by September 2020 as a result of the addition of an extra 1,000 SNAs. This country has more SNAs than gardaí. They are doing important work. I know that the Deputy values the role they play. We need to ensure that we are building on the capacity, especially in the area of training. We are working on the recommendations that came out of the SNA report with regard to a higher training authority, upskilling and ensuring they have the capacity as well. I look forward to working with this committee in this area. The Deputy also mentioned the provision of €19.9 million for school transport. The area of special educational needs has been identified for an increase. Extra money has been more or less ring-fenced for these increases. There are increases in costs, including fuel costs, as well. We are still working on a meaningful inclusion system. We do not want buses to be passing schools, but buses are passing schools. I appreciate that buses have to pass schools when young people with special needs are going to special schools like Kolbe special school in Portlaoise and the Little Angels special school in Letterkenny. They are travelling long distances to go to such schools. There are students passing schools that do not have units. I am trying to remind myself not to use the word "unit" because I am aware that parents of autistic children and children with special needs do not like it. I would like to use this public platform to appeal again to schools in areas like south Dublin where there is a demand for special classes, and where schools have the capacity to provide such classes, to work with the NCSE and the Department to see how their fears can be allayed. There are genuine fears about putting special classes into schools. People are worried about resources and administration. They fear that these young people might not get the special support they require. We have a short history in the year that has just passed in the Dublin 15 area. The Catholic patron, under the stewardship of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin and Monsignor Dan O'Connor, was very proactive on the ground in trying to appeal to schools about the importance of this form of educational provision as part of the inclusion journey. I want to acknowledge all the people who were involved in making this happen. Up to eight schools have put on additional classes. Danu special school has also been created. All of this has happened in a period of nine months. I am repeating my public appeal in the awareness that this can happen. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan mentioned medical consultants. There is an academic responsibility on us when such people are lecturing in third level colleges.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We contribute a percentage depending on the number of hours provided for under the contract. I will get the Deputy more detail on this matter if she requires it. We want to ensure we continue to have this vital voice and expertise in our third level sector. This brings me on to our university ranking for research. One of the fundamental factors underpinning the ranking system is the need to ensure more research is done. I will have more to say about this aspect of the matter later when we move on to third level funding. It is clear, from the feedback I am getting from third level colleges, that we must continue to put public funds into research.I am happy to follow up with the Deputy on the matter of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, Molex and the loss of 500 jobs. I was in the midlands recently and saw that the education and training boards, ETBs, and the likes of Athlone Institute of Technology are working together to upskill people through retraining and are engaged in capacity building in anticipation of changes in work practices. An example close to my home, as a Donegal man, was the 3,500 affected workers at the Unifi textile plant in Letterkenny when Fruit of the Loom decided to move away from Donegal between 1999 and 2001. We had to upskill and retrain those employees, and that capacity building and the education sector are areas I want to keep a focus on. If there is a specific avenue through the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, I would be happy to support the Deputy on that. Deputy Martin talked about teachers' salaries. Our Supplementary Estimate is down this year. We are not in any way complacent about that and we tried to get it down as low as possible. One of the messages from this committee last year was to get more of a handle, for want of a better word, on projected pension increases. I acknowledge the Deputy's role in that regard and I particularly acknowledge the roles of my officials in the Department who have worked hard on that. The annual figure for pensions alone is €1.3 billion, which is significant. It is about getting it right, and getting the guesstimate right in advance. I thank my officials for that. Deputy Martin also mentioned getting more accurate measures for substitute cover. It is difficult because that is a day-to-day matter, covering sick leave and maternity leave, and there are other factors involved. Through our primary school panel, we are trying to help the system and the principals at the coalface who need that cover at short notice. The pilot of that panel is only in its infancy for Cork, Galway, Dublin, Meath and Kildare. We will keep an eye on that but I would like to see it rolled out further. I am also conscious of constraints. There are constraints when it comes to the demands in the greater Dublin area and there are issues around the cost of accommodation, which is a reality facing many young teachers in Shanghai, Beijing, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. I have met those teachers and have tried to listen to where the constraints are. That is one of the barriers to bringing them back. We will continue to engage with them to see how we can try and help provide cover in the future. Transport has been mentioned by all four of the committee members here today. We are committed to a review and that process has started. One of the commitments I gave in my budget contribution was that we would look at transport. We are up to €220 million, going into next year, and between the special education sector and the mainstream, we are talking about providing for more than 120,000 pupils day to day. As Deputy Martin suggested, we need to look under this issue. We can be smarter in getting people to educational facilities using less transportation and fewer vehicles. There are smarter ways to do that. It will require engagement with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I am asking my officials to engage with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, who has overall responsibility on climate change. Traffic congestion, as the Chairperson mentioned, is a matter of safety for children going into primary schools in rural and urban areas. As part of the review of transport, I want to incorporate a wider element that specifically includes examining if we can have more interdepartmental collaboration and address safety aspects. Deputy Martin is welcome to engage on BusConnects. There is a piece of work that we can do through further engagement in that space.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have to get into that space and find smarter ways of doing things. It will be music to the ears of those in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform if we can make savings in that regard and have fewer buses on the roads. That said, we are here as servants of the people and not of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and must ensure that services are there. We are focused on ensuring that young people have access to their schools. I intervened for post-primary schools this summer when we made a policy change if there is a traditional route to the second closest school and put in extra finances for that. The Chairperson also spoke about the 4.8 km policy for post-primary schools. When we are looking at the overall review of transport, we bring everything into the mix because there are areas where acute problems remain. Safety and safe routes to schools in urban areas were also raised. Safety must be at the heart of this. I acknowledge the officials at county council level who draw down CLÁR funding for safety measures outside schools. We must go further and look at what actually happens when a number of vehicles and young people are in a populated area and traffic is passing by. We have to look at everything, including speed between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. There are things we can do within this review and we can hopefully-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are having engagement on transport in general and have had conversations about safety and what we can do about speed limits at schools. I have heard what the Deputy has said about investing in pathways and cycle routes. It is a different type of scenario in many rural areas because of the distance that pupils have to travel, in some instances on narrower roads. We cannot just come up with potential solutions for urban areas. We must take a comprehensive approach that covers rural and urban areas. The Deputy also referenced the High Court decision related to the State Examinations Commission, SEC, and welcomed the action that has been taken. There has been a big change and impact this year in that an extra €9.9 million has been allocated to the SEC. Once a system starts to embed, we hope we will not have to use the same amount of money every year. Officials, civil and public servants sometimes get a hard time but this was a great example of them responding to a High Court judgment in a short time, and they did an incredible job. I made a decision earlier this year that provided for alternative sittings of State examinations for students who experience bereavement. Those officials worked hard on that. More than 40 families went with their sons or daughters to Athlone in July to sit those alternative examinations. Deputy Ó Laoghaire used the word "compassion" and the human support system that was put in place for the parents who were waiting for their children to complete those exams was incredible. That was a difficult and sensitive time for those families and I again acknowledge the contribution of officials, civil and public servants in that. Reference was made to renting prefabs and properties. We replace 600 prefabs per year but we continue to have extra demands. Last year, for example, demand for school places was especially acute in Ashbourne and Ennis. This year, we are monitoring enrolments in Kilcock in north Kildare, Skerries in north Dublin, east Cork and Trim. Every year, we are faced with new pressure points at post-primary level. We have a geographic information measurement system. We are monitoring and engaging with councils and trying to figure out where planning permissions are coming up and where there will be extra people. There is constant demand for temporary provision. This is not a position I like to be in and it is certainly not where the Department likes to be because it involves paying for temporary prefabricated accommodation until buildings are eventually constructed to replace them. We do not like to spend money on temporary provision. Deputy Catherine Martin referred to decanting in County Wicklow. It was a primary or secondary school-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a cost in the documentation. We are using a number of temporary buildings as well as prefabricated buildings. We have decanting and moving costs. We have to set up the proper infrastructure for schools. Some schools may be in a temporary building where the lease runs out and the school may then have to move. There are many challenges in this regard. Ultimately, we want to be able to ensure we move through the system to provide a building. Whether we are talking about Monasterevin or Newbridge, we want to ensure we get it right. There are numerous processes involved. Sometimes parents, teachers, principals and politicians get frustrated with the process. We all do because it happens in our constituencies, including my constituency. We have to go through stage 2A, stage 2B and design stage. We start asking whether the stages unfolding in a phased out way are leading to delay. I learned in the first 48 hours in this job that we must have those stages and processes to ensure we get it right. We must ensure we have near-zero energy building requirements. We must ensure the design and building are right and we do not have a repeat of the situation that faced me in my first 48 hours in the job.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ideally, we want to have the work done during the summer. However, issues sometimes arise in October or March. These are things that are out of control. If there is something specific relating to the school in question, I would be happy to get my officials to follow up on it. Reference was made to higher education and the Cassells report. I know the committee deliberated on the report recently. We have to maintain at the heart of the education system publicly funded higher level education where the burden is not on parents or students. Decisions will have to be made, including political decisions, once the processes are finished at commission level. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Michell O'Connor, has been proactive on this issue. A decision will be needed on funding. As I said, having spoken to leaders in the third level education sector, I believe the whole area of research is an important area. University rankings are an area where investment will be required. Reference was made to equal pay for equal work, the 2011-14 cohort and value. I met a large number of the 2011-14 cohort when I was in the United Arab Emirates. There is anger and a pent-up frustration in that regard. It is interesting that when I go into staffrooms it is not necessarily members of the 2011-14 cohort who raise this issue with me. It is the other teachers because they do not believe it is right that there is inequity in the system. Deputies will hear this from constituency visits. This is something I was determined to make progress on at an early stage. During the Easter conferences last year, I was able to get a commitment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that the inequality issue will form part of the next round of pay talks. The next round will take place in the coming 12 months. I know this has been frustrating but there is a commitment from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department that pay inequality will form part of the discussions. Deputy Ó Laoghaire also referred to inequality and raised the issue of school secretaries, which was also raised last night. There is a process, which has not broken down. I re-emphasise that point today. I appeal to Fórsa to continue to engage with Department officials. Deputy Ó Laoghaire asked me whether I was part of those deliberations. I am not. I am not around those tables but the officials know where I stand on the matter. This issue has been around since 1978. I was six years of age at that stage and Deputy Ó Laoghaire had probably not been born yet.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The issue has gone on for too long and I want to see progress on it and a solution. I hope when we put heads together something may come out of it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Technically, as Minister, it is not my role to be at the Workplace Relations Commission talks. Deputy Jan O'Sullivan will be able to attest to that. From my time in politics, I have learned that nothing gets sorted if people do not talk or engage. The only way we can make progress is if the mechanisms in place continue to be used. The 1978 scheme was changed in 2008. I find it interesting that when I go into schools the secretaries do not lobby me directly on this issue because they are busy. They have such a focus and are so central to every school. They know their role but they do not go out of their way to make a big issue of it when I walk into a school.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a lesson to be learned in terms of how we get the message across. The school secretaries do it through the channels open to them. They have had protests and there was a campaign in all the constituencies. I believe this issue has gone on for far too long. We need to get people talking around a table. Deputy Ó Laoghaire spoke about school transport, special needs and buses travelling past schools. I have no wish to go over this issue again. Next year, we will spend €220 million on school transport. The Deputy referred to school traffic, which we have also covered, and referred to the State Examinations Commission and compassion. We have made changes with regard to bereavement. If a conversation has not already started about illness and different reasons, one will start. My officials are well aware that the conversation will require consideration as well. For the moment, the change relates to bereavement. I thank the officials for the compassion they have shown on that issue. Reference was made to PISA results and the DEIS programme. We are investing €125 million in DEIS.We can and should increase that investment. The current cohort of 870 in the entire DEIS system see the complexity of their world, in terms of societal change, dealing daily with NEPS, referrals to CAMHS and that constant frustration and the extra administration around that work. We have to look at that cohort, whether in band 1 or 2. The other schools are knocking on the door and saying they have complex issues too. When DEIS started in 2005 it was based on geographical grounds linked to socioeconomic disadvantage. Life has become much more complex and geography does not now necessarily determine whether a school needs DEIS status. We need to consider building on that. We have a group working on class size and we will produce a report on that in a few weeks' time. That will be relevant to all schools but particularly DEIS schools. We have made significant progress in our analysis of DEIS and gathering socioeconomic data. We are approaching the endgame and our next steps on DEIS. A big conversation will be needed. If I still hold this position in the new year – I am not going to get involved in talk of an election today – I will ensure that pioneers of DEIS, the stakeholders, the teachers and principals who were, and continue to be, involved in it from day one are part of that conversation. They have to be part of the solution. I do not need to tell anybody on this committee about the complexities, the mental health issues and anxiety that teachers and principals have to deal with from day to day. We must keep that to the fore. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Once we get that analysis and the data, this committee will be the first port of call. We can then see how we progress that. There will have to be a consultation with stakeholders. Without wishing to pre-empt this, it will take apart the original geographical grounds. I hope it will be a signpost for us as to where to go. The first port of call at the democratic level should be this committee. Once we have that information I will ensure that happens.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Chairman asked about school salaries. I talked about supply panels, the pilot and school secretaries. I acknowledge her point about home school liaison. That link with communities has never been more important. Home school liaison officers get right into the house, sit down at the hearth and drink tea with the families. They get to know parents and build up a relationship which is very important to building confidence and ensuring that attendance at school is positive.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Could the Chairman expand a bit on what she is suggesting?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The place to tease out that suggestion is the primary forum with all the leadership and stakeholders.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the administrative pressure that teaching principals are under. It is not a simple world. As the Chairman says, they are involved in construction if, for example, there are summer works, emergency works or additional accommodation, and they have to work with the board of management. It is quite a complex job. I am constantly considering ways to give more in the budget for teaching principals, such as the extra release day. The Chairman mentioned clusters. Within the small school symposium, we ask how we can add value to them and to the networking that is already going on. Many principals already have ad hoc support groups. They are great groups to meet because they give us ideas but the question is how we can add value at an official level. We have covered the safety issues, traffic calming, the walk and cycle options, concessionary places and turning the school transport system on its head. The committee's role in that review of school transport will be important. We will keep in touch on that.  In regard to the junior certificate results in late October, they were a bit late because of the changes after the High Court decision. We proposed a Monday in late September but we are engaging with the education stakeholders. I see Deputy O'Sullivan smiling. For years the stakeholders had been advocating a Friday when normally the results were coming out on a Wednesday. We suggested a Monday in late September but the stakeholders preferred a Friday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We never thought about that but it is a good suggestion. There was feedback to say we could not do it on a Friday because there would be carnage on a Friday night. Sometimes we have to trust the younger generation. The young people who celebrated their results on the Friday night did not do what some people expected them to do. That will be the date. It is too late in October so we will try to bring it forward. We do not want to have temporary accommodation. In north Kildare, east Cork, north Dublin and Trim we want to be in a position to be more responsive.  Third level funding and the potential impact of students returning after Brexit was mentioned. There will not be a change in university status for the RCSI. After 235 years, it is now RCSI University. I was there when the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O’Connor, was seeing this change through both Houses. It was a highly charged and emotional day for the entire team, which was very appreciative of the cross-party support in the Oireachtas. For anybody here who went to RCSI or knows anyone who went there, graduates of the college will be changing their CVs because it does not matter when they studied there, they will be able to say they have a university degree.University status is a big issue on the international stage. As the committee will be aware, when one travels to China or India it is important to have a university degree, it is good for Ireland and enhances the reputation of the RCSI. I wish to acknowledge Professor Cathal Kelly, CEO, and his team for their work and engagement with everybody in the Parliament.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Absolutely.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, but it is important that we highlight some of the good work that has been done and the moneys spent on education. I am talking about students, the welfare of families and their children in respect of what they have experienced over the past number of years. The Chairman would be the very first person to come in here and criticise if students in both national and secondary schools were not catered for. I welcome the funding as did the principals of each of the schools that I have visited.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Since 2014, more than 2,600 projects have been funded as part of the summer works scheme. My officials are very eager to work with school principals on temporary accommodation issues. I urge school principals to get in touch with the Department because we do not want anybody to be without a school place in September 2020. I agree with what the Deputy said on apprenticeships. We want to continue to place a tremendous value on apprenticeships. SOLAS and the ETBs have continued to drive that because there are young men and women in the secondary school system who know, as do their principals and parents, that they will go down different career pathway and, therefore, we will continue to focus on that pathway. The final question was on recreational facilities. The Deputy is a good man for getting sports capital applications in from his constituency. I urge him to encourage the schools to make a joint application with a club, if possible. That is an area I want to continue to support as well.
