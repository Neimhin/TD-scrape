JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas as ucht chuireadh an Chathaoirligh go dtí an coiste seo inniu. Tá an t-ábhar seo iontach tábhachtach. Táim ag dúil go mór leis an díospóireacht le baill den choiste. I appreciate the opportunity to update the committee today on the structural assessments undertaken in 42 schools constructed by Western Building Systems and the next steps to be taken by the Department of Education and Skills. I am joined by the head of the planning and building division, Mr. Hubert Loftus. I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for their help and positive suggestions throughout this process. We have tried to keep the members of the committee informed and have been in regular contact with the clerk and members. We also invited members to a briefing last week in Tullamore, where the Department's management of this challenging situation was co-ordinated. Three Department teams focused on operations, communications and interim accommodation. They worked intensively over the past two weeks to co-ordinate the full programme of structural assessments and the implementation of precautionary measures. They also worked to provide support to schools as required in respect of interim accommodation needs and to ensure progress was communicated to schools and the public. Getting to where we are today has only been possible thanks to the collective efforts of parents, school principals, patrons, boards of management and Department officials as well as the project managers, structural engineers and contractors who pulled out all the stops to facilitate the reopening of schools this week. I acknowledge the disruption and inconvenience caused to pupils and parents over the last number of weeks and the impact this has had on parents' life and work. I am conscious that there has been a particularly heavy burden on school principals. They have been dealing with the operational impacts of the assessments and related precautionary measures. I thank them in particular for their ongoing co-operation. The outcome of all 42 structural assessments, including the full list of schools requiring precautionary measures, was published on 1 November. The summary of the current situation is as follows. There were 19 schools fully cleared to open this week without any precautionary works. A further 19 schools were enabled to open in full following external precautionary measures in the form of a fence around a building, or part of a building, and protective decking at all entrances and exits. Three schools, two in Tyrrelstown and one in Lucan, are being enabled to open, initially at ground floor level only, following the implementation of both internal engineering solutions and external precautionary measures. Following a meeting between Department officials and school authorities in Tyrrelstown yesterday, additional work is continuing to address some of the operational impacts of the precautionary measures and other logistical issues such as traffic management. All parties are working towards the reopening of the Tyrrelstown school, initially at ground floor level only with other classes accommodated off-site. Finally, one building on this list, phase one of Ardgillan community college, remains closed. Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, ETB, has made arrangements for the displaced classes to be accommodated, including through the use of a shared community centre and facilities at another school. It is important to underline our priority over the mid-term break was to ensure that the structural assessments were conducted and any precautionary measures implemented to ensure safe occupancy this week. We will be moving as quickly as possible to the next phase. That is to initiate more detailed structural investigations at all the 42 schools and, following on from that, to implement the permanent remediation works required. We cannot give a precise timeframe at this time for the duration of precautionary measures or the implementation of permanent works. That will depend on the outcome of the next phase of the investigations. Every effort, however, will be made to keep the duration of temporary measures to a minimum. We fully intend to pursue Western Building Systems through all contractual and legal channels for the cost of the precautionary measures and the remediation work, where required. It is also our intention, at the appropriate time, to initiative a programme-level review of the Department's design and build programme to include aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight. The review will look at aspects both pre- and post-implementation of the amended building control regulations in 2014. The results of the more detailed structural assessments at Western Building Systems' constructed schools will be necessary to inform this review. I am happy to take questions or listen to comments.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is no problem. There will be specific questions I will not be in a position to answer but I will be happy to obtain the information sought. If there are elements I miss out on, Mr. Hubert Loftus will be more familiar with them and their history. Let me deal first with the issues raised by Deputy Thomas Byrne. I agree with him that a number of players are involved; it is not just the contractor. It is very much set out in the building control legislation that there is a weight of responsibility on those concerned, be it designers, architects or contractors. We will pursue every possible channel to ensure that whatever costs exist at a remedial level can be met. We will also pursue any disruption costs as best we can. A question was asked about the 2017 clerk of works. Since 2017, every single school has a clerk of works. Even though there is a clerk of works on site, he or she does not have ultimate responsibility for certifying work. The clerk of works is not looking down the cavity wall to ensure the wall ties are in. This goes back to vigilance, supervision and the question of where responsibility lies.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The clerk of works is ensuring the work continues. Obviously, there is vigilance. If there is a good clerk of works on site, he or she will be taking photographs and doing all the necessary work. In the past two years, I have spoken to the clerk of works on a school project in Donegal. He was telling me that every day he was on site he was taking photographs and being vigilant. The work can be done at clerk of works level but the clerk of works is not responsible for certification. It is still a matter of self-certification from the point of view of the contractor, designer or architect. Deputy Catherine Martin made a suggestion on learnings from the investigation. Deputy Burton asked whether there will be an inquiry. There has to be an inquiry, in whatever form. I will be happy to pursue this to determine what we can learn from it, even regarding the period after 2014. The Deputy also asked about the certificates of completion and compliance. At every stage, responsibility for compliance rests with the contractor of the design team. This is where responsibility for the certification of compliance lies. Certification of completion occurs when the project is completed within a certain period. The Department has a role in that regard. We all heard about Ardgillan college and its defects at the same time. Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to the fire assessment, boiler house and toilets. At no time were any of the fire safety assessments pointing to structural issues. In Ardgillan, a fire safety assessment concerning the cavity wall resulted in officials from the Department being alerted. They put a team in place to explore further whether there are structural issues. At no time during all the fire assessments was there any indication that there were defects, such as the lack of wall ties or the inner timber relief not being joined properly to the steel structure. The weaknesses came to my attention and that of the Department only when the wall opening in Ardgillan happened on the Friday in question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	One of the questions Deputy Thomas Byrne asked was how much a fire safety audit cost. I do not have that figure to hand, but I am happy to get it for him. The Deputy also mentioned the building regulations. There are not just fines; there is also imprisonment for breaches of the regulations. All of this will be taken into account as we pursue every possible channel to ensure-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with Deputy Catherine Martin that it has created a lot of worry and concern and been a body blow to individual communities that were very much part and parcel of ensuring the school projects came to fruition in the first place. I agree completely with her assertion that it is a worrying time, but safety has been at the heart of our deliberations. I remember that when the problem first emerged, we were faced with two issues, the first of which was ensuring the safety of the staff and pupils. The second was trying to ensure continuity in the education of the children in the classroom. They were our two main foci in the past two weeks. The Deputy asked about the decision made in September 2017. That matter has been cleared up. There has been a clerk of works for all major building projects since 2017. The Deputy asked how many WBS schools had been assessed. Of the 55 schools, I think reports on 51 have been forwarded to the Department. The Deputy asked about the regime post-2014. There are four schools. There is a three school campus in Ashbourne, as well as Scoil Chaitlín Maude in Tallaght. There is concern about the external walls in these schools that has to be backed up with evidence and engineering assessments.  The next phase involves the 19 schools identified in which, for example, there is the potential absence of wall ties but in which there is no immediate or imminent danger. We will be pursuing an intensive and comprehensive programme of works to assess the extent of the problems in these schools and ensure they will be rectified. The Deputy talked about external fencing and the making of payments. At this stage, as far as I am aware, there is no indication of payments being made by WBS. The estimation of cost will be based on the extent and nature of the works required. We are trying to evaluate and assess the extent of the works required in all 42 schools. The Deputy referenced fire audits and asked if there was correlation between them and structural assessments. While there could be issues with doorstops and and doors not opening properly, that never is an indication that there are structural issues within the cavity walls. While all of the fire assessments were being carried out, at no stage were structural weaknesses identified until the opening of the walls at Ardgillan community college on the Friday afternoon.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I presume the Department was liaising at every stage with fire safety personnel. Mr. Loftus might come in on what happened before I was in situ, but I know that, once the concern about a potential structural weakness emerged in late August, a team and a programme of work were set in place. The potential concern emerged in Tyrrelstown. Because Ardgillan community college was being assessed through a different fire safety stream and was not part of the 55 schools, it was decided to make it part of that assessment process. That is how we ended up in this place. The Deputy mentioned community facilities. Obviously, a lot of disruption is being caused in the communities affected. For example, basketball teams are looking for facilities. The community building in Tyrrelstown is open again. The ground floor is open in Tyrrelstown and also in Lucan. Within a matter of weeks we needed to have strengthening and support work done on the first floor. We will also need strengthening and support work done on the second floor in both schools in Tyrrelstown to ensure the disruption will not continue. It will be done within a matter of weeks. When can the work be done? It will have to be done at weekends. It cannot be done when the students are on site in a learning environment. We will have to figure out a way to ensure the strengthening and support work on the first and second floors will be completed. The Deputy talked about how grave professional misconduct was dealt with in legislation. Obviously, we are taking the matter very seriously, which is why I have met the Attorney General. The Department's legal team is in contact with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and we will pursue every possible channel to ensure we get justice, not just from the point of view of the taxpayer but also for the communities affected.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is correct. The reason there are precautionary measures is that there is an ultra cautious approach to the 19 schools. Initial assessments are that there is a suspicion of a lack of wall ties. There is no immediate danger but the judgment was made that there is an issue with structural weakness. For example, there is a three school campus in Ashbourne and the total length of the fence is 3 km. That gives an indication of the extent of the work that took place and the type of logistical exercise involved over the bank holiday weekend. It is to reassure the parents who are sending their children to these 19 schools. I spoke to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Creed, this morning and two of his boys are attending one of the schools in Macroom. Its external walls are raising a concern about a potential absence of wall ties. However, until we get a full evaluation and assessment of the extent of the problem we have taken the ultra precautionary measure of putting fencing around these schools. It is ultra cautious on my part. From day one I was on the same hymn sheet as my officials about safety so we are taking this ultra cautious approach. The extent of the problem in some of these schools is not the same. Some will need more work than others. In fact, in one school it is only one gable wall but we have taken the precautionary approach of having the fencing around all 19 schools. The two Tyrrelstown schools and Eiscir Riada in Lucan have internal and external issues and that is why that approach has been taken. Ardgillan is in a different position and we have closed down that building. Phase 1 was built in 2009. Phase 2 was built in 2015 and it does not have any structural issues and that is why that school is operating since yesterday morning. Eiscir Riada in Lucan is in the same situation as Tyrrelstown. It opened yesterday morning for the junior students to attend. That is not to say that the concerns are different in different schools. The Tyrrelstown's boards of management and principals took a decision because of the logistics of moving children to different settings. They took the cautious and safety approach which was the right decision. They wanted the extra time to reassure parents. Parents will be afforded an opportunity tomorrow to visit Tyrrelstown and meet the engineers from PUNCH Consulting Engineers, departmental officials and the staff so they are reassured before they send their children back on Thursday morning.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take the point about whether it is a big programme or an extension. This is an area where I want to ensure we have proper procedures and vigilance in place. I have been comparing it with Northern Ireland and the UK. They have a heavily resourced building control unit in their local authorities. Obviously then it is a question of Exchequer funding because if one tries to replicate that model it is down to resources. Having found myself in this position so new in the job I believe we must examine every way in which we can have more vigilance. Families today are wondering what happened and what went wrong so we owe it to them and to the taxpayer to ensure that happens. There are plenty of structural engineers so one of the issues I will be examining as part of this overall review is whether we can have a more systematic approach to having that type of vigilance in place as well. Again, it is a question of resourcing. These are the issues we have to grapple with. Deputy Burton talked about the disruption. Yes, it is not great to be looking at scaffolding first thing in the morning when one goes to school. She will appreciate that the decision I and the Department were faced with was about safety. Young people are adaptable and interested in learning so they will be taking note of the process going on around them, whether it is internal or external. I went to Tyrrelstown and met the two principals and members of the boards of management. The Deputy is right that they are beautiful buildings from the outside, and parents had confidence that they were okay on the inside as well. That trust was broken and-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	My job and the job of everybody else here is to build up that trust again. How we do that is the foremost question on our minds. I answered the question about the partial use of the ground floor. We are expecting to move onto the first and second floors in a matter of weeks. Eiscir Riada in Lucan is a two-storey building so we will be seeking to do that on the first floor and also to do the first and second floors in both schools in Tyrrelstown. The Deputy spoke about full recovery and compensation. She also mentioned loss but I do not know if she was referring to teaching time or compensation for the cost of remedial work.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As far as I know I am due to be in the Dáil at 5.30 p.m. I have already had a discussion with my officials on what happens about lost days. There is a reconfiguration option but obviously that is led by the teachers and the school. That is a conversation I am happy to have. What was the Deputy's second question?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Sorry, the second question was about a Supplementary Estimate.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We do not have a costing. We do not even have a costing for the temporary remedial work over the last two weeks. Obviously, I will have to deal with that. I will also be talking to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, about treating this as an extreme measure. I am treating it as a very extreme measure. At the same time our first port of call is accountability and culpability and we will be following up through the appropriate channels in that regard. Until I know exactly what this will cost I am not in a position to go to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to seek extra money.We will initiate an inquiry and it is our intention to initiate this programme-level review of the Department's design and build programme at the appropriate time. It will look at whether rapid response to building is the right way to build. It will include procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight. We have to look at everything. We owe the people nothing less.  Deputy Burton spoke about the community and the pride in the two schools. I picked that up on the ground in Tyrrelstown. There is disappointment on one hand but on the other hand, it is about how we move forward because my duty of care is to ensure those two schools get the adequate response to ensure they will be part of that community for a long time, be it Lucan, Tyrrelstown or any other part of the country.  The Grenfell Tower fire was mentioned. Let us be honest; this fire happened in June 2017. These assessments of the 55 schools came in September 2017. Obviously, there was a lot of triggering here. The Grenfell Tower fire brought a lot of focus not just to this Department but other Departments. Once those 55 assessments were complete, there was a triggering of the suspicion in late August 2018 that fast-tracked putting a team in place to check out the schools in Tyrrelstown and Ardgillan.  We do not yet know the cost of remedial works. We must wait and see what the figure is. A question was asked about the standing down of a contractor. We are having conversations with the Attorney General regarding many matters, one of which is future contracts. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. He or she can check work but does not have responsibility for compliance.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If there are specifics that I leave out, Mr. Loftus will fill them in for me. Senator Ruane raised a number of practical scenarios, such as a child being locked into a bathroom. This would become an issue if there were a fire. That is where people's concerns are. The standard of the building is paramount.I have been picking up bits of anecdotal information from public representatives about minor issues, such as doors jamming, but if one has minor issues in any building, it is something that one must take seriously and on which one must follow through. Obviously, the point at which one is aware there is a structural assessment required or a suspicion of concern is when one moves into a completely different space, as we did on Friday fortnight last. I will let Mr. Loftus go into the detail on tendering process, the quality assurance and oversight. The tendering process, etendering, is outside the political process. It applies not only in Ireland, but in Northern Ireland and in Europe. That is our tendering system. Considering that 19 out of the 42 schools that needed external works did not have the same trend as Ardgillan, Tyrrelstown and Lucan, the different trends are alarming. Corners were cut, for example, in Ardgillan, and one would question what were the reasons. Was it time? The Deputy is correct. Wall ties certainly will not cost much. It goes down also to people's pride in their work. Many of the buildings in this country that are used as educational buildings are over 100 years old. Old colleges that were built to standards and regulations at that time are still standing and here we are talking about schools that were built in the past ten years. That bit is not leaving my head. This is something we all take seriously. I was asked what triggered the appointment of the 2017 clerk of works. I assume it was the Grenfell fire but Mr. Loftus might add to that. It would have been the assessment work that was carried out on the other schools. On engagement back and forth, I was asked about self-certification of schools. This is the space that we need to bring this conversation into now. Are we happy with the type of oversight with regard to self-certification? Even in the private sector, most builds have experienced an average extra cost of 18% because of the new rules brought in in 2014. The extra costs are due to delays. There are delays because designers are taking their work really seriously. They are sitting down with the contractor and stating they will not move to the next stage until they ensure that everything is done properly. For instance, they may not move until they have a meeting with the fire officer on-site the following week, and where it turns out that they cannot get him that week, they might get him the following week. This is delaying projects, and that is correct. If that is happening in the private sector, as I am picking up anecdotally, it must be happening across the board as well. It is something we must be conscious of. Mr. Loftus might talk about the snags issue after the completion of a project as well. There is obviously a default period after signing over and getting payment. I was asked what went wrong in Ardgillan. Senator Ruane mentioned the word, "negligence". According to my information, it was simple things, such as the inside timber leaf not being adjoined to the sealed structure, the timber leaf on the inside not sitting properly on the concrete in the right place, and wooden nails going down through the concrete when one would only assume that these should be bolts. The Senator encapsulated it by using the word, "negligence". That is why that phase 1 building from 2009 was closed down in its entirety. That building was separate and as for that trend in Ardgillan, the same level of negligence did not appear elsewhere. That is not in any way justifying the different weaknesses in the other buildings. As for lessons learned for the future, this committee will play a role in how we move into the new space of providing greater vigilance and oversight to ensure that this does not happen again. Deputy Funchion rightly pointed out the lessons learned on the PPP buildings. We have schools half-finished and a company went wallop. There are subcontractors who are owed money and now we must re-tender. Due to time lost, there will be extra money involved. Once again, it brings a negative to something which should be a complete positive for communities. As for the State playing a bigger role, the State does not have the resources for complete oversight. From where does one take the responsibility? The legislation, both pre-2014 and post-2014, places the responsibility on the contractor and on the designer-architect. It is specific. It applied the whole way through the past ten years. That did not happen. I do not believe anyway that we should move to a situation where the State becomes responsible for oversight in its entirety. We must place responsibility. That is why we need to ensure that we follow up through all the legal channels to ensure culpability, responsibility and accountability. I have said that publicly from day one. I will continue to do so. That is the least I can do from the point of view of both taxpayers and the communities concerned. I was asked who was liaising with the parents. What we did straight away was set up a communications unit, through an intervention by Deputy Thomas Byrne. We were working on whether we should go directly to the parents and how would we communicate this news. Then I visited the principal in Tyrrelstown who told me that there were 46 different nationalities in that school and that some of the parents may have difficulties on the communications side. These were the challenges. What was decided was - I thank Deputy Thomas Byrne for his intervention - that the communications unit in Tullamore would communicate directly with the schools, that is, with the principal and the teams there. As information came through, the principals fed it back to the parents in their respective communities.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take that point. We tried to ensure this committee was kept informed. That was at one level.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take Deputy Coppinger's point. For an individual Deputy in whose areas the schools are, information is key. I suppose we were in the situation of trying to sort out the two main issues of safety and getting children back to school. I apologise if there were any deficits in information in that regard. Deputy Funchion-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There were updates on the Department website each day. There were 42 schools. I am not saying it affected 42 constituencies but it impacted on approximately 30. That will give the committee a sense of the magnitude. Councillors were ringing the Department. Concerned citizens were ringing me. A former principal in Tyrrelstown was ringing me. Everybody was trying to give their help. It all helped and they all fed into the solution. Communications is a two-way street. I acknowledge the dedicated team in Tullamore who worked on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Monday of the bank holiday weekend. When I visited, all I could see were empty packets of biscuits. I do not think the dietary conditions were great.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They were happy to come together, as were the construction companies which had to do the temporary work. The construction companies mobilised 250 workers over a long weekend. They felt there was a duty on their part to come forward and try to address this situation as well. Deputy Funchion also asked about minor works for primary schools and summer works.We will be in a position to announce the summer works before Christmas and we are pushing hard to get the minor works announced before Christmas as well. I will commit to that. We need a longer run-in, for which several Opposition colleagues have been calling. We will commit to starting the application process for the 2020 summer works early next year in order that schools can do a bit of forward planning. Members do not need me to tell them that principals have a lot going on. The last thing they need is to be given an award of funding in May or June of that summer, which then has to go out to tender. It just does not make sense.  Deputy Coppinger raised a few issues around building control. She made the point that the cost of wall ties is minuscule. Let us have a conversation about rapid build. A lot these builds were completed in 24 to 26 weeks. Today there is a demand for housing and there is a demand for rapid build in that sector as well. Let us look at the enormity of the challenge. I do not believe that reducing the timescale of a build is a negative if it is done right, if the workmanship is right and if there is proper attention to detail and oversight. It is a question of oversight and how we can fill that gap.  Deputy Coppinger mentioned the Garda. At this stage I have not made contact with the Garda but I reiterate what was already said at committee today. The Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 specify that sanctions are not limited to fines. They include imprisonment. There is culpability and I will certainly continue to be very vigilant and-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am determined to get to the bottom of this. I am determined to find out who is culpable and where the responsibility lies. Obviously that will be a job for my legal team, the team in the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO, and the Attorney General. The 2014 regulations are very clear that the sanctions are not just fines; they also include imprisonment. There must be culpability and an effort to bring culpability and accountability to bear. Mention was made of Northern Ireland companies in general. I certainly will not tar all companies with the same brush. A lot of Northern Ireland companies do good work in the South. The work of Western Building Systems, WBS, in Rush was mentioned. I will let Mr. Loftus answer on the assessment carried out in 2015. Deputy Boyd Barrett raised this in the Dáil the week before last. The Deputy asked about ongoing WBS projects. Yes, there are such projects, namely, a temporary building in Sandymount and a build in Wicklow. We are faced with a decision on whether to stop those projects or add more vigilance and oversight while they are ongoing. Obviously we have made the decision to go with the later option. The projects should continue to completion. We are in direct contact with the Attorney General and the CSSO in regard to future contracts but we did think about that question. We looked at what the implications would be if those projects were stopped and we felt the negative would outweigh the positive. However, extra oversight is in place.  Deputy Coppinger also mentioned whistleblowers. If she has any evidence or if there is evidence within the Department, I am happy to pursue it. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I shall first respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett. He raised a lot of issues and made a number of allegations. His comments highlight the fact that questions need to be answered. However, people need to be in a position to defend themselves.The Deputy mentioned whistleblowers. I would be interested in hearing any information or seeing any evidence anyone might have. Accountability was mentioned and it was suggested that schools were being blocked repeatedly by the Department. I have no knowledge of that, but if he has any information around that I am happy to listen to and to look at that. The issue of Whitehall College of Further Education, a building built in 2006 under the auspices of the OPW, was mentioned. The Deputy is correct to say it was vacated in 2014 due to certain issues that arose. The reason there was no knock-on impact on the school was that it was a completely different type of build. It was a prefabricated building. That building, however, must be included in any investigation or review that comes out of this, even though it was under the umbrella of a different Department. We can learn lessons from it.  Deputy Boyd Barrett has said he will read the transcripts. He said he picked up a lot of evidence from conversations with a couple of workers. The more evidence we have as we carry out this review, the better.  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked whether there was a specific warning about WBS from certain engineers. I do not have any information in that regard. As far as I am aware that was not the case.  The Chairman mentioned the four schools affected in her constituency. I thank her for coming to Tullamore with Deputy Thomas Byrne for the briefing session. Communication goes both ways, and we learned from her visit as well.  Mr. Loftus will tell us who was the party responsible for signing off on the work but as far as I am concerned, the certification of compliance is the responsibility of the contractor on site and the designer on site. There is a role for the Department in certification of completion but it does not take consideration of certification of compliance at the moment. Mr. Loftus might be able to elaborate on that a little more.  The reason we do not have a cost for the remedial work is that time was not available to us even to plan out the works. I mentioned the three-school campus at Ashbourne, which required 3 km of fencing. Scaffolding was still being sourced on Sunday at one of the Cork schools. Remedial work is continuing at the school in Tyrrelstown to bring it up to the satisfaction of the board of management and to address safety issues there. As soon as we get that figure, I will ensure that it is presented publically. Insurance, culpability and accountability were mentioned. I am looking at all possible avenues which might redeem costs for the remedial work. It must also be noted that there is a big job ahead of us now, and we will have to do a comprehensive and complete assessment for the 42 schools in order that we can find the best solution, which will involve a tendering process. That process will cost money and the implementation of that solution will cost money but these school communities have been wronged and I will find out who wronged them. Whatever needs to be fixed I am prepared to fix it; I am making that my responsibility. I have been in the Department of Education and Skills for only a short while but the officials with whom I have worked closely in recent weeks on this issue are very attentive. Everything I needed and everything I have asked of them in terms of communication and the putting together of a team to find alternative accommodation at short notice has been done. The biggest response on this issue came from the community. The community response was enormous; it stood up to the challenge. Education and training boards, ETBs, different schools and different school patron bodies came forward with space and with solutions. The contractors also came forward with ideas. There were many solutions proposed. The 42 schools were able to open last Monday as a result. Tyrrelstown wanted to do its own robust analysis of the logistics to ensure that the bus transfers were okay and that there was adequate supervision when young children were dropped off at school. The response at a community, school and education sectoral level has been second to none. Universities offered space as well. I thank everyone involved in that regard.
