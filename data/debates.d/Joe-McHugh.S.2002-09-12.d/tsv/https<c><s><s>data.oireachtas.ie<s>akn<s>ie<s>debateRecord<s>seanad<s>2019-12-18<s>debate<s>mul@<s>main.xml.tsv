JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	It is nice to be back in the Seanad. This amendment relates to a new provision inserted in the Bill on Committee Stage. The new provision would require all schools to provide to both parents and the Department information relating to voluntary contributions inclusive of the total moneys collected annually and a detailed expenditure of those moneys by the school and would require my Department to publish all of this information on its website on an annual basis. During the Committee Stage debate, I outlined my concerns about this provision and indicated to the House that I would examine it in more detail, and would, if necessary, bring forward an amendment to address my concerns. In particular, I outlined that I needed to reflect carefully on the additional administrative burden that it would place on schools. This is a particularly important consideration for me. I had been clear that it is not my intention or the intention of this legislation to unnecessarily add to the administrative burden on schools. In the period since Committee Stage was completed, I carefully examined this provision and I have some concerns arising from that examination. Of particular concern is that this provision will undoubtedly lead to an additional and significant administrative burden for schools. It puts in place an entirely new and much more extensive financial reporting requirement on schools. This new requirement is in addition to what I have already provided for in the Bill in relation to schools providing information on voluntary contributions and how they are spent directly to students and to parents. The wording of this provision is also problematic. It refers in general terms to information on detailed expenditure being provided to parents and to the Department but it does not specify what information or level of detail must be provided. The provision is, therefore, unclear and is not consistent with the overall approach in the Bill, which involves the charter guidelines setting out clearly the specific information that is to be provided to students and parents. The guidelines will be developed following a consultative process with the education partners. This consultative process will help ensure the reporting requirements put in place under the charter guidelines are clear to all, the relevant information needed for transparency is made available, and the reporting requirements are straightforward and workable at school level. In addition, all schools must comply with their obligations under the charter guidelines and the Minister may issue a direction to any school that is not so complying, including where it is not complying with the requirement to provide information in relation to voluntary contributions. The inclusion in the Bill of another requirement outside of, and entirely separate from, the charter requirements for the provision of a further and potentially more detailed set of data to parents and the Department does not make sense. The publication of such data would also inevitably lead to the creation of a new type of league table - this time about school finances and levels of voluntary contributions. We all know that league tables that take account of only one aspect of a school's life are unfair, lacking in context and do not reflect the individual school's efforts, circumstances and challenges. Similar issues would arise in relation to the publication of data on voluntary contributions. Every school is different and has different fundraising requirements and priorities. At any given time, these may differ. Those requirements and priorities can also change over time within a particular school. Publishing data that allow for a comparison of schools based on moneys raised and spent in a given year without any consideration of context would be misleading for parents and unfair to the schools concerned. For example, such comparisons would not reflect the difference between a school that consistently seeks high contributions and a school that in a given year or for a short period is fundraising for a particular project or facility but typically does not seek or raise significant amounts from parents. It also would not distinguish between those schools that are clear to parents that all contributions are voluntary and those schools in which parents may perceive that there is an obligation to make a contribution even though it is voluntary. In this Bill, I am putting in place an obligation on schools to be transparent on voluntary contributions and to provide key information to parents on the moneys raised and how they have been spent. I am doing this in a structured and clear way as part of a school's obligation under its student and parent charter. I believe that the approach that I have taken in the Bill in this regard is clear, fair and balanced and will not be unduly burdensome for schools. I accept that the intentions of the Senator at all times on the issue were motivated by his own insights into this. I regret having to delete a provision previously voted in by the House but after taking the time since Committee Stage to examine this addition provision in detail, for the reasons I have outlined I propose to delete it from the Bill.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am trying to be consistent regarding the motivation behind the student and parent charter. In the early stages of our extensive consultation with education partners and schools on the charter, we were clear that it would not put an extra administrative burdens on schools. Senator Gavan suggested that it would only involve one email but it is not that simple. There is an administrative requirement. There are 4,000 schools in Ireland. The point made by the Senator on transparency is already embedded in the legislation. There are guidelines within the Bill to ensure that schools are obliged to make information on the moneys they raise and the subscriptions made available for public consumption. That would achieve the goals which the Senator claims are the motivation behind the amendment which was made on Committee Stage. The last thing I want to do is to put more of an administrative burden on schools and principals. A key term to which I was introduced at a very early stage in this job is "initiative overload". There will be an obligation under the student and parent charter for schools to publish information on any money raised and how it is spent. If there is a better mechanism to ensure that is done in a way that will allay the Senator's fears, I am open to continuing that conversation when the Bill returns to the DÃ¡il.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not wish to place an extra administrative burden on schools or principals. The Senator stated that transparency is the motivation behind his amendment. There is already provision in the Bill to ensure that each school is obliged to give a full account of money raised and how it is spent.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This amendment is in two parts.Part (a) provides that the Minister may allow for a review of the charter guidelines from time to time, as he or she considers appropriate and with the review of the charter guidelines to take place before the end of each relevant period. Part (b) provides for a definition of the relevant period, which is every five years starting from the date on which this section of the Bill comes into operation. On Committee Stage, Senator Gavan proposed an amendment to provide that the charter guidelines would be reviewed at least every five years. I could not accept the Senator's amendment as worded at that time, but I agreed to introduce an amendment to achieve the Senator's aim on Report Stage. The amendment I am now proposing still allows for the Minister to review the guidelines from time to time if he or she needs to, but it also ensures that they must be reviewed at least once in every five-year period starting from when the relevant section of the Bill is commenced, as Senator Gavan proposed. It is important that the Bill provides for a mandatory periodic review of the guidelines while also allowing the flexibility to review the guidelines at a shorter interval if a matter addressed in the guidelines needs to be updated or revised, or if an urgent or new issue emerges in schools that could be addressed in the charter guidelines. I thank the Senator for identifying this need on Committee Stage and I am pleased to be able to bring forward the amendment to address it now. I hope both the Senator and this House can support this amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On Committee Stage, Senator Craughwell tabled an amendment which proposed to make explicit reference to teachers in section 27C(c), in order to make clear that the provision was referring to mutual respect and communication between teachers, students and parents. While I could not accept the amendment as worded on Committee Stage, I outlined at the time that I was open to making such a provision and my officials have since engaged on the matter with legislative drafters. As a result, I am pleased to bring forward this amendment, which ensures that section 27C will now make explicit reference to teachers. The provision, when amended, will refer to "mutual respect in communications between the school, including teachers or other staff of the school, on the one hand and students or their parents on the other hand". The majority of day-to-day communications in a school are between teachers or other school staff and students or their parents, and I am happy to make explicit reference to this in the Bill. It is appropriate that the amendment refers to other staff in the school. Everyone in this House will agree with me about each individual's role and contribution to school life. I have taken the opportunity to ensure this explicit reference to teachers and other staff also applies in subsection (d), which concerns confidentiality in communications between schools and students and their parents. I thank the Senator for raising this issue on Committee Stage and I hope he and the House can support my amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Craughwell raised this matter in a Committee Stage amendment and it is something about which we have thought. When there is communication between students and a school, or parents and a school, that includes the whole school body. School bodies are made up of teachers, caretakers, SNAs, special education teachers and secretaries. At the heart of every school is the acknowledgement of all those who play a significant role. We are all on the same page regarding the value of teachers, and this amendment is just about including that in the Bill. I was happy to accept the Senator's point. It is not making a distinction between anyone or singling anybody out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Amendment No. 4 would require the grievance procedures under the charter guidelines to include an explanation of the role of the Ombudsman for Children under the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 as it relates to complaints against schools. On Committee Stage I advised the House that while I did not think it was necessary for the Bill to provide the grievance procedures set out the role of the Ombudsman for Children, I would have my officials consider this issue further with a view to bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage if required. Having examined this proposal further, I am satisfied that including this in the Bill is not the appropriate way to achieve the Senator's goal. As the Senator is aware, the role of the Ombudsman for Children is set out very comprehensively in the 2002 Act. I acknowledge that the Senator has adjusted this amendment to refer to the role of the Ombudsman for Children insofar as it relates to complaints against schools. However, there are many provisions in the Act which governs the ombudsman's remit regarding complaints against schools.It is not appropriate, nor would it be possible, to summarise in this Bill or in school grievance procedures this extensive legislation or to attempt to summarise the various conditions and provisions that apply to the role of the Ombudsman for Children under the 2002 Act insofar as it relates to schools. Doing so in this Bill risks casting doubt on or limiting the statutory role of the Ombudsman for Children under its own legislation. For the same reasons, it would also not be appropriate to require schools to provide an explanation to students or parents of the role of the Ombudsman for Children. The appropriate body to do this is the office itself. I will, however, make it a requirement under the charter guidelines that the grievance procedures would require that schools must always inform students or parents of the fact that they may be able to make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children. I also intend that schools would be required to provide students and parents with contact or website details of the Ombudsman for Children in order that they can make their own contact with the office to determine independently whether a complaint can be made. I strongly agree with the Senator that this is very important information for students and parents and I will ensure this requirement will be included in the guidelines on the grievance procedures. However, for the reasons I have outlined, the approach to setting this out in primary legislation is not appropriate and it may cast doubt on or potentially limit the remit of the Ombudsman for Children with respect to schools. On Committee Stage I advised the Senator that I needed more time to consider what is now amendment No. 6. Since Committee Stage, my Department has undertaken significant further analysis of the matter and engaged with the Ombudsman for Children, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General. With this matter I am endeavouring to balance factors such as the valid issues raised by the Senator, the current legal framework under which the Ombudsman for Children operates, the autonomy of schools and a general desirability that grievance procedures at school level would be followed before the Ombudsman for Children would become involved in a complaint. These are complex and interrelated matters and great care is required to ensure we get the balance right. I agree it may be appropriate for the Ombudsman for Children to intervene in some limited cases, such as where a school is deliberately delaying or frustrating local grievance procedures, but I must also balance that against a need to ensure the matters should be resolved at local school level where possible. That is the best and most satisfactory approach for both students, parents and the schools involved. It is better for all concerned if, in the first instance, the school considers and deals with the grievance at local school level, even where the outcome is not to the satisfaction of the complainant. This gives all parties the opportunity to present the position and come to an understanding of the perspective and position of the other parties. I also do not want to create a position where students and parents may be confused about any perceived overlap between the local school grievance procedures and the Ombudsman for Children complaints procedure. I am therefore not fully persuaded at this time that deleting section 9(2) entirely would be an appropriate step. I am exploring, however, whether an approach that instead sets some limits on section 9(2) or qualifies it in some way would be more appropriate. The aim would be to ensure that for the majority of cases, the local complaints procedures would have to be exhausted, but it must also cater for those exceptional cases where awaiting exhaustion of the local process would not be appropriate. There are complex legal and practical considerations that require further work before I will be in a position to decide the best way to do this. I acknowledge the Senator's efforts in communicating with the Department and putting forward her views on the matter. I assure her I will continue this work with a view to bringing forward an appropriate amendment on this matter once the various legal and other issues are teased out. I cannot accept the amendment but I assure the Senator that we will continue to work on this matter with a view to resolving the complex issues involved.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This amendment arises from the amendment proposed by Senator Gavan on Committee Stage that provided for a school to give reasons where it decides not to deal with a grievance on the basis that the grievance is vexatious or frivolous. During the debate I advised the Senator I was happy that the Bill provided for this already but I would consider making an explicit provision in the Bill. Having further considered the matter with legislative drafters, I am pleased to bring forward this amendment to make an explicit provision in the Bill that requires the grievance procedures to provide that where a school decides not to deal with a grievance on the basis of it being vexatious or frivolous, it must give the reasons to the student or parent for the decision. I thank the Senator for raising the matter on Committee Stage and I hope the Senator and the House can support my amendment today.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Members for the discussions in here and conversations. Certainly, we all come from different backgrounds, but as always in the Seanad, people's convictions are as consistent as ever, which I always respect. Where I cannot meet people halfway, I try to go as far as I can. The amendments that I brought in here today arising from Committee Stage stem from the different suggestions that were made in this House. The purpose of this Bill is to give young people and parents a voice, and it is particularly focused on the youth voice. Anybody involved in politics globally at this stage knows that the youth voice is getting louder and stronger, so it is a case of what we do to facilitate that voice. I hope that this Bill will act as a mechanism to meet that demand coming from young people. Any of the challenges, such as the last one raised by the Senator in terms of technology in classrooms, at the heart of those challenges have to be young people because they are people who were born after the Internet came into existence. I think the sociological label for young people is digital natives. Some of us in this House were born at a time when there was not even a landline. I am assuming that the Leas-Chathaoirleach and I are in the same boat.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have to allow young people the space and time to make judgment calls. I think we will do that because we have a confident young generation who want to make changes, whether it is in the area of the climate challenge or other areas of difficulties in society. I wish to acknowledge Joshua Lavery from Portadown who is seated in the Gallery. He is doing work practice today and I am working him really hard. It is good to see somebody of Joshua's generation in the House during our discussion of this Bill.
