JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Figary Water Sports Development Company Limited is a private company in Donegal involved in the development of a marina in Fahan, north Donegal since 1998. Some â‚¬4 million of its money has been invested to date. Since 1998 it has lobbied for Government assistance or cross-Border funding. Two issues are outstanding and I believe solutions can be found through departmental intervention. These issues involve a bond and rental payment prior to 1998. Efforts should be made to contact the Department to resolve this because the project is ideal. While various projects in Donegal are awaiting funding, this one is proactive, community-based and involves yachts and sailing clubs. There is great potential for the economic and social infrastructure of Donegal. I ask for the Leader's intervention on this issue with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
