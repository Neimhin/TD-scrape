JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are in public session. Apologies have been received from Deputy John Brady. I propose that we go into private session to deal with housekeeping matters.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, and his officials to the meeting today. Following events surrounding the Northern Ireland protocol, the committee welcomes the opportunity to engage and ask questions about the sequence of events that ultimately led to the European Commission triggering Article 16 before it made a U-turn on that decision. As members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, we feel we have a twofold responsibility in this regard: first, to ask questions at a Government level as to what happened and how it happened and, second, we must have accountability at a Commission level. We want to ensure what happened does not happen again and that we can have public trust and confidence in the protocol's procedure in the future. We look forward to the engagement today. The Minister of State will get a feeling and a sense from the members as to where they are on this issue. Last week, however, there was a certain anxiety and obvious desire to deal with this issue. We appreciate the Minister of State being with us today. Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I also remind members that they are only allowed to participate in this meeting if they are physically located on the Leinster House complex. In this regard, I ask that all members confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting. For anyone watching this meeting online, Oireachtas Members and witnesses are accessing this meeting remotely. Only the Chairman and the necessary staff essential to the running of the meeting are physically present in the committee room. Due to these unprecedented circumstances and the large number of people attending the meeting remotely, I ask that everyone bear with us should any technical issues arise. I now call the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat Aire Stáit Byrne. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit as a theachtaireacht agus a óráid.Deputy Calleary will be first to contribute.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. If it is agreeable to the Minister of State, to do justice to the range of questions the members have, I will take them on an individual basis. I therefore ask for his indulgence in relation to replying specifically to the questions. That will potentially allow for members to come in a second time as well. The Minister of State may now reply and Deputy Howlin will follow.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State. The maths in terms of timing are not good.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If we keep going with the current strategy some members will not get in. With the agreement of members, we will try something different. I have no doubt Deputy Howlin has a number of questions. I suggest he engage in a questions and answers session with the Minister of State as that might lend itself to the answers being more direct.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Due to the efficiency of the Minister of State in his answering, we can facilitate a second round of questions, but does Deputy Ó Murchú wish to come in with a supplementary question before I open the meeting up to the floor again?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for taking the time to appear before the committee today. I have no doubt he will get a sense from this meeting that this conversation will not finish today. There is an appetite among committee members to ensure we get accountability and transparency. I believe that no single person made a decision of such magnitude and impact. My belief is that a group of individuals came together and that people in the Commission know their identity. For us to have confidence in the Commission into the future, it is imperative that we find out who made this decision of such magnitude because it had consequences. For every action there is a reaction. We only have to think of the time, effort and diligence invested in this by officials in the Commission such as Michel Barnier and his team and the individual countries throughout the European Union which knew of the sensitivity of the Northern Ireland peace process and went out of their way to send ambassadors here. I met the Danish and the Dutch ambassadors in my county. Many other ambassadors went to County Louth and different parts of the Border region over the past four and half years to get a sense of the situation. Individual countries of the European Union understand the importance of the peace process and protecting it. However, this decision, which was made very quickly by a group of individuals on a Friday evening, had drastic consequences that could have had a deeper impact on Northern Ireland. It was a very serious decision. It is very important that we as a nation have confidence in the European Union and have a Commission that is accountable. It cannot be a powerful entity where individuals can be protected. The message in that regard is strong. The Minister of State need not address that again as he covered it to the best of his knowledge. The Minister of State may not have an answer to this specific question. What assurances can he give that the protocols around strict veterinary distribution practices employed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are replicated in Northern Ireland? I have a concern that protocols similar to the very strict regime we have in place, through the Department, for ensuring traceability and quality of produce are not replicated in Northern Ireland. The Minister of State might ask his officials to follow up on that and revert directly to my officials in this committee. I thank members.Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas agus mo bhuíochas a ghabháil chuig an Aire Stáit fá choinne na díospóireachta inniu. B'fhéidir go mbeidh cúpla focal sa bhreis aige.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Aontaím leis an Aire Stáit. Leanfaimid i dteagmháil amach anseo agus b’fhéidir go mbeidh seans againn an tseachtain seo chugainn sa díospóireacht le Leas-Uachtarán an Choimisiúin, Maroš Šefčovič. B'fhéidir go mbeidh níos mó freagraí ar fáil ansin. I thank members of the committee.
