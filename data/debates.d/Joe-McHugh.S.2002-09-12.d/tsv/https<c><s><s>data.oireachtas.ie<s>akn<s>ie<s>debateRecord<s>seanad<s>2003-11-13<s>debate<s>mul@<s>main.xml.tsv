JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are positive aspects in terms of better local government, but also many shortcomings, such as in planning, which both sides of the House raise as a very important urban and rural issue. Planning at local authority level is under-resourced and under pressure at the moment. We had a public announcement by the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party after the Ard Fheis, at which the Cathaoirleach was present—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	—about addressing planning. Another of the party's Ministers, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, got 20 minutes on the "Six One News". Bryan Dobson travelled to Galway to talk about how they were going to address the problems in planning, especially in rural areas. However, I am bemused by the recent stealth tax announced by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, as in a rural area, for a 2,000 square foot house, there will be a stealth tax of €13,000. How is that going to ease the pressures of planning? We need the Minister here because between now and the March deadline for these development charges, we will have a glut of planning applications being submitted to all local authorities which do not have the resources to deal with them.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ordinary people in rural and urban areas will be waiting up to a year and a half to get their planning through.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are restricting, not encouraging planning, which is completely against the Taoiseach's announcement.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of information, I am still a member of the local authority.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It now takes two years to get planning permission.
