JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In 1990 it took about 25 minutes to get from Ashbourne to Dublin city centre. In 2003 the journey takes one hour and ten minutes on average. On top of this—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will let the people of Ashbourne know that Fianna Fáil find this a laughing matter. Some 20,000 people pass through the town daily. All we want are bus lanes – two bus lanes on a boreen from Dublin to Ashbourne – and a long-term plan for a bypass.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I raise the issue of dyslexia, although not on behalf of any organisation. As the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, is aware, the Dyslexia Association of Ireland is a voluntary organisation which relies very much on subscriptions and voluntary inputs from teachers. It has done tremendous work. With its workers, volunteers and all those involved, it would like to see the recommendations made in the 1998 report submitted to the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, and published in 2001, implemented. That is the reason I raise the issue.Service provision and mainstream funding are needed. For example, the group in Letterkenny, County Donegal, has relied on local authority funding. It received €10,000 in development funding last year from local authority subscriptions as an acknowledgement of the work it was doing. This is a major issue and funding, whether for psychologists or otherwise, is required to identify the needs of young people who suffer from dyslexia. I know the group refers to those who suffer from dyslexia but perhaps "suffer" is the wrong word. It is politically incorrect to use the word "suffer" in that the people concerned do not suffer; they just have a different way of looking at things. I bring this issue to the Minister of State's attention.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for her reply. Will she or her officials consider inspecting the good work taking place in the out-of-school workshops in Donegal, which are helping young people with dyslexia in a voluntary capacity? There is no funding for the teachers or the buildings.
