JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the committee.  In his contribution, the Minister of State said the Government is committed to maintaining a strong regional input into the management of inland fisheries.  I welcome that statement, but unfortunately it is completely disingenuous.  It is an untruth and it certainly does not grapple with my sense of reality in terms of how regional fisheries should operate.  I say this in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, within which there is a commitment to promote and work towards an integrated marine strategy.  We are looking at a new mechanism in terms of how we monitor our inland fisheries and there is no mention whatsoever of the Good Friday Agreement, under which we have a responsibility to work with our colleagues north of the Border.The Minister of State may argue that there is a Loughs Agency which is accountable to Dublin and Stormont, and that is correct.  It exercises a statutory remit across Lough Foyle.  From a practical level, tributary rivers flow into Donegal and bailiffs and officials from the Loughs Agency come into the county and work alongside bailiffs and officials from the northern regional fisheries board.  There is a duplication in terms of the practicalities of working in the two jurisdictions.  I suggest we contact the Loughs Agency and our colleagues north of the Border because we have a written legal, democratic obligation to the terms of the Good Friday Agreement which calls for an integrated marine strategy for those working in inland fisheries in Donegal, Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh.We must heed the needs and frustrations of two bureaucracies, possibly three — there is an accountability to Dublin, Stormont and London — by introducing practical measures.  We have enough problems here with red tape in every Department without having more.  There is an opportunity to do this.  Those in the Loughs Agency are practical and pragmatic, and they want less red tape in going about their work.  I suggest the Minister of State heed the Good Friday Agreement because it contains practical suggestions.  If we continue to work the Dublin-centric mindset towards Border areas we will not find practical solutions that would help people on both sides of the Border.  The Minister of State is from Kildare but he is not completely Kildare-centric and, having travelled the world, he has an open mind to these issues.  During his term of office I ask him to focus on this area.  He should not be political in this regard.  The sense of urgency with which the Minister of State's party, Fianna Fáil, tried to amalgamate with the SDLP does nothing for the harmonisation of good relationships North and South.
