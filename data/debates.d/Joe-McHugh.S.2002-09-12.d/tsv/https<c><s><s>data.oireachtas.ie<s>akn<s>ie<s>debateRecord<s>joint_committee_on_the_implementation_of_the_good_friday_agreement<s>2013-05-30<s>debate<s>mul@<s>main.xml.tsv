JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As we have a quorum we will commence in public session. Apologies have been received from Deputies Regina Doherty, Seán Crowe, and Joe O'Reilly. I remind members of the usual drill regarding mobile telephones. I ask that they switch them off or put them on silent mode. We will have a discussion with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, to explore education as a tool for empowerment and overcoming social disconnection. In layman or laywoman terms, that means we will have a good conversation about education and how we can learn and share experiences in terms of tackling disadvantage. The Minister will give account initially and then I will open up the discussion to the members.  The Minister is very welcome. It is his first time to attend before this committee. We appreciate him coming here and giving of his time. We hope to have a good engaging conversation this morning. His presence here today has garnered considerable interest in this discussion. I appreciate the attendance of members from different organisations and individuals in the Visitors Gallery who have come here today.  I will throw out a statistic that would be in the back of everybody's mind, namely, that of all the students who go to university in the Republic, only 0.5% are from Northern Ireland. That 0.5% statistic from 2008 has been a recurring one. There are issues around mobility, mobility challenges and mobility opportunities into which we will hopefully delve today. I invite the Member to make his presentation and I will then open the discussion up to members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister. I will now take questions and observations from members. I call Deputy Kitt.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If the Minister does not mind, I will take two speakers at a time. I acknowledge this involves taking multiple questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As the Senator said, the precedent has not been set.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious of the time and the Minister has to attend the House for a vote, so we really have to go. May I ask the Minister and his officials to formally respond to the three contributors?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps the Minister could respond specifically to the pre-school question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The division bells have stopped, so we have to go. I wish to thank the Minister very much. We will seek a follow-up engagement, but we appreciate him being here this morning.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Paul Hannigan, president of the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Mr. Dennis Cummins, president of the Dundalk Institute of Technology, and Mr. James Brennan, head of life sciences from Sligo Institute of Technology. Professor Terri Scott, president of Sligo Institute of Technology, is unfortunately unable to join us today. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I invite Mr. Paul Hannigan to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Cummins. Does Mr. Brennan wish to speak or will I open it up to the members?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take questions and observations from members and the witnesses can decide who will respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. James Brennan has something to add.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegates for their contribution. They have made a suggestion to the committee. Before we consider the ways we would follow up on it, may I ask the witnesses if they are getting a reciprocal buy-in from their colleagues north of the Border? Do the representatives from colleges in the North think in the same way as they do? If they do, should they not be part of the proposal for a North-South higher education working group? Is there work going on behind the scenes? I am trying to tease this out as to how we as a committee can develop this proposal with a buy-in from universities north of the Border.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I know that plenty of school pupils in County Donegal fill out UCAS forms. I remember filling out an UCAS form for Jordanstown and perhaps Mr. Pat Doherty will comment on this point.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	May I suggest, subject to the agreement of members, that the committee formally brings this proposal to the attention of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who was present this morning so he will be interested in the follow up meeting that the delegates are attending? We can ask the Minister to contact both Mr. Stephen Farry and Mr. John O'Dowd in relation to the delegates' proposals. Let us start the conversation because if one looks at what is happening on a cross-Border basis in regard to health, between Altnagelvin and Letterkenny hospitals and also the Belfast and Dublin hospitals in relation to paediatric and cardiology services, there is an awful lot of pragmatic practical engagement going on at a health level and there is no reason it cannot happen at an education level. Subject to the agreement of committee members we will write to the Minister for Education and Skills, bringing this issue to his attention and he can communicate directly with both Ministers in Northern Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Tralee is a kind of a border - - - -
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are starting the conversation. I think Mr. Paul Hannigan rightly pointed out there is a HEA and other reports with references to cross-Border provisions. It is up to us to work on the issues. This is not set in stone and we can drive it and work on this together.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will circulate that to members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank our guests for attending. The joint committee will now go into private session.
