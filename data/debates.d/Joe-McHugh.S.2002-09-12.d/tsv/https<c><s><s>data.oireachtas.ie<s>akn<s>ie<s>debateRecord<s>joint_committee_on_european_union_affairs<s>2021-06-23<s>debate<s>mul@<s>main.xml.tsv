JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Calleary and Senator Martin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur romhat go dtí an gcruinniú. On behalf of the committee, I welcome to the meeting the members of the House of Lords Sub-Committee on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland. I welcome Lord Jay of Ewelme, Lord Caine, Baroness Goudie, Lord Hain, Baroness O'Loan and Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick. Without putting too much pressure on the sub-committee, Lord Jay has a formidable team. I know to be careful with the word "experience" because it can be mistaken for referring to one's age, but there is experience and wisdom among the members of that team. I have worked closely with a number of them in different chapters of my own political career. We are looking forward to their contributions and engagement. This meeting is timely. I do not want to use jargon like "impasse" to describe where we are at but we have a challenge. It is through continued engagement, an opportunity for which we have today, when people are talking and communicating that problems are solved. We are grateful for our guests' attendance today and look forward to their engagement. Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any members who attempt to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.  I thank members for their patience and call on Lord Jay of Ewelme to make his opening statement. 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Jay. I will start the ball rolling with a quick question, which he can pass on to one of his colleagues. He emphasised the importance of strengthening interparliamentary dialogue between the Oireachtas and Westminster. In appreciating the formal mechanisms that are open to us, we all know what is happening with the North South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and that formal mechanism has not been available to us over the last couple of months. Is there an opportunity to do more work on an informal basis, in terms of engagement, whether that is on an east-west or a North-South basis? Lord Jay may wish to pass that question on to one of his members. I am conscious of the role that Lord Hain played when he was Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body, as it was then. While that was a formal mechanism, I think the best work was carried out during the informal sessions, if Lord Jay understands what I mean.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will come back to Baroness O'Loan in the next round. I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive answers and insight. I call Deputy Ó Murchú, followed by Deputy Haughey. We will take the members individually and Lord Jay of Ewelme can decide how many people should reply.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will hand over to Lord Jay of Ewelme. There are three questions, one on animal medicine, one on potential unilateral action and one on legacy issues.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I have to come back in. There are other members. Deputy Ó Murchú is the first to contribute. We will try to get them in at the end. We will have to be fair to everybody. If Lord Jay has somebody left in this round, we can bring them in in the next round. This time I will bring in Deputies Haughey and Howlin and that will offer a broader range for Lord Jay to signpost to his colleagues.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. Senator Chambers requested that I ask a specific question on her behalf, which is whether our guests are concerned about political instability in Northern Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is interesting to hear that a man with a young child in the house has time to butter and eat toast in the morning. I do not know where he finds the time. I will pass the questions over to Lord Jay and his team. After this round of answers, his colleagues might want to return serve in our direction. We will be happy to answer as best we can.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Jay and his colleagues also. Perhaps we may go back now to Lord Jay if he has any questions. I know that we have Deputies Ó Murchú, Howlin and Haughey on standby to answer any of the questions that they may wish to pose. Perhaps we will take just two questions at a time if that is okay with our guests in the half hour that we have remaining to us.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Jay, Baroness Ritchie and Baroness O'Loan. The first question from Baroness Ritchie concerns the overall EU mood and the second one is where Baroness O'Loan has asked about the opportunities for Ireland and Northern Ireland. I will ask Deputy Ó Murchú to answer now as he indicated first but we will take all contributions if people wish to address different aspects of these questions. We will start with Deputy Ó Murchú followed by Deputies Haughey, Howlin and Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are two very specific questions here. One is on the overall EU mood and the second is on the opportunities for Northern Ireland. Before I bring in Deputy Haughey, my own view on what Baroness Ritchie has said is that I assume and hope at this stage that the EU, the European Commission and that the people who triggered Article 16 understand at this stage that that was a monumental mistake. I call Deputy Haughey now to deal with those two questions, please. We will try then to get some more questions from some of Lord Jay's other colleagues.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will hand it back to the visitors. There is still time for another round of questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies for that. I said Northern Ireland and Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We can take Lord Jay up on his proposal to meet again in the autumn. Baroness Goudie said the same. It would be timely in the aftermath of the sub-committee publishing its report. We could do that. I agree with Lord Jay that today's meeting was one of intent. It was constructive but it was also heartening. Lord Hain emphasised trust, Baroness O'Loan emphasised respect, and Baroness Ritchie spoke about dialling down the rhetoric, which is a sophisticated way of saying "calm down". From our own personal journeys in life, we all know what the limitations of telling people to calm down are. Baroness Goudie emphasised the potential of a mediator while Lord Hain spoke about honest brokers. I will not open up the debate about where that goes but memories of George Mitchell come to mind in respect of that. With respect to formal and informal, Baroness Ritchie gave us a semi-formal invite to Downpatrick. We always talk in terms of London and Dublin. Perhaps it would be nice to have something formal in Downpatrick and we could do something informal the next day in Donegal across the Border to reach out. It would be an opportunity for both committees to meet up in Northern Ireland. I will leave the witnesses with an old Irish saying, "Má theastaíonn uait aithne a chur orainn, mair inár dteannta", which means if you want to get to know us, live with us. What I am taking from this meeting is that the reason people were not meeting was not all down to Covid. Over the past ten years, what we could call a vacuum has been created. We must get back to basics. I remember joining 12 of my colleagues in Stormont. We met Peter Robinson and the late Martin McGuinness. Peter Robinson started his speech by saying it was about building relationships. He then stopped and said, "No, delete that. The relationships are already there. It's what we do with these relationships that is important." Perhaps we need to look at the language we use. As a Donegal man who lives in Ulster, one thing I know about Ulster is that when you tell somebody what to do, it does not really work out. It has not worked out and never will work out so perhaps we need to ask the questions differently and ask what we can do to help out. I know the sub-committee's experience and wisdom as a committee, and it is great to have all of its members online. They have such great experience, knowledge and insight and we could do good work collectively. Once again, I thank our witnesses and members of our committee. We will take the sub-committee up on its invitation and try to keep the engagement going. It is to be hoped we can meet up in the autumn. I wish Lord Jay well along with Charles Kinnell and the work he is doing. We are very grateful for this engagement today.
