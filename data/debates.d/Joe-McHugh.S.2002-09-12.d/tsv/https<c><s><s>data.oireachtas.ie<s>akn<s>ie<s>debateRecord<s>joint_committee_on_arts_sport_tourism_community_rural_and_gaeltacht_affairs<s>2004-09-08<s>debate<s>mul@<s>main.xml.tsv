JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is so much this morning to take in. It is a great opportunity to see the diverse works and different groups involved in the voluntary sector. Mr. Doorley spoke about trying to get volunteers into the youth sector. A common theme is that there is less time on people's hands and I know that is a factor in a complex situation. One of the issues that needs to be explored is apathy among young people from 12 to 30 years of age. Apathy is a sickness in society that we have to face and is a sickness that will discourage people from getting involved. In fact, it is difficult for young people to participate in sports and other activities, not to mind becoming leaders. There is a challenge in combating apathy in voluntarism.I was interested by Mr. O'Shea's comment that recruitment to GOAL has gone from 100% Irish to 40% Irish. Young people need direction and there are people who would be interested in such work. More attempts should be made to connect with them. My only familiarity with GOAL is through television and other media. I know that Mr. O'Shea cannot get to them all personally, but his 20 minute contribution here was inspiring, was full of enthusiasm, ideals and anger. Young people can identify with that anger and enthusiasm. If there was more of a connection made with young people, through primary, secondary and third level institutions, possibly through the media, the sense of apathy can be turned around and people might feel they have a purpose. In addition, Mr. O'Shea's direction, influence and hands on contribution could inspire young people. Young people are easily led and they can be inspired. Positive contributions such as that of Mr. O'Shea can help.This has been a positive meeting. I am sorry I cannot deal with all of the contributions but the work of all the organisations, from the ICA to the GAA and otherwise, is worthwhile. Volunteering is in the Irish psyche and, although there are complex challenges, I do not think it is in trouble.I am sceptical about creating a centre for voluntarism because each group is unique and will find its own way. To have a centre would be to create another bureaucratic structure, which should not be the way forward. We are doing fine. While there are challenges for the future, we do not need another layer of bureaucracy.
