JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Labour Party on putting down the motion on emigration last night. I did not get a chance to speak because time did not permit but I thank the Leader for adding to the debate, which was very constructive. I wish to put the role of ICAP, the Immigration Counselling and Psychotherapy in the UK, on the record. It is a relatively new body and I acknowledge the Government's role in bringing it in to frame policy. It deals with the mental health of the Irish community abroad and employs 200 clinical psychologists but they do not work on a voluntary basis and the organisation needs funding. The task force recommended the organisation receive ongoing funding. It has an office in London and is opening an office in the next few weeks——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have a question. In light of the office in London and the organisation's plans to open offices in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In light of that organisation's plans and forward thinking we need an ongoing debate on emigration. I will raise this issue on the Adjournment. If 30% of this body's resources and energy are spent on fund-raising in Ireland, we need the task force document to be implemented. We need more money for this area. The Minister has a role in this area and so do we.
