JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim m'aitheantas chuig an Bhille um Theanga Chomharthaíochta na hÉireann do na Bodhair a Aithint 2016. Gabhaim m'aitheantas agus mo chomhghairdeas leis an Seanadóir Mark Daly agus le mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Neamhspleách, Finian McGrath, faoi choinne a gcomhoibriú. Níl muidne ag troid sa Teach seo achan lá. Is lá stairiúil é seo. Aontaím le tuairim an Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim aitheantas do na daoine atá ag obair ar an aistriúchán inniu. Cuirim fáilte roimh na daoine uilig. Mar fhocal pearsanta, trí bliana ó shin ní raibh mé ábalta labhairt leo siúd a bhí ag labhairt Gaeilge i mo pharóiste féin. Ní raibh mé ábalta. Tuigim cé chomh tábhachtach atá sé daoine a bheith ábalta labhairt tríd a dteanga féin. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach. Arís, is lá stairiúil é. Déanaim comhghairdeas agus gabhaim buíochas le achan duine as a bheith ag obair le chéile ar son na ndaoine sa Ghailearaí Phoiblí, taobh amuigh agus timpeall na tíre.
