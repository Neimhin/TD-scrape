JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When is it envisaged to bring the maritime safety provisions Bill to the House, in light of the indecision and recent Government policy on decentralising from major rural outposts in Valentia and Malin Head to large urban centres?  I raise this in light of growing concerns at these centres that as a result of the vacuum being created, there is no plan to upgrade these stations.  While there is no plan to upgrade information communication technologies at these stations, lives are being put at risk.  These concerns need to be addressed.Will the Taoiseach say whether this Bill can be expedited in light of these concerns and in view of the fact that lives at sea are put at risk?  The Government may be at sea on this issue, but certainly the feeling in Valentia and Malin Head is that they want to continue at these locations.
