JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take both contributions in good faith. There was an agreement but at the last minute there was an issue with the planning Bill. There will be a stand alone Bill because of the planning permissions that will need to be completed before the end of the summer. I accept there is good faith and trust within the Business Committee but this was something beyond our control.
