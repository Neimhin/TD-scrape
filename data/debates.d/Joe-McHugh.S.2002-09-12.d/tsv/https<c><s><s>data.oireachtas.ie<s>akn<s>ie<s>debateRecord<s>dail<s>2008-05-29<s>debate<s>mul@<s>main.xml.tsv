JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I raised the issue of No. 92, the public transport regulation Bill, yesterday.  I do not think the Minister for Transport was here at the time.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs interjected yesterday during my contribution.  I am seeking clarification.  The Minister maintained he would be prepared to set up an inquiry for expanding rail into the north west.  Was this a facetious comment?  If it was genuine, is this new policy that the Government intends pursuing?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister.  He is two weeks shy of completing his first year in the job and many questions and grey areas remain regarding broadband provision.  The public is looking for a clear policy direction.  The forum on broadband met last February.  Since then Deputy Coveney, the Fine Gael spokesperson in this area, has repeatedly asked when the forum will report and engage in consultation.  The Minister said this will happen soon.  When will the consultation process happen?  His reference to an on-line consultation is ironic.  Will a facility be provided for those who do not have access to computers or broadband to contribute to the debate, given many rural areas do not have access to broadband?An issue arose earlier regarding the Taoiseach's comment that the national development plan is under review.  Will the investment the Minister plans in ICT in schools proceed?  There is complete confusion about this, as highlighted by my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, earlier.  Will the Minister shed some light on that?Have industry representative groups been consulted?  If not, when will that happen?  The Minister said a report would be published soon but he still has not specified when.  It is important that the industry representative groups, which are key contributors to the broadband debate, be included.  When he was in Opposition, the Minister was a strong advocate of the importance of NGN.  I do not intend this as a political slight but his energies have been very much employed in the green sector and the broadband debate has been consigned to the position of bridesmaid within his portfolio.  It is evident our position on NGN, next generation networking, is weak in a EU context.  Will he take responsibility for this area?  He has been in the position for almost a year but, as of yet, he has provided little direction.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Minister answer the questions?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be brief this time and give the Minister some time to answer my question.  I came into this job working from the basic premise of thinking globally and acting locally.  The Government has gone completely askew.  It is blaming global matters and doing nothing locally.Everybody knows that diesel is €1.40 per litre.  The Minister is trying to get people to use environmentally friendly fuels but it has completely backfired.  There is a danger that people might start buying petrol cars.  There are no incentives for hauliers who have bought environmentally friendly lorries in terms of reduced motor tax for complying with environmentally friendly regulations.In respect of doing something locally and not blaming global matters, the Minister mentioned countries from the UK to China to the US.  In terms of something local, we on this side of the House launched a proposal to reduce the VAT rate from 13.5% to 12.5%, which would affect goods like coal, gas and electricity products.  What is the Minister's position in respect of this proposal?  Will he consider bringing it to Cabinet because it will directly affect the matter referred to by Deputy McManus, namely, heating oil for people?  We are talking about a figure of approximately €300 million that is going directly as a windfall tax to the electricity producers, which could go directly to the consumer.  What is the Minister's position on this and will he consider the Fine Gael proposal launched yesterday?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is the proposal.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	With all due respect, we have had ten years of wealth in this country which we have not redistributed into the area about which the Minister is talking.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The consumer can benefit directly rather than having a windfall for the producers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The long-term solution could have been found ten years ago.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Apart from aspirations, what are the Minister's alternatives?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about the loss to this sector during the ten years when we had wealth, which was wasted and squandered by the Government of the day?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, announced the introduction of  bio-fuels schemes in 2007 at which time he promised there would be a period of consultation to be followed by the introduction of legislation.  It is now mid-2008 and as of yet consultation has not taken place.  Furthermore, we are still completely in the dark about the proposed legislation.  Will the Minister clarify if at this late date there will be a consultation period and, more important, will legislation on this area be introduced shortly?Some 16 companies in this sector have been granted permits for excise duty.  Does the Minister consider that figure of 16 companies is adequate or should the number of such permits granted be increased to stimulate the bio-fuels industry?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Having regard to all the proposals the Minister mentioned, in terms of the windfall tax that will be substantially gained by the electricity producers up to 2012 in regard to carbon tax exemption, is he prepared to take back that levy and windfall gain and discuss with those involved what he is seeking to realise within a more sustainable and environmentally friendly society?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Minister consider taking it back?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Minister take it back?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is the Minister looking at it or considering it?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am disappointed that the Minister will not use his influence to change the policy.  I accept that ComReg may fear a legal challenge.  Nevertheless, the Minister is the man in charge.  We are talking about a potential 20% reduction in charges to the retailer.  The Minister has a responsibility to act on this matter, rather than wait for the EU to take action.The Minister referred to roaming charges.  Without crossing the political border, a mobile telephone user can incur roaming charges.  If one drives between Greencastle and Muff in east Inishowen, one will receive a text message welcoming one to the United Kingdom.  Some years ago, the O2 network introduced a zero roaming charge for the whole of Ireland.  However, this only applies to users going from one O2  network to another.  Customers who, when near the Border, do not re-set their telephones to O2  find themselves in the Orange or Vodafone network and liable to roaming charges.  Does the Minister have plans to get rid of roaming charges for cross-Border users if we are to comply with the legal requirements of the Good Friday Agreement?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Can the Minister convince this side of the House that he will not be subject to the diktat from the Taoiseach that there will be a pull-back in some national development plan projects?  As Deputy McManus said, the Minister described in panoramic terms the roll-out of next generation broadband.  Will he be curtailed in his spending by this new directive on a reduction in expenditure on the national development programme?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No pull back.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Food imports and exports are completely reliant on the haulage industry.  Excluding excise duties, there has been a 360% increase in fuel prices over the past five years.  Fishermen say that 70% of their turnover is being spent on diesel for their boats, while the corresponding figure for the haulage industry is 50%.  Many haulage operators have bought new lorries that are economically efficient and are adding blue liquid solutions to be environmentally compliant.  Does the Minister think there is an opportunity to incentivise the haulage industry in some way, perhaps by discounting motor tax?  In his response, the Minister will say that we must look at the long-term position but, as Deputies McManus and Coonan have said, there is a short-term crisis because lorry drivers are going out of business every day.  What measures can the Minister take to ensure the future of the haulage industry?  They will go out of business in the short term, not to mention the long term.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister should answer the question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does the Minister have any incentives for the haulage industry?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He is rambling.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What short-term incentives does the Minister have to prevent haulage operators going out of business?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is not an answer.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are going to be out of business.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Offshore energy projects currently get a set figure of €140 per megawatt hour, but will there be parity between offshore and onshore projects?  If so, what will the rate be, assuming it will not be exactly the same?  When will it be announced and what confidence can the Minister instil for the project investors?  We are not talking about the super-rich, but about small farmers who got together and built their own projects.  They want a timeframe for access to the grid.  Can the Minister shed some light on the matter?
