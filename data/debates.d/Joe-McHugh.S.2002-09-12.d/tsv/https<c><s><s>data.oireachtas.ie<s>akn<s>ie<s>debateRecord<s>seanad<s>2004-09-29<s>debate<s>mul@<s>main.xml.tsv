JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the House. I too welcome the publication of the Disability Bill but have reservations about its key areas. Regarding the ring-fencing of moneys over a five-year period, the question arises as to how much money will be involved and what will happen in five years time. While the legislation states that assessments will remain independent, who will carry them out? Officials from the soon-to-be dissolved health boards or Government officials? How independent will reviews of assessments be?From speaking to representative groups and people with disabilities, there is much discontent with the current building regulations regarding physical access compliance. I understand that it comes under a different Department but much more can be done in this area. Who will police physical access compliance? Will there be more amendments to the building regulations?Stipulations exist requiring 3% of local authority workforces to be made up of people with physical or other disabilities. However, this rule is not adhered to and a recent survey of local authorities put Monaghan County Council bottom of the list. I will not admonish other councils as Donegal County Council has nothing to be proud of either. For years, I have been flying the flag for compliance with the 3% stipulation.Approximately 1,400 citizens with physical disabilities in County Donegal are fighting hard for rights-based legislation. These people are not looking for hand-outs, pity or to be treated differently. While a large percentage of them voted in the last election, this group will be more sceptical than others. It is important that their expectations are not raised with false promises in budgeting over five years. There must be a more concrete delivery of a programme of works in which these people can have full confidence. Consultation has been referred to but it must be ongoing as the Bill goes through the Houses.Another key factor is administration. It is important that this legislation does not involve layer upon layer of bureaucratic appointments. The issue is service provision, not the creation of mountains of bureaucracy. There are too many provisos in the Disability Bill. It needs to be more concrete with better clarification. Will the Minister of State inform the House of the timeframe for the passage of the Bill?
