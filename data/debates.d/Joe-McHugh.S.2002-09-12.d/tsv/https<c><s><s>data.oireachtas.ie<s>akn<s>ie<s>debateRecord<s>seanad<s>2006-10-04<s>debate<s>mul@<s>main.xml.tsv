JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes on the Independent Monitoring Commission's report.  It has not been published yet, but initial soundings in Northern Ireland suggest it will be a positive step forward.This House must keep a sharp eye on the deadline of 24 November and the prize is to get the institutions up and running again.  We must do anything we can in our jurisdiction to assist in this process, therefore, I call for a debate on Northern Ireland prior to the deadline.  This debate should relate not only to the institutions but to the wider prize of benefits for border areas and the rest of the country.I ask for the Leader's intervention on quota restrictions that are to be placed on the pelagic fleet.  We have 23 vessels and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has indicated that these restrictions will apply for the autumn period.  This is dangerous and would mean the vessels might not be allowed to fish for this period.  Already a major Donegal crab boat fishes out of Holland which means the ports, such as Greencastle, Killybegs and Downings Harbour, lose out on ancillary benefits.  Small industries and small shopkeepers are losing out and the benefits are being lost to other ports.  We must focus on this matter and I ask for the Leader's intervention.
