JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Lawlor has mentioned a historical case. There is a specific anomaly here. The Minister for Education and Skills will have details about a specific case, where the mother has recently been naturalised and is an Irish citizen but the circumstances of her dependent daughter have changed suddenly as a result. Prior to her naturalisation, her daughter, as a dependant, was entitled to a SUSI grant, but as a consequence of the mother being naturalised in the second year of the daughter's bachelor of commerce degree in Galway, the daughter is not entitled to the grant. There is a distinct anomaly in that situation. It will probably require legislation. The personnel in SUSI with whom I have been dealing on this case and a range of other cases have given us the space and time to deliberate on how we can move this matter forward or work around it. I reiterate what Deputy Lawlor has said. In the second year of the operation of SUSI it must be said that the staff in SUSI have been more than courteous and very professional. It is important to record our appreciation for their work and endeavours. They were subject to sharp criticism in the first year, much of it unwarranted. Obviously there were delays because it was the first time a centralised model took over from the vocational education committees, VECs, and the local authorities. There were teething problems, but the invaluable work so many personnel in SUSI are doing must be acknowledged and put on the record. This matter is outside the Minister of State's remit but I am aware of his long-term interest in the education system and his championing in the past of equal rights and equal treatment for all citizens. There is a distinct anomaly in this case. A dependant who is over 18 years of age and who was entitled to a grant in the first year of a bachelor of commerce degree is not entitled to the grant in the second year as a consequence of her mother being naturalised. That is wrong and must be addressed. Whatever legislation is required must be introduced.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I will forward the information directly to the Minister. In the short time available to me, I wish to put another matter on the record. There is no need for a response from the Minister of State as I am putting it on the record for the consideration of the people in the Department of Education and Skills. It relates to the issue of smaller schools. The initial thinking about smaller schools was that eventually a school would become a one teacher school and, as a result of parents voting with their feet and taking the students from that school, the school would close. However, that is not the case. Parents of children in one teacher schools, and I have in mind one such school in my constituency, wish to keep their children in these schools. The teacher is under pressure so we must examine the resources available to such teachers and other resources for protection, safety, regulation and a proper educational environment. I raise this for the attention of the people in the Department of Education and Skills. They should re-think the capacity and resources being provided for the teacher in one teacher schools. Parents are voting with their feet. They wish to keep their children in one teacher schools and we must support them.
