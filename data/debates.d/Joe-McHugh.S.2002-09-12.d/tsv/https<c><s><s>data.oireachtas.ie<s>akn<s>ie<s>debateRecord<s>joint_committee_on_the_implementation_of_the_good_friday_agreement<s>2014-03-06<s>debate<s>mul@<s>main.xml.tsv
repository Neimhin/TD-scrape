JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are here to discuss the Amnesty International report, Northern Ireland: Time to Deal with the Past.  I welcome the following: Mr. Colm O'Gorman, director of Amnesty International Ireland; Mr. Patrick Corrigan, Northern Ireland programme director of Amnesty International UK; and Mr. Kartik Raj, campaigner, EU team, Amnesty International.  The timing of this meeting is quite appropriate.  We have had a challenging week in Northern Ireland relating to legacy issues' dealing with OTRs or "on-the-runs" and other difficult challenges.  We are delighted that the witnesses are here today to add value to this committee's deliberations on the past.  Witnesses at recent committee meetings have included Ms Kathryn Stone, the victims' commissioner, ex-prisoners, former combatants, and victims groups.  It is a complex mix.  The members are very well aware of the difficulties and challenges.  We very much look forward to the witnesses' contribution today and we will have a good open session after their initial statements.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, you are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your remarks.  You are directed that only comments and evidence in relation to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. O'Gorman to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before going back to the witnesses I commend them on their helpful work.  When we consider the absolutes inherent in the dirty war for 30 years, as people had a fixed position and one group was right and another was wrong, bar stool conversations meant everybody had a fixed opinion.  We have had many groups before us and some want justice, others want truth and yet others want acknowledgement.  Some groups want closure but others disagree with that term.  It is such a complex issue and people are not having the conversation around absolutes in dealing with the past.  How can we marry the conversation when people have a fixed position on how to deal with the past and when there is a complex mix of opinions?  The witnesses may not be able to answer the question specifically but in coming together we are highlighting the need for a mechanism to deal with the past.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am not necessarily referring to parties.  As Deputy Smith noted, Justice for the Forgotten has a line regarding what it wants from the process but other groups want other goals.  How can such disparate issues be brought together?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will allow Deputy Seán Crowe to speak first.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are under pressure timewise, but perhaps I might throw something into the mix.  The Eames-Bradley recommendation of a £12,000 reconciliation payment was controversial and failed.  As we have not mentioned money or economics today, I think I should throw it into the mix.  Some 3,600 people were killed during the Troubles and 40,000 injured, not to mention those affected psychologically or the relatives of those who were physically hurt or died.  We engage in significant outreach work.  We visit Northern Ireland and have visited east Belfast.  Recently we were in parts of Derry visiting the Nationalist community and have visited Loyalist and Unionist communities in Belfast.  The people are talking about the peace dividend, not necessarily on an individual basis but in communities.  They are asking what has been achieved since 1998, whether there are jobs or extra benefits as a result of the peace process.  What weight does Amnesty International place on the economic dividend for communities?  The committee constantly raises issues about the A5 and Narrow Water bridge projects which would bring tangible economic benefits to regions and generate greater economic and societal prosperity.  What weight does Amnesty International place on the economic dividend as a way of dealing with past neglect in communities that have been hurt and left out of prosperity in the past?  What weight does it place on it, not on an individual level - I do not want go into specific payments such as that included in the Eames-Bradley recommendation - but at the collective level for communities that have lost out?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegation for its presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Matt English, chief executive, Special Olympics Ireland; Mr. Peter O'Brien, director of training and volunteers; Mr. John McKernan, chairman of Special Olympics Ulster; Mr. Shaun Cassidy, regional director of Special Olympics Ulster; and Mr. Liam McGarry, a family member with Special Olympics Ulster.  The committee will hear about the work the group does providing an all-year programme of sport and training activities to thousands of athletes.  We are particularly interested in the group’s North-South dimension in co-operation and integrated strategies which are part of the Good Friday Agreement.  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. English to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Senator.  I also thank you for insisting that both representative groups be invited to appear before the committee.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Most of the contributions were observations, and the witnesses do not have to reply to all observations, but I invite Mr. Matt English to comment, and Mr. John McKernan might give an Ulster perspective.  I too am interested in the response to Deputy Conlan's question on Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal.  Are these counties in Ulster or not in Ulster?  I would appreciate specific clarification.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is Mr. Cassidy the regional manager for the north west?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is he regional director for the nine counties of Ulster?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I remember one time when Cavan was not in Ulster, but I will not go there.  We will not talk about the past.  I appreciate the attendance of the delegation.  The meeting has been a good opportunity for the witnesses to put on public record the good work that they do.  If the committee can be of help then our door is open.  We appreciate their being here and thank them for their contribution.  We will be in touch.  I also thank the members.
