JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Many social economy projects are coming towards the end of their three-year lifespan and there is grave concern that they will come to an abrupt end and that F√ÅS is looking for an exit strategy. A total of 64 jobs are at stake in Inishowen in a social economy project involving Tullyarvan Mill, Greencastle Maritime Museum and Inishowen Community Radio, in regard to which a public meeting is being held on Friday night. The concept of the social economy came originally from Ireland with examples such as the co-operative and credit union movements. In Glencolmcille, County Donegal, Fr. McDyer founded the concept of social economy which constitutes social entrepreneurial activity. It is neither business nor community development but something in between.I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to seriously consider initiating a pilot programme in Donegal in the wake of the recent job losses and doom and gloom associated with the county. He should seriously consider initiating a pilot social economy project and the creation of a social economy sector rather than the introduction of specific programmes.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
