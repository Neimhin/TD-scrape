Without getting into the politics of the issue, it caused a reawakening for many people over 70 and made them realise they could still be active, that they still have much to offer and that they can play a useful role in society.  That role has been largely untapped.  We must take cognisance of the fact that older people on both sides of the Border have a great deal to offer, based on their own rich experience and their own vision.  We should tap into that as much as possible.  In that context, I will be parochial and mention a group on active citizenship in Derry working with a group in Moville.  It is only a small voluntary organisation with a small amount of money, operating out of Serenity House but it is doing great work in terms of capacity building across the Foyle.  I urge Mr. Sheridan to look into the good work that group is doing and to see if his organisation could assist it.We are at a crossroads with regard to funding.  We could restrict ourselves if we say that funding can only come from within the island of Ireland.  The Irish diaspora were first brought to the forefront by the former President, Mary Robinson.  The work done under Tony Kennedy has concentrated on building capacity with eastern America and London.  We have an opportunity to seriously reach out to all Irish communities and for Co-Operation Ireland to become truly international.  We should look beyond the traditional locations, namely the east and west coasts of America, Australia, England and so forth.  There are other countries where we have a massive synergy of Irish people who have been disaffected, either politically or economically, by the Troubles.  They are seeking to become involved in Ireland again and if the real issue is winning the peace, then we can learn from the rich experience of others at an international level.I know of people of Irish descent in places as far away as Venezuela and Singapore who would be interested in contributing to diaspora projects.  Perhaps Co-Operation Ireland is the ideal mechanism for doing that.  We have much to learn from Mr. Barack Obama, whose fund-raising campaign over the Internet raised enormous amounts of money, much of which was in small donations of only $5.  I urge Co-Operation Ireland to explore that possibility.
