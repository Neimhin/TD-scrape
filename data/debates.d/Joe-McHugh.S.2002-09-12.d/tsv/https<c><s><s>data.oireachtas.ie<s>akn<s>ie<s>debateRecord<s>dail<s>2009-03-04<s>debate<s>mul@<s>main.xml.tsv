JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss a matter of urgent national importance, namely, the need for An Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to engage with bank officials, post offices, and credit unions in Border areas in the context of security, on foot of an alarming armed raid on a post office in Carrigans, County Donegal, on Friday last.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am delighted with that answer because there is a very simple rationale behind this question.  It encompasses the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister's Department, in terms of the partnership money which was set aside for alternative enterprises in coastal communities such as Inishowen.The Government is seeking partnership across the floor of the House.  It wants us to co-operate and work together because of our serious financial situation.  The reason I tabled the question for the Minister is that I respect him as a west of Ireland man who has a cognisance and relationship with rural life and landscape, in terms of how it should be worked and lived on.  I need the Minister to sit down and work with the Ministers from the Departments I mentioned.  We can create jobs in Donegal tomorrow morning in alternative enterprises in the marine sector.  We can create jobs in the white fish sector, not for large boats but for boats under 12 metres.  We can create jobs in the aquaculture sector for mussels and oysters.The Minister knows that as he is a west of Ireland man.  However, we are crippled with regulation, legislation and a lack of responsibility at an interdepartmental level.  All I have seen from my year and a half as a Deputy in this House is Departments pushing from Billy to Jack and saying, "That is not our responsibility".  We need to create jobs in the country.  With a little foresight and communication between Departments, we can create jobs.  I am sick and tired of tabling parliamentary questions——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——and hearing Ministers say, "I can create jobs in the morning".  Donegal, as a county, can create jobs but the Government is not willing to take responsibility.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Get rid of the red tape and the nonsense and get people working again, rather than queuing in the dole offices in Buncrana or Letterkenny.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am asking the Minister for his indulgence.  I apologise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am very angry about this.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know it is question time.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Which we are doing.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not a Second Stage speech.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have tabled three of them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It related to partnership money.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about the marine?  The Minister said such money could not be spent on marine or aquaculture projects.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about alternative marine projects?  What about marine tourism?  The Minister should look at the question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He is not replying.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Minister intervene?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Minister's honesty.  The question is vague because it encompasses three Departments.  It relates to funding by the Minister's Department for alternative marine enterprise.  I have a letter, which I will give to the Minister, in which a salmon fisherman outlines how he made a proposal to set up an alternative marine enterprise only to be turned down by a partnership company on the basis that it did not fund such enterprises.  That is a critical issue.  I apologise to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I acknowledge the sensitivity regarding protocol in the House.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have a job to do and I must listen week in, week out to Ministers saying they would like to hear our ideas.  Constituents visit my clinics every week with plans for projects and enterprises but they cannot get through the red tape.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	White fish have absolutely nothing to do with the core of the question.  Let us put the record straight.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister should have some respect for my question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister was about to reply.  I am trying to be helpful——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——on behalf of people who want to work.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I know he is familiar with this issue.  He has been to County Donegal, to Killybegs and to Greencastle, where he met with fishermen from the whitefish sector.  In the time since he was there, this has become more of a problem, affecting boat owners with boats of 12 metres and less, and fishermen who do a little bit of whitefishing or catching dogfish.  They stay away from cod, which is the key point in this matter.  We are all interested in sustainability and in the preservation of stocks.  When Europe hears of whitefish, it hears cod.  We are all interested in the preservation of cod.  We all want this and the fishermen agree to it.  However, there are other whitefish that can be fished in the Irish seas.We must get the point across to the Minister of State and show him that the present system and interpretation of EU guidelines is not satisfactory in terms of conservation, sustainability and best practice.  I will leave it for my colleague to talk about the ins and outs of best practice by the fishermen with regard to the quota system.  Rather than days at sea per boat we must look at quantity of fish.  Fishermen know when to fish, where to fish and how best to fish.  They are the ambassadors of the sea and the people who know best practice.  In dealing with the whitefish sector and the overall fishing sector we have left the fishermen out of the loop, even though there are representative bodies.We must start heeding the guidance of the whitefish fishermen and acknowledge that they are more interested in the quantity quota per fish species rather than days at sea.  Unfortunately, we do not have time, but concerning the interpretation of Council Regulation EC/237/2002, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food must explain itself and its methodology.  The allocations are completely unsatisfactory in respect of both scope and scale.  I hope we can see some movement on this matter in the response of the Minister of State.
