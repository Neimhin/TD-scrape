JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate Senator White's ongoing efforts concerning ageism, including the paper she produced on that subject.  She should also try to highlight an anomaly with respect to people with disabilities.  When one reaches the age of 65, one is not entitled to a motorised transport car grant, which is discrimination against people in that age group.I wish to refer to health carers working outside the mainstream health system.  When a man is looking after his wife, both their pensions are taken into consideration and means tested, so he is not entitled to the carer's allowance.  A second anomaly arises in the case of a woman who cares for her father and mother.  Her father is confined to a wheelchair while her mother is bedridden following a stroke.  We have a responsibility to such people who work around the clock, seven days a week.  Caring is a stressful occupation so carers not only need remuneration for such work but also other support also.The Leader has a wide knowledge of the education system and is also aware that diligent special educational needs assistants work hard throughout the secondary school sector.  Some of them have been working for up to eight years but still have no entitlement to long-term contracts or permanence.  We also have a responsibility to special educational needs assistants who work outside mainstream education.  We should get them into the system because they provide an important primary function.  Will the Leader raise that matter with the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They do not get the motorised transport grant.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are not entitled to it.
