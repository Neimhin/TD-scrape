JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ireland was recently ranked fourth in the world in terms of trade and investment.  While this achievement must be welcomed, the fact that we languish further down the table in the area of technology and production is a worrying sign.  Yesterday this was put into sharp focus when I stood in a 68,000 sq. ft. factory in Donegal which has been empty for ten years.  Three years ago a private investor bought it and invested in it, installing all the modern conveniences and making it a state-of-the art facility with instant access to broadband.  We have a worrying situation because nobody is biting.  Nobody is interested.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Chair should either be equitable and let everybody have his or her say, or let nobody speak.  This always happens.  The Senators who speak last have approximately 30 seconds to make their points.  I ask the Chair to allow me to finish my point.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	At our peril we ignore the primary and secondary sectors in this country.  Our farmers are being rewarded for not farming.  Our pelagic fishermen have their boats tied up in Greencastle and Killybegs.  We must think outside the box and stop getting carried away with the spin that our economy is going well.  Our economy is hanging by a thread because we ignore the primary and secondary sectors.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why are we not supporting a timber processing plant in the north west that would create 1,000 jobs in the morning?  Why is the Government failing to do that?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We should focus on the primary and secondary sectors, not just the tertiary sector.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, my question was not answered.  Is that silence an endorsement of the Government's attitude to the neglect of the primary and secondary sectors?
