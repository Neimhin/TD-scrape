JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Marian Harkin and Senator Vincent P. Martin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh the representative from the Embassy of North Macedonia, Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski. The representative of the Embassy of Montenegro, who was also scheduled to attend, has sent her apologies. As members know, we will be engaging with Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski today on the topic of EU enlargement in the western Balkans. We are looking forward to our conversation and she is very welcome. Our conversation is twofold. First, it is to send a strong message to her country and to the other Balkan states that we are keen to engage with those countries in terms of EU enlargement. We have been engaging very much on the aspirations of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. We also have the Georgian ambassador, H.E. Mr. George Zurabashvili, with us here today and he is very welcome. As I said, it is twofold. We want to continue with engagement and we also want to inform ourselves. We are looking forward to Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski’s contribution. I have a note on privilege. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Everybody knows the drill in that regard. I invite Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski to make her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mrs. Bojadjieska Ristovski. With the agreement of the committee, I must be excused because I must attend another committee but I will be back. The Leas-Chathaoirleach, Deputy Howlin, will take the Chair. Deputy Howlin is up next but, being in a position of responsibility now, perhaps Senator Chambers will speak. Deputy Haughey will speak after that and then Deputy Howlin. Hopefully, I should be back in ten or 15 minutes. If I do not get into a row, I should be all right.
