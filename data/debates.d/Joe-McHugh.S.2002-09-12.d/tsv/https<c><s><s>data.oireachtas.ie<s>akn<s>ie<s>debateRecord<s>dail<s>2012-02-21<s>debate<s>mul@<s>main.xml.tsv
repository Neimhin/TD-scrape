JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The issue of inter-country adoption was very much a focus of the previous Dáil, with Vietnam being the main concern.  The narrative and debate at the time were not very positive, against the background of the many homes throughout the State in which Vietnamese children were happily living.  It is important to be sensitive when analysing the reasons that Vietnam was closed to foreign adoptions at the time.  Several darker reasons were put forward in terms of preventing Vietnamese adoptions.  During the period that adoptions were suspended, 19 Irish couples found their applications to adopt were in limbo.  It was a delicate time for them, including those seeking to adopt their second or third child having already adopted from the country.I thank the Minister and her team for her proactivity in regard to getting Vietnam back on the agenda.  There have been heartwarming stories in recent weeks.  While the narrative in the previous Dáil focused on the negatives, there was insufficient recognition of the great working relationship that existed.  I also thank the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Pat Breen, who worked in tandem with the Minister in travelling to Vietnam to get the process up and running again.In regard to adoptions from Bulgaria, there is confusion among prospective parents in regard to binding contracts placed with the ANIDO Association.  A meeting took place on 2 December which was attended by representatives of the Arc Adoption agency, but confusion remains as to which organisation is the best vehicle for pursuing adoption applications to that country.  Arc representatives indicated at the meeting that applicants were obliged to avail of its services in order for Bulgarian adoption applications to be processed.  At a subsequent meeting, a Bulgarian attorney representing the ANIDO Association said there was no such legal obligation but that it would be advisable to avail of Arc's mediation services.  With ANIDO's fees at €5,200 and Arc charging some €11,500 per client for services rendered, prospective adoptive parents are looking at an application cost of up to €17,000.  This is the side of the adoption process that can lend itself to very negative perceptions in terms of the cost of the process and the timeframe it involves.  I know that the Minister and her officials are on top of this matter which is causing much confusion for parents.  I ask for her ongoing vigilance in ensuring that people wishing to adopt from this particular country are not exploited.I want now to refer to the situation in respect of Florida, which has been on the agenda pre-Christmas and in respect of which I know the Minister has been proactive.  Many parents were reluctant to continue the process as they believed their declarations with the American authorities and HSE were not right.  Following a successful meeting in Washington in November, expectations were heightened that this matter would be resolved in the short term.  While I am aware that the Minister is working on this I ask that her officials investigate any blockages in respect of which both authorities can work together.Many parents involved in this process are in the dark.  An example is a couple who applied in May 2009, took part in a preparation course in September 2009, received their declaration in 2010 and applied to the US in June 2010.  This couple have been through a difficult three years owing to the difficulties between the United States and HSE.  One accepts there will be ramifications for couples having to deal with the bureaucracy of two different jurisdictions in terms of the need to ensure everything is above board and so on.  It is important vetting mechanisms are in place.  However, many couples - I am sure we all do this - measure their lives against those of their colleagues and peers who got married at the same time as them and have families, often within nine months of their wedding day.  This particular couple know other couples who married at the same time as them over four years ago, many of whom have had two and three children naturally.  This is frustrating for them and is putting a great deal of pressure on them and their extended families.  We are all aware of the goodwill within families to see their sons, daughters, brothers, sisters or grandchildren realise their dreams.  We must be sensitive to the difficulties being experienced by people who must endure this two or three year process to have a child.  We must in our efforts to sort out this issue put this at the top of our agenda.  I again ask for the Minister's intervention in this regard.  I know that her officials have been working hard on this.I take this opportunity to commend the Minister's officials within the HSE.  While the Government and Opposition are great at knocking civil servants, a few people in the HSE - I will not name them - two in particular, have been working hard with the United States authorities on this issue.  I know that Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was involved in this process and has lent her support to those involved.  We must do all we can to steer Florida in the right direction.  Perhaps the Minister will ask that the Taoiseach put the issue on his agenda for his upcoming visit to Washington for St. Patrick's Day.The narrative within public discourse is the economy, be it on local or national radio or local or national media.  I welcome the positives in this regard as announced by the Taoiseach today.  However, there is much more happening in the world.  We must do what we can to assist those couples for whom having a child does not come naturally.
