JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." Tá an reachtaíocht seo a bhaineann le coinníollacha sábháilteacha iontach caol agus gairid. Chomh maith leis sin, tá brú ar achan tír san Aontas Eorpach cloí leis an spriocdháta den 9 Iúil. Déanaim comhghairdeas le mo chuid oifigigh as ucht an obair a rinne siad ar an reachtaíocht thábhachtach seo san am gairid a bhí acu. I am pleased to introduce the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Bill 2015 for the consideration of the House. The purpose of the Bill is to transpose Directive 2013/30/EU, the offshore safety directive, which is focused on the safety of offshore oil and gas operations. Transposition of the directive will further strengthen the safety regulation of offshore oil and gas exploration and production in Ireland’s offshore area. The offshore safety directive is the European Union's response to minimise the risk of offshore accidents throughout the Union following its review of offshore oil and gas operations in Europe prompted by the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. The directive seeks to ensure a consistent implementation of best regulatory practices in all European jurisdictions with offshore oil and gas activities, as well as strengthening the European Union's preparedness and response capacity to deal with an emergency that would potentially affect its citizens or the environment. This is an exciting time for the petroleum exploration sector in Ireland. In the past four years we have witnessed strong momentum in exploration interest with the number of exploration licences in place at its highest level ever. We now need to see this effort translated into increased drilling levels, as it is only through exploration drilling that the true potential of Ireland's offshore area can be proved. I would welcome an opportunity in the future to outline in greater detail to the House some recent and ongoing initiatives aimed at ensuring continued positive momentum. However, having regard to the time available, I will confine my comments to the Bill and the directive it will transpose. The offshore safety directive specifically provides for the institutional separation of regulatory functions relating to offshore safety and the environment from those functions focused on the economic development of offshore resources such as licensing and revenue management. It also provides for a goal-setting approach in major accident prevention based on thorough risk assessment and reliable management systems; clarity on environmental liability in the event of a major accident; and emergency preparedness and response arrangements. The deadline for the transposition of the directive is 19 July 2015. The approach to transposition involves integrating the directive requirements with the safety regulatory system for oil and gas exploration and production activities in Ireland introduced under the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010. That Act conferred on the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the responsibility for the safety regulation of petroleum exploration and extraction activities in Ireland, including a requirement to establish and implement a petroleum safety framework. The petroleum safety framework is the system the CER uses to regulate the safety of petroleum activities carried out by licensed petroleum undertakings. These activities extend from exploration through to decommissioning of infrastructure at the end of the lifecycle of a development. It should be noted with regard to decommissioning that, in accordance with their petroleum lease conditions, all parties to a lease are required to post a decommissioning security once the decommissioning process is triggered. This ensures the costs of decommissioning are met by developers, not by the State. The petroleum safety framework was designed in line with best international practice, with petroleum undertakings required to reduce all safety risks to the internationally accepted level that is as low as is reasonably practicable, ALARP. A guidance document was published in 2013 by the CER setting out how developers needed to demonstrate ALARP in their safety case applications and how the CER would assess such applications. While the Bill provides for fines of up to €3 million on developers for failure to ensure all petroleum activities are carried out in accordance with their safety management system and safety permit, it also provides that petroleum undertakings are financially liable for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage. It does not propose a limit on such liability. The key requirements of the directive are broadly analogous with the provisions of the 2010 Act. While a significant element of the transposition of the directive involves the introduction of consistent terminology and language, the main regulatory implications of the directive required to be addressed in the Bill are the establishment of a national competent authority; provision for the assessment of potential major environmental hazards offshore within the scope of the safety case regime; clarity on industry liability in the event of a major accident; and specific obligations to be placed on both operators and owners of petroleum infrastructure. Section 1 is a standard provision concerning definitions.  Section 2 replaces section 13A of Part IIA of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 with a new interpretation section that is consistent with the terminology and language of the directive. Key new definitions include those for "operator" and "owner". These definitions enable the obligations under the directive to be placed on the relevant entity and integrated with the existing safety regulatory framework for petroleum safety. Section 3 inserts a new section 13GA and establishes the CER as the independent competent authority under the directive. The principal objective of the CER as competent authority is the effective safety regulatory oversight of operator and owner compliance in reducing the risk and potential consequences of major accidents offshore to a level that is as low as reasonably practicable. Section 4 replaces the existing section 13H with a new section which integrates the competent authority functions under section 5 and the directive requirements in the context of the CER's general petroleum safety functions. The matters to be considered by the CER in carrying out its functions are also set out and include minimising the potential for overlap or duplication of effort. Section 5 further strengthens the existing emergency preparedness and response arrangements through inserting a new section 13HA, providing the CER with the power to direct industry to conduct emergency exercises and tests and to direct industry to take adequate measures to ensure the continuing safety of designated petroleum activities. Section 6 amends section 13I to align with the terminology and language of the directive. Section 13I requires the CER to establish and implement a risk-based petroleum safety framework through which it shall exercise its petroleum safety functions. The CER has successfully operated the petroleum safety framework established under the 2010 legislation since December 2013. Section 7 which deals with obligations on petroleum undertakings, operators and owners inserts three new sections - 13KA, 13KB and 13KC - to reflect the general and specific obligations of each of the three related regulated entities under the directive, namely, the licensee, described in the 2010 Act as the petroleum undertaking; the operator who is appointed by the licensee to carry out oil and gas operations; and the owner who is the legal entity with operational control of a non-production installation. Section 8 which deals with safety case guidelines replaces section 13L with a new section which requires that the contents of the safety case guidelines published by the CER be consistent with the specific information requirements of the directive. Sections 9 to 11, inclusive, replace the existing sections 13M, 13N and I3O with new sections, placing the obligation to submit a safety case on operators and owners. Section 12 which deals with notifications sets out the regulatory process for the submission, assessment and acceptance or refusal of design notifications and combined operation notifications by operators to the CER in accordance with the offshore safety directive.  Sections 13 and 14 which deal with safety permits and the refusal or revocation of a safety permit amend the existing sections 13P and 13Q to reflect the CER's assessment of safety cases submitted by operators and, where relevant, owners to reflect the capacity of the operator or owner, as appropriate, to carry out a designated petroleum activity. Sections 15 to 18, inclusive, amend existing sections 13S, 13T, 13U and 13V. These sections relate to the notification to the CER by operators or owners of petroleum incidents or potential incidents; the further investigation and-or the taking of enforcement action by the CER regarding the notified petroleum incident; and the issuance of a report by the CER to the Minister with respect to each petroleum incident that results in the loss of human life, serious personal injury, damage to third party property or a major accident. The Bill provides that any petroleum incident must be notified to the CER immediately and potential incidents within 24 hours. Section 19 which deals with the improvement plan and notice amends the existing sections 13Y and 13Z to extend the existing power of the CER to issue a direction requiring the submission of an improvement plan or the serving of an improvement notice on petroleum undertakings to also apply to operators and owners. Section 20 which deals with access to safety case information amends the existing section 13AC to put the obligation on the relevant operator to provide a mechanism by which a copy of the accepted safety case can be made available to any member of the public who requests it. Section 21 which deals with miscellaneous amendments makes a number of consequential amendments to the 1999 Act to, among other measures, extend the CER's enforcement powers to apply to operators and owners, in addition to petroleum undertakings, and enable the CER to charge operators and owners a safety case fee. Section 22 amends the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 to require the assessment by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources of the technical and financial capability of applicants for an offshore petroleum authorisation in line with the offshore safety directive. The section also makes provision for ministerial approval of an appointment of an operator proposed by a petroleum undertaking. Section 23, an amendment to section 6 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968, amends the definition of "designated area" under the Act to align with Article 6(7) of the directive which requires the establishment of a safety zone in the vicinity of an offshore installation. Section 24 makes the usual provision for the Short Title and citation. The Bill is an important measure in the continued strengthening of the overarching regulatory framework governing offshore exploration for and the production of oil and gas in Ireland. It comprehensively transposes the directive in a manner that will enhance the safety of the offshore oil and gas sector, build on the regulatory model successfully implemented in December 2013 under the 2010 Act and incur the least cost on the industry and the public service.  I hope the outline I have provided of the Bill's provisions has been of assistance. I look forward to listening to the views of Deputies on this important legislation and their help in progressing the Bill into law prior to the directive's transposition deadline of 19 July.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputies. I appreciate their constructive commentary on the importance of getting this Bill signed into law before 19 July. I also appreciate the fact that it is important to discuss the legislation and go through it with a fine-tooth comb. The first question raised by Deputy John Browne was why this is taking so long. Discussions have been ongoing at Commission level in respect of guidance on financial arrangements. That is an important subject in terms of responsibility. Deputy Pringle asked who takes the responsibility and whether it falls on the operators. It has been difficult and it has taken time to tease that out. Obviously, that gives less time for a national parliament. However, I appreciate the points raised. The three Deputies raised the question of the €3 million imposition. It is a fine. It is important to have a distinction between a fine if proper regulatory management systems are not adhered to or if they are not in accordance with the permit provided on the one hand and other costs on the other. There is a maximum fine of €3 million. Deputy Browne raised the question of environmental damage or repercussions as a result of an accident. The point is addressed in this legislation as well. There is no limit to the costs involved in that case. It is important to make that distinction. The Commission for Energy Regulation is the national competent authority. In the case of this legislation the framework or infrastructure is based on the 2010 legislation. It is more a question of language change and fitting into the framework that was built in 2010. The question of first response if an accident happens was raised. That is not a place where we want to be. Let us consider what happened in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The first responder is actually the Coast Guard. Deputy Browne asked who leads on a mitigation or intervention plan relating to an accident. It is the Coast Guard, which comes under a different Department. Obviously, there is cross-collaborative interaction between local authorities, the Coast Guard and my Department. I welcome Deputy Colreavy's constructive intervention and the fact that he will not be obstructing the passage of the Bill. I welcome his constructive acknowledgement of what the Government is trying to do in respect of broadband and the associated announcement this morning. I wish to acknowledge his comments in that regard. Deputy Colreavy remarked that it is not ideal. He raised a broad range of issues, including Corrib. He raised issues on behalf of people who had difficulties during that process. It is important to note that as a result of that process we have learned lessons. We have contingency plans and legislation in place now as a result of the many lessons learned in respect of Corrib. I take Deputy Colreavy's point, but like any good debate or strong and divisive debate, there is passion on both sides. In certain parts of Mayo people say there are parts of the county that never were hit by the recession because of what went on there. It is a divisive argument but numerous important lessons have been learned in terms of framing legislation in recent years. Deputy Colreavy also mentioned potential. There is potential off the west coast. In geographical terms I always say that we are the fourth largest country in Europe in terms of landmass after Spain, Portugal and France. This gives us an idea of the magnitude of the land territory available to us. The Deputy mentioned a figure of 10 billion barrels of oil out there. However, to date we only have four finds so we have to consider the context of what has been found to date. There is momentum and, prior to the licensing round expiring in mid-September, there has been increased momentum in terms of companies looking for prospecting licences for gas and oil. I will cover some of the other ground if I get a chance to do so on Committee Stage.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	The concept of reducing a risk to as low as is reasonably practicable, a concept known as ALARP, is best practice adopted internationally and a concept reflected in the offshore safety directive. There is no definition for ALARP set out in either domestic or international legislation. The concept of what is as low as is reasonably practicable has been considered by the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom and the courts in Ireland. The courts have found that for a risk to be determined as ALARP it must be possible to demonstrate that the costs involved in reducing the risk further would be grossly disproportionate to the benefit gained. Providing guidance on what constitutes as low as is reasonably practicable is already a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation under the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010. In 2013 the Commission for Energy Regulation published a document entitled ALARP Guidance.The purpose of the ALARP Guidance document is to provide detailed guidance to developers on the requirements of the Commission for Energy Regulation concerning the processes that must be used to determine whether a risk is ALARP. It is important that the concept of ALARP be kept under review and modified from time to time to reflect developing practices. Having regard to the fact the Commission for Energy Regulation has an existing statutory obligation to provide guidance and has already acted in this regard, I do not propose to accept this amendment. However, I appreciate the stance the Deputy and his colleague in the Seanad have taken. It is important to point out that the ALARP definition can be kept under review.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The transposition of the offshore safety directive, which is the purpose of this Bill, is to ensure consistent regulation throughout Europe with respect to the potential for major petroleum incidents. It is important we learn from other countries. In the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, we have tried to source staff from countries with very rich experience of working in the industry. We nearly recruited a member of staff from another country to our Department to share expertise but it did not happen. It is important, however, that we continue to aspire to this. Ireland should not be trying to reinvent the wheel if there are various models available. With respect to the flaring of gas, the technology in question has more than one purpose. At a gas processing terminal, for example, flaring of gas can be necessary for safety reasons. More generally, gas flaring is contentious where the technology is used in the context of a producing oilfield. Gas that is produced along with oil is sometimes flared as processing it would not be commercially viable. If in the future Ireland has a commercial oil development and the flaring of gas is proposed, that proposal will be subject to an environmental impact assessment, including a public consultation process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy again. He mentioned earlier that hydraulic fracking is outside the scope of this Bill. For that reason, I will not be accepting the amendment. The Deputy has constantly referred to the duration and scope of the study that is under way. It is important that the debate continue, and I am certainly open to any opportunity to continue it. The EPA has been tasked with responsibility in this area. Given the two main pillars, namely, the environment and human health, it is important that all the various options, including consulting universities, which is occurring both in Northern Ireland and here, be explored. There ought to be a full, frank and open approach to determining strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and the factors that are detrimental to health and the environment. It is important that space be made available to do that work. I have been doing my own background research on geology. We have very complex geology in this country. In the regions the Deputy is always mentioning, there is a very complex rock formation. Without pre-empting the report, I believe from anecdotal evidence that the complex geography in itself may not lend itself to the activity in question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not within the scope of the legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Regulation of metering is principally an economic regulatory function under the existing regime for oversight of metering. Prior to their installation or modification, it is required that the detailed specifications of all metering stations are submitted for approval by my Department and are also subject to inspection. It is important to point this out. Metering of petroleum volumes also constitutes a part of the safety management system to be described in any developer's safety case, which is required to be assessed by the CER. As this activity falls within the current assessment regime, I do not propose to accept this amendment but it is important to go say that a lot of the hard work and heavy lifting in respect of management, regulation and oversight happened in 2010 and the CER is a robust and independent oversight mechanism to ensure that there is constant vigilance in respect of inspection during the process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a distinction in terms of responsibility. It is addressed elsewhere so I am not accepting this amendment but I wish to put on record that the ultimate responsibility is not borne by the State. As a Cork man, the Deputy will have experience in respect of what is happening and what is in place in Kinsale. The decommissioning of petroleum infrastructure at the end of field life is addressed by the petroleum lease granted to the developer once the commerciality of a field has been determined. The decommissioning regime that is in place in Ireland for the Kinsale area gas fields and the Corrib gas field is based on the full cost of decommissioning being borne by the holders of the petroleum lease and not by the State. A petroleum lease also includes a condition that requires a parent guarantee which means that a deed of guarantee and an indemnity in favour of the Minister must be given by each lessee. As this Bill is focused on safety and the prevention of major accidents and the question of liability for the cost of decommissioning is already addressed elsewhere, I do not propose to accept this amendment. However, the Deputy has raised an important issue, namely, the question of who bears the responsibility - the State or the operator. It clearly states elsewhere that it is developer who bears the responsibility.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I again make the distinction between the fine and costs involved in environmental clean up. The maximum fine of €3 million is for infringement of contracts entered into in respect of permit and proper safety guidelines: the €3 million is a fine if those commitments are infringed upon. There is no cap if there is an accident, there is environmental damage and there are considerable costs involved in that clean up. There is no limit in respect of the cost that should be borne in respect of the clean up. If one looks at what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, one can see that one is into entirely new territory in respect of responsibility. I want to make the distinction. The figure of €3 million is a cap on the fine for infringement and there is no limit to environmental damage.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Amendment No. 7 speaks to the part of section 16 that confers on the CER a power to appoint a petroleum safety officer to investigate petroleum incidents notified to it or safety or environmental concerns that have been reported to the CER by individuals on a confidential basis. While it would be a matter for the CER to decide whether such reports should be released, it would not be appropriate to give the Minister a role in what should be a matter for the independent safety regulator. Section 16 gives the CER the power to investigate what would include whistleblower reports. Providing that such confidential reports might be published would be likely to discourage confidential reporting or disclosure.
