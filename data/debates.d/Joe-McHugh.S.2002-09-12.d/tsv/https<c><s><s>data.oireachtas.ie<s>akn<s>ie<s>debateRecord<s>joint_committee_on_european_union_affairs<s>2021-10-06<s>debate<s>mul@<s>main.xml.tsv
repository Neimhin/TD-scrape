JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I propose that we begin in private session. Is that agreed? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son a choiste ba mhaith liom fáilte a ghabháil roimh an Dr. Anthony Soares, an Dr. Aoife Ní Lochlainn, an Uasal Tara Farrell, agus an Uasal Stephen Douds go dtí an coiste inniu. Beimid ag dúil go mór leis an díospóireacht iontach tábhachtach ar na ceisteanna agus na cúrsaí trasteorann. Before beginning there are some housekeeping matters and the privilege notice. I apologise in advance as it is a long note on privilege. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does. Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. For people watching this meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting. Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting. Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking. After all that, I invite Dr. Anthony Soares to make his opening statement. He is very welcome.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. I will now call on members for their questions. I call Deputy Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Next is Deputy Howlin, followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank both the witnesses. I will take Deputy Ó Murchú's questions now, followed by those of Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Dr. Soares wish to take that question or would he like to pass it on to Ms Farrell?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Dr. Ní Lochlainn. The next speaker is Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Douds.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Dr. Soares and his colleagues for their contributions today. They have whetted our appetite for more discussion. They have raised a lot of issues with us today and in their submission they have called for a more structured approach. That is something this committee should think about. Reference was made to climate change and sustainability, and the possibility of working together on a cross-Border basis at a practical level. I am sure Dr. Ní Lochlainn is familiar with the Politics in Action programme. Mr. Peter Weil and Mr. Dave O'Brien of that programme have been working with young people through the Glencree centre. Young people go straight for the jugular in terms of the issues. They do not get caught up in or bogged down by the issues in the way politicians do. They reach out for the big, heavy issues and are not afraid to get stuck into them, including issues like education, climate change, future business, future work and where we are going. If the witnesses need to make contact with the Politics in Action programme, the committee secretariat would be happy to help. The empowerment and education of women through second-chance education is an area in which I have a keen interest. I worked on a number of programmes in that area before I got involved in my current profession. I know the value of that work and would agree with what Dr. Soares said about the PEACE PLUS programme. We need more of that. We need more engagement and more opportunities for women to work collaboratively on a cross-Border basis. At the end of the day, there is real potential there in terms of second-chance education and empowerment. It is not just about empowering individuals but also empowering communities so any help we can provide in that regard will be forthcoming.  Dr. Soares called for a better process with a more structured agenda and we actually had that during the Brexit discussions through the Department of Foreign Affairs. It laid out a very credible, structured process on a cross-Border basis so in that context, we are not talking about reinventing the wheel. There is a potential governmental structure there that we could possibly look at. We could devote an entire day, if not weeks, months or years to talking about multiple identities. The complexity that surrounds that may exist below the political level. While I do not want to open up the debate again, I must ask a few questions around that. Is there enough safe space being created to discuss the complexities of identity and multiple identities? Is there enough safe space being created for people to express their own identity or identity preferences, be that Irish, British, British-Irish, Irish-British or Northern Irish? The non-political group to which the witnesses belong has a very interesting composition in terms of focusing totally outside of politics, which is perhaps where the safe space lies. Has the group looked at the history of Canada and how it has evolved and grappled issues of identity and multiple identity including people identifying as Canadian, French-Canadian, British-Canadian, Irish-Canadian, Scottish-Irish-Canadian, Welsh-Canadian, Manx-Canadian and so on? Canada is a country with no shortage of discussion points around multiple identity.A more comprehensive answer may be required but I would be very interested to hear brief feedback on that point from Mr. Douds.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the members of the committee, as well as Mr. Douds, Ms Farrell, Dr. Ní Lochlainn and Dr. Soares for their participation. I know Dr. Soares does a good job of staying connected with the committee and communicating with us but we will try to follow up on several of the issues that have been raised. I note that Senator Martin has joined the meeting online. He has a national remit as a Senator but he lives quite close to the Border. Does he wish to offer a few words of wisdom or ask a question?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator. He did my job there, so I do not have to say a final "thank you" to everybody. The meeting is now adjourned. The next meeting of the joint committee will take place on Wednesday, 13 October 2021 at 9.30 a.m. when we will be joined by representatives of the European Commission to discuss the state of the Union.
