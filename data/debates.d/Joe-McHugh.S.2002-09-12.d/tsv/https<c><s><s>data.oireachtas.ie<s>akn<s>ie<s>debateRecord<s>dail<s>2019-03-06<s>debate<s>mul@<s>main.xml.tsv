JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Beidh an t-ábhar seo iontach tábhachtach. Aontaím leis an Teachta maidir leis na príomhspriocanna atá i gceist. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs. That includes taking account of the flow of students from primary into post-primary education. The council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes. It is open to any school to make an application to the NCSE to establish a class. In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation, both current and planned. In that regard, the special educational needs organiser, SENO, may approach individual schools to discuss the matter with a view to finding the optimal location in terms of convenience and sustainability. When the NCSE sanctions a special class in a school, the school can apply to my Department for capital funding to reconfigure existing spaces within the school building to accommodate the class or to construct additional accommodation. SENOs, who are locally based, are available to assist and advise parents whose children have special needs. Where parents have been unsuccessful in enrolling their child in a school, they should update their local SENO to inform the planning process. SENOs are also available to assist and advise schools on special education supports and planning. The number of ASD special classes in County Dublin has increased from 66 in the 2011-12 school year to 197 in the 2018-19 year, which is a threefold increase. There are 15 ASD classes in the areas referred to by the Deputy: two early intervention classes, eight primary classes and five post-primary ASD classes. I am conscious that the level of demand in many areas throughout the country is increasing.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important to point out the progress that has been made, although I know that is no consolation for a parent who is trying to facilitate a child. There is a process and a clear mechanism based on the NCSE, which is an independent group that works through SENOs in conjunction with a board of management. It is the prerogative of the board of management to make the initial application. Following that, a decision is made on whether a special class is sanctioned. One must look at the trajectory in this regard. In 2011 we had a total of 548 special classes in this country and now we have upwards of 1,500 special classes. This year, we are spending nearly €1.8 billion of the budget of the Department of Education and Skills on special educational needs. There has been a change in the admission to schools policy. Deputy Lahart asked me if I could intervene in the process. Since 3 December 2018 a change was introduced. There is a provision in the Education (Admission to Schools) Act, following the completion of the process, that is, the consultation, the engagement with the SENO and with the school and if a board of management makes an application, for the Minister to compel a school to provide an extra class.However, this is after all areas have been exhausted in the meantime. The ultimate process, the first step, is that the school must make the application. Once that process has kick-started, I will be very vigilant to see where it goes afterwards.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy and I are on the same page on the importance of this issue. Stepping outside the political arena for one second, we are serious in this country and as a society about having inclusion at the heart of our model. Whether this be people coming from different countries or people with special educational challenges, behavioural or otherwise, or autistic children. This is relevant not just to the geographical issues the Deputy listed, but also to Cork, Galway and Donegal. We are meeting the challenges head-on in terms of weighing up resources and weighing up what can be done within a fixed period. If the Deputy looks at the increase in funding from 2011 and the increase in the number of classes, he will see that the commitment is there to build on this. To answer his question as to what role I can play, my officials work very closely with the NCSE. The SENOs are tasked with the responsibility of engaging with the board of management. If the board of management makes the application, a process is entered into.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If it makes the application in the first place-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a provision within the Education (Admission to Schools) Act from 3 December last year that compels the Minister if there is a demand, if there is an issue and all areas have been exhausted. However, we must also spread the good news that in the schools that have requested special classes and really looked at this inclusion model, it is working. I was at a small school on Monday in my home county. There are 35 students, including five autistic children, in the school and a new unit is being built there. It is an incredible story.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We must spread the good news, just as we did with DEIS in the past.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste seo. Is léir go bhfuil an cheist iontach práinneach, agus ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas a ghabháil leis an Teachta fá choinne an cheist a tharraingt anuas. The National Council for Special Education, which is an independent agency of my Department, is responsible for planning, co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs. This includes taking account of the flow of students from primary into post-primary education. The council ensures that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. The NCSE has informed my Department that it is satisfied that there are sufficient post-primary autism special class placements in Kilkenny to meet identified need for the forthcoming school year. The conversations I have had with the Deputy in recent months tell a different story.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy is picking up different messages on the ground, so we must look at meeting areas where there are weaknesses according to the anecdotal evidence and the feedback from my officials. For the 2018-19 school year, 160 new special classes have been opened, which means that there are now 1,459 special classes in place, compared with 548 in 2011. The number of special classes in County Kilkenny has increased from five in 2011-12 to 26 in 2018-19. Of these, 22 are autism special classes: two autism early intervention classes, 13 primary autism classes and seven post-primary autism classes. Individual school boards of management are responsible for the establishment of special classes. It is open to any school to apply to the NCSE to establish a class. In deciding where to establish a special class in an area, the NCSE takes account of the current and projected demand and the available school accommodation, both current and planned.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy once again. With every new school build and even for major additional capital expansion of a school, the general trend is that there is an in-built provision for autism classes, special classes, within those new schools. I am aware that with a cohort of 4,000 primary and secondary schools in the country, there are many old buildings and buildings that are challenging from the point of view of provision of this service on site. There is an opportunity for schools and boards of management to decide to make provision for special classes. They can look at reconfiguring existing spaces. This is a difficulty because many of our schools are already at capacity, they are maxed out, but there is a provision to construct additional accommodation as well. I re-emphasise and reiterate that if the board of management comes forward with the idea and suggestion of looking at providing for a special class, the NCSE and the SENOs will meet the board. I meet the NCSE regularly, and this might be helpful in this instance. At this stage what I would like to do is meet the NCSE on this specific issue regarding Kilkenny, and I would be happy to organise a meeting and have the Deputy included in it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has been very constructive and we will certainly organise that and see how it pans out. We have a duty in this House, as legislators, to get the good message out. The Deputy is no different to me in that she visits primary schools and secondary schools. The schools that have special classes and that are embracing the social model of inclusion by ensuring the inclusion of people with special and challenging conditions, whether dyspraxia, dyslexia or autism, are the schools and learning environments that are the richer for it. We can feel the harmony and the learning that is going on, and the schools that embrace the special classes are the ones I feel energised by when I go to visit. The message has to go out to other boards of management that there is an opportunity to ensure we are providing for children with all forms of disability and challenges, from complex medical needs to different and challenging behaviours. Those are the students who are going to enrich the school environment and they become the leaders within that school, along with the people around them, such as SNAs and others working within that inclusive atmosphere to provide the learning environment we all aspire to.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I did not hear the question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy is a big advocate for choice.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Caithfear a rá go mbeidh an infheistíocht chaipitil níos tábhachtaí. My Department’s capital allocation for the school sector in 2019 amounts to €622 million while the allocation last year amounted to €539.6 million. Overall targets for the delivery of school places set out in the Revised Book of Estimates 2019 are on a par with 2018. The breakdown between additional places and replacement places can vary from year to year, depending on the nature of projects and the particular priorities relating to demographics and refurbishment. Construction activity in 2018 and 2019 will involve over 130 large-scale projects and approximately 280 smaller-scale projects under the additional accommodation scheme. These projects enable significant progress in delivering some 40,000 school places, including additional and replacement places, and the replacement of over 600 prefabs, which is a key element of our prefab replacement programme. There will be enhanced sports facilities through the construction and modernisation of 48 PE halls at post-primary level and 82 general purpose rooms at primary level. In addition, the enhancement and modernisation of PE facilities in schools also will facilitate community usage of these facilities. There will be delivery of over 200 modern science laboratories, which will support the delivery of the reformed science curricula and the roll-out of computer science as a leaving certificate subject. In addition, under the summer works scheme my Department is funding a total of 307 school projects, with projected expenditure of €40 million in 2019. This will benefit schools as they upgrade windows, meet curricular requirements and make fabric improvement to buildings. A total of €117 million has been allocated to date under the current summer works scheme in respect of categories 1 to 9, which has resulted in the approval of 942 school projects.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has answered the question with regard to why we are in a different position. To clarify, the cost of Harold's Cross is €23 million. I understand the point the Deputy is making, however, which is that this is indicative of the increasing cost of land, which puts pressures on the budget. We are also looking at the 2014 regulation which changed the specification and at the 2017 change with regard to NZEB - the nearly zero energy building standard - which is working towards more environmentally efficient buildings. I am very conscious that we have to get value for money from the taxpayers' point of view and, while there is construction inflation, that we do not just accept there will be increased costs and allow that to carry on. We build in a detailed design element to the schools and, by having a detailed element complete prior to tender, we get fixed-price contracts, which ensure the price and ensure that whoever wins these contracts sticks within that. It is a question of efficiency and value for money. We are still going to be delivering over 40,000 places from 2018 to 2019 and there are still many buildings under construction. However, I appreciate the Deputy's point in terms of being vigilant to ensure we get value for money.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If there are external ways of ensuring we do things efficiently and get value for money, I am open to considering them. The National Development Finance Agency is doing great work and is at the heart of these projects. Now that we have a ten-year capital budget and trajectory, we will work within that fixed budget. There are constraints and it keeps on the pressure to ensure we try as best as we possibly can to keep costs down. For example, we are looking at methods such as the Accelerated Delivery and Architectural Planning and Tendering programme, about which I will speak later. A project manager is brought in to do the job at a very early stage in order that we can be as efficient as possible. The most important factor is the quality of the product and the safety of the building when finished. A strong message coming from young people, within both the primary and secondary school sectors, is that there should be nothing less than environmentally friendly construction. They raise concerns about such matters as solar panels and achieving efficiencies. I am conscious that they have these concerns. The nearly zero energy building standard will ensure new and additional buildings will meet those concerns.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an cheist. Aontaím leis an Teachta. Is ceist iontach tábhachtach í a tháinig suas anuraidh agus ag tús na bliana. I am aware of the demand for additional special class and special school placements in the Dublin area, including Dublin 15. I have asked the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to provide my Department with a report on current and future identified need in the area in question in order that evidence-based decisions may be made on the development of the necessary placements in the area in the short, medium and longer term. In preparing the report the council will meet parents and other groups. It is also engaging with officials in my Department on the work they are undertaking. As this process is ongoing, I have no plans to meet groups at this stage. The NCSE is an independent agency of my Department with responsibility for planning, co-ordinating and advising on education provision for children with special educational needs. The council ensures schools in an area can between them cater for all children who have been identified as needing special class placements. A working group chaired by the NCSE has been established to put in place a new working protocol to ensure there is effective proactive planning and timely delivery of specialist educational places for students.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As there is a job of work ongoing, it is important to consult all stakeholders, including parents. I am confident that this work will be done in a comprehensive way and completed in a timely fashion. We will then be in a position to make decisions on the back of it. The Deputy has her own anecdotal advice and feedback from public meetings. She has felt the pressure on the ground. There are no better people for having antennae than Teachtaí Dála, but I need to be methodical in how I go about dealing with this issue. The NCSE must be allowed space to deliberate and consult, while listening to the people who matter most, specifically the parents. I ask the Deputy to allow the people who are in the process of coming to a conclusion the time to complete that work. We will then be in a position to make decisions.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a priority. The Deputy's constituency colleague in the Chamber today, as well as my colleague and the Deputy's other constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, are anxious that it is given the prioritisation it requires. I can guarantee that it will continue to be given such prioritisation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Aontaím leis an Teachta maidir leis an bhrú atá ar na múinteoirí agus príomhoidí uilig sna bunscoileanna. Tá dualgais agus freagrachtaí orthu agus bíonn an ról ag athrú i gcónaí. Tuigim an fhadhb agus na deacrachtaí. I have engaged with the relevant stakeholders and I am fully aware of the concerns of school principals. I do not intend to meet the group in question as the issues of concern to the group are being addressed in my ongoing engagement with the primary education forum.The primary education forum was established in September 2018 and aims to support the planning and sequencing of change in the primary school sector and to exchange information on the intent and impacts of the actions in the Action Plan for Education in order to look for synergies and opportunities to streamline implementation and address workload issues. Through adopting this approach, my Department and partners already have agreed to make several changes to the pace and sequence of planned reforms. In budget 2019, school leadership was again supported, with an additional release day for teaching principals in primary schools and a further four additional release days for teaching principals in schools with special classes. Building on the number of release days provided in recent budgets is one of my priorities as Minister. Having listened to the Irish Primary Principals Network, IPPN, which brought to my attention the issue of having a second adult present in one-teacher schools during the school day, my Department is making available additional resources where gaps are identified to ensure that there are two adults present for all of the school day. There is currently no temporary replacement panel to recruit short-term replacement teachers. However, following from the action plan for teacher supply, my Department is currently undertaking an analysis of the potential for a supply panel scheme for primary schools.  I understand the pressure faced by principals, especially teaching principals, and I was delighted to meet principals to discuss this issue when I recently spoke at the IPPN conference. Working towards making progress and addressing this issue is a priority. Some principals could not attend the conference because they could not get substitute cover. I am very aware of the acute problem and that of teacher supply.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The message, which I am getting individually from members of the group the Deputy mentioned, is quite consistent in terms of initiative overload and the extra pressures. We introduced middle-management leadership at both primary and secondary levels to provide the mid-range leadership posts. The reality is that people in public leadership positions are finding it increasingly difficult. There is a feeling of being judged and of being in a constant 24-7 cycle of work. The old regimes of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., or 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the secondary school system, and of working from Monday to Friday do not exist any more. Principals are taking calls on a Sunday and in July and August. It is about trying to make it easier. Let me give an example of how. Principals have to become construction experts if they have summer works programmes. In a few weeks, I will be opening the summer works programme for summer 2020 to give the principals time, rather than having them rush under pressure in the course of a few months. I have paused the mathematics curriculum change. I have also considered introducing sequencing into the admissions to schools legislation. There are ways in which we can remove the pressure from the principals. I am in that space and hear the concerns of those individuals. I have great confidence and faith in the primary forum, however. It is a great example whereby we do the sounding, checking and testing of various initiatives or other developments coming down the track. The primary forum is excellent for this.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to read the research. Principals have a great way of getting in contact with politicians directly. A number of principals have been in contact with me directly and I value their input. I would certainly be happy to read the research but, to be honest, I feel the primary forum is the place to do the collaborative work. I have great confidence in that mechanism. I am committed to addressing the issue of supply panels for substitute teachers. I have already raised it publicly and I certainly will ensure that the officials continue to prioritise it to try to have some mechanism in place in the not-too-distant future.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Tá dul chun cinn déanta. B’fhéidir go mbeidh an freagra níos soiléire leis na sonraí atá de dhíth agus atá i mo fhreagra.  The schools in Tyrrelstown to which the Deputy refers, namely, St. Luke's national school and Tyrrelstown Educate Together, are in full possession of their buildings, albeit with precautionary measures in place to ensure safe occupancy. The safety of pupils and staff has been and remains our first priority. The Deputy will be aware that, following initial investigations at the schools last October and November, both internal and external precautionary measures were required in them. With the completion of the external precautionary measures, the schools were occupied initially at ground floor only. Works on the precautionary measures required on the upper floors were completed by 12 December 2018. One of the schools fully reoccupied its building at the time. The other opted to take up full occupancy again after the Christmas holidays. More recently, detailed investigations were carried out at both schools. The purpose of the investigations is to determine the type and extent of issues in each of them and design permanent remediation solutions. The intention is that remediation works necessary in the schools, with 20 other schools that have precautionary measures in place, will be carried out in 2019. My Department has advised the schools accordingly. Work is advancing with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Attorney General to devise a legal strategy to pursue the contractor in question for the costs of the precautionary measures and the permanent remediation works. Some proceedings have been issued against the contractor in relation to fire safety matters. To date, proceedings have issued in respect of Ardgillan community school which is partially closed as a result of concerns arising from investigations. The case will be back before the Commercial Court in early May. I acknowledge the principals, teachers, staff, parents and pupils not just of the schools mentioned by the Deputy but of all of the schools affected, not just before Christmas when the issue emerged but also in the weeks and months since. I have met a number of the principals and staff and management of the schools, both at the time and since, and take the opportunity to express my thanks to them for the work they have being doing to make sure the impact on the pupils of the investigations to date is kept to a minimum.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In 2019.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	 I am interested in the new process in politics where the Taoiseach tells me to do something and I then tell Fingal County Council to do something. The Deputy knows that is not the way it works.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If there is a weakness in my Department, we are committed to acting. We are very committed to the two schools mentioned, as well as other schools. I have been to them and I am conscious that there is an issue with space. Any solution will involve all of the stakeholders. If Fingal County Council owns the land, I am sure it will be in a position to advise on the matter. The works will be finished in 2019. The most appropriate time to undertake them is during the summer.That will happen. The remediation work needed, the design and work completed to date will inform us as to what other work is needed. I am conscious of the disruption and that other schools were also part of the solution. I met a staff member from one of the neighbouring schools where students were decanted. She spoke in positive terms of being in a position to help. I am from a rural part of the country where we are strong advocates of the meitheal and the community. I saw the urban meitheal in full drive in that area and I do not take it for granted. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In fairness, the Deputy is being constructive. Sometimes issues like this do not require a meeting or a major formal process, but an individual talking to another individual. I am sure Deputy Burton knows the director of services for the appropriate division within Fingal County Council. I do like to be hand-on. If she will provide that contact number to me, I will be happy to pass that on to my officials.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Aontaím leis maidir leis an ábhar seo. Tá sé iontach práinneach. Tá níos mó scoileanna i nDún na nGall ar an bhealach céanna leis na trí scoil atá i gceist. Ba mhaith liom na sonraí seo a leanas a chur ar an taifead. Ar dtús, gabhaim aitheantas do na daoine agus na foirne uilig sna scoileanna éagsúla - Gaelscoil na gCeithre Máistrí, Scoil na nAingeal agus Scoil Mhuire i Srath an Urláir. Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, tá Gaelscoil na gCeithre Máistrí ag stage 1 den architectural planning process. Nuair a bheidh na rudaí sin déanta, táim sásta go mbeidh sé ag dul ar aghaidh go dtí an chéad chéim eile de na forbairtí. Nuair a bheidh na nithe sin socraithe, beidh an togra ag dul ar aghaidh le pleanáil costais. Beidh ullmhúchán de dhíth fá choinne na socruithe ina dhiaidh sin. Bhí mé i Scoil na nAingeal i Leitir Ceanainn mí ó shin agus chas mé leis an fhoireann uilig. Tá siad iontach sásta leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta. Tá an togra sin ag stage 2b. Tá an t-iarratas istigh agus tá athbhreithniú ag dul ar aghaidh i mo Roinn. Tá comhrá ag dul ar aghaidh idir mo Roinn agus an fhoireann design. Tá an fhoireann design ag obair ar an iarratas atá le mo Roinn agus ag labhairt fadúda an chéad chéim eile atá de dhíth. Tá sí ag obair ar na riachtanais úra maidir le near zero energy buildings a tháinig isteach in 2017. Is coinníoll úr a tháinig isteach é sin. Mar shampla, beidh coinníollacha maidir le conservation of fuel and energy faoi na rialacháin fhoirgneamh. Beidh coinníollacha le baint amach maidir leis sin. Tá Scoil Mhuire i Srath an Urláir----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	----ag staid 2b, detailed design, fosta. Táim sásta leis an dul chun cinn. B'fhéidir go mbeidh sonraí breise ag teacht amach as an gcéad cheist eile.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To be clear, St. Mary's national school is in the capital programme. The project will go to tender when pre-qualification is complete, the design team's near zero energy building, NZEB, submission has been considered, any other issues have been raised and consequential amendments to the stage 2b design and tender document have been implemented. That will progress in quarter two. The tender stage normally takes between seven and eight months to complete. I will be ensuring - not through my intervention - that the process is transparent and open and that work will begin in quarter four of this year. There was also a major focus on this project in March 2018. There were expectations at that time that it would come in at an earlier stage. I am committed to this project and to ensuring it will be completed within 18 months. I cannot, unfortunately, influence the pre-qualification tender process mentioned by Deputy Gallagher. It is not in my gift. It is under the Office of Government Procurement. I do take the Deputy's point, however, on local companies being in a position to tender. It is not in my gift, however, to decide which company is successful. As I said as Gaeilge, I visited the Little Angels school recently. Work there is moving ahead as well. I know the Deputy shares my motivation in ensuring the 13 major capital projects in Donegal advance as quickly as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Taking off my ministerial hat, as a Deputy from Donegal I know which side my bread is buttered on to ensure we get a level playing pitch and are treated in a fair manner. I commend the groups, from boards of management to communities, that have been driving these projects. Ultimately, they are the arbiters who decide when a project is needed and aontaím leis an Teachta maidir leis na fadhbanna sa Gaelscoil na gCeithre Maistrí. Those prefabs are not a suitable environment but the commitment to the Irish language and cultural aspect of learning in that school remains. They are on the right road, an bealach ceart.  We are focused on the Little Angels school and will ensure it continues to get priority, as will any of the other major capital projects in the county that need it. It is important to make the point that my motivation to ensure the detailed design is done correctly is that the fixed-price contract, whoever gets these jobs and whenever they get them, contains a price that we stick with and work within. That is the reason why advance detailed design is done before they go to tender.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy will be aware that last October and November my Department carried out initial investigations into 42 schools that were built by the company to which he refers. He will also be aware that of those schools, 22 required precautionary measures to ensure that they could be safely occupied. The safety of pupils and staff has been and remains our first priority. Following on from this, my Department initiated a second phase of detailed investigations for the schools on 18 January last. This is focusing initially on the 22 schools that have precautionary measures in place and at Ardgillan Community College, Balbriggan, part of which remains closed. Eight investigations have been completed to date. The remainder are expected to be completed by early May. Detailed investigations in the schools that do not have precautionary measures in place will be carried out during the summer months. The purpose of the investigations is to determine the type and extent of structural issues in each individual school and to design permanent remediation solutions where these are needed. The intention is that any remediation works necessary in the 22 schools with precautionary measures will be carried out in 2019. It is envisaged that remediation work in the schools without precautionary measures will take place in 2020. Preparatory work to initiate a review of the Department’s design and build programme is currently under way. This includes consultation with the Office of the Attorney General given the existing legal process. It must be ensured that the review does not compromise this. I will make an announcement on the review when the necessary preparatory work has been completed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We were faced with a major issue last October and November. In the middle of the debate and the prioritisation of making sure students, teachers and the workers within the schools were safe, questions were also raised in the House about the ongoing capital programme and how other schools would be impacted. My officials and I were faced with the challenge of how to prioritise both remediation and the ongoing building programme. We had to figure that out. We are looking at completing the schools that need external and internal remediation work in 2019. They will get first priority. The other schools, which do not require advanced invasive work compared with the other schools, will be dealt with in 2020. It is a question of resources, manpower and womanpower, within our offices. We have now set up a team within the building unit in Tullamore wholly dedicated to Western Buildings Systems issues. We also want to ensure the independent review continues apace. I am committed to ensuring that an independent person or group is appointed by the end of this month.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is about being vigilant and processes that are fit for purpose to ensure that lessons are learned where they are needed. We will learn if there are better ways of doing things.  We have a dedicated team in Tullamore with a rich history and tradition of ensuring that schools are being built in a proper way. I indicated and committed in October and November that the review will be done this year. We will be in a position to carry out that review and, where lessons need to be learned, they will be learned.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, 2019 to 2022. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country and the four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. The Cabra and Phibsborough Dublin 7 school planning area is currently served by eight post-primary schools.This includes Cabra community college, which is under the patronage of the City of Dublin Education and Training Board. While categorised as interdenominational, Cabra community college is multidenominational in nature and provides for the local community and it could potentially bring additional capacity of this nature at post-primary level to this area. The new schools announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Cabra-Phibsboro-Dublin 7 school planning area. However, the requirement for new schools is being kept under ongoing review and in particular would have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. It will also take into account that, in the last number of years, three new multidenominational primary schools have been established in the area to cater for the increased enrolment numbers at primary level. The projected increased flow of pupils from the primary schools in this area when the current junior cohort from these schools reaches sixth class, as well as the output from more established primary schools in the area, will need to be taken into account in future demographic exercises when deciding on the need for additional post-primary school provision in the area.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The recent round of the patronage process showed that every school that was chosen by parents was multidenominational, whether they were ETBs or under An Foras Pátrúnachta or Educate Together. I am aware that there is demand and the choice of patron is also an option. On the question of capacity at Cabra community college and its plans for expansion, the geographic information system, GIS, looks at long-term demographics and where the next housing developments are going to be. We are always open to looking at new opportunities in the context of satisfying demand and I would happy to look at that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to do that. My officials are always looking at ongoing needs and ongoing review. On a personal level I would say that sometimes when we have this debate we talk about the things that are not there, or the options that are not there for parents, but other parents look at other options. I am a Loreto boy myself and religion was not rammed down my throat at Loreto secondary school. A lot of value systems were presented to me as a young person in the area of compassion, respect and dignity. It is important when talking about choice that it is not just one-dimensional.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take the Deputy's point. The majority of schools in the conurbation are of one religion and it is important to give parents choice, but it is also important to value the contribution of schools from other patronages.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Mar atá a fhios ag an Teachta, tá dul chun cinn déanta. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the project to which he refers has now been devolved for delivery to Waterford and Wexford Education and Training Board, WWETB. A schedule of accommodation has been provided to WWETB in that respect and I understand that WWETB has provided a copy to the school principal. The next step in the process of engagement with WWETB is the execution of a service level agreement, SLA, between it and my Department. This is currently being arranged. Once this SLA is in place, WWETB can then begin the process of procuring a design team for the project to design the buildings, obtain the necessary statutory planning permissions and move the project onward to tender and construction in due course. I acknowledge the efforts, both political and civic, that have been made on this project. I have had a lot of contact on the matter and a lot of communications. Colleagues of Deputy Browne, such as Deputies D'Arcy and Kehoe, have been anxious to see this project realised and I thank everybody for the pressure they put on to ensure it happened.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I cannot give a timeframe because of the planning permission process. I hope the proposals get through that process and I know the Deputy will be speaking to his colleagues on the ground about it. I was speaking to the CEO of Wexford County Council yesterday. There is a good team at local authority level and I am sure their vigilance will be second to none so that it gets through the process. Until we get to the other end of the planning process, I am not in a position to give a start date for construction.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy is right. There is an anxiety with regard to the situation a few years down the line. The problem will not necessarily arise this year or next but in three or four years. Gorey community school is at maximum capacity at the moment. I had an opportunity to visit Creagh College, which has a fine new building. We were talking about autism earlier. There are four special classes in Creagh College. It will possibly have 800 pupils in the not too distant future. It has capacity for 1,000, which can be extended to 1,200. We will be very vigilant. I have asked my officials to look at the future population projections. I hear that a large number of applications for planning permission are being made for the development of housing estates. The principals I met were very anxious that we look at some form of engagement in this regard. I am happy to do that. I do not know what the preferred solution will be. It may be to build extra capacity or an additional school. I will, however, continue to engage on that issue. Gorey is now only an hour from this city and people from this city are considering purchasing houses there. We are looking at an increased population.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to do that. The answer I have is a stock answer similar to the answer to the Deputy’s earlier question. It is very similar so I will not read it. We will pass on the answer. We have work to do in this area. The approach the Deputies in this House have taken since Christmas has been to table a range of parliamentary questions in this area. Even though we are spending nearly €1.8 billion and even though the number of classes has increased from nearly 500 to 1,500, we are looking at enormous challenges in this area. I see it as a massive opportunity for our country. I know that is why the Deputy is raising the issue today. The whole area of inclusion and of ensuring that everybody gets an opportunity to get into the workforce and to avail of lifelong learning opportunities presents a massive opportunity. I will stay in touch on this issue. The Deputy is correct that classes can be requested if parents come together to demand one, but ultimately it is the board of management that makes the decision.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not a person for the bata mór, the big stick. Telling schools what to do is not my approach but, if we continue to highlight the great work going on in the schools that have special classes, people will see the benefits not just for the young people with special needs, but for the children around them. When that is in operation it is an enriching environment in which to be. We are spending €1.8 billion and providing 1,500 special classes. We also need to remain committed to the special schools. That is something of which I am conscious. Some parents should still be afforded the choice of their child attending a special school. While some parents would prefer a mainstream school, we have to protect that option.
