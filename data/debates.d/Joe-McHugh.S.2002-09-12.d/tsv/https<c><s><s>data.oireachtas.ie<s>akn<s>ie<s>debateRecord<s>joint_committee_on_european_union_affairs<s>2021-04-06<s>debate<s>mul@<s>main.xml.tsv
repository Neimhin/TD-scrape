JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are joined today by Senators Lynn Boylan and Alice-Mary Higgins, both of whom are very welcome. This meeting is a continuation of the committee's engagement on the Comprehensive and Economic Trade Agreement, CETA. On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. David Fennelly, Dr. Oisin Suttle and Dr. Laurens Ankersmit to the meeting. Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of any person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such direction. For witnesses attending remotely, that is, outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I now invite Dr. Ankersmit to make his opening statement. Tá fáilte romhat.

JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Dr. Suttle. Deputy Richmond has indicated that he wishes to speak. I will take one member at a time. I ask members to specify if they are directing a question to one specific person or to all of the presenters generally. I call on Deputy Richmond. I will announce the next speaker when he has finished. Is Deputy Richmond there? He may be on mute. He does not seem to be there so I will take Deputy Brady.

JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Dr. Ankersmit was in mid-flow there. I apologise for that. I thank him for the football analogy too.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask the witnesses to offer brief responses in the time that remains.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations, the effort they put into their presentations and their engagement here today. It is a clear sign of how complex this piece of work is that there was little repetition today and many questions were asked across a wide range. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe, na Teachtaí agus na Seanadóirí uile. Gabhaim buíochas freisin leis na cainteoirí, an Dr. Fennelly, an Dr. Suttle agus an Dr. Ankersmit, fá choinne na díospóireachta, a gcur i láthair agus a bhfreagraí cuimsitheacha. Is léir go bhfuil na himpleachtaí iontach tábhachtach ó thaobh an Bhunreachta, chúrsaí eacnamaíocha, chúrsaí dlí, chúrsaí trádbhaic agus na rialacha idir an Aontas Eorpach agus Ceanada de. Gabhaim mo bhuíochas arís le gach éinne fá choinne a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht inniu. Tá an cruinniú thart anois. Beidh cruinniú againn trí Microsoft Teams amárach, an 7 Aibreán, ar 10 a.m.
