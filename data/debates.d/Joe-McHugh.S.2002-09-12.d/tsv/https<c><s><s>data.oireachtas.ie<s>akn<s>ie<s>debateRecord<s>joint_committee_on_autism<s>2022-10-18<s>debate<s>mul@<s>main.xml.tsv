JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I had not planned to speak at this stage. Does the Chairman want to move on to someone else because there are a couple of specific questions that I want to think about?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. O'Regan for his presentation and for the other interventions as well. They are helpful. I want to try to get a better understanding of where the school inclusion model pilot is. When it was initially set up in 2018 by, I think, the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was looking at employing two co-ordinators and then the assumption was that the specialists and the therapists would come from the HSE. I am checking out information going back to 2021, when 31 speech and language and occupational therapist, OTs, were to be recruited by the NCSE. Has there been a shift? I am listening to some of the witnesses' language and I hope I am not quoting Mr. O'Regan incorrectly by saying that he said that one cannot put something into every school. I totally understand the challenges around this, but where are we with that pilot? We are four years into it. I know there is an independent evaluation being carried out at the moment by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI. Maybe that is finished. Is that evaluation finished or is it ongoing?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry to interrupt but I am conscious of the time and the Chairman will rightly cut my time shortly. Is the model now within the competency of the NCSE?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is very difficult to get a perspective on this issue because it seems that NCSE has become the employer of occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Such posts should be under the competency of the HSE. I understand what was said about the culture, the three months and the lifestyle of students outside of school. Will the ESRI evaluation show the value of the people that the HSE had deployed in 2018 and 2019 before Covid-19 hit? Surely the evaluation will see the value in having speech and language therapists in schools. The difference is just a building. If a parent has to bring a child from school to go and meet the speech and language therapist in a different building, is there not value from a HSE point of view in providing in-school therapy in schools?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegation for their discretion. For what it is worth, I am not looking for a response. My own county and constituency are not included in the pilot scheme. There are nurse specialists in schools and the scheme has completely changed the dynamic of schools and reminds us that people are individuals. Maybe the evaluation might point to something.
