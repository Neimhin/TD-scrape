JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus a chomhghleacaithe, Ms Maeve Collins, Mr. Pat Kelly agus Mr. Daniel Griffin ón Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha. Beidh díospóireacht ann leis an gcomhchoiste. We will be discussing the outcome of the Conference on the Future of Europe and the outcome of the latest General Affairs Council with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members know the drill with regard to the Leinster House complex and the constitutional requirement. We need to be on campus if we want to engage.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you for that. You referenced energy in your remarks and I have no doubt some members will want to raise that with you. This committee has a piece of work on that coming up shortly. Deputy Haughey is first, to be followed by Deputy Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Next is Deputy Richmond, followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious the deputy permanent representative to the EU, Ms Maeve Collins, is present.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Sorry, she is the former deputy permanent representative.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will ask a question in the context of Ms Collins's former role. One of the things we picked up on when we went to Romania and Moldova was a clear message coming from politicians that because of the war they are now getting attention they were not getting previously. Is attention to eastern bloc countries something Ms Collins believes was missing prior to the war? I know that she was quite proactive in her previous role as ambassador to Finland. I met her there and much good work is going on in Finland. It is not right to collectively build a fence around all eastern bloc countries but the sense we got from Romania - Deputy Howlin was there as well and Deputies Ó Murchú and Haughey were on a recent trip to Georgia - was that because of the war it is now getting attention. Is that something Europe is conscious of? Did we miss a beat up to that? Do we concentrate too much on the western side? I have spoken to the Spanish ambassador in the recent past and there is a sense we are not doing enough for the southern Mediterranean. Is there a periphery-core issue? We all live through it in this country, where because we on the periphery we sometimes feel we do not get the same attention as others. Is that a thing? I wanted to send back that message. That is why we will continue as a committee to focus on Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and the Balkan states. A representative appeared before this committee, Mrs. Eli Bojadjieska Ristovski, on behalf of North Macedonia. As a committee, we will continue to use our influence, presence and industry to try to build on those connections because at present Europe is very driven and very anxious to ensure accession for the Balkan states, in addition to looking at a roadmap for the likes of Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. It would be interesting to hear both the Minister of State and Ms Collins's opinions on that. 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is not an opinion.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	This was a consistent message that came from politicians in Romania.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is not about the Minister of State. It is about the situation prior to his appointment, going back before Covid and over the past ten to 20 years.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State should not be defensive. It is not a criticism of what we are doing as a country. It was an observation made by many people about Europe, not about Ireland. That was the sense we got. I do not think I am talking out of line when I say that is what we picked up. At the end of the day, there is a massive focus on that region now. There is now a pathway for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. It is all good. The committee wanted to alert the Minister of State to the fact that we will continue to do that. Beimid ag bogadh ar aghaidh leis an obair atá i gceist le tíortha na mBalcán, an Mhacadóin Thuaidh, an Chosaiv, an Albáin, an tSeirbia agus Montainéagró, agus beimid ag amharc ar an obair atá i gceist leis an Úcráin, an Mholdóiv agus an tSeoirsia fosta. Beimid i dteagmháil leis na finnéithe amach anseo. Gabhaim buíochas leo ar son an choiste fá choinne a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht inniu. Fanfaimid i dteagmháil ar na hábhair éagsúla amach anseo.
