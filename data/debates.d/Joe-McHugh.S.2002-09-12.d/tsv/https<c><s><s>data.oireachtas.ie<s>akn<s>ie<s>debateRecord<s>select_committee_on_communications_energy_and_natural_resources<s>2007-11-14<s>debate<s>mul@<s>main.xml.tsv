JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being late.  I join other speakers on this side in congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  Some weeks ago he announced his plans for the 100% roll-out of broadband.  I look forward to interpreting his definition of "100% roll-out" during the coming months and years.
