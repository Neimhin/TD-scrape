JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I look forward to the reply with the specific data I seek as I am only working on anecdotal information at this stage.  From my information, between 2001 and 2007 more than 111 rescue missions in Lough Foyle were carried out by Malin Head rescue centre.  Within that figure there were a number of joint operations between the rescue centres in Clyde in Scotland, Belfast and Malin Head.  These joint operations used each other's intelligence in a collaborative way and have been going on for many years.  I have singled out Lough Foyle because it is unique on the island as we have a joint jurisdiction under the auspices of the Loughs Agency.  The two jurisdictions have worked together to manage the fishing operations in Lough Foyle.The issue I wish to raise is of the utmost importance.  Before North-South joint operations and connectivity, and cross-Border co-operation, when the Rev. Dr. Ian Paisley was leading the charge against working in a collaborative way, we had unique relationships regarding marine safety on this island.  There were operations involving services based in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Malin Head at a time when such collaboration did not appear to exist.  However, there has been a unique understanding, interrelationship and interdependence between services based in three jurisdictions, namely, Malin Head, Clyde and Northern Ireland.I have a number of questions for the Minister of State though I accept he will not have a reply for me tonight.  What consultation has gone on between our Department of Transport, which has responsibility for the marine, and the Northern Administration regarding the proposed closure of the station at Malin Head?  What consultation has taken place between the Loughs Agency and the Department of Transport regarding the proposed closure of that station?  What consultation has taken place at the North-South Ministerial Council, which proposes that there should be North-South co-operation on aquaculture and marine issues?  These are the questions that need to be answered.  What consultation has taken place between the Scottish Administration and our Minister regarding the proposed closure of the station at Malin Head?  I ask this because there have been ongoing rescue missions involving the Scottish service based in Clyde and the service in Malin Head.  Has the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body been consulted by the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, regarding this issue?  If it has, why have I not been consulted as a member of that body?  If it has not been consulted, the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body must be asked whether the Scottish Administration has been consulted regarding the proposed closure of the station at Malin Head?Regarding proposed new funding avenues through INTERREG, what consultation regarding the proposed closure of the station at Malin Head has taken place between the Department and the Scottish agencies that were seeking transnational links between Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction?  An area of interest to you, a Cheann Comhairle, is Valentia and the southern channel.  What consultations have taken place with French authorities regarding the proposed closure of the station at Valentia?There are so many questions regarding the intrinsic relationships and linkages of the existing infrastructure in Valentia and Malin Head that have not been answered.  The rigid tool of the administrative stroke of a pen is being used to close a station at Malin Head, taking away all the good work and capacity building that has gone on over the years between three jurisdictions.This decision goes against our constitutional rights because we bought into the Good Friday Agreement and into integrated strategies for the marine and aquaculture.  We are removing existing infrastructure, interrelationships and interdependence, North and South.  We are making a serious mistake.  What external consultation has taken place outside the Department of Transport regarding these issues?  These are important issues that need to be clarified.
