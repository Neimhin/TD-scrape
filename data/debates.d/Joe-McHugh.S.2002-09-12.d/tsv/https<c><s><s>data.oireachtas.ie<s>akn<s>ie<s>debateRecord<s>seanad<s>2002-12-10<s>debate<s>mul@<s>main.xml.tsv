JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Last week in the budget a cutback of 15% in the capital allowance scheme for hotels over seven years was announced. This will prevent investment in hotels. I refer to the BMW region where tourism infrastructure is at an embryonic stage and the tourism industry is not as well established as it is elsewhere. I ask the Leader to contact the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to establish whether it would be possible to introduce a period of grace of between three and six months prior to the termination of the scheme. Certain individuals have invested upwards of €100,000 in the scheme but banks are not willing to give them a commitment on funding and they have been left high and dry.I will raise this matter later in the week when the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism comes to the House, but I would appreciate it if the Leader mentioned it to him this afternoon. The BMW region only exists on paper. It must be taken seriously. The country must be dealt with on a regional basis because every decision made centrally affects those who live in peripheral areas.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share my time with Senator Terry. While rushing down the corridor to get here, I heard a lot of shouting on the television. Senator Ormonde was speaking with passion. The only thing I heard was her reference to the reality on the ground, at which point I thought she was attacking the Minister, but maybe it was unwise of me to think like that. I have to agree with her in relation to the demand for houses that exists. There is a question of supply and demand in regard to social housing and housing in general.On coming to this House I was under the illusion that it was a Chamber in which we could debate and tease things out. The whole debate on social housing infrastructure has been bypassed today because this Stage of the Bill has to pass through the House this evening. If I had my way it would not go through as quickly.Let us consider the urban social housing problems that exist in every town, be it Ennis or Letterkenny. Recently in Letterkenny, we purchased over 100 excellently built houses from a private developer. However, the people living for the past 10 or 15 years in local authority houses – houses which may not be of the same quality as the new ones – put themselves on the transfer list for the new, high quality houses. All of a sudden, there was a movement from one particular housing estate in Letterkenny to a newer, brighter estate, maybe a mile and a half up the road. This movement created a void in the original housing estate, a place that may have a stigma associated with it, and people on the housing list are actually turning down the vacant houses there.The reality of the problem is that we have no plan in respect of social housing. We have no vision. All we are doing is reacting to the demand and supply imbalance. We had an opportunity in the past five years to redress this problem and look at the human infrastructural project. I refer specifically to urban estates as I have not yet dealt with rural social housing.There is a big drive for voluntary housing projects in rural areas. I do not know where the agencies concerned came from, how they are vetted or how they are formed. However, voluntary housing agencies are operating in rural towns and villages and providing social housing. That is not the way forward for the social housing project because the people who have been allocated these houses will never own them.I would like a buy-out option in respect of voluntary housing because we have an innate belief in ownership. We like to own our houses and we are not actually providing people with that opportunity in rural areas if we just supply voluntary housing. I want this included as a technical aspect of this Bill.The social housing project does not extend to rural areas. There is a pullback concerning the specific instance cottage. There is no obligation on local authorities to provide for the specific instance cottage in rural areas. I am not talking about providing social housing on an ad hoc, once-off basis, but about providing housing that was provided 100 years ago in rural areas of Donegal or west Clare. Senator Dooley will appreciate that there would have been clogháin of maybe four to five houses together in a nucleus. That is not being addressed in the Bill.We have a duty to debate the housing issue but we are not being allowed to do that today. I am actually taken aback and I agree with Senator O'Meara's reaction to the time constraints. I understand where the Minister is coming from – he is reacting to a supply and demand issue – but if we are to spend our time reacting to issues in this or the other House, God help the social infrastructural project. There is not even a mention of recreational parks in housing estates.There should be an inter-agency or inter-ministerial brief at this level. If there is an increase in crime or problems in places such as Letterkenny or urban areas like Limerick, one sees inter-agency approaches being adopted by the health board, the relevant Department, such as the Department or Social and Family Affairs, and the Garda. They are reacting. Everybody in the country is reacting and it is time we woke up and realised the real debate should take place in this Chamber without time constraints such as those imposed on us today.
