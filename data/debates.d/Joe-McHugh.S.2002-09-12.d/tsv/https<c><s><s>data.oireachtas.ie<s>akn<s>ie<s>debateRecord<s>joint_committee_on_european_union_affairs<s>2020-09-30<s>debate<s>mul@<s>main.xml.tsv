JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom ar dtús báire fáilte is fiche a chur romhaibh chuig an gcoiste inniu agus go háirithe roimh na Seanadóirí agus na Teachtaí a bhuaigh bhur n-aitheantas agus bhur suíocháin den chéad uair i mbliana. Is léir go mbeidh clár tábhachtach romhainn, go deimhin, leis an tionchar suntasach atá bainte amach le Covid-19. Beidh bealach difriúil de dhíth agus táim ag dúil go mór leis an obair thábhachtach agus leis an gcomhoibriú tríd an gcoiste seo. Is é mo thuairime go bhfuil gá mór orainn leis an dualgas agus leis an bhfreagracht atá orainn agus táim tiomanta go mbeidh mé, tríd an ról seo, neamhspleách agus féaráilte le linn an ama atá ríomhainn. I am delighted to have been given the honour to chair this committee. I want to note the Irish aspect and significance of our first language. In 2007, Irish became an officially recognised language of the European Union and the derogation will be lifted in January 2021, just a couple of months from now. At any opportunity, we have to promote the use of our language. We have an enormous pool of people working in the translation service in Kildare Street, which is an incredible resource. Perhaps, through the clerk, we can promote that also through this committee. Apologies have been received from Deputies Haughey, Harkin and Duffy, and Senator Keogan. Deputy Harkin is running late as she is speaking on the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2020 in the House.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call for nominations for the position of Vice Chairman.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Richmond for making the nomination and Deputy Calleary for seconding it. Are there other nominations?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have had two nominations for the position of Vice Chairman. We will record a voice vote for each nomination in the order in which they were made.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Comhghairdeas to Deputy Howlin. We will now go into private session.
