JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is good opposition. The Senator will get used to it after a while.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I commend Deputies Kenny and Perry on raising this matter. It is indicative of an effective Opposition that has been working well in the past two years and a team of people who are getting ready to enter Government. It is a good omen for a team that will be capable and professional, when in Government.As regards the remuneration of moneys owed to people who were otherwise charged illegally, it is important that the public has confidence in what is being done. If there is to be a remuneration in excess of €1 billion, it is important that the litigators do not take a surplus of what is available. That is to be welcomed.Senator Minihan mentioned that the Tánaiste has done a good job since this issue was highlighted. She had no choice. It is as simple as that. She had to do a good job. An illegal technicality was identified and she had no choice. It is important that the public has confidence in the disbursement of moneys to the people from whom it was taken, illegitimately. A wider debate should be mandatory as regards care of the elderly and it is incumbent on us as legislators to begin that debate. Perhaps this is a watershed as regards opening a debate on the elderly. It is certain, however, that there is a serious equality issue as regards care of the elderly.The symbolism of an elderly person handing over his or her pension book to either a private or public nursing home is disturbing. Such a practice is inequitable and wrong. I am in total agreement that one has to pay for services, but to require the handing over of a pension book to a public or private body is to treat people discriminately and this must be addressed. To give an example, there would be uproar if we were to insist that parents hand over their children's allowance for pre-school care or require people to surrender their unemployment assistance to go on courses. People would not accept that. There would be a revolution if we started to demand unemployment assistance from the unemployed or the children's allowance from parents. Equally, it is wrong to ask people who have worked relentlessly and tirelessly in this State over the years, the elderly, to hand over their pension books and we have a serious inequality issue as a result.If elderly people are functionally dependent or have cognitive needs that need taking care of, they cannot be treated differently from any other citizen. They still have to be treated on an equal basis. As a practical example, I will ask the Minister of State, through the Chair, how he would feel on his retirement, if he had to hand over his Oireachtas pension to some authorities, and it was taken away from him week by week and he never saw a penny of it.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Joking aside, there is an issue regarding the symbolic nature of handing over moneys in the form of a pension, assistance or an entitlement to a private or public body. Leaving the Minister of State's spouse or family to one side, I believe it is wrong and there is a serious equality issue to be addressed.As regards access and funding there is need for a comprehensive debate on private and public nursing homes. On the east coast there are many elderly people in high income brackets who are holding out to get into public community nursing homes. They are holding out, in certain instances, because they do not want to go into private nursing homes. If one is paying €800 a week to a private nursing home and, let us say, the subvention is €680, down the line the cost of care may increase but the subvention may stay the same. There are problems and concerns in that regard.There should be equal assessment between community homes and private homes. One is not financially assessed in a public nursing home whereas one is assessed in a private home. Anomalies exist between the treatment of public and private nursing home patients, which must also be addressed.As regards transparency, we have an ever-expanding elderly population base and they have to be taken care of. We must look at different avenues for treating them on an equal basis and for moving forward on the equality issue. Before Christmas I raised with the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, an issue regarding the 21 day rule for patients in private nursing homes. Senator Leyden will be aware of this as he was present. If an elderly person breaks a leg and has to convalesce in a community nursing home, the person will have to pay after 21 days. That is a discrimination issue, because someone in a public hospital may stay longer than 21 days but will not have to pay.The debate on how nursing homes have been developed has not been addressed and we need to look at this. In the past, we had public and private nursing homes. Private nursing homes were successful due to the fact that they were family led. I am aware of many private nursing homes across Ireland which have been family led. They have been a success story.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I want to make one last point. The Chairman should allow me some discretion because I found it hard to concentrate on my contribution with the talking that was going on behind me. It is rather difficult to make a contribution when one is being interrupted.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We must address the fundamentals of investment in nursing homes. At present a developer-led syndicate is driving construction which is opposed to the type of private nursing home that we had for years, which was family led and gave credibility to the sector. However, at present, syndicates of rich, successful businessmen are getting tax-breaks to feed into the construction and operation of nursing homes. This is an ethical issue because it is detaching the family run element and it allows outsiders to come into the sector. They have to provide for a matron who may not have an emotional attachment to the nursing home.I have tried to make three important points today. The first is in regard to equality and how we treat older people. We all live in Peter Pan's world and we think we will not get old. When I get old — I do not know when will be the cut-off point, perhaps it will be when I reach 100 years of age — I would like to be treated the same as every other citizen in this country. The second point deals with the transparency between the community nursing homes and the private nursing homes and the financial assessment of each. The third point——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Absolutely. Perhaps somewhere in Boyle, County Roscommon.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Chairman's latitude. The final point is that we must have a serious debate on who or what is driving the provision of nursing homes. Is it the construction industry or is it people interested in the care of the elderly?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I took due deliberation in preparing this Adjournment matter as it is one which should not be taken lightly. To address the broader perspective of cancer incidence, one in three people in this country will develop cancer. Another frightening statistic is that 60% of cancers will develop in the elderly. If this is the case, it is important we maintain cancer services on a regional basis and are not sucked into the madness of centralising cancer services, which is the mantra of many reports of recent years. Centralising cancer services is not the way forward and we must be careful not to go down that road.To be parochial, Letterkenny General Hospital needs a colorectal surgeon, a breast surgeon and a radiation oncologist. These appointments must be made in the short term. In conjunction with these services, a super-regional centre from where these services will operate is also needed.The leaked elements of the O'Higgins report suggest that breast cancer services will operate in a centralised manner. It has been insinuated that the north west will eventually link up with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. However, this will not be the case. The now defunct North Western Health Board exhausted every avenue in trying to link up with Altnagelvin Hospital. It is not good enough for reports to repeatedly state that north-west cancer services will be facilitated through that hospital or through Northern Ireland services. It is not and will not be the case and we must consider decentralising services.There is need for a full-time breast surgeon at Letterkenny General Hospital. Recent reports suggest it will take until 2007 for breast services to be relocated or decentralised to the west and north west. This is a scandal for the simple reason that in 2000 other areas had their breast screening services rolled out. That women between the ages of 50 and 64 living in the west and north west will not have these services in the short to medium term is a scandal, a disgrace and a matter which must be addressed in every possible way by the Government.While unnecessary bureaucracy is a problem, breast screening services must be rolled out. We cannot blame bureaucracy; we must believe there is political will, but many in the north west do not believe it exists. One frightening and glaring statistic is that cancer death rates can be reduced by 25% in women detected through a screening programme. These services do not exist in the west and north west and, therefore, the women who cannot avail of them are in more danger of developing cancer in comparison to their eastern counterparts. This is an absolute disgrace. People in the west and Donegal pay taxes. Do they not deserve a service that women in the east are receiving? This is a rhetorical question because it is a disgrace that women are faced with such a predicament.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will finish on this point. In Northern Ireland alone there are four screening centres in Lurgan, Antrim, Belfast and Altnagelvin, spread out on a regional basis. Others areas in Northern Ireland are not disadvantaged by these services whereas the west and the north-west are so disadvantaged.No consultant radiation oncologist is visiting Letterkenny at present. This means patients must travel to Dublin on the N2-A5 road for treatment. This road is an infrastructural nightmare, although that is an issue for another day. The situation in Letterkenny is disgraceful. Cancer services must be addressed because one in three people will develop cancer. Some 25% of women will survive if they are screened properly.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the intervention and latitude, but this is something that I feel strongly and passionately enough about to speak on behalf of the women of the west and Northern Ireland. All they are seeking is a service to which they are entitled.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is a frightening response because it does not give me clarity or hope to anyone who lives in the west or north west. The Minister of State said the Tánaiste is confident that the target date of 2007 for the national expansion will be met. What indicators has the Tánaiste used that allow her to be as confident? It means nothing to me because, in 2002, the target date was 2005.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Tánaiste invoke confidence on this side of the House and in the people of the west by making a complete commitment to the programme's full expansion to the west? This area was not even mentioned.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Cathaoirleach is in the same boat as myself, so I know he understands.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	An extended reply, please.
