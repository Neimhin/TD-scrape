JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  The overwhelming message is that considerable progress has been made in recent years.  It must be acknowledged that considerable progress has been made in road safety as a result of policies such as the 2007 road investigation policy, in addition to the 2007 policy on the preservation of the scene, the 2010 to 2112 effective roads policing and the 2010 speed enforcement zones.  Too many people have died on our roads.  The families of those who have died pay the ultimate price to make our roads safer.  That is a given and everybody can acknowledge that.Mr. Barry from the National Roads Authority referred to the responsibility of the Oireachtas for legislation.  There is a role for legislators to ensure that certain decisions are made, but it is more important to ensure that there is responsibility and culpability and that a mechanism is in place to establish this.  Mr. Noel Brett from the Road Safety Authority stated that the RSA does not have that engineering competence or statutory functions.  A number of agencies have made presentations today.  However, the absence of a representative from the local authorities, which have a function in road safety, is worth noting.  We have a plethora of agencies, but none with overall responsibility for road accidents.Prior to 2006 the checks and balances that are in place now were not in place.  That is the reason the three families who are present cannot get closure on the loss of their loved ones.  The sad point is that checks have been put in place because they and every family that lost a loved one on the roads in recent years paid the ultimate price.How do we facilitate closure for the families of those who lost a loved one prior to 2006 and have received ambiguous reports?  They may have attended the inquest but this did not bring closure.  What can we do for the people who have made the roads safer for our sons and daughters?  Do we not owe it to them to discover their needs?  We owe them a big debt.  They have lost their loved ones and the question is how do we enable them to get closure?  I know this is a very open question that can be side-stepped to an extent.
