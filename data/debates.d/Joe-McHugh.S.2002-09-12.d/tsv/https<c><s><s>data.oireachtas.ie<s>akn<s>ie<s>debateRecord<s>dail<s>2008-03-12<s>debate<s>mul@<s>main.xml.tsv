JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Given the ongoing negotiations between the Minister and her Northern counterpart, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, her Department seems willing to put taxpayers' money into a new radiotherapy centre in the north west.  Why does she continue to state there will be eight centres of excellence?  Will this affect a potential ninth centre in the north west?  Does the Minister have more confidence in the Northern Ireland administration to roll out cancer services than the administration here?
