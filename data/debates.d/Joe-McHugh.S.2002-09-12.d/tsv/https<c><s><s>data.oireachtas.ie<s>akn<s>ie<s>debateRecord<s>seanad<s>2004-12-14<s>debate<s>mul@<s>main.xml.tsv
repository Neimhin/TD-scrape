JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the call for a debate on this issue of knives. It is important to note that young garda√≠ who deal with junkies on a daily basis in Dublin do not have the simple provision of a protective vest. Such provision would represent a simple solution to their needs. They find themselves in volatile situations and the provision of a simple protective vest would be a start in dealing with this problem.I am delighted there will be a debate on Northern Ireland. Without going into the political aspects of the issue, I wish to point out that industry has a part to play in regard to such a debate. I will give one example. If one is driving between Carndonagh and Quigley's Point in north Donegal, which as we are all aware is in the Twenty-six Counties, one is welcomed by Vodafone to the United Kingdom. For a Border area, such a sign is sensitive in terms of nationality. Many people find it offensive to be welcomed to the United Kingdom in Donegal. Industry has a part to play in such a debate. Vodafone, in particular, has a part to play. It has had a monopoly for a considerable time which I hope will change under ComReg regulations.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	And every Donegal woman.
