JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would like to be associated with Deputy McGinley's calls for clarification on Altnagelvin radiotherapy services.  We have a system and not a people problem.  Paramedics are required to remain with their patients on the corridors of accident and emergency units.  In one instance, a paramedic had to spend up to three hours with a patient on an accident and emergency corridor at Letterkenny General Hospital.  Ambulances are not being moved from forecourts because paramedics have to stay with their patients.  This happens because the infrastructure required is not in place, namely, the new accident and emergency medical assessment unit needs to be fast-tracked and we do not have resources.  For example, there are nine vacant junior doctor positions at Letterkenny General Hospital which cannot be filled.There are many assistant physicians in this country with the same expertise as general practitioners.  Why are these not considered possible replacements or substitutes for junior doctors?  This would help free up the gridlock.  We have a system problem and not a people or staff problem.  The only way to sort this out is to hold the general election.
