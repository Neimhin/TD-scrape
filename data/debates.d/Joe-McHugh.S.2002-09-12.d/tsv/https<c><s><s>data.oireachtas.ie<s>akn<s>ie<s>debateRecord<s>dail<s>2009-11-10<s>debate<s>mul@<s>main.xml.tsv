JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the brief time I have I wish to highlight some issues relating to Iarnród Éireann and issues of public accountability related to the National Roads Authority.  I commend the efforts of our party spokesperson on transport, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, in tabling the motion.  Not only does it challenge the lack of financial accountability, it also challenges the lack of public accountability.  In my short time in the House I have tabled 20 parliamentary questions related to national primary and secondary roads which have been disallowed for answer.  Given the times in which we live and the need of people for more transparency that is no way to carry out democracy and it does nothing to legitimise our role as Members representing our constituencies.The first casualty of poor public accountability is safety.  I refer the Minister to a specific example in my constituency.  I do not take the opportunity to be parochial but if the Minister were to assist, many safety issues arising throughout the country, such as those highlighted by Deputy O'Mahony, could be addressed.  If one were to carry out a safety audit on the N56 outside Letterkenny, a new road, well built and constructed, several issues would arise.  Safety anomalies arise related to footpath provision, lack of public lighting, safety issues outside a primary school and a lack of turning lanes.  Such issues create numerous hazards on that stretch of road.  There were two car accidents as recently as this weekend and in the past three or four months there have been numerous other car accidents on this stretch of road.  The Minister's Department, not the NRA, should carry out a safety audit on this stretch of road.  Only then would the Minister gather an insight into the problems associated with this stretch of road and many similar roads throughout the country.The missing link is in respect of public accountability.  No one among the county councillors, the executive level in Donegal County Council or the Members has the parliamentary privilege of a single line answer in respect of the NRA, which is not acceptable. I am pleased our colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, has put this matter into the thrust of the motion.I recognise CIE is referred to in the motion but CIE is the parent company of Iarnród Éireann and it is this company to which I refer.  Between 2002 and 2006 some €1.3 billion was spent on railway infrastructure in the country, including new rail on the western rail corridor, to which Deputy Paul Connaughton referred.  This money was also spent on the upgrade of new infrastructure in respect of rail or transportation cargo.  Within the €1.3 billion allocation there was a 3% contribution from Europe, which would have come from the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency.  My figures indicate a sum of €39.6 million came from Europe.  I cannot establish where this money was spent.  The Minister must indicate, either by contacting Iarnród Éireann or through the good offices of the Department, where this money was spent.  Was it spent on the Cork to Dublin railway line or was it spent on the Dublin to Belfast railway line, for which it would have been intended because of the trans-European cross-Border funding mechanism?  At present, Iarnród Éireann will only provide a figure for the Belfast to Cork route, which implies it is not willing to breakdown the percentage spent on the Dublin to Belfast and the Dublin to Cork route.  My fear is that money may have been used specifically for the Cork to Dublin line.  If the Minister's figures show the majority of the money was spent on the Cork to Dublin line, the implication is funding on a cross-Border basis was used for the Cork to Dublin line.  My geography and my education inform me the line from Cork to Dublin does not cross the Border.  If this is the case and if the figures show the vast majority of funding was spent on the Cork to Dublin corridor, there must be accountability.  The public deserves such accountability, especially since there was once an all-island railway link and perhaps that is what we should pursue rather than to consider drawing down money in an non-accountable way.
