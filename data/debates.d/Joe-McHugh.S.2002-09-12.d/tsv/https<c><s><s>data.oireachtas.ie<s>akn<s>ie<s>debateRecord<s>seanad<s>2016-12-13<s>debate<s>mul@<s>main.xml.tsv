JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh an gceist seo atá thar a bheith tábhachtach. Bhí mé i mo Sheanadóir ó 2002 go dtí 2007 agus gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis na Seanadóirí as an bhfáilte go dtí an Teach inniu. I thank the Senator for placing this important topic on the agenda. The roles occupied by him and me bear testament to the strong commitment of the Government and the Taoiseach, in particular, to the diaspora. I have had the privilege of serving as the State’s second Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, following former Deputy Jimmy Deenihan. The role was created by the Taoiseach in 2014. The Senator was nominated to this House by the Taoiseach in recognition of his strong record in advocating for Irish immigrants abroad, particularly in the United States. I welcome the opportunity to brief the House on our approach to immigration reform in the United States and work to further develop links with the Irish community in that country. This topic is particularly relevant and timely given the recent presidential and congressional elections in the United States. As Senators will be aware, the new President will be inaugurated on 20 January 2017. Members of the House will appreciate the relationship between Ireland and the United States is complex and multi-layered. It is based on shared values, as well as our deep political and economic ties. These links are reinforced by the close family links between our two countries which go back many generations and have been sustained by migratory flows across the Atlantic. The Government is acutely conscious of the issue of immigration reform in the United States. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, other members of the Government and I have regular engagement with the diaspora whenever we travel. Our embassy network also does great work in maintaining links between the diaspora and Ireland, with recent arrivals and those whose forebears left Ireland many generations ago. In my capacity as the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, it is my job to connect with and support Irish communities abroad. I am charged with the implementation of our diaspora strategy and committed to our emigrant support programme. I have seen the benefits of that programme first hand when meeting Irish communities and their representatives in cities, including Boston, San Francisco and New York. I acknowledge the Senator's role in part of the visit to Boston where he introduced me to a number of people he knows and in introducing me to the nuances of issues in dealing with those who are undocumented. I take the opportunity to pay tribute to the immigration centres that carry out important work and ensure the Government is kept apprised of challenges facing the community. That contact is vital and I look forward to further engagement with the professional and committed staff who work on a daily basis with Irish immigrants in the United States, including those who are undocumented. The Government has adopted a two-pronged approach to immigration reform in the United States. We are seeking to regularise the status of those who are undocumented and also pursuing a dedicated quota for legal immigration from Ireland. We have and will continue to press for a solution for the undocumented Irish. The support of politicians in the United States is essential and during my recent visit to Boston, I had the opportunity to meet Governor Baker of Massachusetts, Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston and representatives of local organisations. While a new US Administration and a new Congress will take time to settle in, nevertheless, the Government will continue to pursue this issue in our contacts with the new Administration and congressional leaders and to encourage and promote viable prospects for a solution to the plight of those who are undocumented.  The Government continues to strongly advocate on the issue of immigration reform in the United States at every appropriate opportunity with our contacts in the United States, including at the highest level. The Taoiseach has raised the subject with President Obama on a number of occasions and more recently we are aware that President-elect Trump has made some public comments on his planned policies around immigration. The Taoiseach raised the matter of immigration reform with both President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence last month. Furthermore, the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, raised the matter with Speaker Paul Ryan on 23 November last. Speaker Ryan, a proud Irish-American with a keen understanding of the importance the Government attaches to this issue, indicated that he was hopeful of progress on this issue in the new Congress. I acknowledge the work of our embassy in Washington DC and our consulates across the United States which continue to set out Ireland’s position on immigration reform at every opportunity. I note that Ambassador Anderson will host a meeting with key stakeholders in the Irish-American community, including the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, on the issue of immigration reform at the Embassy of Ireland, in Washington DC on 12 January next. Engagements by the Taoiseach, the Minister and other members of the Government in the United States in mid-March on the occasion of St. Patrick’s Day will afford us an early opportunity to engage with the new US Administration at the highest level on issues of concern to Ireland, in particular immigration reform.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I again thank the Senator. I will point to the very real human stories behind the issue. The Senator knows them at a personal level in Chicago and other places. I met someone who had been in the United States since 1986. To put the matter into perspective, that was the year I did what was not the junior certificate but the intermediate certificate examinations at the time. That man has remained undocumented since 1986, which demonstrates the real human impact. Another person told me that he had put his two teenagers on a plane to Ireland, although he could not join them. The Senator knows the stories and has heard the anecdotes too. The clear message I get from the undocumented Irish in America is that there has to be a solution. There is always a solution. I think that is part of the Irish psyche. Our backs have been against the wall many times. I spoke about the tradition of migratory flows on the other side of the Atlantic, but they have not been just to America directly; they have also been through Canada, as well as to the United Kingdom, in the main, and the rest of the world. It is when their backs are against the wall that Irish people deliver. That is when they try to figure things out. The consistent request that has been made of me in my role is for the Government to sustain the pressure. We are doing it at the highest level. I am open to suggestion from this House and continuing the relationship with the Senator, whose position offers a vital foothold into American communities. We have to keep this issue high on the agenda. I am prepared to return to the United States early in the new year to meet communities there again and keep the issue live. On a final note and in agreement with the Senator's first remarks, we do live in a different world. It is a world where perhaps minds are dominated by fear, retreat and isolationism. However, the Irish are global in their outlook and confident in facing the worst of adversity. We also are pragmatic and able to come up with common-sense solutions. Given the 36 million to 37 million people who claim Irish ancestry and the massive amount of business conducted on an east-west basis through foreign direct investment in this country and vice versa, we have a concrete relationship with the United States. There is hope. We have a duty to figure this out and find a solution.
