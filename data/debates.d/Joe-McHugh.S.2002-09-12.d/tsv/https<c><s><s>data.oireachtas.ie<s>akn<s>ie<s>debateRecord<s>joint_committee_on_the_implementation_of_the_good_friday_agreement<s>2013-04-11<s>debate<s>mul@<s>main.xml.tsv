JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	This week marks the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, a fact which I am sure everyone will agree is reflected in national and international press coverage. Recently I attended an event for academia and politicians at the British Academy in London organised by Lord Paul Bew, an architect of the Good Friday Agreement, which acknowledged its 15th anniversary and looked to the future of the peace process. Yesterday I participated in an event at the US embassy in Dublin attended by representatives of many embassies to mark the 15th anniversary of the Agreement. Internationally, there is still a strong positive focus on what has happened and developments in Northern Ireland. The overwhelming observation was that while we still had the ongoing challenges presented by legacy issues, community relations and sectarianism, added to the wake-up call of the protests in recent months, we should look at the positives and the progress made in the past 15 years. I look forward to continuing my working relationship with the committee and its members while we face the technical challenges presented by outstanding issues such as the North-South Consultative Forum and the review of the North-South bodies.  I would like our guests today to know that the committee has been focused on working at grassroots level. We have engaged with Nationalist and loyalist communities, primarily in Belfast, and hope to continue this work. We intend to visit Belfast on 3 and 4 May to engage with these communities.If issues on the ground need to be addressed, we intend to be there with people and communities. Our role is limited, but the overwhelming feedback has been to the effect that those involved want people to listen, to be willing to help and to be shoulder to shoulder with them. We intend to continue with that work. With that in mind, I am delighted to have such a range of speakers in attendance. We look forward to their observations on the work in which they are involved. They probably have not brought a crystal ball with them, but predicting Northern Ireland's future journey would be difficult. In attendance is Professor Brandon Hamber, director of the International Conflict Research Institute, INCORE, an associate site of the United Nations that is based out of the University of Ulster. He is also a Mellon distinguished visiting scholar in the school of human and community development and the African Centre for Migration and Society at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. I welcome Professor Hamber. We are also joined by Dr. Neil Jarman, director of the Institute for Conflict Research, ICR, who has carried out research on such issues as street violence, disputes over parades, the management of public order, police reform, racist and homophobic violence and human rights in a number of countries, including Northern Ireland, South Africa, the USA, Israel, Palestine, Kosovo and Nepal. He was an adviser to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland during the disputes over Orange Order parades in the 1990s and a specialist adviser to the Northern Ireland Affairs Select Committee during its 2004-05 inquiry into hate crimes. He works with the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights and the Organisation of Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, as a member of an international panel tasked with drafting guidelines relating to law and practice on freedom of assembly. We are also joined by Mr. Peter Sheridan, OBE. He officially took on the role of chief executive officer of Co-operation Ireland on 1 January 2009. As he has presented to the committee previously, I welcome him back. His role is to lead the organisation strategically as it moves into the next phase of its development. He was a police officer for 30 years, starting as a cadet officer in 1978. He did much of his service in the north west of Northern Ireland in uniformed policing. Perhaps we bumped into each other during those years when I went across the Border to Strabane to do a bit of shopping and went through customs on the way back. He rose through the ranks from constable to assistant chief constable with responsibility for the rural region. If the committee agrees, I will ask our three guests to present in a group format, after which I will open the floor to members' questions and observations.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We might not answer the last question, but we really appreciate the refreshing insight of all contributors and the realistic account of the challenges presented.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will now hand back to panellists. Rather than everyone answering each question individually, will people pick out a few questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our next three offerings are from Mr. Mark Durkan, MP; Deputies Aodhán Ó Ríordáin and Seán Crowe in that order.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Will our guests provide clarification with regard to the statistics involved? When Youth Work Ireland and Youth Action Northern Ireland made their presentations, reference was made to non-registration. I do not know whether the latter is specific to particular areas, to particular Unionist-loyalist areas or wherever else. If we could obtain clarification, it would be welcome. The statistics appear to show that the picture is somewhat skewed and indicate that the majority-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is a small majority rather than the overall majority of such individuals.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Clarification in respect of this matter would be welcome.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before returning to our guests for their responses, I will take two more questions from Senators Cummins and Moran.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am sure many civil servants in the Departments of transport on both of sides of the Border will have listened to that last contribution. The panellists are free to comment on it but they may not have an insight into it. I thank the members for their thought-provoking questions which provides a degree of insight for everybody. Before returning to the panellists for their responses, I wish to ask them if there is a role for an independent honest broker outside of Westminster, Belfast and Dublin in addressing the legacy of the conflict and legacy issues in the design of some construct around dealing with the past? We would appreciate their insight on that because from our contact with those in both communities in Northern Ireland, legacy issues and the weight of the past are issues that have come up and we believe they cannot be ignored.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegates for a very enlightening and uplifting morning and early afternoon discussion. The committee appreciates their interventions. I acknowledge the more peripheral meetings which have taken place; two, in particular. The British Academy marked the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement a couple of weeks ago with Mr. Paul Bew. At the meeting I heard similar sentiments to those expressed today. We have come a long way, but there is much more work to complete. I acknowledge and thank the British Academy for organising the round table discussion. I also thank the US embassy for organising a round table yesterday to mark the 15th anniversary. The European Commission and 23 other countries were represented, which demonstrates the extent of international goodwill towards a successful outcome in Northern Ireland. It is important that the committee act as a conduit to feed back to Northern Ireland the international goodwill, efforts and offers of support. The Community Foundation for Northern Ireland is holding its conference next week on the subject of diversity. It is important that we feed back to groups such as the foundation the positive international efforts and acknowledgment of the ongoing work and commitment to the peace process. I thank the three delegates who presented this morning. They have certainly added value to our discussions and the committee appreciates their insight and honesty on the challenges that lie ahead. We are closer to the beginning than to the middle, never mind the end, of the peace process. As one man pointed out to me, it may be a 100 year project. If it is, Co-operation Ireland will be around for a while yet. However, Mr. Sheridan should not panic. Within the process, we must be open to ideas. The very good ideas and suggestions made and presented to the committee today will certainly be discussed and run with. I thank members for their contributions which certainly added a great deal of weight to this important discussion.
