JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I confirm that I was in the school yesterday and I met members of the board of management, the principal and the clerk of works. As the Deputy knows, Westmeath County Council has a service level agreement with the Department to ensure the project is completed. People are anxious to ensure the project is completed before September. I was there because I was invited down by Deputy Peter Burke. We are also anxious that this project finishes. I will not get into the detail of a contract. I have no prerogative in that regard. However, people's minds are focused to get something completed. I was there yesterday and the men were working on site.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The men were working on site. We met in a venue adjacent to the site. We were not on the construction site so I did not meet the contractor. I know from the enthusiasm and goodwill on the part of the clerk of works, the board of management and the principal that all minds should be focused on ensuring that this project is completed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Westmeath County Council is keeping the public updated. As recently as last week it stated it is aiming for a July completion. Let us hope that is realised.
