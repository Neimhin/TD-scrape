JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A group from County Kerry made a freedom of information request on operations in Valentia and in Malin Head in my backyard, but that information was not forthcoming even after paying the freedom of information fee.  I know it is not directly related to the Taoiseach's Department but the Minister beside him is at liberty to furnish that information.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do.  I refer to the issue of whether to pay money for information.  We talk about Communism and Stalinist Russia, but it is impossible to get information here.  A meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will be held next week.  As a new Deputy, I find it very difficult to get information.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not worried about myself but about the people.  The people might not be as understanding on that point.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Taoiseach intervene in respect of the salmon hardship scheme in the context of the legislation relating to the allocation of funds to drift net fishermen?  Not one fisherman on Lough Foyle has been paid by the Loughs Agency.  There is a stumbling block at EU Commission level in this regard.  Will the Taoiseach speak to the relevant Minister in respect of the men who bought into the scheme in good faith and who will, it appears, not be paid until the new year.
