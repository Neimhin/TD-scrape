JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being late.  I was at the launch of the third Journal of Cross Border Studies in Ireland.  I welcome Mr. Mullins and his team.  The last time I spoke on this issue was two years ago, when I was concerned with the parochial element of Coolkeeragh, County Derry, and extending gas supplies into County Donegal.  At the time, the case put to me by Bord Gáis was that demographics and the industrial base were not sufficient to make it feasible from a financial point of view.  Much has changed in two years and there is a lot of wind behind the sail in terms of what will happen in the north west.At the conference I attended today, the idea was expressed that we need much joined-up thinking in terms of economies of scale and the investment we must make in Northern Ireland.  We have invested €580 million in a particular road between Monaghan and Derry and ultimately to Letterkenny.  In terms of the strategic investment of this money, is collaboration ongoing between different bodies?  Bodies such as Bord Gáis could negotiate, co-operate and collaborate in joined-up thinking.  If there is to be a new road from Monaghan to Derry and a dual carriageway from Derry to Letterkenny, is Bord Gáis involved in the capital expenditure we are about to invest in roads?  If not, is there an opportunity to do so?I note Mr. Mullins's point on Gorey.  It is not necessarily demographics that decide this but the industrial base that must exist.  The chicken and egg scenario exists in the north west of the country.  Owing to regional imbalances, we have the workforce.  In the past year, the unemployment rate in the district register of Buncrana has increased by 50% for those under 25.  We have a labour force but we are not getting inward investment because we do not have the infrastructure of roads, rail, gas and ESB supplies.  The list is endless.When will State providers examine the possibilities that will emerge in Northern Ireland over the next ten years?  The Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, announced that the totality will amount to €100 billion but massive dividends will be reaped.  I ask that Bord Gáis get in on the act in terms of economies of scale and regional development, and joined-up thinking in terms of services.  This is going to happen but the reality is that the centralised system we have means that regional peripheral areas will never get anything because of the chicken and egg scenario.  The danger is that we will continue to work on the east coast.  With no disrespect to the constituency of Deputy D'Arcy or the Dublin constituency, it will work on an axis of Dublin to Belfast.  This is my genuine fear.  There is massive potential and opportunity and Derry is the fourth largest city in Ireland.  The potential exists and the spin-off benefits exist also for Donegal, and not just for reasons of nostalgia or parochialism.I came across a transcript from 1934 recently.  Donegal was a thriving economic territory of this island because the main ports were Belfast and Lisahally, County Derry.  That was stopped by partition, which is no longer there.  We are working together on new communications infrastructure and the potential is good.  We are moving forward and I ask Bord Gáis to get involved in terms of joined-up thinking and strategic alliances with different players in Departments in both jurisdictions.
