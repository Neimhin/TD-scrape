JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	This is a very difficult issue for the student and the family in question. I appreciate that and I am happy to take their details from Deputy Quinlivan later and follow up directly on this matter. I want to give a little bit of background on the system, for the record. Overall it is a very good system and I agree with the Deputy on its overall benefits and co-ordination. However, we are open to improving it. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position in relation to the common application system, CAS, for children entering secondary school in Limerick. The Deputy will be aware that a CAS was agreed between the post-primary schools in the Limerick area. This system has been in place since 2005. The CAS is the process by which the admission process for sixth class primary school children wishing to enrol in the participating post-primary schools is managed locally. There are currently 17 post-primary schools participating in the system. This administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to the enrolment processes of the schools in the area. This system is facilitated through the Limerick Education Centre on behalf of the Limerick Principals and Deputy Principals’ Association with support from my Department and to date has been working very well. The Limerick Education Centre meets with the Limerick Principals and Deputy Principals Association twice annually to review the system. On average, the centre manages between 1,750 and 1,900 applications annually and liaises with 17 post-primary schools and over 140 primary schools. Data from the system indicates that 97.5% of children received their first, second or third choice of school for the 2019-20 school year. Over 95% of pupils received their first choice. Whilst this administrative system ensures that a co-ordinated approach can be taken to enrolment processes in the area, each school authority involved in the Limerick CAS has, in accordance with the Education Act 1998, autonomy in relation to its own enrolment policy and the specific selection criteria it applies. This may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. The criteria to be applied by schools in such circumstances are a matter for the schools themselves. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Education and Training Board, ETB, school to the ETB in the first instance, where a board of management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the board, refuses to enrol a student in a school. An appeal should be made within 42 calendar days of receipt of the board of management’s decision. This appeals process is also available to any applicant using the Limerick CAS who has been refused enrolment to a school. The Education (Admission to Schools) Act was signed into law in 2018. The Act, on commencement of the relevant sections, will require schools to enrol a child where the school has places. The Act will help to support the admission processes in schools and provide greater transparency, which will help parents with their understanding of how they will work. My Department has begun the process of consultation with the education partners on the regulations that will be put in place alongside the commencement of sections of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to take the details of this case. The transition from primary school to secondary school is hard enough in itself. It is a big step up and receiving nine letters of rejection is not in keeping with the idea of a smooth flow from primary to secondary level. I reassure the Deputy that once I receive the details I will follow up directly with my officials. The Deputy mentioned the uniqueness of this system. From my own research into it I can see that it is an incredible system, where 17 post-primary schools and 140 primary schools are co-ordinated in an attempt to get the correct fit for pupils. The percentage returns, where 95% of students get their first choice, is incredible. We must also be careful that the 4%, 5% or 1%, even if it is only one person, is catered for. Perhaps with further inspection we can find a way through this issue. I am confident we can do that.
