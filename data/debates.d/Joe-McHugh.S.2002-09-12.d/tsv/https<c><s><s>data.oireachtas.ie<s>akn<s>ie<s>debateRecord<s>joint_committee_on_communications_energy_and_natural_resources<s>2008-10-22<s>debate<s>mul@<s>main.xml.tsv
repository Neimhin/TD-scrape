JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  It is important to have meetings such as this frequently.  Like Deputy Coveney I welcome the fact we had the opportunity to have an informal meeting in Buswell's Hotel a few months ago.  It would be important to continue that dialogue.  I will not ask the same question as Deputy Coveney regarding the public's concern with the difference in benefits between the public and private sectors.  I hope the delegation will elaborate on this issue because there are genuine concerns but I know the delegation has also articulated the opposite argument, which refers to the high cost.Last week I attended the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food at which a similar argument was put forward by members of the aquaculture industry that if the Department had a different licensing policy, the industry would be able to create revenue for the Exchequer.  For example, those in the salmon farming sector have been waiting for up to 70 months for licensing.  The delegation may not be making the same argument or complaining about lethargy or indecision when it comes to licensing but does it believe the sector receives enough assistance from the Department?Mr. Cahill referred to the 282 vessels coming into Cork.  I have been told anecdotally there is a demand within the industry for skippers for vessels such as merchant cargo ships, tugboats or dredgers.  We have an abundance of boats tied up in Killybegs.  The fishermen are available for work.  The skipper of the Atlantic Dawn does not have a licence for a 50-foot tugboat so there is a need for upskilling and a different licensing regime but so far as I am aware, all it would require would be a six-week course to acquire this new qualification.  I have been in contact with BIM and with the Departments of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  As an Opposition spokesperson I have been telling them this is a way of taking people off the dole and getting them back to work.  Is there a demand within the industry for skippers to skipper these merchant cargo vessels?  Is the industry putting pressure on BIM or on the relevant Department to set up these courses as they are not available in this country as yet?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	From listening attentively to local people in County Donegal, they anticipate that exploration for oil around Rockall will be successful.  I accept this is speculation and the delegation will have an inside track on this matter.  I sense, however, that the delegation believes we are in a rut and the industry needs to secure some type of victory or success.  Does the delegation expect oil to be found in Rockall?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I base my remarks on local knowledge.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need to differentiate between the guy at the Galway Races and people with local knowledge.  Seven years ago those with local knowledge told us the boom would not last, money is not free and the economy would crash.  I would not dismiss the speculation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is some evidence.
