JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise on behalf of Deputy O'Malley who has a prior engagement, but she would like that I act as a conduit to relay the replies to her questions. Deputy Deenihan may withdraw to attend a Front Bench meeting.I agree with Mr. Frank Kelly who made the point that the arts are the fabric of our society. They are part of who we are. I am not involved in the arts but looking from the outside, the arts are an a la carte grouping sporadically appearing at a certain time of year in a certain community, such as the Errigal Arts Festival in County Donegal or the Galway Arts Festival. Perhaps the beauty of the arts is that something beautiful emerges from nothing.The mechanism to promote the arts is through education, in the primary and secondary sector, through the goodwill of teachers and principals, reaching out not only to students but communities to become involved because teachers are the ambassadors of the learning process. They see the needs of young people changing and the demands on communities because of the pressures on family life and lifestyle. We have a role as legislators to mainstream the arts through primary and secondary schools. That does not mean that the arts become a subject with a specific slot on the timetable but that the curriculum evolves to facilitate the arts. That may mean appointing an arts officer in a particular secondary school, who will involve the community on an after school basis, at weekends, in the evening, or at breaks during the day, sporadically within the curriculum. I am a former secondary school teacher and my former colleagues detail the ever increasing demands to maintain good relationships with students. The arts can offer a solution in building relationships between students and teachers. The demands are becoming greater and the arts can facilitate a solution to the tension which exists at present.The academic subjects remain. We still need to teach Pythagoras' theorem, etc. Such work is still so important. At the same time, however, we need to ensure balance. This is a matter close to the heart of our Chairman, Deputy Keaveney, and Ms Bannotti. She recently wrote an article on it. It is a matter on which we must come alive or, as Senator Ó Murchú says, on which we must become brave. We must involve the arts because the time is right. We can do it on a joint basis. We can do it by mainstreaming the arts through the schools but also by ensuring the continued sporadic popping up of the arts, be it through a community group emerging or an idea coming out of nowhere in the back of beyond, which is the beauty of the arts. The mechanism exists to mainstream the arts through the education sector but the will, through the Department of Education and Science, to change and evolve the curriculum is the secret to it.
