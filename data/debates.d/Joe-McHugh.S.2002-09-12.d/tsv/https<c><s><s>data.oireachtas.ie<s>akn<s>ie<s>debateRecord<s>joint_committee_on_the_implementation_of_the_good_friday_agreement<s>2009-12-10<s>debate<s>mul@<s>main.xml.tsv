JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the two delegates.  What is the opinion of Mr. Gibbons on the travel tax?  Is it a barrier to entry?  He made two references to Schengen and may wish to skirt around the issue.  However, does he think it would be advantageous for tourism if we were part of the Schengen area?On paper, all-Ireland tourism looks good and ticks all the boxes but it is not happening on the ground and that is why the delegates are present today.  Much of the discussion has been about tourists arriving in Shannon or on the western seaboard but there are still barriers to getting tourists further north.  Sligo and south Donegal, including Bundoran, were once the end destinations for tourists because of the Troubles.  This was dictated by private tour operators but to what extent is Tourism Ireland trying to persuade tour operators to think in an all-Ireland framework?  We are creatures of habit and southern-based tour operators have traditionally organised holidays to Killarney, the Cliffs of Moher in Clare, Sligo and then back to Dublin.  Is that culture changing?Is there a deliberate ploy to encourage people not to go to the most beautiful county in Ireland?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will debate that later.  We do not cry in Donegal if we do not get the things we want but we have to highlight them when it happens.  Between 400,000 and 500,000 people will visit the Giant's Causeway this summer but they will stop there, even if there is a small overflow into Donegal.  Donegal is the crucial link for all-Ireland tourism.  There is a traditional movement of people between Belfast and Dublin because the road and rail infrastructure is in place.  The product offered by County Clare or County Kerry attracts the American tourist, which we never got, but we have an unspoilt product in the form of fishing, mountain climbing and coastal activities such as diving and water sports.Could Tourism Ireland act as a lobbying body for cross-Border rail?  Derry city is the fourth largest city on the island and in close proximity to Letterkenny, being only 20 miles away.  This summer, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, invested €75 million in the Midleton-Cork railway, which covers a similar distance.  The Minister was promoting the western rail corridor yesterday and spoke of its expansion to Collooney and to Sligo and that is a critical piece of infrastructure for future tourism.  In North America, Canada or continental Europe, rail tourism is the norm.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, yesterday advocated rail tourism and offered a discounted pass for senior citizens who come here on holidays.  That is fantastic and I welcome it but what happens when those people get as far as Sligo?  Are senior citizens from Cornwall going to start thumbing a lift to Bundoran, Ballybofey or Letterkenny?There is a missing link in rail travel on this island but the European TEN-T programme funds cross-border rail and focuses on missing links.  I am battering against a brick wall to convince Fianna Fáil Deputies from Donegal to see this as an opportunity but they will not do so.  It is different in the Seanad because Senator Keaveney advocates rail.  Will the 160 workers in Tourism Ireland look at how other countries have used rail tourism?  It is the future.
