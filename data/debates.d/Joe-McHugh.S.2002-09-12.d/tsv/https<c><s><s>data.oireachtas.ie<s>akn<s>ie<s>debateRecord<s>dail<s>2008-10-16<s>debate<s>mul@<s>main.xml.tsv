JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, to discuss the ongoing concerns on the outsourcing of smear testing to the USA and, furthermore, to discuss the cervical screening programme plan to initially limit colposcopy treatment to 11 centres and to assure the colposcopy team and constituents in Donegal that the service at Letterkenny General Hospital will remain.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Creed for moving this motion on the farm waste management scheme.  It is timely for ongoing projects and farmers who find themselves in limbo.  This is more than just an argument about farmers, it is an economic argument in light of the downturn which has also hit the construction sector.  Men who were employed in the housing construction sector are now finding substitute work plastering and building slatted sheds.  Government backbenchers may hear what farmers and local communities generally are saying, but they are not listening.  People are dreading the approach of January and February because things will get worse then.  If there is no plastering or roofing work, things will go pear-shaped.  The Fianna Fáil Party will have to deal with this, although it is not reading what is happening out there.The urban myth about farmers is that they are always getting hand-outs, but let us have a reality check.  Farmers form the backbone of the country.  While houses were being built and 40% of that revenue was going into the Exchequer, farmers were still engaged in primary production.  They were the only people doing so because the Government had already shafted the fishermen.  However, farmers were working against a background of losses and they still continue in that way.  As the Minister knows from his area, store lambs are being given away for €35 or €40.  Nonetheless, Tuesday's budget removed the disadvantaged area payment, raised VAT and put an extra 1% levy on farmers.  In addition, the budget increased university registration fees for farmers' sons and daughters.The Minister said that farmers have the ability to get this done between now and the end of December, but let us set the record straight.  My colleagues spoke strongly about the effect of poor weather conditions this year.  While the sun was shining the Government took the credit, but when it rained it blamed the Opposition.  It rained this summer, which was the worst in 70 years, so how in the name of God does the Minister expect farmers to be ahead of schedule?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A constituent of mine received a letter, which states:Grant aid will only be paid for structures completed by the end of the year to the required minimum, as outlined above.  Where items such as scrapers, sliding doors, venting, cladding, etc., are not completed then the structure as completed will be grant aided less the items not undertaken.  No grant payment will be made on structures that are only partially completed.  Example: those not having a floor, a roof or barriers.Steel companies in Donegal have an eight-week waiting list for roof sheeting.  How can the Minister say that farmers have the ability to get this done when there is such a waiting list?  Can the Minister answer that question?  Government backbenchers are not doing their job because they are not in touch with the people.  They are not listening to what is going on and that is why the Minister is making such a nonsensical point.  Unless he brings in Paul Daniels with a magic wand, men who are not supplied with sheeting cannot put roofs on.  The Minister should explain how he intends to get around that point.
