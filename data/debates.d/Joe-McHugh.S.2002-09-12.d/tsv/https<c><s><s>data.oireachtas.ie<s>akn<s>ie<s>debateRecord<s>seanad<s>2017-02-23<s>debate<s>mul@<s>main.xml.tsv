JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Tá mé fíorbhuíoch a bheith anseo inniu fá choinne na díospóireachta seo maidir le daoine Éireannacha thar lear. Ba mhaith liom m'aitheantas agus mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le Ceannaire an tSeanaid fá choinne an cuireadh seo a thabhairt dom. Since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and overseas development aid, my focus has been on supporting and engaging Irish citizens and those of Irish descent living overseas. I have also been actively advocating for them and highlighting issues of concern to them both internationally and domestically. I do not treat this role lightly. My own county of Donegal has seen decades of emigration so it is something that resonates profoundly with me. I am passionate about being the Minister of State representing Irish people wherever they are in the world. In March 2015, the Government published Global Irish: Ireland's Diaspora Policy, its first clear strategy statement on the diaspora. We recognise that Ireland has a unique and important relationship with its diaspora that must be nurtured and developed. Drawing inspiration from our Constitution, our vision is a vibrant, diverse global Irish community connected to Ireland and to each other. Supporting our diaspora is a key priority for me as a Minister of State. The Government's emigrant support programme, ESP, is clear evidence of the strength of the Government's continued commitment to our citizens and our communities abroad. Since its inception in 2004, the programme has provided over €148 million to over 400 organisations across the globe. In 2016 ESP funding supported over 230 organisations in more than 30 countries. As I have travelled and met with Irish communities across the world, in London, Glasgow, Boston, San Francisco, Edinburgh, Vienna, Istanbul, Nairobi and Kampala, I have seen the very real difference that our funding and our people make and the fantastic work being done by Irish community organisations. For example, just this week in London, I had meetings with Patrick Morrison and Mary Tilki of the Irish in Britain. I visited the London Irish Centre in Camden and had a lengthy engagement with the staff who provide expert advice and guidance to those newly arriving in London as well as older longer term residents who are now concerned about the uncertainty created by Brexit. I met Fr. Tom Devereux and Eddie Gilmore of the Irish Chaplaincy and Sally Mulready and Margaret Geiger of the Irish Elderly Advice Network. A month ago, I had the honour of seeing the newly refurbished Irish Cultural Centre in Hammersmith, meeting Jim O'Hara and his team and visiting Nora Higgins, Rita Andrews and their team at Southwark Irish Pensioners Project. I was glad to be able to reassure them all about the Government's work on Brexit and to give a commitment of our ongoing support.  Our support is not just about the funding itself. The emigrant support programme also nurtures a wider sense of connection with home and fosters the sense among Irish people abroad that we value them. The importance of that to the Irish abroad and to families across Ireland should not be underestimated and I see it all the time in my own constituency. I have also met with Irish community organisations and leaders doing fantastic work in San Francisco and Boston. I was accompanied by Senator Billy Lawless in New York and Boston. While in Boston, I met with Mayor Marty Walsh of Boston and Governor Charlie Baker along with Fr. Dan Finn of the Irish Pastoral Centre, Seamus Mulligan of the Irish Cultural Centre of New England and Ronnie Millar of the Irish International Immigrant Center. In San Francisco I met with Celine Kennelly and Fr. Brendan McBride, from the Rosses in my own county, of the Irish Immigration Pastoral Center in San Francisco. I look forward to building on this community engagement when I travel to Philadelphia and New York in March.We are all aware that this is a particularly uncertain and anxious time for undocumented Irish citizens in the US and for their families here at home. In New York, I chaired a round-table meeting with representatives of the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres, which brings together Irish immigration centres from across the United States. It was an important opportunity for me to hear from them at first hand and to reassure them of the Government's support for their organisations. We remain fully committed to the twin objectives of relief for undocumented citizens and greater pathways for migration to the US. The services funded by the emigrant support programme include welfare and legal advice services uniquely tailored to the needs of undocumented citizens. In 2016, we allocated more than €2.3 million in funding to organisations across the United States. Our ambassador in Washington hosted a key strategic meeting of stakeholders in the area of immigration at the embassy on 12 January. Senator Billy Lawless attended the meeting. We had an exchange of views on how progress might best be made in the new political context. Amid the uncertainty and concern associated with announcements in the US, including another one this week, it should be emphasised that much will depend on how the executive orders are to be implemented. It is worth noting that many actions in the orders will require additional funding from Congress and possibly lengthy lead-in times to recruit and train additional staff. Our embassy in Washington is currently working with the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres to ensure that undocumented Irish citizens have access to clear, factual information about the executive orders, and also clear, practical advice as to action they can take to ensure they are in the best possible position. The Government will continue to use every channel available to it, including the upcoming visit by the Taoiseach to Washington, and by Ministers to other key US cities, to voice support for Irish citizens and to sensitise the new Administration to our concerns. Significant funding and support is also provided by the Department through the emigrant support programme, to support citizens who wish to return to Ireland. Through chairing the interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad, I have been working to oversee joined-up delivery of the diaspora policy and also to examine issues affecting the Irish abroad and those wishing to return home to Ireland. The next meeting of the committee will take place at the end of March, to allow Ministers to report back on issues raised by Irish communities abroad with them during their St Patrick's Day travel programmes. We are all rightly concerned about issues that have been identified as potential barriers, for example: job opportunities, especially in rural areas; access to affordable housing; the rising cost of motor insurance and health insurance premiums; access to schools and affordable child care; recognition of foreign driving licences; recognition of qualifications; and social protection issues including transfer of pensions. I invited representatives of Crosscare and Safe Home to brief the committee so that Department representatives would have a clear and complete understanding of the issues. I will invite Departments to bring forward proposals on the next steps at the next meeting. I am also pleased to report that over the past decade more than €4 million has been allocated by my Department to Crosscare and Safe Home, for their work with returning emigrants and I am pleased to report that their funding in 2016 increased by €60,000 on the 2015 figure. I would be delighted if I could solve all of these issue immediately, but as everyone will appreciate, many of the concerns raised are cross-cutting matters and addressing them will naturally involve the co-operation of relevant Departments and ongoing engagement with industry and service providers. Indeed, some of the issues are not exclusive to returning emigrants. Issues relating to the availability and cost of housing, child care and motor insurance, for example, are relevant to the whole population, and are issues that the Government is working actively to address. As Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs my objective is to ensure that all Government policies are developed and delivered in a way that takes account of returning emigrants and does not inadvertently create additional barriers. Having spent time as an emigrant myself I know how important it is for the Government to communicate more, and more effectively, with those who have left Ireland and I have made this work central to what we do. Our @GlobalIrish Twitter account has gained on average 60 new followers a week since I took office. Regular newsletters are sent featuring and promoting networks overseas to readers all over the world. St. Patrick's Day is a particular focal point for communicating with the diaspora but throughout the year the global Irish remain connected with us and with each other through our work with Irish sporting and cultural organisations. Government support for the GAA, for example, has enabled the global games development fund. With our help, people are playing hurling in Buenos Aires and ladies football in Vietnam. With our help also, Irish people and their children are keeping up with the cúpla focal
in Hong Kong, Paris and Sydney. Yesterday I was informed that, incredibly, 250 people in London have attended an Irish class in the past six months. With our help, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Eireann is active in Birmingham, the West Midlands, and Birmingham, Alabama. In May at the Global Irish Civic Forum I will bring together 150 delegates from across the world who are working at the coalface in delivering supports to the diaspora. My ambition is that we build even greater innovation and sustainability into community organisations so that they thrive and grow. In particular, I will focus on digital initiatives so that those organisations can communicate better with us, with each other and with the wider diaspora. The Government is also providing support to Irish business networks who seek to help Irish business people to connect with each other and seek out new opportunities, including for trade and investment in Ireland. In 2016, the appointment of Ireland's first Senator for the diaspora, Senator Billy Lawless, was an important step in recognising the contribution of citizens based abroad. As regards the important issue of extending voting rights in presidential elections to citizens abroad, I am working actively with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan. Our immediate priority is to complete the report to Government setting out the policy, legal and practical implications of extending voting rights. I am happy to report that extensive work has been carried out by officials in both Departments in this regard. As we look ahead and consider the review of the implementation of the diaspora policy I am keen to encourage even more responsive solutions to problems faced by emigrants. I urge Members of this House to come forward with suggestions and to use the platform of the civic forum on 4 and 5 May to continue the engagement. There must be even greater cross-Government policy coherence in their service in the year ahead, and better engagement between the different generations of the Irish abroad. Thank you, Acting Chairman, for the opportunity to address the Seanad this afternoon. As we prepare for St. Patrick's Day and consider the real needs of the diaspora I look forward to the discussion with Members of the key issues facing us, and on the key opportunities we need to embrace.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I had a comprehensive reply ready for each point. Given that I only have five minutes, I will try to get through as many as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy if Members are happy.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is enough goodwill in the Chamber to ensure that we figure this out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge Fianna Fáil’s role in ensuring that diaspora policy was recognised in the first instance. Senator Davitt referenced the American presidential election and the fear of the undocumented about executive orders. The Senator’s specific question was on the Taoiseach’s role on St. Patrick’s Day. We have a strategic approach. It did not just happen after the presidential election. A great deal of work was done prior to that. For example, Senator Lawless and I met in New York. Our embassies and consulates, such as in San Francisco and Boston, were constantly trying to figure out a strategic approach because everything would change after the election regardless of who got elected and the US Supreme Court route did not work in the area of immigration reform. Our approach has consistently been to follow up and follow through. If it is me in Philadelphia or New York in March, the Taoiseach in the White House, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, in America at the end of January and start of February or Senator Lawless at the meeting on 12 January, there is a thread, and it is focused strongly on the issue of the undocumented. I spoke to a young man yesterday. Undocumented, he has been there for 17 years. There is anxiety and a serious sense of concern, so it is up to us to put the proper information out there if, for example, there are unrealistic executive orders in terms of employment or requiring funding from Congress. I do not know what matters the Taoiseach will discuss but, from my conversation with him, I am convinced that the issue of the undocumented will be the top priority. Senator Lawless discussed the importance of the emigrant support programme, ESP, funding and how €2.3 million of the €11.5 million went to the US last year. That programme funds many immigration centres, which give advice. I have visited them and met great people from the east coast to the west coast, including Mr. Ronnie Miller. They are working proactively to ensure that people are given the right advice and are protected. There are lawyers there. Senator Lawless mentioned the US Senate’s 2013 immigration reform Bill and the 10,000 visas in perpetuity. That was a major opportunity and the Senator discusses it often. He also mentioned the business interactions and the fact that Irish companies in America employed more people there than American companies did here. That is a rich connection and fluid movement of people. I met a young woman from Cork who had a company in Limerick and did a great deal of her work in San Francisco with a larger company. This movement of people happens on a daily basis. There are education issues, which another Senator mentioned. There are significant opportunities, and not just in the US - I am getting phone calls from Texas, including one in the past week - but also from Singapore and Jakarta, where Irish people are classified as EU citizens living outside the Union. They see the opportunity in sending their children back home. It is something that we need to consider. I am an open Minister of State. I got a great deal of help in my previous portfolio, including from Senator Ó Clochartaigh when I was ag streachailt le mo chuid Gaeilge.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is how I figure things out. We can work together. We can take the education information from today’s debate and put it on the table of the Higher Education Authority and the Minister for Education and Skills, given the education deficit issue in the third level sector. I do not mean to be crude about it, but it is also an opportunity for funding. Let us consider that space. I would be willing to take up the matter. A number of Senators mentioned barriers for returning emigrants. The interdepartmental group, which I chair, is not a group of politicians, but of officials from various Departments. We have met twice and are due to meet again in a number of weeks’ time. I have tasked my officials with examining the effectiveness of the interdepartmental group.Ultimately, it is the man with his head above the parapet who will get his wings clipped. I am chairperson of that. Ultimately, it is the individual Departments that have responsibility, whether for driver licences or issues such as farming, which the Senator mentioned. My job is to keep the pressure on each Department to try to help them make the change. I am open to suggestions and ideas about making it more effective. I have also written to each of the Ministers in the various Departments to ask that when they send their officials to these meetings, they address these issues. Let us look at a roadmap for each of the issues and see how we can follow through and keep it on the agenda. Senators are aware, through their own offices, that there are many issues facing the diaspora such as homelessness, which will be the responsibility of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. If Senators have ideas about making the interdepartmental connection more effective, I am open to them.  I had a conversation recently with a couple who returned from Australia after 16 years. One of the things they mentioned was expectations. It was one word. Emigrants have expectations but having spent so much time away, when they come back home things have changed. Their world, community and family have changed and people have moved on and are in a different space. Their biggest barrier was dealing with their expectation of the type of Ireland they thought was there. There are issues such as that.  The biggest barrier for returning emigrants in the past six to seven years was jobs. The biggest barrier was that there were no jobs. Our specific commitment in 2012, under Enda Kenny and Eamon Gilmore, was that before the end of 2016 we would have 100,000 extra jobs. That has been eclipsed. Senators will have heard the figures because it was talked about in this Chamber. It is gone to 200,000. There are jobs but there are also barriers and I want to work with Senators on that issue. I will not bluff and say we will eliminate all the barriers but we can work towards a mechanism to keep them live on the agenda. We can look at this House as a watchdog, for want of a better word, for the progress being made. I am happy to do that.  Senator Joe O'Reilly spoke about an all-out diplomatic assault regarding the undocumented. That is happening and it will continue to happen. The Senator also talked about the reasons for going. It promotes business and tourism. The Senator also mentioned the overseas missions. The role our missions play internationally is evolving. I spent two days in London with Dan Mulhall and his team. The ambassador's role does not conform to my specific stereotype of an ambassador's role. Dan Mulhall has made presentations on Brexit to the House of Lords. He is meeting with the construction federation and civic society and community groups. He and his team are out there with their sleeves rolled up. There are people like that in missions all over the world. There are people like Philip Grant in the consulate in San Francisco. We all know the way he dealt with the Berkeley tragedy because it was such a public issue. Their human investment in all these different consulates around the world has to be acknowledged.  The Senator spoke about organising a second Gathering. I will certainly pass on those sentiments and suggestions. The Senator talked about skills shortages. There are a lot of skill shortages in the labour sector in this city. That is something we can do a bit better and use our embassies. In my local hospital in Letterkenny there are advertised positions that cannot be filled. It is the same in Galway and Dublin. Can we do things differently and focus more on sectors, for example science and agriculture, and let people know there are jobs back home? I raised the interdepartmental issue. Tá a fhios agam faoi na deacrachtaí atá ag daoine teacht abhaile agus teacht ar ais. Táim cinnte fá dtaobh de sin. Tá mé anseo agus tá mo cheann oscailte go dtí aon bhealach gur féidir linn a bheith ag obair le chéile. Tá an caidreamh idir an Seanad agus an Dáil thar a bheith tábhachtach agus tá sé ar idir na hoifigigh agus na hAirí sinsearacha a bheith freagrach as na míbhuntáistí atá ann do na daoine atá ag teacht ar ais abhaile. Gabhaim buíochas le na daoine a oibríonn ar son na ndaoine atá ag iarraidh teacht abhaile. Tá dreamanna ag obair le chéile ar son na ndaoine atá ag teacht abhaile nó atá ag smaoineamh ar theacht abhaile. Níl an bhealach socraithe faoi láthair fá dtaobh den dream idir-Ranna. Tá mé thar a bheith oscailte d'aon bhealach ar a smaoiníonn Seanadóirí fá dtaobh de sin. Tá mé anseo le haghaidh sin. The Senator also mentioned the issue of driver licences which has been raised by Deputy Noel Grealish and my colleague, Deputy Tony McLoughlin. They raised it at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence. Driver licences are an issue that has been identified as seriously important for the undocumented. They need to come back home to renew their licence because it is their only form of identification. I spoke to Deputy Grealish last night and he is going to formally ask the committee to come and meet with me and my officials. We will try to do something on that and we will keep the Seanad posted. Canadian issues with driver licences was raised. The Senator said there are no plans to address these strategies and I take exception to that. While we do not have a magic formula for each of these individual issues, we have to look at the type of mechanism that is not working. The Senator has identified there are weaknesses so if there are weaknesses we have to try to do it differently. I have raised these issues with officials at meetings. We had representations and a presentation from organisations such as Crosscare and Safe Home and they have identified the issues. They are groups we can work closely with. Voting rights were mentioned. When I came into this job last May, I went straight out and said I was supportive of voting rights. I did that with the backing of the Taoiseach. It is not just because of his imprimatur; it is something I genuinely feel strongly about. My Department is not responsible for putting this report together. It is the responsibility of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. Is that report being looked at? It is not just being looked at; it is being put together. I have asked for an options paper to be ready for Government as soon as possible. That is going ahead. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, is very supportive of this idea so there is the political will from Deputy Coveney and the Taoiseach on the issue. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I covered Senator Ruane's point about the education potential and I am willing to work with the Seanad on that. Senator Higgins raised a very important point on the fears about the executive orders in America. She also talked about Brexit, our history and moral authority and obligation. I agree entirely with the Senator. I also go to countries wearing my other hat, that of Minister of State with responsibility for international development. I go to places like Kenya and Uganda and see the contribution that Irish missionaries have made. The people working in NGOs arrive out there on a voluntary basis. There is appreciation of the role the Irish have played and for what we have contributed down the centuries. We have an understanding of what migration is about because Irish people left our shores and went to places like New Brunswick in Canada where something like 51% of the population is of Irish descent.  We can learn from our movement. Sometimes figures can be a distraction from the real human problem. There are 65 million people displaced; 20 million people have refugee status of whom 10 million are children. There are 10 million children with refugee status so these are the bigger issues. I join with the Senator and Senator Ó Ríordáin when they say we have to look at all the other moving parts. The new Administration in America and Brexit are moving parts but there are other moving parts that are part of this overall solution. I met 2,000 women and children in a transfer station in Adjumani in northern Uganda. When I looked into their eyes they still had hope even though they were in a transfer station. They had hope because they left a terrible situation in South Sudan. We have a duty and obligation to help them. I will connect that point to the diaspora. My two portfolios, diaspora and international development, are not separate. They are intrinsically linked. When I was in Nairobi, I met nuns who were working as diaspora missionaries. For example, on one project, Sr. Mary Owens from the Loreto order was caring for 124 children who are HIV carriers. She was working on a project with a whole laboratory set up. This is the type of interconnectivity we have. Diaspora and international development are interlinked. People use phrases such as "harness the diaspora" and we could debate what that means but where the Irish diaspora is already playing a role internationally, perhaps we can work out a way to figure out a lot of the problems. I agree 100% with the Senator on the definition and our history of migration and what is our contribution. On the resources for births, deaths and marriages, the Senator mentioned PRSI and pensions. The Senator also mentioned the J1 visa programme. I welcome the announcement two weeks ago of an additional 2,700 J1 places in the United States. The Senator also mentioned the Fulbright programme. On visiting the United States as Minister of State with responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs, I got to know young Irish people in universities such as Notre Dame who were teaching Irish to American students. While many of them had Irish ancestry, some did not have an Irish connection but had an Irish affinity and it is crucial that we hold on to those programmes. Senator Richmond referred to Argentina and on the diaspora closer to home, spoke of the importance of London. I visited the House of Commons and met a number of people, including the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. James Brokenshire. While there I articulated the concerns of the Government and the citizens around potential issues for the Border and Brexit. Senator Boyhan also mentioned the interdepartmental committee and I covered that. I agree with the Senator that it was a brave decision to appoint Senator Billy Lawless and it was also a good decision. Senator Boyhan talked about the difficulty for the emigrants in London who cannot come home. I saw that yesterday morning in Kilburn when I met emigrants from Clare, Galway, Laois and Kerry. Although I was searching around for a Donegal person yesterday morning, I did not come across anyone.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I could see it in some of their eyes. Some of them have not been home in 25 years for different reasons. There are people looking after them in some instances and we have to ensure that the welfare agencies in London and throughout greater Britain look after them. We need to look after them because they are with us. They are still Irish citizens. I certainly will ensure that we continue to support the 100 groups that we funded last year in Britain. The Senator also mentioned we are not defined by geography or time, and I agree. An Irish citizen is an Irish citizen and one does not become more or less Irish just by getting on a boat or a plane. The Irish nation cherishes affinity. The Senator mentioned the Constitution. Tá dualgas orainn uilig. The Senator also mentioned aspects of the Genealogy and Heraldry Bill 2006. I will get my officials to dig it out and I will certainly look at that. Then the last Senator, Senator Rose-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator has two surnames. I apologise. The Senator referred to the interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad. I accept it takes in the returning emigrants but we must be clear too that it is an interdepartmental committee on the Irish abroad. It takes in everything. I am prepared to work with the Senator on the challenges therein. The Senator spoke of the inherent rights of Irish citizens, what it means to be an Irish citizen, voting rights and the options paper. It is an options paper which will be prepared. In terms of a timeframe, and this puts on the pressure, it is my intention that we will have that options paper to consult with the wider diaspora for 4 and 5 May. They are coming home, they will be with us and it is only right that we consult them on that. Before that, a paper will be prepared by the Department. I can assure Senator Conway-Walsh we are working closely with them. The Senator mentioned something pertaining to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys. If she has specific details on that, I will raise it directly with the Minister.
