JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze for that very blunt and sobering assessment of the current situation, for outlining its direct impact on her people in Ukraine and the indirect impact of creating a potential food shortage and the implications of that. We will try to keep the conversation flowing. Deputies Richmond, Howlin, Ó Murchú and Brady have indicated. I will take those contributions first. I welcome Mr. Barry Andrews, MEP, to today's meeting. If he would like to contribute during his Fianna Fáil colleagues' time slot, I will be happy to let him speak first but his colleagues have the right to speak first. Mr. Andrews is very welcome and has a good interest in this area. If members have a few questions they can direct them to the Chair of the Committee on EU Affairs, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze, or to the Ukrainian ambassador, Ms Larysa Gerasko. They can involve both of them.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze wish to take that question?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Howlin followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Brady.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Mr. Shchedrin wish to come in?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is a lot of background noise. I ask Mr. Barry Andrews to allow Senator Chambers to comment as she is under time pressure? I presume both of them have asked their colleagues to facilitate them in contributing to the debate.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you very much, Ms Klympush-Tsintsadze. We wish you good luck and we will be in touch.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Could the ambassador reply to Senator Martin and wrap up? I think all the questions have been asked, so she can wrap up.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It was a pleasure to have both yourself, ambassador, and Ms Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, the chair of the Ukrainian committee on EU affairs, with us today.It was a pleasure having the ambassador and the chair of the EU committee here today. ehensive presentations and responses. This committee will continue to work with and be with Ukrainians. We have been to Romania and Moldova. We visited the border towns of Siret and Palanca and in a couple of weeks' time we plan to go to Georgia. No doubt the officials and the clerk will be in touch with the ambassador's office and I know she will point us in the right direction if needed.  We are with Ukraine, not just in words but also in actions. We will continue to vociferously support Ukraine's EU accession request along with that of Moldova and Georgia.  We wish our guests well. A lot of their fellow citizens are in various towns, counties and regions of Ireland and while we are not getting everything right because of the magnitude of the challenge, we are very focused on doing our very best for Ukrainian men, women and children. We wish everyone well.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat.
