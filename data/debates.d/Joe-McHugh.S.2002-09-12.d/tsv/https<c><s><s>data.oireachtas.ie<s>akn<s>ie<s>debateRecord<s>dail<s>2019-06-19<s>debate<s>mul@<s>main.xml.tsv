JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. As she may be aware, my Department recently completed a review of provision at post-primary level across the school planning areas in the south Kildare area. My Department is satisfied that the needs in the area can be met through the replacement and expansion of the existing Curragh post-primary school with a new 1,000 pupil school building. It is intended that the expansion of the existing Curragh post-primary school, a multi-denominational community college under the patronage of Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, will also cater for demand arising in the adjoining Newbridge and Kildare school planning areas. Pending delivery of the new school, there is capacity in the existing Curragh post-primary school building. A new site will be required for the new school and my Department has commenced the site identification process. In line with protocols for the use of State property assets, my Department has written to the Department of Defence inquiring if the Department is in a position to provide a site that could be suitable. Due to commercial sensitivities surrounding site acquisitions in general, I cannot comment further at this point in the process, although I can assure the Deputy that my Department is making every effort to progress the matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To reiterate, the Department and the Government are committed to the new post-primary school in the Curragh. I appreciate that when diggers are not on site it can lead to frustration but the commitment is very clear. We will build a new post-primary school. The way politics works, Teachtaí Dála, who are messengers of the people, do their work and raise the issue. I thank the Deputy for raising it today. When I meet Deputies from that constituency, whether it is the Ceann Comhairle or Deputy Heydon, this issue and those concerns are raised with me. That is important, and it is important to keep this issue alive. However, Department officials are in touch with the Department of Defence. It is not a question of simply producing a map. There are military installations on the Curragh, so there has to be proper consultation. It is even wider than that, however. There is consultation and communication with Kildare County Council as well. If there is information the Deputy believes is important or potential solutions, Department officials and myself are open to hearing those but I reiterate and re-emphasise that we will build a new post-primary school on the Curragh. It is needed, and it was announced towards the end of last year. That commitment is steadfast. I appreciate the frustration of parents who wonder where students will go in the time ahead. However, it is important to point out that every effort is being made at Department level. I will ensure that the officials keep on this case and continue the communication. Unfortunately, because of commercial sensitivity, we cannot have a public forum when it comes to land and site acquisition but I assure the Deputy, the parents and the staff concerned publicly here today that we will ensure this will be a priority in the time ahead.
