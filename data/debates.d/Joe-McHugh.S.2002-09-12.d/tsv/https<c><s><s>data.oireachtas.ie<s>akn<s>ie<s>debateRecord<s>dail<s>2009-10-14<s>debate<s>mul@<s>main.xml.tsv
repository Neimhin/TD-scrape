JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to raise an issue under the Labour Services (Amendment) Bill, given the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for labour, Deputy Calleary, and the Tánaiste.  When we are discussing the effectiveness of the board, we must also discuss a radical overhaul of courses.  I am encountering many constituents, sparkies and plumbers, who have done one, two or three years of their apprenticeships but who find themselves in limbo.  Their expectations were for 26-week courses, which puts them further into limbo.Some 27% of the unemployed are aged under 25 years.  This is 104,000 people.  We must consider a situation——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While we are considering a radical overhaul of the board, we also need to consider a radical overhaul of the courses that we deliver.  We have only to look at our neighbours in America where Cormac McCarthy wrote a book entitled, "No Country for Old Men".  We are in the process of——

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ireland is becoming no country for young men.  We need to address this serious situation.  Some 104,000 people in the unemployed labour force are aged under 25 years.  Young people are getting on boats and aeroplanes.  We cannot record——

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister's response is a wee bit flowery.  I know he will respond by saying that the specifics will be in the legislation, but at this stage we need to put some meat on the bones because several questions need to be answered even before we reach the legislative stage.  For example, what are the powers of this proposed mayor in respect of rezoning and the draft development plan, a power that county councillors hold under a statutory instrument?  How will the mayor affect this process?  Questions arise about staffing, salary, the expense of creating the office, the term of the office and powers.  There is an onus on us to put this up for debate because there are many questions.  One might ask why I, as a Donegal man, am asking about the Dublin mayor but I want to know if this will be rolled out nationally.  Will Dublin be a pilot?  Will Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, and Cork all have directly elected mayors?  If the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is still in office in 2010 when the mayor is elected, what will his relationship be with the mayor?  Many questions need to be answered.
