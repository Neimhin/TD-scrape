JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This debacle is a microcosm of an Ireland full of contradictions and a Government that has presided over a failed decentralisation programme.  The Government is trying to go into two of the most remote parts of this island and dig out civil servant jobs.  It is unprecedented and is a detachment from common sense.  It shows the Government has little evidence of prudence or leadership.Any time during the past 15 years when a decision had to be made, the Government hired a consultant.  With regard to the future of the Irish Coast Guard, we commissioned Deloitte & Touche at a cost of €140,000 of taxpayers' money.  It came up with a very specific recommendation, which was to keep the two stations at Valentia and Malin Head, build on existing capacity and work with the two stations.  Now, however, everything has changed.  Internal judgments have been made by a handful of civil servants making allegations of inadequate infrastructure, ESB supply, broadband and amenities, but these have been flatly and roundly refuted by experts throughout the country.The central element of this debate concerns saving lives and for over 100 years that has been the role of paid officers and volunteers at both Valentia and Malin Head.  The present crews and those gone before have excelled at this job and handed down their rich experience and knowledge of saving lives.  There is no good reason to change what we have but there is a good reason to keep it.  It has been working, the people have been saving lives and the wheel is not broken.  Why, therefore, are we considering changing it?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is an element of the argument that has not been articulated by the Minister or the civil servants.  Speaking from a technological perspective, we could locate one centre in New Delhi if we decided to do so because of advanced communication.  However, technology is not the issue, it goes much deeper.  This is about respecting the sea.  If the mindset of the Government disrespects communities and a way of life, how in the name of God will it respect the sea?  It is that simple.This is not a parochial issue concerning just Kerry or Donegal.  We live on an island that has been manned by two stations — ten years ago Valentia and Malin Head manned these stations on their own.  Malin Head worked in conjunction with Belfast coast guard station and has intrinsic links with it.  Internationally, Malin Head station has links with Ayr in Scotland and Valentia has intrinsic links with Spain.  It is an international issue that we are trying to pull apart, a network of knowledge, familiarisation and experience with the sea.Will we open a new centre on the west coast in an urban location?  Will we introduce academics, people with masters degrees and PhDs, to it?  Is the plan to give away the link with coastal communities, fishermen and people who know the sea?  Computers cannot take account of tidal flows which are sometimes erratic.  The knowledge and experience of people living on our coastline is needed.The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is a conscientious man who fears lives will be lost if we do not change.  If, however, he chooses to change the system, lives will be lost.The Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, is responsible for the Office of Public Works.  Does he want to preside over the procurement of more lands and the construction of a new centre in Limerick when next Tuesday's budget will make cutbacks in other Departments?  Will the vital link with the people who know the sea be broken?  Will we rely on those who learn about the sea from books?  The issue at stake is one of maintaining communities and saving lives.  Does the Government want to place lives in jeopardy?  I do not believe that is the case.  It is time it showed leadership rather than allowing civil servants take a hand at them by producing nonsensical documents.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State indicated there would be two sets of equipment.  One cannot tender for two sets of equipment if a decision has not been made.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is unbelievable.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a joke.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	All this amounts to is that the last man out at Valentia and Malin can switch off the lights.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That should read "when"; there is a typo.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is an absolute disgrace.  It is no wonder people have lost faith in politics.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government is treating members of the public like fools.
