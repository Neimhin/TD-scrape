JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Leader to contact the Minister with responsibility for insurance matters as we will have a serious situation this St. Patrick's Day. It would be inappropriate if ours was the only country in the world with no festivals on 17 March, a day celebrated in America and other parts of the world reached by the Irish diaspora. It would be ironic if ours was the only country which could not hold a festival that day but there are serious issues regarding insurance problems in this area. I ask the Leader to intervene.
