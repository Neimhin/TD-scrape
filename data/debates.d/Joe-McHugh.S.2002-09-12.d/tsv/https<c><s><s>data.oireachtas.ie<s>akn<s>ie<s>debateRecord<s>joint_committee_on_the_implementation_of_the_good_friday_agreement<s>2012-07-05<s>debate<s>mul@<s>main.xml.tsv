JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I said at my inaugural meeting as Chairman that I would not read the exact wording of the mobile telephone notice.  If people have mobile telephones or iPhones, they know the drill.  The minutes of the previous meeting, of 21 June, have been circulated.  Are any matters arising?  No.  Are they agreed for signature?  Agreed.We will meet representatives of Hanna's House to discuss the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security on the island of Ireland, North and South.  I had the privilege of meeting the organisation and the witnesses were kind enough to say it was a lot less than a year ago.  The organisation is doing good work and it is very welcome today.  We are interested in what its members have to say.  I encourage committee members to use the opportunity to find out more about the organisation.Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentations I remind them that, by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.For the information of committee members and those in the Visitors Gallery, the Hanna's House project was created in the mid-90s to mobilise the collective energy of women to work towards feminist ideals of justice, equality and non-violence.  The group hosts seminars, workshops and meetings to bring together women from diverse backgrounds to talk about the legacy of the conflict on the island of Ireland and what a feminist peace means to them.  Hanna's House has developed a strategic alliance, which is a group more than of 50 women from all corners of Ireland working together to create a more just, equal and non-violent society.  In our journey, we are trying to develop a deeper understanding of the conflict and we are always interested in people's perspective.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Claire Hackett.  Perhaps I will allow her to sum up at the end.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take the second contributor, Senator Jim D'Arcy, who will be followed by Ms Michelle Gildernew.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Graham might answer the question and sum up as well because we are constrained by time.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Graham and her colleagues.  It has been a good debate.  I note time has constrained us.Perhaps we should put on record the historic occasion in Stormont yesterday where there was formal approval of the North-South Interparliamentary Association.  If Ms Graham is looking for a North-South mechanism, that might be a natural place to go.  It was great news yesterday.  This is an implementation body, and one of the components that was outstanding.  It is important that we record that.If Ms Graham was looking at the east-west dimension, there is the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  She should feel free to get in touch with that body because these are two separate elements of the Good Friday Agreement, east-west and North-South.We wish Ms Graham well in her work.  We will take up her challenge of going to different women's groups throughout the North and throughout the South.  We visited the women's centre in Strabane a few weeks ago, and we have initiated that work.  We will take up her invite for her conference on 5 November and wish her well with it.  I thank Ms Graham.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I propose the committee suspend for a few minutes in order to bring in the next group.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Pat Colgan, the chief executive officer, and Ms Gina McIntyre, director of corporate services, with SEUPB.  We will have a discussion on the delivery of the PEACE III and INTERREG IVA which are managed by the Special EU Programmes Body.The SEUPB is one of the six cross-Border bodies set up under the Good Friday Agreement.  Its main role is to manage cross-Border European Union Structural Funds programmes in Northern Ireland and the Border region of Ireland.  The current programmes are known as the PEACE III and INTERREG IVA and the SEUPB is in the process of closure of the PEACE II and INTERREG IIIA programmes.  We look forward to exploring with our guests how the current funding is being applied to positive effect and how it can be sustained in the future.  Issues around PEACE III were raised at the highest level yesterday, both in Stormont and in Dublin.  Hopefully, there is positive news as a result of the pressure applied yesterday regarding the urgency of the matter.Before we commence, I advise witnesses they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence connected with the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, any person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call Mr. Colgan, who is most welcome, to make his presentation.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Colgan for his presentation.  Obviously his enthusiasm for this major job of work is still alive and well.  Yesterday, I was speaking to a few people from Derry and they felt the buzz and excitement to which Mr. Colgan referred, which contributes to society, not least the special EU programme body, the SEUPB.  The peace bridge is a great source of joy and people are still walking on it and enjoying it.Before I call on the first group of contributors, I wish to acknowledge the presence of representatives from the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Foreign Affairs and Trade and Public Expenditure and Reform.  This reaffirms the Government's commitment and the necessity that all Departments work with the SEUPB.  I welcome the officials and commend them on their ongoing work.  I have no doubt that solutions will be found to the challenges, as the Government is committed to the SEUPB programme, in particular PEACE lll.I will call four speakers, starting with Mr. Pat Doherty, MP and Deputy Se√°n Conlan to follow.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take one final question from Ms Michelle Gildernew.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take a supplementary question from Deputy Conlan.
JoeMcHugh	Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you very much for coming in today and we appreciate that you did so at such short notice.  Sometimes we focus on the negative news, but I would like to congratulate all the officials from the relevant Departments in bringing a solution to this important matter that affects people in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  I wish you well in your endeavours.
