JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I want to raise two items in respect of head 4 concerning mental health. I think a better explanation is needed for the different ranges and definition of mental illness. I refer to the definitions of real, serious, long-lasting and permanent and specifically within that category schizophrenia and recurrent psychotic depression. That is one level. Public concern focuses on a different level, that of a person presenting at a GP's surgery saying she is suicidal, with the corollary that there will be a termination. That is the fear and concern among the public and the opening of floodgates as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor pointed out. Can we please highlight better the pathways that are and will be available to women who present saying that they have just harmed themselves or are about to do so, or threatening suicide, be they counselling, help or support, the better to manage the crisis? That conversation is not being held at the moment and I ask that this be done in a better way, even in the explanatory memorandum of this legislation to avert terminations where possible. In respect of heads 19 to 20, the Offences against the Person Act 1861 was already mentioned. Under the changes with respect to criminal prosecution, what are the consequences of accessing abortive pills over the Internet, within the first trimester?
