JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  It is always good to be kept informed on these matters, because it is a complex area.  From the perspective of the public, the proper information is not available in terms of the invaluable nature of the potential in this case.  At some stage corporation tax will increase from 25% to 40%, but what level of a gas find would be necessary before the tax of 40% is applied?  Perhaps that is too much of a hypothetical question.Given that there is so much money and investment in the initial stage of exploration, the public perception is that the Government is not in a financial position to carry out the work, which is the reason it takes place in the private sector.  That is still the critical message which must reach the public domain, because the person on the street, and I include politicians among that group, does not have the level of knowledge and expertise of the delegation.  No government could sustain the amount of money invested in such work or in the necessary technology, or match the level of private sector involvement.At a more parochial level let us consider a hypothetical case.  If there were success in Rockall, would the delegation consider Corrib as a link or would it perhaps consider Killybegs or Greencastle in terms of bringing the gas on shore?  I realise it is a hypothetical question.  If it is the case that gas is found would these destinations be considered?  The reason I put the question is that there is still a potential of linking Corrib to Northern Ireland at Derry.  I realise my comments are completely parochial in terms of bringing gas to Donegal.  Is everything based on that hypothesis?  If gas is found would the delegation consider linking it directly to Donegal or would it go via Corrib and ultimately link up to the Derry gas line?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Ó hÓbáin mentioned that we have to be seen more positively internationally.  In considering the rates of 25% and 40%, I assumed that at a certain level of oil or gas exploration that rate would increase to 40%.  Would it not be in the group's interest to qualify that increase from 25% to 40%?  For example, it could be decided if oil or gas is found in the Celtic Sea, that because of the depth of the sea or the distance involved, the rate would not increase to 40%.  I am not being facetious.  I am trying to be helpful in terms of the public perception.  Sometimes when people see figures they look at them in black and white.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps Mr. Ó hÓbáin is already doing this but would it be a useful exercise to meet local authorities in Donegal and Sligo in advance, in the same way as he is appearing before the committee, in order to inform local authority members at ground level of the Department's intentions.  It is only a few miles from their electoral representative areas and questions are frequently asked of them in their constituency offices.  That is just a suggestion.  Perhaps Mr. Ó hÓbáin is already doing that or has plans to do it.
