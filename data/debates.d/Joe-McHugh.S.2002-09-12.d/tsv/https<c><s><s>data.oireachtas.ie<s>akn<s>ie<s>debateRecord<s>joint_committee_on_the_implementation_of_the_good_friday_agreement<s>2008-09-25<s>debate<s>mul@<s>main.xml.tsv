JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the commissioners and wish them well in their ongoing efforts.  Regarding Deputy Ó Caoláin's point about having a politically neutral forum, while this is a forum, unfortunately it is not politically neutral by virtue of the absence of the Unionist representatives from Northern Ireland.  We have already acknowledged this as a committee and I know that the Chairman is doing everything in his power to put pressure on them to participate in our deliberations.  We are all conscious of the fact that they should be here if we are to have an effective, politically neutral environment in which to discuss issues.Dr. McDonnell's point regarding the process is key.  The end point of the process is the forum, which will provide a mechanism.  We do not know the end point after that because it is new territory and a new area.  It is important to listen to all groups and peoples who have been affected to some degree or another by the conflict.  Each individual has been affected in a way which is important to him or her.  We should use this committee as a forum to invite groups to participate in the design of the process.  This would be of benefit to the commission.  Perhaps a forum involving us as politicians and the commissioners will not be the endgame nor one which people who have been affected by the Troubles would aspire to in the first instance.Consultation is very important and must be ongoing prior to the establishment of the forum.  We must engage with people and listen to them.  The danger lies in people developing negative perceptions of the forum.  Some might see it as being patronising.  Others might not see it as an effective mechanism to achieve justice or as a mechanism that can meet their needs.  In that context, it is important in the overall design of the forum that effective consultation continues.As Dr. McDonnell pointed out, some groups shout louder than others and it is important to bear in mind that there are quiet, if not silent, groups out there.  However, some of the groups that shout the loudest have the confidence to do so and may be reflecting the silent groups that are not in a position to do so.  I refer here to the victims of the Omagh bombing.  It is important that we engage with groups like that who have had experience in this area and know what they are looking for.  It is imperative that this committee engages with such groups and invites them to what will hopefully be a politically neutral environment, once Unionist representatives are on board.  If we engage with such groups, that will help in the overall design of the forum to which the commissioners aspire in the long term.
