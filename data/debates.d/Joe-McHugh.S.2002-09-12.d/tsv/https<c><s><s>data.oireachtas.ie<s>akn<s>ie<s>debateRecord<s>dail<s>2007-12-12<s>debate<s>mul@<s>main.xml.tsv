JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When I was at a wake last week, I met a gentleman who happened to be a Fianna Fáil supporter who said his pension represented a great increase on the pension received by his grandfather in the 1950s.  Fianna Fáil supporters, including Deputies, often fail to acknowledge that increases in most social welfare payments such as fuel allowance are index-linked and subject to inflation.  The Government failed to acknowledge that point during the circus that was budget day.  It is natural that there will be increases in payments which are index-linked when inflation is taken into consideration.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government does not account for inflation when it is considering increases in some social welfare hand-outs such as the widow's pension.  Inflation is taken into consideration, however, in independent reports which recommend increases in ministerial salaries.  I decided to share that anecdote with the House to assure Members that Fianna Fáil supporters in County Donegal are alive and well.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In 2006 the National Economic and Social Forum produced a report which acknowledged that there were barriers to labour market inclusivity.  This is really what we are looking at.  We are not interested in the hand-out mentality.  We accept that people need hand-outs at certain intervals — for example, if they are not working as they progress through their career paths.  The forum's working document, Creating a More Inclusive Labour Market, highlighted issues such as transportation and child care.  It pointed out that literacy and numeracy problems were preventing people from entering the labour market.  I remind the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, that the report stated the poverty traps encountered by many single mothers represented one of the main barriers to labour market inclusion.  The budget will not lead to the elimination of poverty traps.  Does the Minister of State agree that the very good report compiled by the National Economic and Social Forum which was presented to the Taoiseach in January 2006 but is now sitting on a desk should be heeded and re-examined?  Will she facilitate the synchronisation of the various Departments to try to maximise labour market inclusivity which is badly needed?When I met one of my constituents, a good Fine Gael supporter, on Monday night, she told me that when she went to collect her Christmas bonus, she met a man at the counter who had been receiving unemployment welfare assistance for a considerable period.  The woman in question who has been receiving unemployment assistance for 12 months discovered that the man she had met at the counter was getting a Christmas bonus, but she was not.  Why should a woman who had paid contributions towards stamps before she left employment 12 months ago not be entitled to a Christmas bonus, when long-term welfare recipients are?  I would like to voice my concerns on behalf of the woman in question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will focus only on the preventative educational aspects of the issue.  I have a few questions in that regard.Before I ask them I acknowledge some locally-based and locally-designed intervention models.  In particular, I put on record the efforts of a partnership approach in County Donegal which had a successful road show recently.  There were participants from the ambulance service and the Garda, as well as families who lost loved ones and other people involved in car accidents.  It was a very dramatic and hard-hitting road show.  It should certainly be emulated in other parts of the country.I have questions on the Road Safety Authority's role in working with the Department of Education and Science.  How does the Road Safety Authority intend to work the mechanics of its proposals on education and awareness through the school system if there is no effort on the part of the Department of Education and Science to change the curriculum, redesign courses or introduce lessons into the school system?Perhaps there is action behind the scenes of which I am not aware.  It is required and must be done through a radical overhaul of the education system.  We should bring driving instructors into classrooms to talk to 13 and 14 year olds and get such pupils started on the theory aspect of learning to drive.  Instructors should also speak to them about the practical sides of learning to drive.I visited Crana College in Buncrana in the past month and asked both male and female students what subject area they wished to discuss with me.  They wanted to discuss cars, driving and test waiting times.  These were 14 and 15 years olds.  We have an opportunity to harness that energy in a positive way but the only way we can do so is by creating new modules, changing the curriculum and radically overhauling the system.  Pupils would then be learning about a topic they are interested in rather than continuously being force-fed different aspects of the curriculum.The curriculum has not evolved in the past 20 years.  I was a teacher in 1993 and pupils are currently learning the same core subject topics which I taught then.  They are still learning the same core subject topics that I learned when I took my intermediate certificate, as it was then known, in 1986.  It is time we use education as a mechanism to overhaul the curriculum in a positive way.We should start teaching the basics of driving skills at a practical and theoretical level by bringing the people who know how to do it into the system.  We should not necessarily delegate such a task to teachers, as they are in schools to teach the sciences and arts to pupils rather than teach them how to drive.  We should be radical and use this opportunity to overhaul the system.At some stage, perhaps next week or in a fortnight or a month's time, we will be faced with another big issue of carnage on the roads, like the five young people unfortunately killed in Inishowen approximately two years ago.  We will be faced with another sensational topic and everyone in the House will say how terrible it is.  This week the issue was cocaine and a few weeks ago it was gangland murder.We are becoming a reactionary House that acts on every issue sensationalised in the media.  It is time to intervene and be positive and creative.  We should be proactive in creating the society we want rather than reacting to every issue that is being sensationalised.  We should be clear, constructive and radical in overhauling our education system.
