JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	The Department is engaging with the group on Sherkin Island, with which I am familiar. When I was on the island, I met the group and it is a great project. As the Deputy pointed out, there was a history and precedent of Cork County Council funding part of the programme. We will continue to consult the island community and need some pathway to a solution. We do not have it, but perhaps the Deputy might influence Cork County Council which could be a way forward.
