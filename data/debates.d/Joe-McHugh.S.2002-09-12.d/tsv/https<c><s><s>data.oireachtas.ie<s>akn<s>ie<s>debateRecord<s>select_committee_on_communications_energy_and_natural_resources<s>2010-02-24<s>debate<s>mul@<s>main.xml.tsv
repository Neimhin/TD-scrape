JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In constructing the framework for this forum, there is no need to reinvent the wheel.  Various sectoral representative groups are in place, including the Shellfish Growers Association and the game angling clubs in every county.  The Minister of State could tap into those representative groups.  An important point I raised on the debate on Second Stage is that we need to examine the cross-Border dimension.  From a parochial point of view, I always emphasise the work of the Loughs Agency, but it has a remit into our country in terms of management of tributary rivers and the same position applies in Carlingford.  Representative groups are in place on the voluntary side.  There are game angling clubs and tourism representative bodies.  As Deputy Coveney said, we must take cognisance of the private sector as it is the sector that is driving the industry of game angling.  There is a regional dimension to this.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State is trying to do the impossible because he is trying to marry all the various interest groups, having regard to all the tensions and associated tensions that pertain at regional level, and bring all that together at a national level.  If the Minister of State could come to us with a frame of reference, that would be important and I would welcome that.
