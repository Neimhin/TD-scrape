JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State in the House and indeed all of the Ministers working in the Department of Health at the moment and their officials for dealing with all the ongoing challenges. The work that is needed is acknowledged not just by me in this House but by the public as well, so I acknowledge that at the outset. I am also conscious of the fact that with language being used this evening in terms of contact tracing, there is a feeling of being overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task and by the magnitude and scale of the challenges as well. I put down this question on the back of difficulties expressed to me yesterday morning and over the previous weekend by some school principals. The reason they contacted me was there were communication difficulties in dealing with cases that they were alerted to them on a Friday evening and then going through the process over the weekend. The issue could be summed up in a nutshell by saying it concerns the communication, point of contact, direction and protocol for contact tracing. Since putting down this question yesterday, I am delighted to see that there has been considerable progress made over the past day. The primary level stakeholders and the secondary level stakeholders met with NPHET today as well, and that is really necessary to instil confidence in the leadership within the school communities, because we all know, appreciate and certainly know the value of children and teenagers being back in the school system. Teachers have been very closely monitoring their progress since schools have come back. Parents have noticed progression where regression happened when pupils were absent from school for up to about six months, and it is important we hold on to that progress. To summarise, what I am raising is something that has already been enacted by the people concerned. I am very well aware of demands on the system and the contact tracing system, but it is really important and incumbent on all of us to ensure whatever resources and strengthening of the existing system that can be done should be done. That focus, especially with the participation of NPHET officials at the stakeholders meeting, was a positive step forward today. I acknowledge the role played by officials within the Department of Education and Skills. They have been liaising quite closely with Department of Health officials for a long time, going back to last March and there is constant communication and constant engagement in ensuring that they try to get things right. I know from my own communication with them and from my own relationship with them in my previous role that the different officials work morning, noon and night to try to get this challenge under control. We are all on the same hymn sheet, whether it is parents, teachers or principals, to ensure the progress that has been made in having children and teenagers back in school stays on track to ensure we continue with the primary motivation of educating our young people.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That was a comprehensive answer and it is good to see the response included upfront honesty on where challenges exist. In one particular area, the Department and the HSE are working to deal with ongoing issues. It is important that we continue to be transparent. Information is key. Re-emphasising the seven-day week availability to principals will be very important in the days ahead. The intense feeling among primary and secondary principals and teachers, as the Minister of State knows, is they want to continue teaching. They see the progress and they want to be in a position to lead on the educational front and take a responsible position to lead on the health and safety front. They have dual responsibility. Following the meeting today and the comprehensive nature of the answer, I hope progress will be made. Many people have varied opinions on what happened last night. As the evenings get shorter it will be a different lockdown at a different time from the lockdown in March when the sun was in the sky and the evenings were longer. Now the evenings are getting shorter. With regard to the 5 km rule, many people, and not just the elderly, go for walks in the evening. People in rural Ireland could be living ten miles from lights or from a town or village. We have to have due consideration for people who want to walk on a footpath in a safe area. We do not want people endangering their lives or putting their safety in jeopardy. We need to have closer scrutiny of this. There is much conversation about the GAA. The GAA has always been here in the darkest of days when the country has been in the most difficult of times. It was there for the school meals programme at a voluntary level when I was in my previous role. Now that the evenings are short and people are in their houses, they have something to look forward to, whether it is intercounty football, hurling or camogie. It is something on which we should work hard. It is not a glamorous job for these GAA athletes. They are not getting on buses. They get changed at home and they go to training in their own cars and vehicles. It is a difficult time for them but they are providing a ray of hope for so many people in the country.
