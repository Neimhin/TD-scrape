JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a ghabháil don Rialtas fá choinne na scéime seo. Tá gá mór léi agus tá sí práinneach agus de dhíth chun rudaí a insliú agus pumpaí teasa, fuinneoga agus doirse nua a chur i dtithe. Guím gach rath ar an Aire Stáit sa jab tábhachtach atá aige agus sa dualgas atá ar féin agus ar an Rialtas. Beidh práinn ann ó thaobh an one-stop shop. Sin an rud is mó anois. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, for the work he has put into this scheme. It has been worked on quite comprehensively in recent months. The most important thing now is to get the tendering sorted for the one-stop shop. Already our offices are receiving calls from people who were involved in previous schemes, including insulation schemes. They have the information but do not have the authority to give accurate information because they need to go through a tendering process. That is critical. There is another element that also needs to be considered. It concerns those in receipt of domiciliary care and the carer’s allowance, who would qualify for the scheme. However, there is an issue with the BER. There is an anomaly whereby those whose houses have a C rating will not qualify; I think it has to be a D rating. The anomaly lies in the fact that many of the houses would have got their attics and walls insulated. It is important that they not be precluded from the 80% grant owing to the showing of initiative in recent years. Even though the windows and back door may be hanging off, the BER will be a key consideration if we are not to discriminate against people who find themselves in this position. On another issue I wish to raise, could the Minister of State clarify the position? The original criterion referred to houses built before 2006 but the year has now been changed to 1993. That will affect many houses. I presume we are ready to roll out the tender process for the one-stop shop. It must be initiated as a matter of priority. May I raise the issue of the mica scheme, which I realise I will be raising in the next hour as a topical issue? There is a great opportunity to incorporate the retrofit scheme into the schemes for houses with mica and pyrite. Many of these houses were built in the past couple of decades. If the householders did not have a problem with mica, they would be going out to replace their windows and doors. There is a hard-to-believe argument that the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is trying to push for people to build houses under the old criteria, or the 2007 standards. The 50 mm of insulation required in 2007 has changed to 100 mm. Expecting homeowners who are to rebuild their houses or do the outer leaf to go back to 2007 standards does not make any construction sense or common sense. There is a way of assimilating the retrofit scheme into the mica scheme to cover circumstances where you are building a new house or replacing the outer leaf. I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, and the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, have set up a working group to investigate this issue. What needs to come out of that is that we do not impose unnecessary bureaucracy on the mica homeowners, who are going through a very difficult time dealing with the stress. We need to give them a win such that the equivalent of whatever they would get under a retrofit scheme if their house did not have mica would be made available to them, without the bureaucracy, hardship and frustration associated with having different rules for different Departments. We are looking for collaboration and cross-government support on this issue. I realise I will be getting into this in more detail in the next hour with the Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan. Arís, gabhaim aitheantas don Rialtas fá choinne na scéime seo. Labhair an Teachta O’Donnell faoi na daoine uilig atá de dhíth chun an obair seo a dhéanamh ar na tithe. Níl siad ann. Tá siad de dhíth chun na tithe a bhogadh ar aghaidh, tithe príobháideacha a atógáil nó tithe úra a thógáil. Tá brú ollmhór ann anois mar gheall ar an éileamh do dhaoine chun bheith ag obair ar na tithe agus an obair seo. Dá mbeadh aon bhealach, aon deis nó aon smaoineamh ag aon duine chun daoine, daoine óga ina measc, a fháil tríd an tír nó taobh amuigh den tír, sin an rud is mó.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt don Aire Stáit as a dhíograis agus a thiomantas maidir leis an scéim seo. Gabhaim buíochas freisin leis an Aire, an Teachta Darragh O'Brien, as a thiomantas. I welcome the Minister of State. It is our fourth time to discuss this Topical Issue. I will make five points and perhaps when I make my next contribution I will be able to elaborate on them. The first point is that facilitators are needed on the ground in Donegal with immediate effect to disseminate information and to fill a communication gap that exists at present, which is very difficult for homeowners. They are trying to navigate their way through this torture. It is a torture, and it is continuing. That is important. Ms Ann Owens of the Mica Working Group has been very consistent on this appeal. Commitments were made last summer. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, mentioned the outreach from the Housing Agency that is in operation, but people need to see this happening and to see people on the ground with immediate effect. Second, I was delighted to hear the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, regarding the retrofit scheme. We have talked about this off-campus as well. While I welcome the retrofit scheme being assimilated into the mica scheme, it is very important that we do not add another layer of bureaucracy to what is already a quagmire in some people's eyes, making it impossible to pedal their way through this scheme. If the retrofit scheme is going to be done in unison, let us work into it that it is not an extra agency or Department trying to seek different rules and criteria. This has to be part of the one scheme. The third point I wish to raise is the homeowners who have paid the engineering fees. On the last occasion, I mentioned a mother and daughter in Donegal who have taken out a loan of €12,000 from the credit union. That is a lot of money. The mother is not earning and is on a pension while the daughter is a carer, so they do not have money to pay back this finance. Basically, that money has to be paid back as a matter of urgency. The 17% holding back on the payment is too high. In fact, some people believe it is actually as high as 25%. It has to be reduced, and I know there are conversations to that effect taking place. It is important that this is addressed as a matter of priority. The point of raising this matter tonight with regard to the Society of Chartered Surveyors of Ireland, SCSI, is that I believe the Department made an error in what it did over two weeks ago. It drew up the terms of reference in consultation with the SCSI but did not include the voice of the homeowners. That was a mistake. It has eroded confidence in a process that is already at a very vulnerable level. It has really got the homeowners' backs up that they were not part of that as well. I know this has been addressed in terms of trying to have a better stakeholder representation, but the danger here is, with the SCSI feeding into the Department on the terms of reference, whether that door is closed or ajar for the homeowners, who incidentally are meeting with the SCSI today. Can they still have their voice heard and be part of the terms of reference?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State. The response is consistent with the information the Minister has been sending to me. I will focus on several elements. The word "independence" was used a number of times in the reply. This independence has been somewhat tarnished by what has happened in the past two weeks. It is very important that whatever submission the homeowners make is not just seen as a listening exercise but also that they have something to contribute. It has to be done in a proactive way. Since 2014, when the then Minister of State, Paudie Coffey, and I sat in a room with officials from the Department with responsibility for the environment, there have been many false dawns and timeframes. Many months have been mentioned. We have been told that this will be done and that will be done in the next few weeks. We are all coming out of lockdown. People who are fortunate enough to have homes have spent two years in them. Mica homeowners have spent two years in houses that are falling down. They need a timeframe that is honest and upfront. The Minister has said in response to me this will be completed at the end of the spring and the legislation will go through. The Attorney General and his team are working very hard on this. They are making it a priority. They are meeting twice a week. It is very important that we stick to whatever timeframe we give and it does not drag on. According to the old Gaelic calendar spring starts in Ireland on 1 February. It is argued that in the northern hemisphere spring starts on 1 March. We need to be very careful about throwing out timelines that will not be met. We have to help people navigate their way through this. The most important thing that needs to happen today is that people who are owed money for engineering costs need to be repaid. We need facilitators on the ground as a matter of priority.
