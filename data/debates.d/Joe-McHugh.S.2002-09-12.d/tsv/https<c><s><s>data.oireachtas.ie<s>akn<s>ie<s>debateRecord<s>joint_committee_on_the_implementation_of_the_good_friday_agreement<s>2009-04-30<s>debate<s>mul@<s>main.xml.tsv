JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being late.  This is an important piece of work and I commend the Chairman on bringing it to this level as well.  This  is the forum in which to do this.I also welcome the commissioner, Professor Monica McWilliams.  She and her team are very welcome.  I know from my contact with her in Denver during the summer that this is a subject very close to her heart.  Certainly, the work she has been doing on it so far has been very helpful.  I shall not elaborate in any great detail, since I have been late.  Given that there are two commissions within the framework of the Good Friday Agreement, it is very important that they work together.  Certainly, the great synergy we have on a North-South basis in terms of our knowledge of politicians throughout the political spectrum needs working on.  Both commissions should work in tandem as I believe they do.On a parochial level — and Deputy Blaney would agree with me on this — we sometimes find ourselves very involved in cross-Border affairs.  In my constituency office in Letterkenny I receive a good many people from Northern Ireland making representations in terms of the human rights infringements they believe are not being dealt with in that jurisdiction.  I assume the experience is similar in constituency offices in the North, where people from Donegal, Cavan or Monaghan come across.  We need stronger synergies at a Border level and certainly if there are mechanisms for overlap, I should be willing to work closely with the commission on that.
