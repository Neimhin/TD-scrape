JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have learned, from representations made to me this week and from speaking to colleagues in other parts of the country, that a wave of anti-social behaviour is spiralling across the country in the form of the annual pre-Hallowe'en use of bangers and other fireworks.  In one example, which illustrates the link between anti-social behaviour among young people and driving, young people threw bangers out of a car at a petrol pump attendant.  People now live in fear of the potential consequences of such incidents, because had there been a leakage of petrol at the pump in question there would have been serious trouble.  We must call on parents to be extra vigilant, because their children regard such anti-social behaviour as fun.  However, it is not fun and the consequences could be serious.In a further link between anti-social behaviour and driving, some young people drive up behind cyclists and try to knock them off their bicycles.  I call for a debate on anti-social behaviour.
