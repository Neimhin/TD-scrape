JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Although the current peace process in Northern Ireland has reached somewhat of an impasse, the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement still prevails. There is enhanced political and cross-Border communication at local and business levels. However, there is one impediment to enhanced cross-Border co-operation at business level, namely, the "roaming" mobile telephone charges that are incumbent on business people. If we are to discuss gateway status between Derry and Letterkenny and the establishment of a linear business park there, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should intervene with his counterpart in Northern Ireland in the interests of reducing the charges to which I refer. By travelling five miles and crossing the Border, one can incur extra charges. We must facilitate a more harmonised economic baseline for the type of co-operation to which I refer.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome this timely legislation. I also welcome the fact that all Stages are being dealt with in the House this week. I hope the Bill has a speedy passage through the Houses because sensitive redundancy negotiations are taking place in Letterkenny at the Unify plant, where 250 workers were laid off three weeks ago.Senator Mansergh asked where the cut-off point in terms of retrospective redundancy allowances should be located. Perhaps we could start with Castlecomer, where people were made redundant before Christmas. In light of those recent redundancies and the fact that the legislation could have been before the House two to three weeks ago, I support Senator Coghlan's amendment on retrospective payments for people who were made redundant at the beginning of the year.Members are being very parochial by referring to counties Tipperary, Kilkenny and Galway. People in County Donegal are suffering from serious difficulties as a result of the decline of the traditional textile sector. This is the situation which we have been faced with over these last five or six years, even during the so-called Celtic tiger period. The Celtic tiger did not arrive in County Donegal. Perhaps it visited Bundoran on one of the hot days during the summer, but it did not come to the county during the boom years.We set up a task force under the leadership of the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney. The document produced by that task force outlined how we would face the challenges ahead of us, how we would develop more sophisticated and new products and how we would move away from sectors – such as the textile sector – which were in decline. That document is collecting dust on a shelf in the county council office in Lifford. Donegal suffered tremendously during the years of the Celtic tiger and it is mired in quicksand in terms of the provision of jobs in the future. That is not to mention retaining the employment that exists in the county at present.The Tánaiste must take this situation seriously. We must sit down with our local authorities, possibly using the forum of the Seanad, to consider the possibility of providing alternative industries in County Donegal. We must look at high-tech and high-value industries and also at the tourism product on offer in the county. We need to tap into existing resources and move away from the declining traditional sectors of employment.I have no wish to speak only in bleak terms. Opportunities exist in County Donegal. For example, a 144 kilometre stretch of the county lies adjacent to the North and a number of cross-Border opportunities exist. There are business opportunities and investments that can be made through the peace process. I referred to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement on this morning's Order of Business, which is very much in evidence in County Donegal through its working relationship with Derry. However, we must explore fresh opportunities.I welcome this legislation, so fundamental for people losing their jobs. As Senator Mansergh said, it is a sensitive and delicate area and we have to be sympathetic. I would like this Bill to go through the other House by next week and to be signed off as quickly as possible, because there are people depending on it.Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern): I thank all the Senators who have contributed to the debate this afternoon, especially the Opposition Members welcoming this legislation. It is recognised by all Members of the House and the social partners that there is a need to update the statutory redundancy provisions, which is the purpose of this Bill.A number of questions were raised by speakers. The first, by Senator Leyden, related to the repayment of the 60% should an employee refuse to sign the document. The Department will repay the amount provided that the employer can demonstrate that the amount was paid. For example, if one had the returned pay cheque – which one would now have to request from the banks since they have changed their system – that would be proof that the money was paid.Senator Ulick Burke asked when the Bill would come into effect. For the employees to qualify for the changes in the Bill, the date is 25 May, and employees issued with notice of redundancy on that date or later will be entitled to the enhanced payments, i.e. two weeks' pay for each year of service, plus the bonus week. Senator Burke also raised questions regarding retrospection. It has been explained by the Tánaiste that the legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General is that the payment of statutory redundancy lump sums is a legal requirement for employers and could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. Employers are entitled to due notice of the intention to legally require them to pay enhanced rates. The new Redundancy Act has to be brought into effect by ministerial order after enactment by the Oireachtas, and this cannot be made retrospective.Senator John Phelan referred to the meeting with the public representatives from Kilkenny. As was eloquently noted by Senator Mansergh, Senator Phelan said the "impression" he got was that the Tánaiste promised retrospection. According to the minutes, what the Tánaiste actually said was that she would use her best endeavours to get the best possible deal for workers. The impression being given by some people that there was a cast-iron commitment to retrospection does not hold water. Otherwise I am sure that Senator Phelan and his colleagues would be declaring that from the mountain-tops.
