JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I spoke at length to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, yesterday and I will not revisit the points I made. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is aware that many problems have been associated with community development. There has been bad blood between groups and a hostile form of communication has developed between people in different organisations. It should not be forgotten that some groups have operated effectively and constructively, as the Minister of State mentioned. The issue of community development has to be addressed. We can use Paulo Freire's language of community development - grassroots development, involving people on the ground and bringing money to communities - but we have to ask if anything tangible emerges. How effectively does money given to community groups benefit people on the ground? I compliment the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, on the CLÁR programme which has provided some clarity to this area and has meant that people can see a tangible outcome.The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, will be looking for feedback as part of his review of the community development sector. I agree that the jobs of those who have made great efforts need to be protected. People are disenchanted due to the fact that they cannot see an outcome from community development. We should be sensitive to the needs of those employed in partnership programmes or in ADM companies. Community, youth and development workers have put a great deal of effort into their jobs, although the results might not be visible. It might be politically advantageous for the Minister of State to come in with a heavy hand and say that the schemes have not worked, but I ask him to be sensitive to the work that has been done by partnership companies and community workers. Proper mechanisms do not exist to help us to see results on the ground. This committee should be involved in the consultation as much as possible. I ask the Minister of State to treat this matter with extreme sensitivity.
