JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Tá leithscéalta faighte againn ó Teachtaí Harkin agus Calleary. We have received apologies from Deputies Harkin and Calleary. This is a very important session on EU industrial policy priorities, including vaccine production and digital transformation. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Thierry Breton, Commissioner for the Internal Market, European Commission. We are looking forward to this engagement. I thank the Commissioner for the important detail of keeping his presentation brief, which will allow for more engagement. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting. Unfortunately, the Commissioner must be at another meeting by 10.40 a.m. He has obliged us by providing a short opening statement and I will try to get all members into the session. I call the Commissioner to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. We will begin our questions. As our time is limited there will be a five-minute cap on it. I call Deputy Howlin, to be followed by Deputy Richmond. He has five minutes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry to interrupt the Commissioner, but could he repeat the statistics for vaccines for Ireland? They are important. He referred to 70% but there was a bit of interference.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are well over the five minutes at this stage. Could the Commissioner give a brief response-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps he could come back with a written response to the second question because I want to allow other members to ask questions about digital issues.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is no problem.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It will be between 4.5 million and 5 million.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. The next speaker is Senator Martin, to be followed by Deputy-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have two more contributors to come in and there are only ten minutes left.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator. There were two big items on the agenda for this meeting, namely, the digital transformation and vaccine production, but the issue of vaccination has dominated the discussion, so the Commissioner may wish to appear again before the committee at his convenience to deal with the digital side of things.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. I wonder how solúbhta or flexible he is with his time. There are three more members who have indicated that they wish to speak.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Commissioner is very good to give us an extra five minutes. If members are specific with their questions, all three will be answered. First, I call Deputy Brady, followed by Deputy Duffy.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Commissioner has been generous in giving us an extra five minutes. There are five questions remaining. We do not have time for individual questions. I will get specific questions from Deputy Duffy and Senator Keogan. Perhaps Senator Chambers wants to come in. I will then revert to the Commissioner, and he can have the final say and decide when he has to leave.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will give the Commissioner the final word. I have a specific question. Many major pharmaceutical companies are based here and have a significant presence in Ireland. Is anything we in Ireland can do to support the European and global vaccine effort? The Commissioner can try to answer those nine questions as best he can.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an gCoimisinéir as ucht an ama agus as ucht a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht inniu. I thank the Commissioner for being part of this debate today. On behalf of the committee, I thank him for his engagement.
