JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to do that. I have worked closely with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, who has responsibility for the higher education sector. I am happy to take the Deputy's constructive suggestion about getting involved.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Donegal is now on the agenda. I confirm to Deputy McConalogue that my officials and representatives from Donegal County Council are very engaged on acquiring a site. I was in Crana College last Monday week and had the opportunity to meet the principal and other staff. Their sense of urgency is a focus, and I will have an opportunity on Friday, when the Deputy will no doubt also be in attendance, to meet the education and training board in Letterkenny to ensure this stays live on the agenda. There is a local solution, but it will require intense focus at local level, county council level and on the part of the Department. It is a focus in my contact and communication with the schools and the education and training board. We have to find a solution. People are getting frustrated. The Deputy and I want to see this progress, as do the politicians on the ground. It is to be hoped the engagement on Friday will help us to keep this firmly on the agenda.
