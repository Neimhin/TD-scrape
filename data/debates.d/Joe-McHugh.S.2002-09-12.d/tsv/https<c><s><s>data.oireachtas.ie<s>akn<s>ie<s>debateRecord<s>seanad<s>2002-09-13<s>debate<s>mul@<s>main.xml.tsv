JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach and the Leas-Chathaoirleach on their appointment and thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me one minute of speaking time last night. In calling for a "Yes" vote on the Nice treaty, I would like to talk about my membership over the past three years of the committee of the Assembly of European Regions. In that time, I have had the special privilege of working with politicians from western, central and eastern Europe. We have debated, discussed and exchanged information on a range of issues such as regional aid, aviation, gender, industrial employment, the environment, transport and the ageing European constituency. Working with Hungarian, Polish and Romanian politicians, among others, was a special privilege.As we worked together, we discussed the "No" vote in the last referendum. It was not taken as negatively in eastern Europe as we might think from newspaper coverage here. Politicians there examined the result critically and examined why the Irish people alienated themselves by not turning out to vote. They also examined why people voted "No" to the Nice treaty. We discussed that and also discussed the European model. There was a feeling among those looking on from outside that the centralisation of the European project has placed it too far away from the people. I hope that the European project will continue, but it must become a decentralised model based on the principles of subsidiarity and regional and national autonomy in the decision-making process.During my time on the committee since 1999, I have come across various projects including regional aviation projects in Sweden, alternative farming projects in Poland and tourism projects in Romania and Hungary. I believe that the European project is about sharing experiences but holding on to our unique national identity. Placing regionalism at the core, we can hold on to our cultural identity, languages and traditions through the decentralisation process.There is a fear put about by scaremongerers that the European project has become a federal project similar to that of the United States or the  Länder system in Germany. I disagree. There will not be a federal Europe but one based on contributions from individual states which will hold on to their uniqueness. It will not be a system based on uniformity. If the “No” vote carries this time, we will send out negative signals. The message to our eastern European counterparts will be harmful and irreversible.The Minister spoke about myths. The myth I wish to highlight is that of Ireland as a country that has been a net benefactor from its membership of the European Union, something I disagree with. It is true that we have benefited substantially in financial terms but we have also contributed to the European project. It is an insult to graduates, industrialists and politicians to say that Ireland has benefited only. We have contributed. In light of that contribution I feel that central and eastern European countries are in a position to contribute by offering their services and expertise. We can learn from them and have a rich European project based on that.One of the politicians I met in Poland asked if I could help two students from his country by assisting them for one month in Ireland. They came to Letterkenny, travelled to and enjoyed the ambience of Galway, visited the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim, toured the city walls in Derry. They even went to Cavan and enjoyed it. They had a great time and left having experienced warmth, hospitality and a great reception in Donegal. They asked me one question as they left. They asked why the Irish people, who had given them such a warm reception, would not allow Poland to join the Union. It is a question we should think about.When we are selling this to the public we must say that we have contributed to the Union, helped design the European project which continues to change and evolve and we should continue to change with it. It is a matter of national importance.
