JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources	2002-09-12	None	The draft bioenergy plan was published in October and will undergo strategic environmental and appropriate assessments which will inform the content of the finalised plan. These assessment processes will commence shortly. The draft plan sets out the broader context for the development of the biomass sector, as well as the current status with regard to the range of policy areas that must be co-ordinated to create the conditions necessary to support the development of this sector. The REFIT, renewable energy feed in tariff, schemes are the primary means through which electricity from a range of renewable sources is supported. In this regard, electricity from biomass, including co-firing with peat, is already supported through REFIT. The draft bioenergy plan recommends the continuation of REFIT for electricity generated from biomass and that the scheme would be kept under review to assess the most cost-effective way to support co-firing of biomass with peat. The choice of technology is, however, ultimately a commercial decision for individual project developers and the fuel used at the Moneypoint plant is a matter for the operator. The Minister has no role or function in this regard. Notwithstanding this, there are several important issues that would demand further consideration before biomass could be used at Moneypoint. The conversion of Moneypoint to biomass would require significant levels of capital investment by the operator. Support tariffs substantially higher than those available for wind, the most cost-effective renewable technology in the electricity market, would also be required which could lead to increased electricity prices. Substantially more biomass than is available domestically would be required with large amounts of the resource having to be imported leading to uncertainty in security of supply. The sustainability of transporting large amounts of imported biomass would also be a cause for concern. The commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector where biomass can be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy that biomass has a role in the bioenergy sector. It is hoped that biomass will account for 5% of the renewable electricity targets for 2020. Bord na Móna’s peat-generating plant in Edenderry, County Offaly, has been using biomass. It is expected the plant will apply to the Department under the REFIT scheme. The ESB, however, has so far not given any indication of using biomass at its power station in Lanesboro, County Longford. While transportation costs are a factor, the real concern is with the renewable heat sector. Biomass is more efficient in this regard. Unlike wind, it is also a scarce resource. While there are constraints in its use, I accept there is potential in the use of biomass.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy and I are on the same page with regard to the potential of this sector. If officials have not examined the case in the United Kingdom to which the Deputy referred as part of the consultation process on the draft bioenergy plan, I will ensure they do so. Realising the potential from forestry presents cross-departmental opportunities. I will contact the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to examine this potential. The way forward is to take a concerted, constructive and organised approach.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta as ucht a teachtaireacht dearfa agus guím Nollaig shona air fosta. Work on the development of a definitive energy policy is continuing. More than 1,240 written submissions were received arising from the public consultation process by the deadline of the end of July last. The Department is continuing to consider these submissions and engaging, through a series of seminars, with citizens and interested stakeholders, to ensure all views are heard and understood. It is also seeking to ensure that the assumptions on which the final policy paper will be written are tested and accurate so as to produce a dynamic and responsive evidence based framework, which will allow us to achieve a balance between sustainability, security and competitiveness challenges and opportunities. Our overarching energy policy objective is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced energy to all consumers. While fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy. The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding 16% target from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through electricity, heat and transport.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind. To date, wind energy has been the most cost-effective renewable technology in the electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target. Work on the design of future incentives for renewable generation will commence next year. Any incentives will ensure maximum value for the electricity consumer and an appropriate return to project developers.  It should also be noted that the building regulations support the uptake of renewable heat. The draft bioenergy plan recommends the introduction from 2016 of a renewable heat incentive for larger heat users to change to renewable source heating solutions. In the transport sector, the biofuels obligation scheme and grants for purchasing electric vehicles underpin renewable energy deployment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are moving into a new phase in which we must be ambitious about what can be achieved. Whether using biofuels or providing grants for electric vehicles, we must consider all options. I have here a statistic on the biofuel obligation which will give the Deputy an idea of changes taking place in this area. The biofuel obligation increased from 4% to 6% from January 2013 and further increases will be required in future years if we are to comply with the renewable energy directive. The requirement for increased amounts of biofuel will incentivise the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market, which will support indigenous biofuel producers and expand the sustainable indigenous production of biofuels. In 2013, for example, 150 million litres of biofuel were placed on the Irish market. We must be ambitious and examine international best practice. Every politician in the House is in contact with individuals involved in the renewable energy industry or university research in this area. A forum is also required in the House to advance new ideas on renewable energy. Officials in the Department are open to having such an engagement.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The introduction of wind energy is having a direct effect on price and creating a more competitive market. The development by EirGrid of east-west infrastructure in recent years has also contributed to the energy mix and introduced more competition. While final agreement has not yet been reached on the new INTERREG programme, it appears there will be a pillar focused directly on sustainable transport. This issue will affect the Deputy's constituency. Perhaps we need to have a conversation at this juncture about how the Department and Government can proactively feed into the INTERREG funding that will come on stream in 2015. The Deputy and I come from the same neck of the woods and our constituencies do not have access to sophisticated transport infrastructure. As we both come from the Border area, we will be in a position to target INTERREG funding under the sustainable transport pillar in the year ahead.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his question. The national broadband plan aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  The commercial telecommunications sector is currently investing approximately €2.5 billion in network upgrades and I understand that over €18 million has been invested in broadband services in Kerry over the past 18 months. Approximately 1.6 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland are expected to have access to commercial high speed broadband services over the next number of years. These very significant investments represent a step-change in the quality of broadband services available. On 24 November last, a public consultation on a national high speed coverage map 2016 was launched. This allows all members of the public, be they business or residential, to identify whether their premises-home is included in the Government's proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on a county-by-county basis as to which villages and townlands are to be included. The map can be accessed at www.broadband.gov.ie. The areas on the map marked blue will all have access to high speed broadband services of at least 30 Mbps from the commercial sector by end of 2016. The areas marked amber will require the intervention of the State. It is anticipated that speeds of at least 30 Mbps will be delivered through the Government's intervention and the network will be designed to cater for future increased demand from consumers and business. The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder-bidders towards the end of 2015. In this regard, the Department will design a tender in a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. It is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The reason the Minister introduced this intervention last month is to try to address the challenge of broadband service provision in Kerry and other parts of the country that do not have access to broadband, be that for businesses, primary schools, secondary schools or at a domestic level. The focus now is on whether the mix in this regard will be a combination of wireless and copper or fibre. The process is a complex one in that we must adhere to EU guidelines in relation to commercial services. Where commercial companies are unable to access services, State intervention will be provided. It is crucial that people who feel excluded make known their situation between now and June 2015. There is already engagement on this issue between the Department and Kerry County Council and other local authorities but we must ensure this engagement is ongoing.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I share those sentiments and can relate to the Deputy's argument. I have come across similar businesses. In regard to the specific business in Castleisland, if the Deputy forwards me the details, I will discuss it with my Department officials and seek to have them engage with the company. I also have responsibility for the Gaeltacht in County Kerry. Údarás na Gaeltachta is already engaging with the Department as part of the strategic consultation process to identify deficits and how we can move forward. Earlier I used the word "ambitious" in regard to renewable energy. With regard to broadband, we need to be strategically aggressive in our pursuit of broadband service provision. The situation in respect of the provision of broadband services is not dissimilar to that in which this country found itself in the 1920s with regard to rural electrification. Broadband is in a similar space to that of electricity in the 1920s in that it is necessary. As stated by the Deputy, we must do everything to combat the discrimination in terms of the rural-urban divide. I will work with the Deputy on any issues to do with County Kerry.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. The Eircode postcode has been designed, inter alia, to manage challenges around finding addresses in Ireland, specifically the fact that more than 35% of addresses are not unique. This issue underpins the solution adopted which will assign a unique seven-digit alphanumeric identifier to each address. The first three characters of the code, called a routing key, will be used to help sort mail, but it is not directly linked to counties, towns or other geographic features. A routing key will be shared by a number of properties in an area, and will become familiar, rather like the prefix on landline phone numbers. The second part of the Eircode postcode, the unique identifier, has four characters drawn from a carefully selected set of letters and numbers that identify each address. The Eircode design has a flexible structure with plenty of spare capacity. That means that it is future-proofed to allow for changes to buildings and new developments. There has been widespread support from public sector bodies and private businesses, with particular interest from the retail and financial industries, for the introduction of postcodes nationally. For example, Nightline, Ireland’s biggest independent logistics firm, is fully supportive of the introduction of Eircode. In addition, the emergency services and, in particular, the National Ambulance Service, have welcomed the introduction of Eircode as the codes will facilitate the speedier deployment of its services. The Freight Transport Association of Ireland and other bodies, as the Deputy has pointed out, have expressed concerns over the non-sequenced nature of Eircode. A sequential design has a number of drawbacks, including the potential to lead to the inability to assign a sequential Eircode postcode to new builds and to cope with the expansion in the number of addresses in the future. The cost to the Exchequer of the national postcode system over the ten-year cycle of the contract is expected to be €27 million, excluding VAT, with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and postcode distribution. An extensive public information campaign will commence early next year to inform the public about Eircode postcodes and promote their use. This will include outreach activities to ensure the public, especially the vulnerable and hard-to-reach, obtain information on Eircode in a timely manner. Eircode postcodes are expected to be launched by the middle of next year when every household and business in the country will receive a letter containing their postcode.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The cost to the Exchequer of the national Eircode system over the ten-year cycle of the contract is expected to be €27 million, excluding VAT, with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and postcode distribution. The cost of the contract will be €16 million over the first two years and a further €1.2 million per annum for the remaining eight years of the contract. The bulk of the cost can be attributed to the dissemination and communications processes. The cost of designing the Eircode postcodes and associated databases is not a significant component of the overall cost. Capita, the company employed, has been paid €3.22 million, including VAT, to date on foot of delivery of agreed milestones. For further clarification, consultancy costs from 2010 to 2014 were €1.12797 million. PA Consulting received €941,000, including VAT, Mason Hayes & Curran received €141,000, including VAT, while other consultants received €44,000. The Deputy referred specifically to costs. On the cost to businesses and SMEs from the introduction of Eircode, Eircode postcodes will be made available to a variety of business users who can avail of the postcodes free of charge for a limited number of look-ups per day, approximately 15, from a dedicated website.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Rather than repeat what I said in my reply, I will revert to my officials. If there are other costs or ancillary costs, I will get the officials from the Department to shed more light on them. The important point about costs is something on which all Departments have to be focused, namely, efficiency. There is a lot of engagement with An Post, for example, in terms of data. It has a geodirectory and information systems. Where there are efficiencies and savings can be made, there is no doubt that the Minister, Deputy White, will ensure that will be done. If there are ancillary costs and a further breakdown other than the information available here, I will get officials to get in touch with the Deputy directly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be repeating some information as the question is similar to others. The cost to the Exchequer of the national postcode system over the ten-year cycle of the contract is expected to be €27 million, excluding VAT, with costs covering design, database upgrades, media and postcode distribution. A contract was signed with Capita Business Support Services Ireland limited in December 2013 to develop and roll out the national postcode system over a ten-year period. Total spend to date on that contract is €3.22 million. Aside from the contract with Capita, consultancy costs of €1.12797 million, including VAT, have been incurred from 2010 to date on the national postcode system. The design for the national postcode system was approved by Government and the brand Eircode was launched for the national postcode system in April 2014. Capita launched the website www.eircode.ie earlier this year. Over recent months, Capita has engaged with a number of private and public stakeholders to brief them on the project and prepare them for the launch of Eircode postcodes next year. Overall, the response to the project has been very positive. To support dissemination of Eircode postcodes, the databases of large public sector bodies are being Eircode enabled. This work is expected to be concluded this month, which means that public sector bodies with large customer-facing databases will be in a position to use the codes immediately on launch. An extensive public information campaign will commence early next year to inform the public about Eircodes and promote their usage. This will include outreach activities to ensure the public, and especially the vulnerable and hard to reach, obtain information on Eircodes in a timely manner. Eircodes are expected to be launched by the middle of next year when every household and business in the country will receive a letter containing their Eircode. Although not aimed primarily at growing the post office network, it is expected that Eircodes will assist the mail service by providing a stimulus to mail volumes through direct marketing capabilities. In addition, An Post has been selected to disseminate Eircodes next year and will benefit accordingly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his questions. On the first point with regard to emergency services, my information is that the ambulance services have welcomed it. I do not have information on fire services but my officials certainly will follow up on that point. An exhaustive consultative process has been carried out in this regard and consequently, I am sure the fire services already have been contacted. However, if concerns exist there, the Department must follow up on them. In respect of the non-sequenced nature of the Eircode system, there probably is a couple of elements in the thinking behind it. First, one reason behind the non-sequenced mechanism is the desire to avoid setting up a discriminatory system in which certain areas could be targeted by geography or otherwise if they all were in one block. Second, a feature of development in Ireland is the use of once-off housing. The Deputy might consider an example of a roadway in his own constituency in which two houses stand at present. It is possible that in two years' time, a brother or sister will build a house in between the two. It would be difficult to come up with a sequenced system that would build into future planning. However, I certainly will raise the concern regarding the fire services.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge that a number of concerns were raised in the past. There always will be issues with a new system but with regard to the Data Protection Commissioner, as part of the Department's approach to the introduction of Eircodes, communications between the two have addressed the implementation, dissemination and commercialisation of Eircodes to ensure adherence to all pertinent data protection legislation. The Data Protection Commissioner's office has been advised of and has noted the rationale and policy justification for the approach suggested for the Eircode roll-out and implementation. However, I believe the key point regarding the roll-out is the intricate - I will not use that word and even am struggling with English words these days - the intrinsic link between An Post and the system. It will be part of the roll-out and its expertise and knowledge base is absolutely paramount to the success of this project because it has its GeoDirectory and has the information whereby postal staff on the ground know precisely where the people are. Consequently, An Post is a key and integral part of this development.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. The programme for Government commits to examining the role and collection of the television licence fee in light of existing and projected convergence of technologies and to transforming the television licence into a household-based public service broadcasting charge to be applied to all eligible households and applicable businesses, regardless of the device used to access content or services. The Minister is currently considering the charge in the context of funding of public service broadcasting, arising from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's five-year review of broadcasting, including a new system of determining the adequacy of funding for public service broadcasters and a revision of the current governance arrangements for advertising minutage. In conjunction with this, the Minister is considering possible amendments in respect of certain administrative and operational issues identified in the period since the Act came into effect. Until he has given his full consideration to these matters and has brought proposals in that regard to the Cabinet for decisions, there will be no change to the current arrangements.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In respect of the spend and the money that is not being collected, there is an evasion figure of anywhere between 15% and 16%. The total amount for the television licence is between €185 million and €190 million - I believe the latter is the correct figure. I am aware, for example, that some of this money goes to the likes of TG4 and is going back into the system. Moreover, from my work in my other portfolio, I am aware that this money is going to a place where it is being well spent. As for the Deputy's question where he sought a simple "Yes" or "No" answer, in the reply I gave, the Minister has stated categorically that there will be no change at present. My own thoughts in this regard concern the complexity of the subject. We are entering a whole new world with so much changing so quickly whereby people are not even using laptops for their daily news-feeds but are using their iPhones.Given the complexity of usage, the Minister needs to take time to reflect. If we have learned anything as a Government in the past six to seven months, it is that it is important to take time and do things properly rather than rush them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will be taking more time to work out a very complex system.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation with the UK Government in January 2013, a joint programme of work was undertaken to consider how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both Ireland and the UK. Economic analysis conducted on the Irish side clearly indicates that, under agreed policy and regulatory conditions, renewable energy trading could deliver significant economic benefits to Ireland and the UK, as well as being attractive to developers. However, given the economic, policy and regulatory complexities involved and some key decisions that the UK is not yet in a position to take, delivery by 2020 of renewable energy trading will not be possible. In the context of a European internal energy market, it would appear that greater trade in energy between Britain and Ireland is likely in the post-2020 scenario. Domestically, onshore wind energy has been the most cost-efficient renewable electricity technology in the Irish market. Detailed analysis by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, and EirGrid found that for 2011, wind generation lowered wholesale prices and offset the costs of the public service obligation levy and other associated costs related to renewable electricity. In addition, the recently published SEAI report on quantifying Ireland's fuel and CO2 emissions savings from renewable electricity in 2012 found that as a result of wind generation, almost 600 kilotonnes of oil equivalent of imported fossil fuels, valued at €180 million, were displaced with a consequent CO2 saving of 1.5 million tonnes valued at €11 million. Analysis undertaken by the Department, the SEAI, EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation assessed the costs and value of choosing the path towards 40% renewable electricity generation in 2020 compared with a scenario where renewable electricity remained at 2013 levels. This analysis informed a report which the Minister expects to receive and publish shortly.  Separately, the second phase of public consultation on the renewable electricity policy and development framework will commence shortly with the publication of a strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment scoping document. The renewable electricity policy and development framework is expected to be completed in 2015.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was not involved but I was certainly watching very closely from the sidelines when I was Co-Chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly when the agreement went to a memorandum of understanding between the British and Irish Governments. There was momentum behind the movement towards a bilateral agreement between the UK and Ireland. That did not happen and that conversation is off until 2018 or post-2020. Between now and then, we must be creative in our ways of doing things. We should not, as an island nation, rely solely on the UK as a potential partner. We should be looking at the likes of France and other creative options. How far advanced are universities in their research in terms of tidal energy and how does that affect getting foreshore licences? We need to look at the entire mix and I am certainly prepared to work with the Deputy on this issue. If we are going to be moving to a period of time where resources will become scarce, we need to be ahead of the posse and work closely with the European Commission on these matters.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not have the answer but I will get the Minister, who has responsibility for this section, to get back to the Deputy on that question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his question. It is Government policy that An Post should remain a strong and viable company in a position to provide a high-quality postal service and maintain a nationwide customer-focused network of post offices in the community. The network stands well-positioned to become the front office provider of choice for Government and the financial services sector for both electronic transactions as well as the more traditional over-the-counter transactions. It would be wrong to ignore the significant challenges facing the post office network in the current economic climate while also taking account of changes in technology and general retail behaviour. The future of the post office network will only be secured by its continuing to modernise and diversify in the provision of services that large numbers of people and business users want to use and that are sustainable in the long term. Currently, there is a whole-of-Government review under the auspices of the Cabinet committee on social policy exploring the scope for providing additional public services and securing new lines of business through the post office network. The Minister has been engaged with both An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union concerning this review as and when appropriate.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I completely agree. Prior to the local elections, a debate was raging throughout the country about post offices. The overarching message from people within the communities we both serve was that the post office was an important one-stop-shop where people could meet. This must be the ultimate focus of any debate with An Post as technology improves.We spoke earlier about broadband and that we will try to bring either wireless, fibre or copper to every home but we do not want to create a society where people do everything from their sitting room. We must focus on the idea that people must still meet each other. There are many suggestions being made to the Department, for example, that post offices should be developed to have a sharper focus on banking. AIB has a contract in this respect and Aviva has a contract relating to insurance. The Revenue Commissioners includes An Post as one of the three avenues for people paying property tax, so we must be conscious of keeping people moving through the doors of post offices. Ultimately, it is a place for people to meet. Some people have even proposed that they could become types of Internet hubs as well for people to access online facilities. There are plenty of creative options, including that from the Deputy, and we will work from the Government policy of keeping those post offices.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will certainly ensure that proposal will feed into the business development group. The Deputy asked where is the process now, with the conversation having started in March or April. At an October meeting of the Cabinet committee on social policy, approval was conveyed for the establishment of a business development group to examine potential opportunities for both government and commercial sectors. The group will be chaired by an independent chairperson and will have representation from An Post. My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for rural affairs, Deputy Ann Phelan, will have significant input, along with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The group will also have the capability to call on representatives from other Departments, and it will be asked to provide an interim report by the end of the first quarter of 2015, with a final report concluded by the second quarter of 2015.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his question. The Grid Link project will facilitate the integration of renewable energy onto the transmission system, reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels and facilitate further electricity interconnection with Europe, providing a more secure electricity system. Despite the recent recession and drop in electricity demand, there remains a concern about the emerging risk to the security of supply in the south and east of the country, brought about largely by heavy power flows through the network. EirGrid estimates that, if left unchecked, the existing grid in the south and east of Ireland would not be sufficient to meet our future electricity needs, thus jeopardising electricity supply to the area. In meeting its obligations to ensure the system is secure, EirGrid proposed the Grid Link project to strengthen the grid and fulfil expected requirements in the south east. EirGrid reviews all projects and strategies at regular intervals to take into account relevant developments, including economic conditions and electricity demand forecasts. In 2010, a review of Grid25 resulted in EirGrid reducing the estimated cost of the programme to €3.2 billion. EirGrid is currently undertaking a further review, with the outcome expected in the first quarter of 2015. In January 2014, an independent expert panel was established to examine the Grid West and Grid Link projects. EirGrid is undertaking analysis on fully undergrounded and overhead options for each of the projects in accordance with terms of reference set by the panel, which are available on the Department’s website. In due course, the panel will provide an opinion to the Minister on the completeness, objectivity and comparability of the studies and reports and will oversee the publication by EirGrid of the two studies and reports prior to EirGrid proceeding to public consultation on the two projects. The panel expects to be in a position to provide an opinion to the Minister on the Grid West project in the first quarter of 2015. An opinion on the Grid Link project is expected in the third quarter of 2015.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There was public pressure and it is important that there is engagement and consultation in response to that pressure. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Rabbitte, set up the panel to consider the options of overhead pylons versus underground lines. I encourage the Deputy to feed into the process, and his contribution today will I hope form part of that. It is a fairly tight timeframe but it is important that both options are considered. The issue of overhead pylons and wind turbines is a difficult space. I agree that people realise that energy requirements are a practical reality and important, particularly if we are seeking to attract investment in new industry. I will take on board the Deputy's points.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Having found out who exactly is on the panel, I would be confident of its composition in terms of independence. Obviously, it has terms of reference. The panel is chaired by Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness and includes Professor John FitzGerald; the economist, Mr. Colm McCarthy; engineering professor, Keith Bell, from the University of Strathclyde; and Dr. Karen Foley, head of the school of landscape architecture in UCD. I am confident that we have an independent group and I hope there will be a comprehensive examination of all the concerns in the first report in quarter one of 2015.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the questions. Is it okay with the Ceann Comhairle if we take the two questions together?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will respond to the first question but will keep the other question in the back of my mind. The national broadband plan, NBP, aims to ensure that every citizen and business, regardless of location, has access to a high quality, high speed broadband service. This will be achieved through a combination of commercial investments and a State-led intervention in areas where commercial services will not be provided.  On 24 November last, the Minister, Deputy White, launched a public consultation on the national high speed coverage map 2016. This allows all members of the public, whether business or residential, to see whether their premises or home is included in the Government’s proposed intervention. It also provides detailed information on a county-by-county basis as to which villages and townlands are to be included. My Department is responsible for the calculation of the costs associated with the Government's intervention under the plan. This is an important part of the detailed work that is being undertaken to finalise the detailed intervention strategy. Ultimately, however, the outcome of the tender process will determine the final cost of the intervention.  Detailed technical, legal, regulatory, financial and economic evaluations are required to ensure that the tender will be designed in such a way that maximises efficiencies and keeps the cost to taxpayers as low as possible. Given the strong dynamic that currently exists in the Irish broadband market we can expect a very competitive procurement process. The next steps in this process will see a further public consultation on the detailed intervention strategy in mid-2015. A detailed procurement process will be undertaken in order to select a potential bidder or bidders towards the end of 2015 and it is expected that the physical build of this network will commence from 2016. This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in Ireland and no doubt in Longford-Westmeath.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will take the two questions in the short time available. It is a complex process because we must adhere to EU competition guidelines. The Department is not in a position to say whether it will be fibre, copper or wireless or a combination. I agree with Deputy Moynihan that fibre is where it is at in terms of business, whether the MANs network or Project Kelvin in the north west. The competitive nature of this and compliance with EU regulations are important. We are looking at a constructive timeframe post-summer 2015 and at going to tender. Whether it will be a bidder or a combination of bidders, this is where the focus must be. The physical infrastructure is there. We have ESB and Eircom infrastructures. There are also wireless solutions. A gap will be filled by commercial companies. The ESB has already announced 50 towns and Eircom announced another project in the past month targeting other towns, but there will be gaps.  There is a map. I encourage the Deputies to go to the local authorities, including that in Longford-Westmeath. I am sure there is engagement with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. They know what is available, what is missing and what is included. If there are to be changes on the map between now and summer 2015, there is an option there. Again, I encourage Deputies to engage with the local authorities which are already doing this at a formal level. If there are to be changes to the map, let us make them. We are moving into a new space in regard to broadband. It is not just about providing broadband for present day needs. We have to look at how this broadband infrastructure, both commercial and State-led, will provide for the needs ahead, whatever they will be. Things are changing so quickly. I do not know what the needs will be but the people involved in the industry know where broadband capabilities, supply and services will be in the next ten to 20 years.
