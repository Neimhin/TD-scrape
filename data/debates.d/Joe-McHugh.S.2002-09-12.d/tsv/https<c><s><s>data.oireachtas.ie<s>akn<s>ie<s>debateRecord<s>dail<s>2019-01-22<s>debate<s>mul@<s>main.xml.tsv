JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills	2002-09-12	None	Coming from a Border county, a no-deal Brexit is the worst possible outcome and would not be in the interests of the UK, Ireland or the EU. While I, along with my Cabinet colleagues, continue to watch developments in the UK closely, my Department continues work to prepare for the UK’s exit. This work, at national and EU level, continues to intensify, taking account of all possible outcomes. Central to all planning scenarios, the maintenance of rights and privileges under the common travel area, CTA, will protect much of the valuable and rich co-operation which takes place between education on a North-South and an east-west basis. My officials have engaged with colleagues in the Department for Education in the UK on a set of principles which are designed to maintain and build on this co-operation. I am working closely with my Cabinet colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to conclude this process. It is important to note that, notwithstanding the type of Brexit, the CTA will be in place. Naturally, I do not wish for a disorderly Brexit, but prudently, I am preparing for this. As part of my Department’s contribution to the Government contingency action plan, an amendment to the Student Support Act 2011 has now been included as one of the parts of the proposed miscellaneous provisions (withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on 29 March 2019) Bill. This will facilitate the continued payment of SUSI grants to Irish students attending UK and Northern Irish higher education institutions and to UK and Northern Irish students studying in Irish higher education institutions. As well as that amendment, I also recently announced that EU fees would continue to apply to UK and Northern Irish students for the 2019-2020 academic year. This brings certainty to UK and Northern Irish students who can be assured that the EU fees will apply for the duration of their studies in Ireland. However, equally important, both of these actions will ensure that Irish school leavers seeking to pursue their higher education in the UK and Northern Ireland will have certainty as they are making their CAO or UCAS choices at this time. My Department will continue to monitor all Brexit developments carefully. I can assure all stakeholders in education that the contingency planning is being constantly refined to reduce risks arising from Brexit substantially.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy on bringing certainty to these matters. We are already in the first fortnight in January and students in Northern Ireland do not have certainty. It is not good enough if we are going to look at long-term planning or long-term commitments to North-South co-operation as well as the movement of people. Statistics show that the number of students from the South going North has gone down over the past five years. However, the number of students coming from the North to study in the Republic is going up. At the same time, we have to give a little more certainty. People do not live in six-month, nine-month or 12 month vacuums. Students who are doing their junior certificate or their GCSEs are in that space of thinking ahead to where they will get their university education.I aim to work with the Deputy on that point. The Deputy asked about guarantees in the event of a no-deal Brexit. I suppose the honest answer is we do not have any guarantees of any variety in the space in which we find ourselves. My officials and I, with the Cabinet as a collective, are trying to control what we can with these omnibus Bills. The free fees aspect of the matter is outside legislation and will be covered by an administrative or policy change. Over 200 students are in the Irish SUSI system this year from the United Kingdom and nearly 1,500 students are getting grants in the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, so we must ensure that aspect is protected at all costs.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Let us see what we can do in the space. For example, the University of Edinburgh announces measures one year at a time and I know a student who is looking to go to the Netherlands, with that decision possibly taken two years ago. Let us look at the creative space in which we can allow ourselves to work, whether it is on a North-South or east-west basis. I am prepared to work with the Deputy on that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. The Teaching Council is the body with statutory responsibility for the regulation of the teaching profession, including the registration of teachers in Ireland. The Teaching Council (Registration) Regulations 2016 set out the requirements to be registered as a teacher in Ireland. Under these regulations there are four defined routes to registration, namely primary, post-primary, further education and other routes. My Department has no plans to amend the Teaching Council (Registration) Regulations 2016 to include a special education teacher category. Under section 38 of the Teaching Council Act, all initial teacher education programmes in Ireland that lead to registration must have professional accreditation from the Teaching Council in accordance with the criteria and guidelines for programme providers published in June 2011 and revised in March 2017. Under the council’s criteria for initial teacher education, student teachers in all accredited programmes are required to undertake study in inclusive education, including special education. Schools should endeavour to assign experienced teachers to special classes with appropriate qualifications and, wherever possible, a background in working with students with special educational needs. Schools should also be proactive in meeting the continuing professional development needs of their special class teachers, in addition to developing and reviewing their whole school polices in the education and inclusion of students with special educational needs. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, support service delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support for teachers working with students with special educational needs in special classes. Schools planning to open special class provision should contact the NCSE support service as soon as they receive their letter of sanction in order to facilitate planning for training of teachers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is an area in which I have a massive interest as well. The investment this year alone in the special educational needs area will be approximately €1.75 billion, which is a 44% increase since 2011. Special classes numbers have gone from just under 500 to approximately 1,500 and we still have a long way to go. I know from parliamentary questions and letters that there is a massive pressure for additional ASD units, and I am very conscious of the fact we need to do more. I am also very conscious that there is a cohort of people in the SNA sector, as referenced by the Deputy, and 16,000 SNAs will work in the system this year. They are waiting on the implementation of recommendations from the recent SNA review. I met with the Ulster-Connacht division two weekends ago and I committed to trying to complete that as soon as possible. I will deal with that personally. With regard to training, my confidence lies in the social inclusion and special needs aspect of teacher training. I am also conscious that SNAs have very much been part of the wonderful journey taken so far that has led to a success story. I know they have more to give and that is why we must consider the recommendations for continuous professional development for them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am certainly happy to look at this to see how we can improve and what supports we can provide for SNAs who are willing to retrain and re-skill, which is really important. I will be working very closely on the very good recommendations made in the SNA review. I am challenging myself on the language we use regarding autism. I met AsIAm before Christmas and my officials since. On inclusiveness, are we using the proper titles? Even a term like "ASD unit" has all sorts of connotation; perhaps, therefore, it is time to really look at the language we use. I constantly use the term children or young people with autism, which is also wrong. They are autistic; it is not something that will be here today and gone tomorrow. I will work closely with the representative groups, but I would also like to hear Deputies' viewpoints on our use of language, even in the circulars I issue. I know that my officials are very conscious of this issue. It is a class, not a unit. It is not a disorder; rather, it is something people are born with. With the proper supports and services, they will get through life as well as anybody else who is not autistic.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for this question about an issue that is close to my heart. While in opposition I highlighted the important role played by school secretaries. As somebody who worked in a secondary school, I realise the burden they are under and the important role they play. I recognise the very important work done by them and other support staff in the running of schools and I am grateful to them for the contribution they make to the education system. I have spoken to a number of school secretaries about their employment conditions. Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers and caretakers in schools. The schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008. They have been superseded by the more extensive capitation grant schemes. The current grant scheme was agreed to in the context of the Programme for Economic and Social Progress which was published in 1991. The majority of primary and voluntary secondary schools now receive assistance to provide for secretarial, caretaking and cleaning services under the grant schemes. It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. Where a school uses the grant funding for caretaking or secretarial purposes, staff taken on to support these functions are employees of individual schools. Specific responsibility for pay and conditions rests with the school.  On foot of a chairman's note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department engaged with the unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. The arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019. It was designed to be of greatest benefit to lower paid secretaries and caretakers. For example, a secretary or caretaker who was paid the then minimum wage of €8.65 per hour in 2015 prior to the arbitration agreement will, from 1 January 2019, be paid €13 per hour, a 50% increase in that individual's hourly pay rate. Following the arbitration process, grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff was improved to enable schools to implement the arbitration process outcome. My officials have advised me that the Workplace Relations Commission has not been in communication with them on this matter. If the representative organisations of the secretaries contact the Workplace Relations Commission, my officials will be a position to deal appropriately with it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not have a specific date. Communication has now been initiated between the representative organisation and the Workplace Relations Commission and my officials are happy to work with them. I will be happy if it happens sooner rather than later. I am also conscious of the fact that there have been so many anomalies in the schemes over the years, including the 1978 and 1979 schemes. The scheme was not supposed to continue for as long as it did. When retirements occurred or people left their jobs, they were replaced for a period, but that stopped in 2008. We have had different provisions for school secretaries and there are anomalies. It is something of which I am very conscious and I am of the same opinion as the Deputy on the need for the conversation to start sooner rather than later because the arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Deputy's insistence that the talks start straightaway, but it also requires people to talk. I met the union representative group in County Donegal two weekends ago. They were very generous in letting me know that they were going to start a campaign the following week. It only started within the past ten days and the group knows what it wants to do. I support people in sitting around a table and talking to each other, but, obviously, contact between the representative groups must be made. Tá an doras ar oscailt.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Since arriving in the Department, I have spoken publicly about how vital it is that young people learn from the past in order that they can plan for the future. At a national, European and international level, it has never been more important for people to understand the lessons of history. As we face the very difficult challenges of Brexit, while also addressing the many aspects of the War of Independence and the Civil War, the decade of commemorations will question the importance of understanding the historical context.I have met officials of the NCCA and asked that a review of the optional nature of history under the new framework for the junior cycle be carried out. I expect to receive a report from the NCCA by the end of the first quarter of this year.  Prior to the introduction of the framework for the junior cycle, history and geography were core subjects only in voluntary secondary schools, which make up 52% of schools. However, it is important to note that currently 90% of students across all school types choose to study history and that 92% choose to study geography at junior certificate level.  The new junior certificate programme has greatly enlivened subjects, with a new emphasis on projects and self-directed learning. As part of the roll-out of the new framework for the junior cycle, history and geography were introduced to schools in September 2018. The minimum time allocated for the teaching of history and geography is 200 hours over the three years of the junior cycle programme, which is the equivalent of three 40-minute periods per week. I understand that for many schools this will lead to increased time provision for the teaching of history and geography.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the first part of her question the Deputy asked what would happen next. At the end of the first quarter of this year the NCCA will report. I am conscious that it has a decision to make and I do not want to predetermine the outcome. I have met the NCCA, my officials and many individuals and groups on the teaching of history. One of the motivations in having Irish, English and maths as core subjects in the junior certificate programme is that they benefit literacy and numeracy, but no subject is of more benefit to one's literacy than history. It is of benefit to one's research skills and in analytical and critical analysis. The Deputy is correct in pointing out that if fewer students take history at junior certificate level, the potential and propensity to take it at honours level in the leaving certificate examinations will decline. There is a little time to work through the issue. I have also asked for the curriculum to be looked at. Perhaps it could even include stair na teanga, the history of the Irish language, which takes us back 3,500 years and can open a lot of doors in respect of our placenames and who we are as a people. I hope that now in the decade of commemorations, the time has come for history to take its rightful place.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the Deputy's reference to the Irish language, there is a lovely seanfhocal, with which the Ceann Comhairle will be familiar - ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine, which means that we live in one another's shadow. We are living in the shadow of the people who went before us. Tá dualgas don chéad ghlúin eile orainn. We have a responsibility to the next generation. Whether in respect of cultúr, teanga ná oidhreacht, we have that responsibility. In the evolving and fast-changing society in which we live, taking a step back and reflecting can be more important than ever. Táim dóchasach go mbeidh an comhrá faoin ábhar seo dearfach.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. As she will be aware, a building project to deliver permanent accommodation for Edmund Rice College Carpenterstown-Castleknock is included in my Department’s six-year construction programme and will be delivered under my Department's 2020 design and build programme. It is intended to provide the new school building on a site of approximately six acres at the former Phoenix Park racecourse at Castleknock. Work on completing the transfer of the site into my ownership is under way. A project brief in respect of the school is being finalised and a tender competition is already in progress to appoint the project management team for the 2020 and 2021 design and build programme, of which the project forms part. The tender competition is expected to be completed by March. When appointed, the project manager will lodge an application for planning permission and progress the project through the relevant stages of architectural planning, tender and construction.  My Department is working to deliver the school's permanent accommodation at the earliest possible date. In the interim, since September 2018, the school has been based at the former Institute of Horology property, Mill Road, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, on a temporary basis.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In her previous contribution, Deputy Burton asked about St. Brigid's GAA club, to which I meant to refer. With regard to playing pitches, in line with all new schools, there will be a high standard of sports facilities on site. Furthermore, it is intended that a public playing pitch will form part of the wider development in the area. The proposed school site is adjacent to St. Brigid's GAA club but any access by a school to off-site facilities is typically by local arrangement. I am sure that the relationship between the school and the GAA club is a conversation that will go on between them. The new school, however, will have plenty of sports pitches. On the question on trying to deal with the population explosion, we are managing that. This is why we used GIS to identify 42 new schools for areas where there will be pressures. In addition, up to 40% of additional accommodation will be provided by existing schools. There is a great emphasis on forward planning within the Department to ensure this happens. The Deputy also asked what we can do to ensure that we do not make the mistakes of the past such as not having proper insight into what was happening on a building site. We now have a clerk of works on every one of these sites and that will continue. It is important that this happens but ultimately it is a question that faces everybody who builds in the private and public sectors as ultimately, the designers and contractors have full responsibility in ensuring the buildings they build are safe and fit for purpose.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To be clear, it is not the Department, it is the school that is co-operating.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The only thing I will say with regard to St. Brigid's is that the new site is adjacent to it and like every local parish or community, there are competent people in these organisations who will talk to one another. If there are any issues that need to be resolved, no doubt they will overcome them. Design-build-operate contracts build good schools if they are built in the right way. It happens throughout the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government also with different types of rapid-build programmes. They work if they are built and done in the proper fashion. Since the introduction of the new building control legislation, we have had a clerk of works on every site. We will ensure that from the day the first sod is turned on this school, there will be a clerk of works on that site.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are in the same space as the previous question on this matter. I will pick out a couple of important elements of the answer but will not go over the whole thing again because I already have put it on record. Schemes were initiated in 1978 and 1979 for the employment of clerical officers, and caretakers were included in that bundle. These schemes were withdrawn completely in 2008. On foot of a chairman’s note to the Lansdowne Road agreement, my Department engaged with the unions representing school secretaries and caretakers, including through an independent arbitration process in 2015. The arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for staff and that a minimum hourly pay rate of €13 be phased in over that period. This arbitration agreement covers the period up to 31 December 2019. We are now at January 2019. My officials have advised me that the Workplace Relations Commission has not been in communication with the representative organisations yet. Obviously, with both Deputies raising the matter in the Chamber today I am sure that will happen sooner rather than later.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Without going over what I said earlier, the figure of €8.65 per hour up to 2015 speaks for itself. To get to the rate of €13 per hour in January of this year cost an extra €22.5 million.Deputy Burton mentioned that there is a break in their contracts in the summertime and that many of them may possibly end up working longer than that during the summer. We all know how committed these people are. The discussion is now being held in the correct place. It has been debated on many occasions in this House over many decades, but we now have industrial relations mechanisms in place and the Workplace Relations Commission's recommendations. Once we receive the invitation to be a part of those discussions, we will be happy to do that. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the Deputy for his creative approach to this question. In April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, that is, from 2019 to 2022. The announcement followed nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future needs for primary and post-primary schools across the country. Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one or a combination of the following options, namely, utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools and the provision of a new school or schools. In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future. Approximately 40% of extra school places are delivered by extending existing schools. While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for the Dunshaughlin school planning area, the requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and will have regard for the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department undertook a review of the position in respect of primary provision for the Ashbourne school planning area in the latter half of 2018. The Department considers that there is a need for increased capacity in the area in the short term and over the medium to long term, taking account of residential development in the area. The Department’s approach to achieving this in the first instance is through the expansion of existing provision, and engagement is ongoing in this regard. The Department expects this engagement to conclude over the coming weeks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I completely disagree with the last part of the Deputy's contribution. There is no evidence whatsoever of discrimination, whether we are dealing with new migrants or Irish people. The measures being used make use of mathematical data and GIS data from Ordnance Survey Ireland, as well as statistics from the Central Statistics Office. We use the raw data and analyse the numbers. There also is an important element of forward planning, and the people holding that information are the local authorities. Meath County Council will know the projected data in terms of planning and residential development. If the Deputy is suggesting that there will be extra demand because of extra residential building, that will be factored into the review, which will be completed in a couple of weeks. I do not know what the outcome of that review will be; I have not been a part of that. Departmental officials have been doing the enumeration in that regard. The Department looks at the broader spectrum of population and I can categorically state there is no two-tiered system for looking after young people in this country.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy for an official from the Department to make contact with Meath County Council in order to look at the specific areas Deputy Thomas Byrne has highlighted. I assume that conversation is ongoing anyway because the Department is trying to collect the data and projecting building requirements into the future. One of the most interesting, significant and positive things about this country is the way in which we embrace new communities. We have done it really well. For example, at St. Luke's national school in Tyrrelstown there are many migrant communities which work together in an inclusive way. In my own constituency, I attended a school last Friday in Letterkenny where 32 different nationalities are represented. We have embraced new communities. People are living side by side and communities are working together, and much of the credit for that is due to the school system. The Department of Education and Skills, long before I became Minister, had been working on that to ensure that we provide a totally inclusive education for all young people. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does Deputy O'Loughlin wish to comment also?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the frustration on this matter and I will try to reassure the parents and the community. The major building project for this school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 2b – detailed design, which includes the applications for planning permission, fire certification and disability access certification and the preparation of tender documents. All statutory approvals have been obtained. The outcome of the pre-qualification process for the main contract has been notified to contractors who expressed interest in tendering for this project. Feedback and issues arising from this have resulted in a legal challenge to the pre-qualification process for the main contact from one unsuccessful contractor. This matter is being handled on my Department's behalf by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor. The Deputy will appreciate that as there is an ongoing legal challenge to the project, it is not possible for my Department to comment further at present. When the pre-qualification process for the main contract and reserved specialists contracts can be successfully concluded, the project will then be progressed to tender stage. Regarding the site, legal representatives for both parties are working together with a view to concluding the conveyancing. There has been significant progress recently on foot of close and intense engagement from all parties. All parties continue the work to ensure the acquisition completes at the earliest possible date, and at this point it is still not anticipated that the completion of conveyancing will impact on the timelines for delivery of the building project.  The Department met representatives of the school last month to update them on the ongoing legal challenge and the status of progress on the project and will continue to engage with the school. I wish to emphasise that my Department is fully committed to getting the project delivered as quickly as possible. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank both Deputies for their interventions. Conveyancing is ongoing but I will outline the chronology of events which has contributed to frustration on this. The Office of the Chief State Solicitor is handling the matter on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. The first listing of the motion for return before the High Court was on Monday, 5 November 2018. The matter was adjourned on that date at the request of counsel for the Department until 26 November and by consent with the registrar to allow sufficient time to assess all options. On that date, the matter was adjourned for a further two weeks until 10 December, as the Deputies are aware. On 10 December, the matter was adjourned until Monday 14 January 2019. On that date, the matter was adjourned for a further two weeks until 28 January. It is anticipated that further adjournments will not be required, and I hope that is the case. The Department continues to liaise with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor on all options. Most importantly, my officials will remain in touch with the school. I thank both Deputies for raising this issue, which I am sure is also of interest to the Ceann Comhairle.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We hope to get things over the line and move on so that we can complete the pre-qualification stage. Then we can move into the tender stage, which takes seven to eight months. I and the Department officials will ensure that it remains a top priority.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas don Teachta fá choinne na ceiste. Tá feidhmiú na scéime aitheantais scoileanna Gaeltachta i mbunscoileanna agus in iar-bhunscoileanna Gaeltachta mar phríomh thiomantas sa pholasaí um oideachas Gaeltachta 2017-2022. Seoladh an scéim i mí Aibreáin 2017 leis an iarAire Bruton agus liom féin chun deis a chur ar fáil do scoileanna i limistéir phleanála teanga na Gaeltachta aitheantas a ghnóthú mar scoileanna Gaeltachta bunaithe ar shainchritéir teanga-bhunaithe a chur i bhfeidhm agus ar an gcoinníoll go mbíonn siad páirteach sna próisis teanga-bhunaithe a bhfuil foráil déanta dóibh in Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012. Tá 133 bunscoil agus 28 iar-bhunscoil lonnaithe sna limistéir phleanála teanga Ghaeltachta. Tá 106 bunscoil agus 27 iar-bhunscoil ag iarraidh aitheantas mar scoileanna Gaeltachta a bhaint amach trína bheith rannpháirteach sa scéim. I mí na Nollag foilsíodh tuarascáil a thugann achoimre ar thuairimí na scoileanna maidir le feidhmiú na scéime, de réir mar a tuairiscíodh do na cigirí le linn na gcuairteanna comhairleacha chuig na scoileanna. Léiríodh go bhfuil na scoileanna ag glacadh go dearfach leis an scéim. Níl iarratas curtha isteach ag 27 bunscoil agus ag iar-bhunscoil amháin chuig an Roinn chun páirt a ghlacadh sa scéim aitheantais scoileanna Gaeltachta. Tugadh deis bhreise in Imlitreacha 0021/2018 agus 0022/2018 do na scoileanna nár léirigh spéis sa scéim foirm um léiriú spéise a chur isteach chuig an aonad um oideachas Gaeltachta sa Roinn roimh an 1 Meitheamh 2018.Níor léirigh aon scoil sa bhreis spéis sa scéim roimh an 1 Meitheamh 2018. Le déanaí, eisíodh litreacha chuig príomhoidí agus boird bhainistíochta na scoileanna nach bhfuil sa scéim go fóill ag leagan amach na buntáistí a bhaineann le bheith rannpháirteach sa scéim. Tá cuairteanna comhairleacha cigireachta eagraithe do na scoileanna seo ag an aonad um oideachas Gaeltachta, agus tabharfar deis eile do na scoileanna seo spéis a léiriú sa scéim go gairid. Mar iarAire Stáit sa Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, tá an Ghaeilge agus teagasc na Gaeilge inár scoileanna ar fad mar thosaíocht i mo ról mar Aire Oideachais agus Scileanna.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Maidir leis an gcúlra, tháinig an scéim seo isteach sa bhliain 2017 agus bhí €1 milliún ar fáil fá choinne na scéime. Bhí suas le €2.3 milliún ar fáil anuraidh agus beidh suas le €5 milliún i gceist i mbliana. Aontaím leis an Teachta maidir le tábhacht na scéime seo. Bhí mé i gcúpla bunscoil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta roimh an Nollaig. Tá siad ag bogadh ar aghaidh agus ag treabhadh ar aghaidh. Níl aon mhíbhuntáiste le feiceáil leis an scéim seo. Tá 27 bunscoil taobh amuigh den scéim. Tuigim na deacrachtaí. Má tá breis comhairle nó sonraí suntasacha de dhíth, tá mé anseo. Tá mé ag iarraidh mo chuid tuairimí agus mo chuid pointí maidir leis na rudaí dearfacha atá le baint amach ón scéim seo a chur in iúl ar na meáin phobail. Ní bheidh mé ag déanamh stiúrthóireachta ar son na scoileanna. Má tá smaointe ag an Teachta faoin bhealach is fearr leis an scéim seo a bhaint amach i gcomhthéacs an iar-bhunscoil amháin agus na 27 bunscoil atá taobh amuigh den scéim, ba mhaith liom iad a chloisteáil. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach agus thar a bheith dearfach go bhfuil daoine óga ag labhairt trí Ghaeilge agus ag déanamh comhrá trí Ghaeilge. Tá dearcadh dearfach agam maidir leis an scéim seo. Tá mise agus mo chuid oifigeach tiomanta nach mbeidh aon rudaí diúltacha i gceist maidir leis. B'fhéidir go bhfuil tuairimí ag an Teachta maidir leis na scoileanna a bheidh i gceist ina contae féin.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Bhí mo Roinn i dteagmháil leis na scoileanna chun sonraí breise a fháil uathu, más féidir. Tá an doras oscailte. Tá an scéim oscailte do na 27 bunscoil agus an iar-bhunscoil amháin. Má tá aon fhadhb, deacracht nó rud crua ag tarlú taobh istigh de na scoileanna seo - má tá imní ar an scoil nó ar phobal na scoile - tá mé ar fáil. Tá an cuireadh ginearálta tugtha agam. Níor oibrigh an bata mór san am atá thart agus ní bheidh mé ag úsáid an bata mór ag an am seo. Má tá fadhbanna ann, tá mé sásta plean a chur le chéile le mo chuid oifigeach chun na sonraí a bhaint amach.
