JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  It is important that we have an ongoing debate on this.  There is no mention of gate 4 and I would like some insight on when the delegation envisages it opening up.  Ms Diviney mentioned the debate on the Wales to Ireland interconnector.  Is connecting Donegal to Coolkeeragh in Derry being explored?  A 6 km or 7 km 110 kV line would link us to the Northern Ireland grid and ultimately to the UK grid.  What is the view of the delegation on this in light of the fact that the ESB owns 75% of Coolkeeragh station in Derry?Is the prudent roadmap of 6,250 MW until 2020 an underestimation and too prudent?  Are we discussing self-sufficiency or are we considering the big plan of being in a position to export energy by 2020?  Two weeks ago I was informed that the UK exported 1,000 MW of energy to France when its nuclear energy plants were not in a position to cool down because of inland rivers and waterways overheating.  There is a possibility that France will need 8,000 MW this summer.  In light of this is the estimation that we will only produce 6,250 MW by 2012 too prudent?  Are we considering that in the long game we may not have a Wales to Ireland interconnector?  Are we considering the fact that we will not be in a position to export?  I do not understand this but as the witnesses are from the sector perhaps they can inform me.One morning a couple of weeks ago the UK exported 1,000 MW of energy to France, where 8,000 MW will be needed this summer.  Paris could be lit up by 8,000 MW and we are aiming for 6,250 MW in 2020.  Perhaps I am missing something and I ask the delegation to enlighten me.  I do not believe that the prudent roadmap is the way to go.  We should be completely bolshie in this sector; we should be ridiculously ambitious.  We know the fossil fuel argument.  We know we will be in a position to export green energy, for which there is a phenomenal demand from the private sector.  There is a phenomenal demand in my constituency for people to build wind turbines but they are concerned that they will not be connected to gate 4.  They are also concerned about their own investment; they have their own cash to invest but they are concerned about the long term.  Perhaps the witnesses will enlighten me on the long-term strategy.There seems to be a ridiculous amount of bureaucracy involved in establishing a micro wind energy generator system in this country.  I know the witnesses do not want to discuss the politics and bureaucratic tiers and process of it but from my investigation of countries such as Germany the same red tape does not exist there.  We have an opportunity for great advancement through initiatives by the public to advance the green energy sector but it is being dragged down.  I would like to be enlightened and I know I will be.  I am not stating that the Irish Wind Energy Association as an organisation is being prudent in the job it has to do, but that the psychology of the country should be to be bolshie and over-ambitious rather than being overtly prudent.
