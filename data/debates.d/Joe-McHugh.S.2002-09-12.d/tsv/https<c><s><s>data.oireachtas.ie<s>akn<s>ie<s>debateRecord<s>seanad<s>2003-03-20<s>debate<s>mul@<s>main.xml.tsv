JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I support calls to have statements on Iraq today. To do so would be an important and timely intervention on the part of the House.Will the Leader ask the TÃ¡naiste to come before the House to discuss the recommendations of the task force on life-long learning? A report launched yesterday highlights the fact that by 2006 there will be a massive increase in the older section of the population. I have always believed that people should not be put on the scrap-heap when they reach 60 years of age. They have much to offer and have great expertise. In the rest of Europe, many elderly people are involved in consultancy work. We should start a serious initiative to underline that we need all the expertise we can get, regardless of the age of the people who provide it.There was a man from Donegal who retired at the age of 60. He went to the shop each day with his dog to buy the newspaper. One day, however, the dog started to take the paper home. The man died the following day. At the gates of Heaven, he asked St. Peter why he had been taken.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	St. Peter replied that the man was no longer needed because even the dog could bring the paper home for him. This is an important point.
