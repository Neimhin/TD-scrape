JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Carr to the committee.  It is good to see a fellow Donegal man here.  He made a brief reference to the Gweebarra issue, although he is here not in a Donegal context but with a national remit representing his organisation.  On the Gweebarra protest, as a political representative in Donegal, I stated on record that we need a bottom-up approach so that the club has more ownership.  As Deputy McManus mentioned here, any new negotiations of the fishery boards must take that into account.  I referred to that last week when the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was here.FISSTA News refers to the organisation's message, a 13-point document that has been handed to the anglers with respect to Gweebarra bridge.  Without going through it, I picked out a few items in it.  The following language is used: without any consultation, without any formal notice until it appeared in the Donegal Democrat, evicting lifelong fishermen, damaging the rights of all anglers in Ireland, the disenfranchising of over 2,000 anglers, no rod quotas without consultation, and promises have been broken.We are all with Mr. Carr on that.  Naturally, politicians will support the clubs to ensure that they have a degree of ownership, but what is needed in the overall debate is a degree of empathy because the same language used there could describe what the drift net fishermen went through in terms of life-long industry, a traditional way of life, and no consultation.  In order to move the debate forward we need to look at the different aspects.  We will never have harmony, which is an idealistic position, but we must have a degree of empathy from different sectors of the industry and we need to spare a thought for people who are no longer able to carry on a traditional way of life.Mr. Carr emphasised the industrial aspects.  That is obvious.  There is domestic and industrial pollution going into our rivers.  These are the challenges.There is a significant issue into which perhaps Mr. Carr's angling association can make a big input, namely, the new Green Paper on local government reform in which the Minister is looking for input on devolved local government.  At present, local authorities do not have the money to provide proper sewerage infrastructure, never mind monitoring of it, to prevent raw sewage from going into rivers and estuaries.  There is a role for Mr. Carr's angling association to play in that regard.There is little emphasis on seals.  What research is being done on how the seals are damaging the salmon population when they try to return to their spawning grounds?  This is a matter of concern to the association.I am seriously concerned about poaching.  The evidence is only anecdotal because if one saw them one would do something about it, but one hears that these guys are operating on a professional basis using sub-aqua techniques and the proper gear for poaching.I do not want to get into farm-fishing and the issue I raised during the meeting.  We can clarify it and if I am wrong, I will accept that.  I come from a farming background, a wee place called Carrigart.  As Mr. Carr will be aware, the land is not as good as that where he comes from in Carrick and Glencolumcille.  One thing I know about farming is that one does not set the crop of potatoes in the same field every year.  I realise that is a simplistic argument when it comes to salmon farming, but it makes sense to me.  Mr. Carr makes that argument, that a farm cannot be operated on the same ground all the time.  There is a role for his organisation to put the heat on the Department.Many of the sea cages have gone through planning.  For example, Marine Harvest Group is trying to get sea cage licences for 12 or 15 years and the operation will move further out to sea, as Deputy Coveney stated.  The sea cages will not be in situ in the same places within the estuaries and the bays.  I believe that is a way of combating sea lice and it is an issue we should take on board.Returning to my original point, if there is not a degree of empathy for the different sectors within our county where there are mussel farmers, scallop farmers, oyster farmers and even those who had salmon licences trying to diversify into shrimp, everybody is fighting a battle for the limited resources.  If there is one point I would make today, which is not just for the anglers of Mr. Carr's organisation but for all organisations, it is that there must be a degree of empathy, otherwise there will be constant division.  There is only one group into which we are paying, namely, the Department.  The Department likes division.  It is a divide and conquer theory.  I would like to have seen a situation where anglers were more sympathetic to the drift-net fishermen and in the situation anglers are in at present on the Gweebarra river there would have been a reciprocal feeling of empathy from drift-net fishermen towards the anglers.  There is room for empathy.  There is room for a little more co-operation because there is a great divide at present.I welcome Mr. Carr's participation and that of his organisation, and his presence here today.  I do not wish to ask any specific questions.  I merely wished to make that point.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not want to become involved in discussing that matter.  I am a public representative and would place jobs before visible pollution in any circumstances.  We are in agreement on most matters but——
