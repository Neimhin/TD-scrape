JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil chuig na Teachtaí uilig fá choinne an cheist iontach tábhachtach seo a ardú. Ba mhaith liom mo fhreagra a thabhairt dóibh anois. My Department engages on an ongoing basis with officials in the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of education issues arising from the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers and refugees. In addition, Tusla Education Support Service, TESS, which is under the remit of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, assists with school enrolment and attendance for children residing in accommodation centres. The International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, formerly RIA, of the Department of Justice and Equality has sourced temporary accommodation in Tracey's Hotel, Carrickmacross, since mid-September. Some families with children of schoolgoing age have been accommodated in this location while the Department of Justice and Equality seeks more permanent accommodation for them in a dedicated accommodation centre under the system known as direct provision. The priority for newly arrived applicants for international protection is to address their immediate needs, apply for accommodation, make an application for international protection, apply for a PPSN to ensure access to weekly payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, and ensure that they are linked with the HSE for medical care. In line with the provisions of the EU directive, every effort is made to enrol children of international protection applicants who are residing in accommodation under contract to the Department of Justice and Equality, including emergency accommodation, in local schools as soon as possible. Schools enrol pupils in accordance with their respective enrolment policies. Following the receipt of an application for a school place each school must advise of the outcome of each application in writing. In instances where difficulties arise in sourcing school places locally, the assistance and support of Tusla Education Support Service is sought, similar to the assistance given to all other families who reside in the community. TESS is responsible for assisting with school enrolment and attendance. Where necessary, school transport is arranged under the school transport scheme operated by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills. Every effort is made to ensure that all children of schoolgoing age receive an education at the earliest possible date. I understand TESS is working with the families concerned to ensure that arrangements are being made for school enrolments for the children in the accommodation centre in Carrickmacross. To update the Deputies, my Department has seconded an official to the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with any queries from schools that are enrolling children from accommodation centres. This official is also available to advise schools on specific queries on the range of supports available to schools and how to access supports. I want to further update the Deputies on this matter. Officials had contact from a post-primary principal earlier today who is happy to offer school places to the three post-primary age children. We are still waiting on feedback from the primary school principal but there is confidence that a sufficient number of places will be available in the local area for all the primary school children. I take the point raised by the Deputies that there is a collective responsibility for this matter. While an official has been seconded from my Department to deal with it, the Department of Justice and Equality, Tusla and all of us are collectively responsible for it. If there are better ways to move more quickly on it, we would be interested in working as efficiently as possible in that regard. There is a requirement in a European directive to provide education within three months of arrival. I am of the opinion, having attended various camps in Jordan in recent years, that it is important to get as early an intervention as possible in terms of providing education.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take this issue in the vein in which is has been raised, which is a genuine call for more streamlining of communication in the first instance. When this question was presented to me today I was happy to take it because it is to do with education and young people. I reiterate that there is a collective responsibility but we want to get the intervention at an early stage also. One of the Deputies asked if the reason for this was because it was temporary accommodation. The problem was created because it was temporary accommodation but if there are actions we can take at an earlier stage or new ways of doing it we will look at them. We provide home tuition in some instances. Perhaps there is something we can do in that space. I am prepared to work with my colleagues across the floor on this issue. Separate to it being raised here tonight and in the media on Monday, I asked my officials last week to arrange for me to go to one of the direct provision centres and meet with families and the young people. I am more than happy to do that and a date has been arranged to do so before Christmas. I am open to suggestions on this matter. I have a very close working relationship with my colleagues, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan. We will continue to keep this matter on the radar.At a major camp in Jordan that I went to, the families were all talking about the importance of education. They had to offer it primarily through their own families but they were emphasising its importance. Education is not lost on anybody in this country. We must ensure that we act where rights are not being respected.
