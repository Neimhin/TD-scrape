JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation and I thank the committee for allowing me to ask questions as a non-transferred member of the committee.  I have listened attentively to the specific roles and responsibilities of the authority and I appreciate the definitions provided.  It is important to have clear lines of definition when we are trying to explore solutions to a major problem and this case requires a solution to a major problem for many families.  There is a particular dilemma for the families.  I have before me a list of transaction dates, including 15 June, 30 May, 5 June, 4 May, 15 June, 21 June, 24 May, 15 May, 13 June, 2 May, 21 May, 1 May and 15 June 2012.  An average of €20,000 was handed over to the Pilot Training College in Watford during a period of up to four weeks prior to the authority being notified that there was a problem at the commercial end between the institute in Florida and PTC Waterford.  This is a hard dilemma facing these parents and students.  I have five specific questions but I will be quick because I am mindful that time is against us.  Will the delegation reiterate its specific role?  Does the IAA examine a company and determine whether it has sufficient resources to safely provide the training required?  Does the IAA do this internally or does it commission an independent body to evaluate whether a company has sufficient resources to carry out training in a safe way?  How often are these evaluations carried out, whether internally or externally?  When was the most recent evaluation carried out, if at all?  If so, was the IAA satisfied with that evaluation?  Is the evaluation available to members of the committee?I wish to support my colleague, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan. We need to explore further the issue of culpability. I appreciate what the witness says. The ultimate culpable body is the company that has left these families high and dry. Deputy O'Donovan's proposal is seconded by Deputy Ann Phelan. It needs to be taken seriously. I am not telling the witnesses their business but it is something to be considered. This matter should go to the Director of Corporate Enforcement. I am making this suggestion as a particular route for this committee to explore. Corporate, white collar crime is involved in this instance. All that money paid in the months of May and June was never sent to Florida. I supplied the list of dates and I know that not one penny went to Florida. Where did that money go? The families want to know how they can repay their loans. The families know they do not have the sympathy of the public because of the cost of the course, which was €80,000. When people hear the cost of the course they presume the families are made of money. I know from my contacts that they took out loans to cover the cost. The banks will be knocking on their doors asking them to repay the loans while the ultimate culpable body gets away scot free. I reiterate a proposal for consideration by the committee. The Director of Corporate Enforcement should be asked to attend this committee and there should be an investigation into this debacle.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the clerk to the committee for working to find a solution to the time constraints we face.  It is important members get an opportunity for a proper hearing on this issue today.  I welcome back the delegation.  This is the big boomerang issue of the past 20 years.  We had the PricewaterhouseCoopers report in 1998, the Deloitte & Touche report in 2001, the Fearon report in 2008 and now we are back dealing with the issue again.  I have four questions for Mr. Maurice Mullen.  Why was the Fisher report commissioned?  Who commissioned it?   Did the Minister request this new report and when was it commissioned?  We all have one common ground on this.  The people in the Visitors Gallery, the members of the delegation and ourselves all have a problem, although I do not underestimate the problem facing the delegation, be it the recruitment embargo, issues around training or the pollution control issue.  Furthermore, the Minister has a problem.  He has a report on his desk and if a pollution issue arises tomorrow morning off Dingle, Malin Head or in the Irish Sea, should he take responsibility or would he be in control of the situation?  Therefore, he has a problem and we all have a problem.  However, from consulting with everybody concerned, including the Minister and the delegates - I was delighted to see Mr. Chris Reynolds in Malin Head during the summer - I appreciate we all have solutions to this problem.  Mr. Reynolds's personnel, the people in the Visitors Gallery, the volunteers, the Coast Guard units, the Minister, the fishermen, the people living along the coast and even the politicians have solutions.  I am not talking about parochial backyard interests here.  Deputy Noel Harrington is not a Kerry man or a Donegal man.  I have a few questions for Mr. Chris Reynolds.  Has he examined the Canadian model which, effectively, is a state-run public-private pollution control model, which is very interesting and as far as I am led to believe does not require the recruitment of additional staff?  It is very much a public-led programme-strategy.  The Canadians have a plan that involves outsourcing to the private sector if an incident occurs.  Has he evaluated in detail the potential to have a cross-Border pollution control plan?  It great to have Mr. John Dallat, MLA, from Stormont here.Obviously, there must be some form of pollution control plan for Northern Ireland. Furthermore, has this issue been considered in a British-Irish context? In the event of a tanker going down in the Irish Sea, it does not merely affect people in counties Wexford, Dublin or Louth, it also affects people on the west coast of the United Kingdom. I am aware of the existence of a pollution control plan within the United Kingdom, although I suppose one must be careful of calling it the United Kingdom at present, given the differences of opinion in Scotland as to whether it will remain that way in the future. Is there a follow-up from the joint bilateral agreement between the Taoiseach and David Cameron in April 2012 regarding more bilateral co-operation on a United Kingdom-Ireland basis? In a practical example that hopefully will take place before the end of the year, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and his British counterpart, Ed Davey, will sign a joint declaration on a memorandum of understanding on a British-Irish basis in respect of energy. Has either the Department or the Coast Guard considered the potential for British-Irish co-operation? As for the boomerang issue that keeps coming back to haunt us all, namely, the stations at Malin and Valentia, has consideration been given or detailed exploration made of the potential to really engage with the Coast Guard units, the volunteers and the local authorities to draw up a consistent plan that takes in all the Departments? Everyone is familiar with the difficulties pertaining to regulation and associated with people in Ireland looking after their own patch and their own piece of turf, as well as with interdepartmental blockages. Has real consideration been given to the possibility of taking an overall holistic approach to all the issues? There are many issues, including those pertaining to safety at sea and lifejackets, as well as incidents to be considered by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney. Other issues concern the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. Given the existence of so many issues with cross-departmental dimensions, has consideration been given to examining a holistic approach under the umbrella of the Taoiseach and the plan produced by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth, not simply in respect of resources, but also in respect of safety at sea and maritime issues? Finally, in the context of the further analysis that I assume will take place, I will direct some questions to Mr. Maurice Mullen. Will it be carried out in-house or on an independent basis? Have terms of reference been drawn up and what is the timeframe?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have sat here patiently for one hour listening to questions.  The Acting Chairman should at least give us the opportunity to listen to the answers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To be helpful, I note the presence of a very patient delegation from Northern Ireland today.  Might I suggest the joint committee hears their perspective as soon as possible?
