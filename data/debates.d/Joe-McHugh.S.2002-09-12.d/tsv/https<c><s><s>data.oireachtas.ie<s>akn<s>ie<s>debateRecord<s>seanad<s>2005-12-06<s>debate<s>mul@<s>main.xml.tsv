JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I received a letter from AnGrianán Theatre in Letterkenny with an 11th hour plea for VAT exemptions for Northern Ireland artists and theatre companies. Some 20% of the theatre's programme involves artists from Northern Ireland and these VAT charges will curtail Northern Ireland artists from coming to Letterkenny and will lead to a price hike that will affect Donegal theatre patrons. As patrons come to Letterkenny from Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh, this would be a conciliatory cross-Border project and a good token in the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.On an RTE programme shown on Sunday the shop steward from Fruit of the Loom in Inishowen said there was no FÁS intervention for their employees. I am verifying this comment but Inishowen people should not be treated differently from other people in County Donegal who leave their jobs. I ask for clarification on that.
