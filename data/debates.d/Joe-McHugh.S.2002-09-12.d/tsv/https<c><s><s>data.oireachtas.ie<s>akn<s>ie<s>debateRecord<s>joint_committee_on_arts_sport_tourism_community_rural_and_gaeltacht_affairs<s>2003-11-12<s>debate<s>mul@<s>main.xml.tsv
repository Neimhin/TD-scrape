JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation and apologise for my late arrival. I agree with all of the non-controversial statements made by Deputy English. Politicians like telling stories about the situation in their own back yard. I will give a brief outline of the situation in my home parish on sports and the gender breakdown. Following on from Deputy English's comments, I have looked at a variety of male-dominated clubs, including clay pigeon shooting, boxing, cycling, badminton, rugby and GAA clubs. I acknowledge that GAA and soccer clubs run summer camps for male and female participants. However, in terms of organisational structure, the committees are male-dominated and there is a male ethos at local level. The volunteer input to which Deputy Wall referred - although there are pressures which are constantly eroding it - is coming from males who, in some cases, are involved with a view to their sons' chances of involvement.On the other hand, in my area, we also have a great mix of clubs, including athletics, swimming, golf, boating and horse riding activities, in which there is a good gender balance. Within their structures, there is a mix of male and female parents providing a voluntary input. Recognising that volunteerism is under pressure in anyevent, perhaps the key to dealing with male-dominated structures is for women to show leadership at an adult level. We should consider ways of facilitating that with a view to greater involvement by women in GAA, soccer, cycling, badminton and rugby clubs. With that in place, an awareness would be created at both adult and juvenilelevels, from which younger participants would be encouraged to become involved.Lack of awareness is a major issue. A debate such as this is a healthy approach to creating awareness and recognising certain shortcomings. There has been a dramatic change already. Our Chairman, Deputy Keaveney, referred to the Donegal ladies' all-Ireland team. As a teacher in a convent school in Letterkenny, I was involved in coaching Gaelic games. While a few pupils were really interested, it was very difficult to encourage most of them to take an interest. However, there has been a sea change and that is ongoing. It is basically a matter of creating awareness through events such as the victory of last summer and the attendant media coverage. We need to look at the voluntary leadership aspect at local level, in terms of encouraging more female leaders to become involved in sporting activities.
