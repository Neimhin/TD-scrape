JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about 1977?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share time with Senator Browne.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This has been a most interesting afternoon in terms of learning new elements of economics. I know it was not always an exact science and many commentators would still believe it is not an exact science. In his contribution Senator Mansergh mentioned the lead up to the last general election and referred specifically to the economic cycle as being suspended. I have never heard of an economic cycle being suspended. Perhaps he is spending too much time in the Assembly in Northern Ireland. The Assembly is suspended. Economic cycles are not suspended. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has proven that economics is an exact science because if one overspends foolishly and lavishly in the good times naturally as a follow on there will be bad times.In 1992 there was a conference in Rio de Janeiro at which there was a definition of "sustainable development". That definition said that if we meet the needs of the present generation we cannot compromise the needs of future generations. In the past five years we have heard from various conferences, the media, different commentators, journalists and professors that we need sustainable development. I accuse the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, of completely ignoring the principles of sustainable development. I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that in the past five years there was spending, overspending and overkill. It met the needs of that voting generation in the last general election but it does not meet the needs of the incoming Government and the people under the present Government. That is a disgrace of the last Government. I am disappointed with the three Independents who stood up here and congratulated the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. Of course, there have to be cutbacks but, as Senator McDowell said, they should have been made two years ago. There should have been a pull back in the economy. The Minister did not do that and should stand corrected on that. I accuse him of deliberating misleading the people in the lead up to the general election.The local government development fund will be reduced in 2003 to 96%. I can only empathise with over 1,000 local authority members who have to deal with the cutbacks in their local authorities and specifically Donegal County Council which has opened three new decentralised offices. How will it manage the funds if there are cutbacks in the allocations to local authorities? We have learned that the Downings harbour development project will not go ahead after promises prior to the general election. The Letterkenny leisure centre which was promised prior to the election is in limbo. The capital project, the N2 from Dublin to Donegal, was not even included in the National Development Programme 2000-2006. What hope have those who work in Dublin and live in Donegal in terms of quality of life when it takes six hours on a Friday evening to get from Dublin to Donegal whereas when I was in college here in 1993 it took me five hours?Let us talk about progress and where we have come from. Money has been spent but it has not been spent in a sustainable way and not in terms of value for money. That applies to affordable housing throughout Donegal and the country. That was not promoted enough by the last Government.We are in trouble when it comes to the Estimates because we have spent lavish amounts of money on feasibility studies, environmental impact studies and, as Senator McDowell mentioned, studies for road projects, tendering and so on. A sum of â‚¬1.6 million was spent on a feasibility study and on an environmental impact study for a bridge across Mulroy Bay in County Donegal that will never be built.Let us talk about value for money and the overspend in the last election. We are in a precarious position. There have to be cutbacks but I do not agree with all of them. As I said, the cutbacks should have been introduced two years prior to the last election. I accuse the Minister of completely ignoring the public when it came to this issue.
