JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Senator Vincent P. Martin. Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chuir roimh an Uasal Tony Murphy from the European Court of Auditors and his team today, Ms Niamh Mahon and Mr. Brian Murphy. Before we begin, witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that witnesses comply with any such direction. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House and-or the Convention Centre Dublin in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any members who attempt to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making his or her contribution to the meeting, he or she confirms he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I call on Mr. Tony Murphy to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Tony Murphy for his introduction. Deputies Neale Richmond and Ruairí Ó Murchú are first up for questions. I have an observation rather than a question. When replying to members' questions perhaps Mr. Murphy might delve a little deeper into CAP and fraud. He emphasised the two together, so perhaps he can give more detail on that when he is replying.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are taking two members at a time, so Mr. Murphy can bundle his answers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Please go ahead Mr. Murphy.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies, I thought the Deputy was finished.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I was too generous even allowing Deputy Ó Murchú in for a supplementary. I ask him to be brief.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	How flexible is "flexible"? I think I am a little too flexible this morning. I apologise to members. Deputy Ó Murchú's contribution went on for nearly longer than England's celebrations on getting into the quarter final last night. That is a story for another day.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before calling Deputy Haughey, I want to say that Deputy Howlin has asked pertinent questions which are probably on all our minds. We are looking for a fairly circumspect response from Mr. Tony Murphy but it is on all our minds and the minds of Irish people.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are no members indicating at the moment. Does anyone have a supplementary question?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy may ask a supplementary question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If the Deputy is agreeable, I will allow another speaker in and come back to him later. Murphy's Law is taking over here today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I would like to home in on a particular issue in reference to the concept of flexibility introduced by Deputy Ó Murchú. I know Deputy Calleary will want to come in on this issue as well as it relates to County Mayo. I acknowledge Mr. Murphy is not the person who designs policy. He is a bookkeeper and all of the rest of it. However, he and his team may be able to help us in terms of signposting. If he is not in a position to provide information on this issue, we would greatly appreciate a follow-up on it. It is to do with houses that are crumbling and falling down in my county and elsewhere. As I said, Deputy Calleary will talk about the situation in County Mayo. This does not come under the category of creativity, enterprise or innovation. A great deal of funding rightly goes to kick-starting businesses as well as the whole area of sustainability, such as changing to green energy and all of that. However, we have an enormous problem with houses falling down slowly.They are not falling down quickly. We are not dealing with an earthquake scenario, a national disaster that would make every broadsheet and red top say we are dealing with a national tragedy. We have a tragedy in that same vein but it is happening very slowly. We have a scenario of people living in houses that are unsafe and dealing with the mental health side of things. We are dealing with generational issues as well, where young kids have arrived at their teenage years and are still living in these houses. It is placing an enormous burden on so many people. All the members of the committee will be familiar with this issue. I am going to let Deputy Calleary in now, and if Mr. Murphy is not able to signpost this publicly today, it is an issue we would really like to follow up on through our secretariat and perhaps we can be given some sort of signpost on all that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Deputy Ó Murchú want to come in on this issue or his previous issue?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that. It brings it so close to home to have that connection through someone on your own team, so you know at first hand what the situation is. Does Deputy Ó Murchú want to come in on his supplementary of supplementaries?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay. I thank members. We have had a bit of Murphy morning, from Brian Murphy to Tony Murphy to Ruairí Murphy. It is the first time I have called the Deputy Ruairí "Murphy" but it might stick anyway.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Murphy very much. We really appreciate this. It is important from a constituency point of view, but also from a national legislator point of view, to know about the checks and balances within funding. In solidarity with Deputies Calleary and Ó Murchú, I re-emphasise we would appreciate any signposting or direction he can give us on the defective building materials issue because it is placing an enormous burden on so many people. I thank the members for allowing a little flexibility here this morning. It might seem like a constituency-related matter but I know members are in solidarity with every single person dealing with this terrible tragedy, whether they are in County Mayo, County Donegal, County Limerick, County Clare or any other part of the country. I thank everyone. We hope we will be looking to meet up again in 2022.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are grateful for that and appreciative of Mr. Murphy's contribution and presence here today. I thank him, his team, Brian Murphy and Niamh Mahon, and the committee members.
