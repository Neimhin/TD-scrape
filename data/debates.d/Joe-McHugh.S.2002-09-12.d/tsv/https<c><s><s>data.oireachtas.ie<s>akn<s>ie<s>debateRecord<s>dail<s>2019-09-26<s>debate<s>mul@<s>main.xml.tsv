JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and giving me an opportunity to update the House on the position with respect to St. Patrick's national school, Diswellstown. I am aware of the pyrite issue in this school and the health and safety issues to which it gives rise. I fully understand and appreciate the concerns of the entire school community and the need to address them as quickly and effectively as possible. The school was constructed by ABM under a design and build contract, under seal, with the Department of Education and Skills as the direct employer. The school was completed in 2006. In July 2007, Fingal County Council became aware that the presence of pyrite had been identified as the source of problems in certain residential dwellings. The then Department of Education and Science, as the owner of the site and building at St. Patrick's national school, Diswellstown Road, Carpenterstown, Dublin 15, had reason to suspect possible ground heave by active pyrites at the school. This was drawn to our attention as a result of emergency remedial works required to free fire doors and address the toppling of fitted furniture, etc. These works were undertaken by the original contractor. In March 2010, the Department engaged a firm of structural engineers, DBFL, which confirmed the presence of pyrites in the building. The Department has sought legal advice from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor in respect of addressing these issues. Initial plans to remediate in 2014 were suspended on foot of legal advice. As this matter continues to be the subject of legal proceedings, I am not in a position to comment further on the progression of the remediation programme. However, I can say that immediate areas of concern are being remediated on an ongoing basis under the Department's emergency works scheme. The purpose of the emergency works scheme is to address unforeseen emergencies or to provide funding to facilitate inclusion and access for special needs pupils. In that context, the Department has approved emergency funding to address issues caused by the pyrite since 2016. At the same time, the school is making progress with a project under the additional accommodation scheme that involves the construction of two mainstream classrooms. Following a submission from the school indicating the presence of pyrite in the car park, the school authority was given permission to proceed to planning stage to include a car park extension. The school authority was requested to submit further detailed reports from its consultants in respect of the pyrite issues in the car park. The Department has sought clarification on some of the details in these reports. When this information is received, it will be reviewed and officials from the Department will be in contact with the school to make progress with the project. The Deputy has also asked about the expanding desire for school places in the area. If demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision depends on the particular circumstances of each case. Depending on the circumstances, it may be provided by using existing unused capacity within a school or schools, by extending the capacity of a school or schools, by providing a new school or schools or by a combination of these approaches. The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review. It will have particular regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. The Department will continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded to meet the needs of the local population.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have studied this case since the Deputy first spoke about it and have spoken to a number of people in the Department about it. Not since 2006 has a school under the design and build programme been left in this totally unacceptable position. This is in addition to the current impasse around Western Building Systems, WBS, which is currently before the Commercial Court. We are also carrying out an international review of design and build. Technological University Dublin will carry out that work. There is a history of bad builds. This has been a horrible story for the entire community since 2006. I want to see progress and I know departmental officials are waiting for school authorities to come back to them with their observations on the next stage of planning for the car park. I want the work to be carried out with haste. I do not want a sticking plaster; I want a proper job done. My departmental officials are keen to see that happen, and that is only right given what the school community has had to endure. This issue arose when I first became Minister for Education and Skills over a year ago. Unacceptable building practices leave a very sour taste in my mouth, not least for the communities which have had to endure them. Standards do not have to be a bar that people have to reach; rather, they should be an underlying fundamental aspect of any building works. On any private building sites where I have worked it has been important to comply with regulations, laws and standards and architects and design teams have responsibility for that. We cannot accept anything less. A lot of mistakes have been made and there has been a lot of malpractice. I want progress on this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I will deal with the Deputy's final point first. I see no problem with the committee being part of the review process after the NCCA produces the guidelines. I acknowledge the role of the committee in terms of its observations and contributions. One thing I have learned from almost a year in this job is that there is a good diversity of opinion on the committee and it is very healthy and important that that is so. The committee faced challenging issues such as this head-on. I acknowledge the work of its Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin, and members and note their diligence and contributions on the matter. I also acknowledge the organisations and individuals who contributed to the work of the committee and, of course, the dedication and diligence of teachers in schools and the work undertaken in pursuit of making RSE fit for Ireland's young people. The implementation of the second national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence goes hand in glove with this conversation and the production of curriculum guidelines.Obviously, this work feeds into that. The clear message, which was referenced, is that we need intergovernmental and inter-agency collaboration on anything we do to prepare our young people for the new challenges that lie ahead. We must also be honest. Not all sexual education will happen in the classroom; the majority of it will happen at home. Young people are exposed to new ways of accessing information, for example with respect to violent behaviour, and new means of communication to get it. We must be vigilant around that.  The NCCA is currently carrying out a review of RSE on foot of a request from my predecessor, Deputy Bruton. I have asked the NCCA to consider the committee’s report as part of that review. It is important, and the emphasis on collaboration and partnership is critical if we want to get this right. The review will cover both primary and post-primary levels and include an examination of the experience and reality of RSE delivery in schools and how the RSE curriculum is planned and taught. At the heart of it is age appropriateness, which the committee referenced in its report, and taking account of the experiences that have been learned over the past 20 years. We are looking at an outdated and outmoded curriculum. The curriculum that was taught 20 years ago does not necessarily apply today. Teachers have evolved in their approach because of the complexities and realities they face in the classroom and, therefore, teaching has changed. We must listen closely to those excellent teachers who are grappling with this subject in their own way. The NCCA review comprises a number of dimensions, namely, a desktop review of recently published research studies, consultation with individuals and organisations working in this area and an online survey to gauge the views of students, parents, teachers, etc. We will have a live public consultation on this up to 25 October to encourage individuals, groups and parents, many of whom have genuine fears about this to which we must be attentive, who have not contributed to do so. I encourage all individuals who have fears or concerns in this regard to use that mechanism of consultation. With respect to hearing the voices of students and parents, we are working hard, through the student and parent charter, to give a legislative voice to young people and parents. Unfortunately, that legislative mechanism will not be in place in time for this report in respect of which we hope to publish the guidelines by the end of the year. It is important we continue to be vigilant about capturing the voices of the students and the parents and listening closely to the experiences of teachers.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá brón orm.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Níl sé ar fáil. Tháinig mé amach ó chruinniú Rialtais. I just came from a Government meeting. I apologise for this. I am digressing a good bit so what I am saying it not exactly what is in the script. I am adopting my usual delivery. The NCCA is also working directly with schools to examine the experience of RSE in the classroom. Let us call a spade a spade. Within every school, the student body studies a hierarchy of subjects on the basis of the prominence of one subject over the other. In terms of status, we need to ensure RSE is accepted as an important priority subject when we get this together. It is fundamental for people who are learning to grapple with the challenges of life but it is also fundamental to the personal development of young people as they go through the student cycle, be it in primary or secondary school. The NCCA review, which took place between June 2018 and March 2019, addresses the key issues raised in the joint committee's report. The report has contributed greatly to the evidence gathering process for the NCCA review, and that diverse opinion is important. The consultation process is open until 25 October. I reiterate that no decision will be made on this curriculum until that report is delivered. There is still time for people’s voices to be heard. Today, I encouraged my colleagues in the Departments of Health and Justice and Equality to pass on the formal findings and challenges they have in their Departments, whether it be in the area of health, nutrition, domestic violence or consent. Those Departments have a role to play and it is important their voices are formally communicated to the NCCA. It is appropriate that the time has been taken to carry out a major review of the way we educate our young people about relationships and sexuality. Issues such as contraception, sexuality and consent need to be taught in a way that not only acknowledges our changing society but also addresses issues that arise in society that indicate a lack of understanding of these issues. Understanding them is fundamental. Consent is not just about how we treat other people, it is also about how we respect ourselves and other individuals. My personal belief is that to respect others, one must start to respect oneself while understanding what is appropriate and not appropriate and what is right and wrong behaviour. That can be taught at an early stage.  It is vitally important that our education system prepares our young people for life in a society that values each individual’s sexual orientation, respects decisions regarding contraception and understands consent. We all recognise relationship and sexuality education in this country. It must be fit for purpose and meet the needs of our young people in a modern Ireland. With that caveat, we hold very close to our hearts the proud tradition of a legacy of education, which holds the fundamentals very close to us. They will continue to be front and centre of anything that appears new in a curriculum. That is to do with respect, dignity, compassion and the fundamentals of understanding. There is a great deal of uncertainty about what is currently taught in schools in RSE. Currently, schools are obliged to teach all elements of the curriculum. No element can be omitted on the grounds of school ethos or characteristic spirit. SPHE and RSE are integral parts of the new well-being programme in the junior cycle. Every student in our schools has a right to access information about sexual health, relationships and sexuality. We acknowledge the commitment of teachers and recognise their professional expertise in dealing with this difficult topic. We also must ensure that whatever road we go down, they have the required capacity, training and continuous professional development. I am encouraged constantly by the yearning and appetite among the teaching community to equip themselves with the specific skills needed to deal with so many complex issues. I attended an event this morning in Athlone Education Centre where I heard at first hand their hunger to work with their colleagues and enable them to be equipped to do the job they need to do. I acknowledge the extensive resource materials prepared by a number of organisations to support the implementation of the curriculum in areas concerning RSE.This includes the HSE, the Gay and Lesbian Education Network and the sexual health and crisis pregnancy programme. There are some excellent resources available to teachers to support them in delivering the RSE curriculum. TRUST, teaching relationships, understanding sexuality teaching for senior cycle, a resource developed by the HSE, may be used to supplement RSE at senior level. This resource focuses on consent through topics dealing with loving relationships, intimacy, assertive communication, understanding boundaries, communicating boundaries without consent and when sexual assault becomes a reality. The development of the LGBTI+ youth strategy was a key commitment from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the programme for Government. It also contributes towards the Government’s broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland. The Department of Education and Skills inputted to that process. We must also acknowledge the role parents play in the education of their children. RSE provided in schools, coupled with education provided at home by parents, is associated with the best outcomes for students.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I will be brief because I will not repeat what I have said and will certainly not repeat the contributions made. As usual, valuable input has been provided, bringing this debate to the right place, that is, to the centre not just of maturity but also of normality. We have a duty in this regard to ensure we put in place the proper curriculum that meets the needs of 21st-century Ireland. As for the questions about legislation, including legislating for ethos and so on, let us now focus on the consultation period, right up to 25 October. It is great to get the opportunity in Dáil Éireann, and to have got it in Seanad Éireann last night, to put the date out there again and I encourage people to use that consultation mechanism. We will produce the guidelines before the end of the year and then address issues surrounding ethos, legislation and whatever else needs to be done after that. No decision whatsoever has been made, but we have entered a period of mature debate. It was the same in the Seanad last night. Yes, there are different perspectives - that is the wonderful world in which we live - but we have to ensure that our young people are equipped with the proper information and, as many Members pointed out, that our teachers have the capacity to do this. We have the infrastructure and continuous professional development forums to do it through our education centres. We just have to keep moving on it. The most important point of support in reaching out to experience is that of the teachers, including those who have been involved in this and have been the practitioners over the past 20 years. Once again, ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas agus m'aitheantas a ghabháil leis an Chathaoirleach agus do bhaill an choiste, fá choinne a ndíograise i leith an ábhair seo. Tá dúil mhór agam sa toradh i ndiaidh an chomhairliúcháin agus na treorach maidir leis an NCCA.
