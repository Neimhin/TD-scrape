JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for meeting one of the representative campaign groups yesterday, Co-operating for Cancer Care NorthWest, and her ongoing communication with another group, Donegal Action Cancer Care.  I listened to the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Niall Blaney, who stated that this should not be a politicised issue.  We sing from the same hymn sheet with regard to equal access and best practice patient care.  The only effort at politicising this debate comes from the Fianna FÃ¡il Party, which has attempted to spin the fault for this problem onto the desk of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  No one person can achieve the radical overhaul of a system on his or her own.We must call everyone to account, particularly the Taoiseach.  A few weeks ago, on the Order of Business, he stated that he was listening to what the people are saying on the street.  Obviously he listened but did he hear?  The ongoing debate is vociferous and those involved in campaign groups seeking proper cancer care provision are those with cancer.  They have been through the mill and are talking sense; they not just being parochial by seeking a centre in their backyard.Naturally I am being parochial in referring to the north west but the Minister is open to the idea of a satellite radiotherapy centre accessible to the public, as desired by those on both sides of the Border.  She will meet with Minister for Health, Mr. Michael McGimpsey, next week.  There is no reference to this in the Hollywood report but I plead with the Minister to maintain her openness to this idea.  She should also demonstrate her commitment to Letterkenny General Hospital.  Three weeks ago she indicated that Letterkenny would be the site of an outreach cancer service provider.  Letterkenny must be a pivotal centre for the area as far as Sligo and Altnagelvin Hospital.People are debating this matter but they do not have access to transparent information.  I tabled a question to the Minister last week about communication with private developers in Letterkenny about a private hospital.  I was delighted to receive a response because that usually presents problems.  The Minister replied that she had met them but would delegate responsibility to the HSE to continue communication.  It is important that the Minister remains focussed because she has an important role to play.The debate on co-location and private versus public requires information.  I ask the Minister to keep us informed on what is happening in Letterkenny with regard to private hospital development.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I just have one brief question for the Minister.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the light of the commitment to establish Letterkenny as an outreach unit of the centre in Galway; the Minister's statement that she is examining, with Mr. Michael McGimpsey, the possibility of a radiotherapy unit being established in Derry and the fact that she met private developers recently regarding a proposal for a private hospital, what commitment can she give to the people of County Donegal that the services at Letterkenny General Hospital will not be downgraded?  These three units will be based within a 20 mile radius of Letterkenny.  Is the proposed accident and emergency unit for Letterkenny General Hospital still part of the Minister's plan?
