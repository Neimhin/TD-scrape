JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our guests are very welcome to today's committee meeting. This engagement marks Europe Day and the European Year of Youth and the topic of youth experiences and perspectives on Europe. The purpose of today's meeting is to mark Europe Day by amplifying young voices and hearing youth experiences and perspectives on Europe. Europe Day marks the anniversary of the historic Schuman declaration, a day to reflect on the strides taken to bring peace and prosperity to the continent of Europe. The war in Ukraine highlights that the ideals behind the setting up of what became the European Union are still very much necessary. This week also marks the 50th anniversary of the referendum in which Irish people voted to join the then European Economic Community on 10 May 1972. The year 2022 has also been designated as the European Year of Youth and the aim is to boost the efforts of the EU, the member states and the regional local authorities to honour, support and engage with youth in a post-pandemic perspective. In this context the committee is pleased to be joined by representatives of Comhairle na nÓg, which are child and youth councils in the 31 local authorities of the country, which give children and young people the opportunity to be involved in the development of local services and policies. We are joined by Mr. Leo Galvin, representing Donegal, by Ms Prachi Agrawal representing Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and by Mr. James O'Brien, representing Wexford. You are all very welcome as are your parents and guardians who are here with you today and who are in the Gallery. I will shortly ask each of you to contribute but before we begin I must read a note on privilege and house-keeping matters before you make your presentations. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction. For witnesses attending the meeting remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does. 

Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I invite all of the witnesses to make their opening presentations, starting with Mr. Galvin, and then we will have questions from members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le James as a ráiteas uile a bhí iontach gairid ach bhí na pointí iontach soiléir ann. I thank our guests for their short presentations. Members could learn from them as regards brevity. I thank them for their clear and concise presentations that raised important points. I will open the debate to members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is an interesting observation. Does Mr. O'Brien wish to add to that?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Just for context, before I call on Deputy Howlin, are all of the witnesses at the same stage? Are they transition year, fifth year or sixth year students? Where are they in their own education?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I have a quick question. Do the witnesses hope to study politics and society for their leaving certificate? Is that something they will be considering?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	You are going to do it?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The reason I ask the question is that the students in my home secondary school and alma mater are learning all about Erasmus through that subject. It is an invaluable resource in terms of information. However, I know that not every young person goes through the course. I call Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is that on Deputy Ó Murchú?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Mr. O'Brien want to take a second? We can go to Mr. Galvin and then come back to him.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for those good questions. Which of our guests wishes to respond? Ms Agrawal is smiling.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I think the next question was what are our guests' two biggest worries.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Do you know what is wonderful? Sometimes when politicians do not have an answer, they just keep talking.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is very admirable to be honest and say nothing.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses for their honesty.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Galvin for his interesting insight into a profession that is rather complex and hard to navigate at times. It is very interesting.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The door is always open. It is very interesting to get this feedback from the witnesses. Before getting into formal politics, perhaps they could champion issues. I will use this as a preamble to introduce Senator Martin, who is an example of somebody who was not a member of a political party in university but he championed and campaigned on various causes. It was politics without being part of a formal organisation. That is a big build-up for him.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank our guests. From the feedback from the members here today, this has been quite a significant intervention. Sometimes things can be a one-off and tokenistic but perhaps the committee should have a further discussion on keeping this going in terms of hearing the voice of young people. Today was very important. We are thankful and grateful to you, our guests, for having the courage, first of all, to come before us and then being so honest, frank, comprehensive, precise, concise and illuminating. We have all been out of the loop for the past few years. We just do not pick up where we left off. The world has changed. Everything has changed. Commissioner Johansson was here a few weeks ago and she said, "You are only ... [young] once, but you are 50 forever". It was a very interesting one. We have to listen to you, our guests, because you are the next generation. You lost out a good bit during the Covid lockdown and we must be very attentive to what you are saying. We are grateful to you for coming here today. I thank you so much for doing so. Arís, ar son an choiste, gabhaim buíochas libh fá choinne an taispeántais chuimsithigh. Tá níos mó rudaí ag bogadh ar aghaidh agus tá tionchar suntasach sa domhan, i gceantair áitiúla agus náisiúnta fosta, agus glór na hóige i gceist. Go raibh maith agaibh agus ádh mór oraibh amach anseo.
