JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I propose we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As a committee we are looking forward to this discussion on the Conference on the Future of Europe. I welcome Professor Federico Fabbrini and Dr. Catherine Day, as well as Professor Gavin Barrett, who will join us shortly. Today's meeting is the start of our engagement on this very important topic. Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on the extent to which evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Professor Fabbrini to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Fabbrini. I call Dr. Catherine Day. She was before this committee in April last year and she is welcome back.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. I call Professor Barrett to make his contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank both Deputies for their questions and observations and I invite Professor Fabbrini, followed by Dr. Day, to respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will perhaps resume the discussion on the book at the end.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Fabbrini and thank him for the compliment as well. He should not worry; we will all buy the book for Christmas. I call Dr. Day.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Barrett. We have 18 or 19 minutes left, so I will take a final round of contributions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does anyone else wish to contribute? I call Deputy Harkin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have approximately nine minutes to feed back. Perhaps, before I let the witnesses back in I will make an observation following on from what Dr. Day said about how we go forward in terms of the dialogue. Sometimes, we can get caught up in trying to speak on behalf of our fellow citizens in terms of their understanding of Europe. Irish citizens are aware of the mechanics of Europe and about Brussels and Strasbourg whether it is with regard to CAP, directives or great opportunities which have arisen through cross-border health directives. If I need my knee replaced, I can go to Turin. If I need some surgery, I can go to some hospital in Spain. There has been enormous progress in terms of interconnectivity. My only point is that sometimes we miss the quick ones. Citizens throughout Europe will really be interested in the conversation and how to facilitate the conversation. Dr. Day talked about the opportunities around online engagement. We are able to engage with all our European counterparts. In my former position as Minister for Education and Skills, we had conversations with all our ministerial colleagues with responsibility for education back in April and May. It was interactive and we did not have to travel, as it was online. There is no reason, for example, we cannot facilitate that conversation for many of our post-primary students who are studying politics in society at leaving certificate level. It is not necessarily connecting in with Brussels and Strasbourg but why can we not create a mechanism and opportunity for them to have a conversation with their peers in places like Greece, Spain, France and Germany? I believe Senator Keogan made a point about local authorities. The past engagement and the physical one-to-one contact were important. I know that, as a former MEP, Deputy Harkin will have had many people from counties Donegal and Sligo over in Brussels to see how things worked in the mechanics of Europe.Perhaps now is the time to look at online opportunities and facilitate and continue that conversation to help people connect. That is my only input. Other members had a few questions to be answered in the short time period so I will move first to Professor Fabbrini.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Fabbrini. Dr. Day and Professor Barrett have about two minutes each.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank all three contributors. Go raibh maith agaibh uilig fá choinne an eolais agus na sonraí inniu.
