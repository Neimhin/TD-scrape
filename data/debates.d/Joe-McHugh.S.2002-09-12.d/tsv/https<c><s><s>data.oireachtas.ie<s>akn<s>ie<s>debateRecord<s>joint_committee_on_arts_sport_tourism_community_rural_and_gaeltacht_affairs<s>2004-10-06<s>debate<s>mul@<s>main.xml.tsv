JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation and Mr. Treacy in particular. It is good to hear of the challenges facing us. I congratulate the former Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, on the review set up by him in 2000, something which took a great deal of courage and for which he received a great deal of criticism. He must be commended and remembered for that initiative which resulted in many improvements since the games took place in Sydney. We have data before us to support that. I also congratulate the Irish Sports Council on its involvement. I hope Deputy McDaid will be remembered for this positive initiative and not for the unceremonious shafting he received last week.The Irish Sports Council has a job to do and depends on a filtering system at grass roots level, be it at community games level, amateur boxing or athletics club level. That filtering system is, I believe, out of its hand given its reliance on so many components such as was mentioned earlier, voluntarism and the involvement of the Christian brothers, before athletes reach its table. We as legislators are responsible for grooming and nurturing talent before it goes on to the Irish Sports Council. That is done through the schools as mentioned earlier. I was glad to hear that development officers will work with schools on sports programmes.At Department of Health and Children level there is enormous responsibility on us as legislators to encourage people to monitor their dietary needs and lifestyle. What input does the Irish Sports Council have in terms of liaising and networking through the Department of Education and Science with the Department of Health and Children? Does it have a planned programme of networking? What is its vision in terms of how the nurturing process at grassroots level should be attained? We have the necessary components in place and there is a great deal of goodwill and voluntary input by parents, the vast majority of whom are a vital cog in the wheel. However, the habits and work ethics of a minority of parents in terms of voluntarism is detrimental to the progress of young people.I view the Irish Sports Council as an umbrella group for the different sports be they at community, athletic or boxing club level. It is the ambassador or kingpin for sports. How can we bring all these areas together and what role can the Irish Sports Council have in that regard? Deputy Deenihan referred to Mr. de Lima from Brazil. Perhaps, as a measure of goodwill, Deputy Deenihan could offer one of his all-Ireland medals to Mr. de Lima.
