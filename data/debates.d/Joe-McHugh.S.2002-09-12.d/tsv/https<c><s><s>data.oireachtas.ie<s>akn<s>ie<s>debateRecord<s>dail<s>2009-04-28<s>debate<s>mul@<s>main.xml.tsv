JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As of yesterday, Members of this House and the Taoiseach's parliamentary party were under the impression that BreastCheck would be rolled out in Donegal in 2009.  This morning, a spokesperson from the HSE announced that it would not be rolled out and that the timeframe would be indefinite.

This raises the question of who is actually in charge.  The health information Bill should be introduced sooner rather than later.
