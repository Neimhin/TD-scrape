JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire, an Teachta Coveney, agus a chomhghleacaithe. Táimid ag dúil go mór leis an díospóireacht faoi na rudaí práinneacha tábhachtacha atá ann faoi láthair, ní hamháin na rudaí atá ag bogadh ar aghaidh san Úcráin leis an Rúis. B'fhéidir go mbeimid ag labhairt faoi rudaí eile inniu fosta. On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister and his officials. They are all very welcome to our meeting. We will be engaging on the topic of the European Union's response to the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other matters. Before we begin, I must advise those present of the position on privilege and deal with housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members will be aware of the constitutional requirements and that their presence must be within the confines of the Leinster House complex. It is imperative that anyone partaking via MS Teams will confirm, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex. We will go straight into our discussion and try to keep it flowing. There are a lot of current issues. I am aware that the Taoiseach has just arrived in Kyiv. I acknowledge the Government's advocacy on behalf of the Ukrainian people. The Minister is aware of the committee's endeavours in trying to develop a deeper understanding and knowledge of what is happening.We have done that pragmatically, with delegations travelling to Georgia, Romania and Moldova in recent months. While we look forward to the Minister's contribution, I wish to acknowledge how his officials were on hand in advance of those visits to give us very good and comprehensive briefings. We also appreciate the help from the various embassies during our travels.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for his presentation. I call Deputy Richmond. He will be followed by Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Next up is Deputy Haughey, followed by Deputy Howlin. I do not normally do this because it is queue-skipping and I do not like to do that, but before I let Deputy Haughey in, I wish to make a point. I do not want the Minister to respond to the point, but to keep it in the back of his mind. Perhaps some of the other members might raise the issue. On the question that Deputy Calleary put to the Minister on the lack of foresight, I do not want to use the term "diplomatic failure", so I will not use it. The Minister stated that he does not want to get into a blame game, but he did say that lessons have been learned. I do not want to jump the queue, but perhaps towards the end of the meeting the Minister could elaborate more on the lessons learned.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. Before the Minister responds, with the agreement of the committee, Senator Chambers is speaking in the Seanad shortly and wishes to, in her own words, tag on a question to Deputy Haughey's question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our final contributor is Deputy Harkin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have a bit of time left.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I have noticed that. I have a question on the Irish Aid food programme. Will there be a recalibration of the programme in light of what is going on in Lebanon, Jordan and the Sahel? I ask the Minister to provide an update on that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Minister has been more than generous with his time. He agreed to be with us until 11.30 a.m., and we have overshot the runway a little. We are very grateful for this. Ar son an choiste, gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as an díospóireacht agus lena chomhghleacaithe as páirt a ghlacadh i gcruinniú an lae inniu. Guím gach rath air i Nua Eabhrac anocht. Beimid ar ais ag plé cúpla rud eile maidir le Brexit agus mar sin amach anseo san fhómhar. Ar son an choiste, gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire arís. Tá an cruinniú críochnaithe anois. Beidh an chéad chruinniú eile ar 10 a.m. Dé Céadaoin, an 13 Iúil.
