JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In 2002 the Government commissioned Deloitte & Touche to do a review of Coastguard stations and it made numerous recommendations.  The then Minister with responsibility in this area, Deputy Dermot Ahern, signed off on one recommendation that Valentia and Malin Head would be the two main Coastguard stations.  My colleague, Deputy Sheehan, is aware of that also.  In 2006 that decision was changed at a whim.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It comes under the Maritime Safety Bill.  Will this matter be debated under the Maritime Safety Bill?  We have wasted €145,000 on a report——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——that put forward a recommendation, was signed off by a senior Minister and on a whim was changed in 2006.  That was a waste of taxpayers' money.  It is giving two fingers to the public.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister to the House.  I have a series of questions on projects across the Border and in the north west.  Prior to the general election, a serious commitment was made by the Government to a motorway from Dublin to Derry and on to Letterkenny.  Commitments like these were all the rage prior to the general election.  The Taoiseach arrived in a helicopter a week before the election to announce that a motorway from Dublin to Derry would be built in the lifetime of the next Government.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Mary Coughlan, spoke about the possibility of a motorway or a dual carriageway right up to the north west.  I am somewhat disappointed that the only cross-Border project to which the Minister's statement refers is the M1 from Dublin to Belfast.  There is no mention of Derry, Letterkenny and a motorway from Dublin.  This week I put down a question to the Minister on proposals for the M2 from Emyvale to Dublin, but the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order and said it was a matter for the NRA.Rather than being critical for the sake of it, I would like to be as constructive as possible.  I would like to ask the Minister questions on co-operation and communication between him and his colleagues across the Border.  There is much talk about cross-Border co-operation and initiatives, but I cannot get access to any documentation or communiques between the Department of Transport and its counterpart across the Border.  Therefore, I am highly critical of the work that has not taken place and of the opportunity being lost currently.  There is collective goodwill on both sides of the Border, across the local authorities and at official level within Departments.  The Minister needs to up the heat by mapping out some kind of plan.  Currently, he is only giving verbal commitments, which are pie in the sky.  There is no tangible evidence to convince me or my electorate that we will see a dual carriageway or motorway from Dublin to Derry.There is a very proactive, forward looking road design office in County Donegal, which has a lot of plans ready.  One plan is for the Strabane to Manorcunningham roundabout, which is ready and awaiting funding.  These projects will be realised if the commitment is there.The railway debate has come up quite often in Donegal these days, especially in light of an increase in rail usage.  A spokesperson for Iarnród Éireann was talking on Radio 1 last Monday morning on the passenger increase from Dublin to Sligo.  A Cork Deputy also mentioned the increase in train transportation earlier today.  What plans are in place to roll-out a railway infrastructure in the north west?  There is no momentum behind a roll-out of railway infrastructure from Derry to Letterkenny.  In the week before the general election the Taoiseach promised a motorway between Dublin and Derry.  Why are we not forward thinking in planning a railway infrastructure plan along with such a motorway?  Such joined up thinking was not alluded to before the general election.While I was critical of the Local Government (Roads Function) Bill, I am confident it is a sign of a broader vision in not just looking at national primary routes.  We have an excellent regional infrastructure of primary and secondary roads that should be linked up.  Stand-alone projects are not needed and the Department needs to have joined up thinking.  Will the Department tap into the collective goodwill among officials in the NRA and local authorities?While we can debate the need for dual carriageways and motorways, this week I received correspondence from a tourism provider on the Inishowen peninsula on the lack of road signage there.  It is an issue affecting many areas to which the Department must give serious consideration.On today's Order of Business I tried to raise the commissioning of a report from Deloitte & Touche in 2002 on Coastguard stations.  Before the Minister for Transport leaves the Chamber, will he answer some questions on it?  The then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, endorsed the report's recommendation to maintain the Valentia and Malin Head stations as the two major centres for the Coastguard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It relates to the Minister's brief.  I appreciate him staying in the Chamber up until now because he is probably in a rush elsewhere to announce the opening of a new road in the Pale.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He is not going to Donegal anyway.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I accept that.In 2006 another review was undertaken to which I do not have access.  Have the original recommendations been changed?  The 2002 report cost the State €145,000 but its recommendations were changed in 2006.  Is the Minister in a position to make the review available to me if I put down a parliamentary question?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Changing the recommendations would fly in the face of the decentralisation programme.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are 18 jobs at Malin Head Coastguard station.  Does the new report recommend it should be downgraded to a staff complement of two or three?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	None of the 18 will lose his or her job?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Can I assure the 18 existing staff members that they will not lose their jobs?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about the recommendation to increase the staff number to 30?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will and I appreciate the Minister's indulgence.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	At least I can assure those at Malin Head Coastguard station that they will not lose their jobs.  Decentralisation is the key, not centralisation.A Member from Cork referred to the provision of ferries there.  Donegal has ferry services in Rathmullen, Buncrana, McGilligan and Greencastle but there is no State provision for funding for these effective and necessary transport modes.  It is important these are tied in with an overall transport strategy.
