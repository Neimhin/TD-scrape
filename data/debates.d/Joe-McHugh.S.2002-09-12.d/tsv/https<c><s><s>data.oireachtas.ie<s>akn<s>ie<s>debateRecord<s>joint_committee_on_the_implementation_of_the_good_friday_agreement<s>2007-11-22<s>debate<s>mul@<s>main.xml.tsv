JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I Googled "Carrigart" a few weeks ago and neither I nor Mr. Pat Doherty, MP, came up alongside Carrigart in the search.  Perhaps after today's historic development we might.  I pay a special tribute to the Chairman and the Vice Chairman on their election on this historic occasion.Cross-Border co-operation is something to strive towards, especially when one comes from a Border county.  Having spoken briefly to my colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, I agree with him that what we need is a harmonious working environment, a harmonious working group.  I will certainly do my part to ensure that we do not use this as a forum for political point scoring but as an opportunity to improve relationships across this country.  There are many issues, including health, infrastructure, and education, on which the committee can work to find mechanisms that will facilitate the eradication of barriers and make crossing the Border easier for people.My key point of reference today relates to the kernel of any democratic society, namely, policing, people's confidence in policing and the police's confidence in the communities they police.  In recent weeks there has been a very negative portrayal of policing in Northern Ireland with the shooting of a PSNI officer on 8 November in Derry, the shooting of a PSNI officer on 12 November in Dungannon and, subsequent to that, the murder of Paul Quinn from Armagh in Monaghan.  These are serious issues that need to be addressed.  This committee can do that.by by staying closely in touch with the PSNI and the Garda Síochána on how policing is moved forward to facilitate people to have confidence in their police force so they do not live in fear in their homes and communities.As a Border representative I have received numerous representations from my constituents in regard to fear in Border villages on the Donegal side of the Border where there is a lack of policing.  I see this committee as having a role in facilitating proper policing across the Border.  My colleagues in Fine Gael will strive towards that.  I am certain a proper debate on policing will also be facilitated by other parties and by people representing the various parties in the Six Counties.
