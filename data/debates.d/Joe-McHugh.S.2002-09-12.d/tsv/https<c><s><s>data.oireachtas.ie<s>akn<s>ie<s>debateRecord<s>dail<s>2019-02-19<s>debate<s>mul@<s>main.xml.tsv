JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	This is a difficult issue for substitute teachers who find themselves in this position. Officials in the Department have been working very closely with the Revenue Commissioners. A new online system is having initial difficulties and there are anomalies with personal public service, PPS, numbers but I am glad to be able to say today that this week 533 substitute teachers and 177 non-teaching staff will be paid. We still have to work through another cohort. I am happy to give the Deputy a daily update because I hope the remaining teachers will be sorted within the next few days. I also want to acknowledge these substitute teachers who have had to deal with this very difficult situation. They have been in touch with the Department because they needed reassurances to pay rent and mortgages and we were happy to provide them. Teachers are due holiday pay at Easter. We are trying to bring that forward in the next couple of weeks as an acknowledgement and as a support for them having come through financial hardship.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. It has been raised on the floor of this House a number of times. Her colleagues have raised it and I recently met students from Kildare who also raised it. There are ongoing legal issues involved in the matter. I will get the Deputy a full comprehensive update as to where we are in respect of pre-qualification tenders.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta fá choinne an tseans labhairt ar an ábhar seo. I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to speak on this issue publicly. I know his county colleague, Senator Maria Byrne, and his party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, have also raised this issue in these Chambers. By way of background, the Deputy will be aware that the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 provides a detailed and comprehensive legal framework to allow any worker who is penalised for making a protected disclosure to secure redress. The Act is supplemented by the procedures that all public bodies are required to put in place under section 21 of the Act for the making of protected disclosures and for dealing with such disclosures. My Department operates within this legal framework when dealing with protected disclosures. The Deputy will also appreciate that there is a legal responsibility on my Department to protect the identity of any individual who makes a protected disclosure.While respecting this legal responsibility, I am happy to provide the Deputy with an update on the specific issue raised today. In April 2015 the two staff members referred to by the Deputy made a protected disclosure to the then chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Minister alleging workplace bullying and errors in practice and wrongdoing that they identified as part of their work in the finance department. Since that time, various review processes, including three independent reports, have been undertaken by the Department of Education and Skills, the Higher Education Authority and the University of Limerick in an effort to address the issues raised by the two staff members. The most recent of the reports, the Thorn report, published in November 2017, outlined a number of recommendations related to the allegations made by the two staff members, referred to as persons B and C in the report, and those of a number of other individuals who had come forward as part of the process. The university accepted in full the recommendations made in the Thorn report and has been liaising with the HEA and the Department on its progress in the implementation of the recommendations. Arising from the Thorn report, the university embarked on a process of mediation, led by Mr. Kieran Mulvey, former head of the Workplace Relations Commission, with a number of the individuals referenced in the report in an effort to reach a satisfactory resolution of their issues. The two staff members referred to by the Deputy were included in this mediation process, during which the university engaged with them to facilitate their return to work. However, my understanding is that mutually acceptable employment positions could not be agreed to between the parties. The mediation process in respect of the two staff members was unable to reach a satisfactory outcome and has now ended. The issue was most recently discussed at a meeting last week between the president of the University of Limerick and the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills. At the meeting the president outlined the position on the steps that had been taken to facilitate the return to work of the two persons referred to by the Deputy. The president also outlined the university’s desire to ensure the issue would be resolved as quickly as possible and requested the assistance of the Department in that regard. It is the view of the HEA and the Department that the issues raised by both persons have been fully investigated at this point. The one issue that remains to be resolved is the return to work of the two individuals concerned. It is primarily an employee-employer issue and I hope the university and the two individuals can agree on a mutually satisfactory outcome that will see these staff members return to the workplace as soon as possible. While this is an issue for the university to resolve, the Deputy has raised it here publicly, while Deputy Michael McGrath raised it previously, as has Senator Maria Byrne in conversation. I want to let the Deputy know that I have discussed it with my officials since it was raised. My Department is willing to assist the university in exploring potential opportunities to facilitate a return to the workplace of the two individuals in question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To be helpful, essentially it is an employer-employee relationship issue. I am conscious of this, but I did say publicly that I would become involved to try to facilitate an outcome that would be satisfactory to all parties. The Secretary General has met the president of the university and I did emphasise the word "any". They are going to look at opportunities, but at the end of the day, we cannot force people to go into something in which they will not be happy. That would not yield an outcome that would be desirable. I acknowledge the Deputy's points about the service both individuals have provided. I am very conscious of this, but I am also conscious of my role not to become directly involved. I am confident that when the president and my officials sit down and the two individuals at the heart of the issue, there will be opportunities presented to them to find a solution. Without pre-empting the outcome, I take the Deputy's offer at face value to meet them. At this stage it might be a little early for me to do so because I am confident that the parties and the employee-employer relationship will be protected in finding a solution. I am confident that they will find a solution with which both individuals will be happy. I will certainly be happy to meet them after a solution is found.
