JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I commend the Labour Party on tabling the motion.  As a Deputy who represents a Border constituency, I am aware that many businesses in the region are experiencing severe economic difficulties, particularly in the context of the recent increase in VAT.  In light of the possible increases in excise duties on petrol and diesel, it appears that, for many people, the more things change the more they stay the same.  Business people in Border counties are of the view that they are suffering as a result of their geographical position.  This matter must be taken into consideration in the forthcoming budget.As the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, who is present, is aware, there is a need to deal with the psychological stress and fatigue caused by the recession.  The psychological effects of the recession are having a massive and traumatic impact on families whose children are attending secondary school or college.  These psychological effects are also impacting on people's health and are giving rise to an increase in crime.An interdepartmental report in respect of the north west was launched by the then Minister, Deputy Martin, a number of years ago.  This report contains a number of good suggestions and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise and Employment should examine it.  What is required is a synergy aimed at facilitating incisive educational courses for those to whom Deputy Varadkar referred, namely, those who are under 25 years of age, who possess university degrees and who want to avail of retraining opportunities.  We must consider the proposals in the report to which I refer in respect of entrepreneurship, resilience in personal development, innovation and creativity and capability training.At present, departmental service providers are working in isolation.  The HSE, FÁS, the VECs and various education providers offer great education delivery and other programmes.  However, we lack the fusion required to create the type of synergy to which I refer and to encourage participation on the part of the private sector.  In my constituency, Marine Harvest, which is a local indigenous company operating in the area of aquaculture, possesses the type of resilience, experience and expertise into which we are not tapping.  This company is willing to expand its operations.  The people who train and work with the company are not being retained in Ireland.  Instead, they export their skills to countries such as Chile.  Opportunities exist in the north west and there is a coastal community there in which people are pursuing their right to work, be it in the fishing industry or elsewhere, in order to put food on their tables.  We live on an island that has massive potential which is not being harnessed.  Ordinary men and women are seeking delivery in terms of breaking down bureaucracy and getting rid of red tape.  They have ideas for marine coastal development through marine tourism, marine alternative indigenous industry and aquaculture.  We can create jobs along the coast.  For every job at sea we can create seven jobs down the line.  Allow us, for starters, to create ten jobs at sea and we will deliver 70 jobs for the Government.  The Government is looking for ideas from this side of the House.  If it creates ten jobs at sea, we will deliver 70 more.  I leave the Minister with that suggestion.
