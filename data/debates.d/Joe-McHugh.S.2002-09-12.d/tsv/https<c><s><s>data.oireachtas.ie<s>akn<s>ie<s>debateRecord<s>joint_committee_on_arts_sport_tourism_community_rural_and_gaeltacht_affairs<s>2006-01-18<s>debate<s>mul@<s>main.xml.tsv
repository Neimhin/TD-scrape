JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation. I will begin by outlining from where I come in regard to this issue. My background is community youth work in County Donegal. Those of us involved in youth work in County Donegal in the 1996-97 period decided to form a network of Donegal youth workers. Breaking Through embarked on its course in 1999. Prior to that, there were no support mechanisms or networking opportunities in this area.I do not need to ask whether the network on which Breaking Through is working is justifiable or needed. There is no doubt that it is needed. Working hands-on in youth work can be a very lonely job in terms of being the only worker on a particular project or in terms of working under a voluntary management committee that may have its own story to tell with regard to support or the lack thereof. Breaking Through is, therefore, an effective group that needs urgent funding. Its membership of between 300 to 400 demonstrates that this country does not have a proper youth work programme or policy.The Chairman asked for a definition of young people at risk. Every young person is at risk at some stage in his or her life. With respect to youth work, we are letting young people down. We look to the GAA, local soccer clubs, musical societies and other outlets to pick up the pieces. Voluntary groups pick up the pieces for young people because the Government does not recognise professional youth work as an important component of society and provision is not being made in respect of it. I have no problem stating this publicly. The problem exists and will continue to do so. We may talk about anti-social behaviour and problems among young people — such as suicide, teenage problems and drug or alcohol addiction — until we are blue in the face but they are endemic and will continue because young people who have left school do not have access to proper community youth work programmes.Support is sporadic. This is highlighted by the fact that Breaking Through is supported by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. It is ridiculous that youth workers should be supported in this way. Youth work is important and funding for it should be mainstreamed rather than provided on a sporadic basis, where groups such as Breaking Through seek funding they hope will come through in November. It is ridiculous that the group must come before the committee and beg for funding.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will come to the question. A comprehensive awareness programme of the benefits of youth work must start at primary school level and continue through secondary school and university. We must follow the lead of our peers in Northern Ireland such as those at Jordanstown who have proper community youth work programmes to degree and masters level. We have no programme in our country and are letting young people down. For as long as we continue to let them down, we will have children on the streets every night.I was in Buncrana, a town close to that in which the Chairman resides, on Sunday night. At 8.30 p.m. I counted 42 young people of an average age of 14 or 15 years on the streets with their peers, with whom they want to be. If, in this day and age, we continually fail to afford young people opportunities through properly managed youth work programmes on an out-of-school basis, we will continue to have social problems and let young people down.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We certainly do and I can empathise with them. I hope I am echoing what they cannot say here today because they are looking for funding.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I empathise with those involved in community-based youth work who are trying hard. They know that intervention and preventive care are best. All they are looking for is a proper, managed programme and a proper system in which youth workers and community workers can be employed. That is what is needed.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	With respect, I do not see the other members of the committee staring at me with dagger eyes — they are not
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They will not be mad at me. To be honest, I do not have a question for the delegation but I congratulate its members on attending. I will persevere in making youth work a priority for this country. It is not a priority, rather it is sporadic and piecemeal. Different organisations are trying their best to work against the grain but they are not receiving adequate funding. This is an outright disgrace. My party and I will persevere with our commitment to youth work and young people.
