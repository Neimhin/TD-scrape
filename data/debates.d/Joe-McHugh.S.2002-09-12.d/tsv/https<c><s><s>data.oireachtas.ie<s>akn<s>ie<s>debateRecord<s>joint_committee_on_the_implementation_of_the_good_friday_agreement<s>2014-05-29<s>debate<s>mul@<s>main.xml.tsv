JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our session this morning deals with the role of the arts and culture in enhancing reconciliation.  On behalf of this committee, I am pleased to welcome the delegations from various cultural groups in Derry: Donncha Mac Niallais and Carol Nic Conmara from Cultúrlann Uí Chanáin, Eibhlín Ní Dhochartaigh from the Fleadh 2013 executive committee, Lisa Anderson from Droichead, Derek Moore from the Londonderry Bands Forum, James Kee and Darren Milligan from the Sollus Centre, and Jonathan Burgess from Blue Eagle Productions.  I welcome everybody.  I met some of our visitors on a recent trip to the north west, and it is good to see them again.  We look forward to an informative meeting at which we will find out what they have been up to since we last met them - on the bounce of the success of Derry-Londonderry City of Culture and Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann.  No doubt they are still on a high up there and we certainly sensed that during our visit.  The city is in a good place, although I know there is still an enormous challenge ahead of all us in regard to peace and reconciliation challenges on the ground.  I believe the roles of the various groups here as cultural ambassadors must be commended.  We are delighted they could all be here with us today.  We will allow each group make a presentation and then we will have feedback from committee members.  Perhaps we will take half of the groups first and then have feedback and then take the rest.  We will watch the time to see how that goes.  Before we move on to the presentations, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.   I now invite Ms Eibhlín Ní Dhochartaigh of the Fleadh 2013 executive committee to make her introductory remarks.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you.  Brevity is the order of the day and it is a good sign that we are moving on, but that could change.  Does Ms Anderson wish to make her presentation now?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is a mobile phone interfering with the sound system.  Perhaps if it was left on the floor, it might not cause interference.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you Ms Anderson. Who is next, Ms Ní Dhochartaigh?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is a lot to live up to.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Mr. Kee.  We are still in the hands of Ms Ní Dhochartaigh.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We appreciate the contributions.  Members wish to learn from our guests and, no doubt, make observations and ask questions.  I ask that specific questions be directed at the relevant witness as this will make our task easier.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take all the members' questions first, which will give the witnesses a chance to reflect on Deputy Feighan's questions and decide who, if anybody, will answer it.  It is a challenging question to be fair and, no doubt, people will have an opinion on it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Do you see what happened here, Ms Ní Dhochartaigh?  Your brevity today was a precedent.  It was a first and everyone has been very focused.  Thank you for that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Ms Anderson.  Does Ms Ní Dhochartaigh wish to make any concluding remarks?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank all of the delegates for their contributions.  We have learned some interesting things today which will add value to the committee's work.  Gabhaim comhghairdeas le Donncha Mac Niallais as an obair iontach atá á dhéanamh aige maidir leis an teanga.  We appreciate his observations on the language and wish him well in his work.  As discussed, there is the outstanding issue of an Irish language Act and so on.  Mr. Mac Niallais should feel free to contact us if he ever wishes to discuss that or any other issue.  Deputy Feighan and I attended an event hosted by the City of London Corporation in the London Guildhall during President Higgins's State visit.  I am not sure whether the delegates have read or heard the speech the President made on that occasion but it was a phenomenal tribute to the work they have been doing in Derry in the past year or so.  We will send them a copy of the speech, which offered real insight into the historical connection between the City of London Corporation and the city of Derry, which was the genesis of Londonderry.  It is part of the unique history of the city.  It was a very powerful contribution and, as I said, an acknowledgment of the work being done by the delegates.  There have been several high-level political visits to the city in recent times.  President Higgins was there in March last year, as the delegates will recall.  I hope that level of engagement will continue in the future.  I support the comments regarding Willie Hay, and not just because he was born in Kilmacrennan in my own county of Donegal.  We take pride in the great work he is doing there.  Reference was made to finding a language that will help us to move from tolerance to acceptance.  That is something we all want to see.  We do not want communities feeling vulnerable and in danger of losing their identity or part of their culture.  The delegates are seeking to celebrate the different cultures and identities in Northern Ireland and create a safe environment and space for that purpose.  When we travel to the North we always hear people from different groups saying that the peace process, which is still in the embryonic stage, is very much a case of two steps forward and one step back.  We are delighted to hear a new phrase today, which is that Derry is striding forward.  We wish the delegates well in their work and will be happy to assist them at any stage.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Ms Wendy Langham from the East Belfast Partnership.  My initial contact with the partnership was through Mr. Maurice Kincaid, whom I met in Boston, and from whom I obtained a good insight into the work the partnership does.  The committee is familiar with the cultural aspect of the partnership's work.  For the information of members, the East Belfast Partnership is a social partnership with community, statutory, political and business members dedicated to regeneration of east Belfast.  It was formed in 1995 and given responsibility to encourage stakeholder organisations to work together to develop and implement plans for the social, economic, environmental and cultural regeneration of east Belfast.  I am familiar with the work the partnership does in respect of the C. S. Lewis festival.  We look forward to other hearing about the other projects the partnership has under way and the impact these are having not only on the development of east Belfast but also on that of the city in general.  As Ms Langham is aware, our earlier discussion focused on the role of arts and culture in enhancing reconciliation.  The East Belfast Partnership has a strong focus on cultural regeneration and perhaps she might explain this in greater detail.  Before she makes her presentation, I wish to advise Ms Langham that she is protected in respect of her evidence to the committee.  However, if she is directed by the committee to cease making remarks in respect of a particular matter and continues to do so, she will be entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of those remarks.  She is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Wendy Langham for that presentation.  I open the discussion to members and I call Deputy Feighan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies for interrupting but is the Skainos Centre the answer to the original question?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is it the little building in the picture?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thought it was the original site of the Skainos Centre.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies to Deputy Feighan.  He can now continue.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps Ms Langham might respond to the question on education.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It could be a cross-Border allocation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Langham very much and the joint committee appreciates her attendance.  We do not envisage this meeting as a once-off event and if the committee returns to Belfast, we might follow up and get a visual glimpse into the work the Connswater Community Greenway project is doing.  Having seen some of the slides presented today, the project is aiming high and given the work in which it is involved, the group clearly is thinking outside the box.  Moreover, its positivity is contagious.  One hears questions continually as to what is a peace dividend from an economic point of view and here, one can see clearly there is a peace dividend with all the infrastructure development.  On Ms Langham's question as to how the joint committee can help the project in respect of corporate social responsibility, members can think about that issue.  If we can have follow-up to this meeting that would be great.  I am aware that Maurice Kincaid is in New York and that Ms Langham's group appears to be learning a lot from different examples, including New York.  Many towns that are struggling at present in the context of expanded retail developments and town centres that are hurting could learn a lot from the infrastructural connecting, pedestrian-wise, in Belfast.We can learn more from the witnesses. If they are interested in working with us, we would like to continue this relationship. I thank Ms Langham.
