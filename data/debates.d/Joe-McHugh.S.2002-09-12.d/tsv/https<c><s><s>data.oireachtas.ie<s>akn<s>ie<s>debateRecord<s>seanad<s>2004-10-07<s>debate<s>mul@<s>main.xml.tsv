JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I join my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in calling for the speedy enactment of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004. The Government's procrastination on this Bill is leading to serious issues within the force, particularly in Donegal. While the Morris tribunal has its merits and must do its job, the perception throughout the island is that the only place where corruption exists is in Donegal. That is a negative perception which does nothing for morale in the force in Donegal or to instil public confidence in the police force there. The vast majority of the police force in Donegal are competent and not corrupt.It is not good enough for the Governments to use the Morris tribunal as a way of introducing transparency and accountability. It is time the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 was enacted because a Garda ombudsman is the only mechanism which will bring about transparency and accountability. A tribunal in isolation only introduces negative perceptions to a small part of Ireland and that is not good enough.
