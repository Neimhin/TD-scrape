JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following new subsection:"(2) In this Act, the ‘Act of 1992' means the Electoral Act 1992.".During the last local elections and previously in the general election it came to the attention of many of us that there is quite an amount of fraud with regard to the electoral register. Two weeks ago a report in The Sunday Tribune alleged that there were 800,000 names on the electoral register that did not have a vote. These were names of people who were either deceased or, as happens in many cases, names which were duplicated.My proposal, which is an aside to the independent commission on the boundaries, is that the Minister should give serious consideration to introducing phased legislation to attach the vote to a person's PPS number. The PPS system is already in place and it would not complicate the system too much to ask that electoral registers be replicated on the basis of those numbers throughout the country. This is already happening to good effect in the Six Counties.In the last local election a gentleman telephoned me two hours before the booths closed to tell me he had five votes and to ask where he should vote. He had votes in Letterkenny and in the Glenties and Milford areas.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As I was not on the ticket I was not in a position to give him advice on that aspect, but I did advise him to vote only once. It is not illegal to be on the register so many times. I know the example I have given is an extreme one, but it does happen. We have an opportunity to change that today if we consider this sensibly. I discussed the matter with the Leader before this debate began. I ask the Minister to look at it sensibly. I have proposed these amendments because we need to instill confidence in the electorate. A gentleman informed me after the last local election that the postal votes of three elderly people had been intercepted and used. An investigation was carried out, but we had no way of proving anything.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is another example. I ask the Minister to give this matter serious consideration, in the interests of instilling confidence in the electorate.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister. We have commenced the debate on this issue. I had intended to pursue a division but I acknowledge the Minister's frankness and openness in engaging in this debate and I will withdraw my amendments.However, local authorities are severely underresourced and do not have the personnel to maintain the electoral register. It is important to recognise this fact.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I hope this is not like the All-Ireland Championship in being a back-door system for electronic voting.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 4, before section 6, to insert the following new section:"6.—Section 6(2) of the Electoral Act 1997 is amended by the substitution of the following paragraph (b):‘(b) each constituency shall return three, four, five or six if necessary, incorporating all of Leitrim and retaining its full constituency entity;’.”.I have the pleasure of moving this amendment in the absence of Senator Bannon.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Bannon emphasised that this amendment does not affect the current boundary report. It is an amendment for the future to maintain Leitrim as a single entity. The people in Leitrim would prefer either a Sligo-Leitrim constituency or Leitrim-Roscommon.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Mooney made some valid points. I have an interest in this as well because in 1969, part of Leitrim was in part of Donegal South. I have done some study of this matter. Regarding the Minister's own constituency, in 1921, Kildare and Wicklow were one constituency but as a general trend there has not been much movement. In fairness to the case made for Leitrim, however, Leitrim has been bandied about, so to speak, going from Roscommon to Sligo to Donegal.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps people should have a voice on future commissions.In regard to Donegal, in the 1918 Westminster elections, Donegal had four constituencies — North, South, East and West — and as late as 1977 we had one constituency. To return to a point raised earlier by the Minister, people want a connectivity with their politicians. That desire is growing and we should focus on it. Perhaps in time Donegal could be a four-seater constituency again if the trend continues. Leitrim may even have a constituency of its own.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the commission report, there are issues we can deliberate on in the future. It is an excellent report and the people involved must have put a good deal of effort into it. I congratulate the people involved, one of whom is the Clerk of the Seanad, Deirdre Lane. I commend the report and the people involved for all their hard work.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was very moving.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister and welcome the issuing of guidelines in the autumn. These will be presented to the joint Oireachtas committee. This is central to the democratic process. I am glad to be able to go home to Donegal and report to the three pensioners whose votes were intercepted in the last local election that there will be a full examination of the present system.
