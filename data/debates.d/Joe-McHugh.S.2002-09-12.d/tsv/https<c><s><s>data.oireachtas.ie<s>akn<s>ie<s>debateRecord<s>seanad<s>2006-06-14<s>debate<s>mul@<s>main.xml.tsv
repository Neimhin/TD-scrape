JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I add my voice to the demand for an urgent debate on health services. It is not until one is immersed in a scenario of a crowded accident and emergency department, or crowded corridors, that one becomes fully aware and appreciative of the problems which exist. We have spoken of trolleys and patients on trolleys, but because so many people speak of it the whole time, the impact is not realised until a situation occurs similar to what happened last night in Letterkenny General Hospital.My mother was at the accident and emergency department there last night, and a crash victim was brought in. The staff excelled in preparing for the arrival, but the victim unfortunately passed away. After the incident, relatives of the deceased arrived and were mourning the loss amid other patients in the corridor. They were not afforded the dignity to mourn the loss. There was mayhem on the corridors, and the dignity which people should be afforded at that time was not given because of the cramped and crowded conditions.We should stop the talk and jargon about investing in primary care and the roll-out of infrastructure and development.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We must act and keep our word. People within the health service who are discussing the issues in a professional way must put their money where their mouths are, with the aid of this Government. It is important we fund the bricks and mortar and afford people the dignity they deserve.
