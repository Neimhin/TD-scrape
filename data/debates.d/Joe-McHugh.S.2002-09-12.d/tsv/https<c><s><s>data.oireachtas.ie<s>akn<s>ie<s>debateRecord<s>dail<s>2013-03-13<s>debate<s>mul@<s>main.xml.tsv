JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Durkan for putting down this significant question. The Minister recently visited Donegal where he got a good insight into heritage projects there. While I was not able to attend the meetings he had with local groups due to the meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, on behalf of the groups I thank the Minister for giving up his time. In his response the Minister referred to local community engagement with any potential interpretative or visitor centres for historical sites. In Donegal, there are two sites where we could realise massive potential. Malin Head has an historic tower which was used in the past by Lloyds of London, Marconi, the Admiralty and the Army as a coastal defence system in both world wars, respectively. It has been a local ambition for many years to get an interpretative centre there. Whatever influence the Minister can use in conjunction with the Office of Public Works would be important. The second site is Fanad Head lighthouse. There is an application for INTERREG funding for a necklace of visitor sites at lighthouses around the coast. This would make a massive contribution to the maritime tourism sector. A decision on the Fanad Head lighthouse site is imminent and I hope it will be successful.
