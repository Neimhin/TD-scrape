JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh na daoine uile ón Northern Ireland Assembly Committee for the Executive Office, Mr. Colin McGrath, Ms Martina Anderson and Mr. Trevor Clarke. Ms Emma Sheerin may be joining us later. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses physically present do. Witnesses participating in this session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to evidence they give. Members are reminded of long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the place in which Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any members who are participating via Teams to confirm, prior to making their contributions, that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I invite Mr. McGrath to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Anderson. I think we are all in agreement about and happy to meet more regularly and, as part of our committee's protocol, we would meet quarterly. I think Mr. McGrath is receptive to that idea too. I thank Deputy Richmond for raising the matter. Politics is about bread and butter too. We are talking about the protocol and Brexit but bread-and-butter matters are important. I am delighted that Ms Anderson is attending that infrastructure meeting. She can let those present know that the Irish Government will be committed to it. It is in our programme for Government. As far as representing citizens and our constituency in the north west is concerned, it is important. I wish Ms Anderson well with that meeting and hopefully we can see progress with that in the not-too-distant future.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. McGrath. I will let Deputy Ó Murchú back in later. I welcome Ms Sheerin and will introduce another speaker before asking her to engage on that point, since she probably did not hear Deputy Ó Murchú's contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Sheerin. Deputy Ó Murchú wants to come back in again. We will try to keep this to the hour. Deputy Ó Murchú will come back in and if anybody else wishes to ask a second question, they can let me know.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr, McGrath. Does Ms Sheerin wish to come in? The question I want to follow up in is with regard to the protocols and modalities that exist with regard to dealing with whatever issues exist as regards the Irish protocol and the engagement of the Executive in these. Obviosuly, even since the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement has been put in place there are a greater number of methodologs with regard to 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will end on that positive note and those positive words from Ms Sheerin, where we are all solution-focused as a committee. The message from today's meeting is to keep the lines of communication open. We are happy to do that on a quarterly basis. We can set that up with our respective teams. We have so much to do and there is so much that can still be done. We have focused on and talked about Brexit for the best part of half a decade. How much does it consume political discourse in the North and take precedence over other important issues? I am interested to hear Mr. McGrath and Ms Sheerin's perspectives on that. There are so many other issues. I do not have to tell somebody from the North how intrinsically our communities, society and economy are linked on this island. It is in all our interests to keep the lines of communication open and try to act as a solution-focused mechanism. We are happy to keep that engagement going. Over the past five years we have been getting consumed by it and the assumption is that members for the North are also consumed by it. How much has it become a focus at the expense of other important issues, such as the infrastructural issues we talked about?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I take full blame for moving Ms Sheerin into that negative space because I asked the question. We all hear her frustration. That is quite clear. As Deputy Ó Murchú said, we are a terribly agreeable committee. Our door, gate or window is always open to our political colleagues in the unionist community. It would be great to have them present or engage at a public session of one of our meetings at some time in the future.It is really important to have everybody around the table when we are talking about issues of concern to everybody. As Chairman, I am very grateful for Mr. McGrath's participation today. We will follow up on the commitment in respect of holding a quarterly meeting. Issues will arise and change but we will try to be as focused as possible. Arís, go raibh maith agaibh uile, agus ádh mór. I thank the members.
