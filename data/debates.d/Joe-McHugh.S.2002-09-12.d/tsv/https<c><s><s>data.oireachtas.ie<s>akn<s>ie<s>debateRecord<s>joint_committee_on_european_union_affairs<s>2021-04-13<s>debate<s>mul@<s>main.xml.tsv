JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte romih Ms Suzanne Drisdelle, chargé d’affaires of the Canadian embassy, Mr. Reuben East, trade and economic counsellor at the Mission of Canada to the European Union, and Mr. Chris Collenette, chair of the Ireland Canada Business Association, ICBA, to our meeting. We have not received any apologies from members to date. We are joined by Senators Boylan and Higgins and Deputy Whitmore who are not members of the committee. They are welcome. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting. I now call on Ms Drisdelle to make her opening statement. I ask the three individuals who are making presentations to keep them short, which will allow for more interaction with the committee and more time for discussion.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Collenette. He mentioned almost every county in Ireland but he has until 10.30 a.m. to make some connection with Donegal. I look forward to that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are two members of the committee from Mayo so Mr. Collenette's research has been spot on. I will do things slightly differently today to give members some flexibility in putting questions and asking follow-up questions. I will try this approach today because I think we have time. We will see how we get on. Members will have seven minutes, which does not mean they have to use all their time. They have flexibility and I hope it will allow them to follow up with additional questions. I will start with committee members and then move to non-members. If the approach works and members do not filibuster, we might get in a second round of questions. We will see how it goes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have hit the seven-minute mark. If we stick to what Deputy Richmond called our new enlightened approach, he may be able to ask his follow-up questions afterwards, if that is agreeable.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have a specific question and a linked question. Who will take those questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has asked a very specific question. I will allow all three witnesses an opportunity to answer.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Senator has blown my new strategy to pieces by using the full seven minutes. That said, it is important that the Senator gets a response. I ask the three witnesses to respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If it is okay with Mr. Collenette, we will move on and if he has a point to make on this, he can do so later. Deputy Ó Murchú is next, followed by Deputy Duffy.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will start with Mr. Collenette.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Collenette has asked the question back to the Deputy. Will Deputy Ó Murchú come in briefly on that point?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Would Ms Drisdelle or Mr. East like to come in there?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. East. We will move on to Deputy Duffy, to be followed by Senator McDowell.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will give a chance to the speakers to respond now. I thank the Deputy. Does Mr. Collenette want to come back in?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will afford all three witnesses the opportunity to respond. Does Ms Drisdelle want to go first?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Drisdelle. Does Mr. Collenette want to come in again?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is what we like to hear.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are a few technical questions. Maybe we will start with Mr. East, followed by Mr. Collenette.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank our Mr. East and the Senator.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Whitmore followed by Senator Higgins.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Sorry, Deputy, I am going to have to-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I have given the Deputy an extra two minutes, two more members have indicated that they wish to speak and there are only eight minutes remaining. I will bring in Senator Higgins-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Senator Higgins----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In fairness, I have given the Deputy nine minutes. I will bring in Senator Higgins-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	-----followed by-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	-----Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies. I am bringing in Senator Higgins, who has been waiting patiently. We are really strapped for time.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Drisdelle has a few minutes, it is okay. Technically we are supposed to finish in 60 seconds but I am conscious that Deputy Ó Murchú also wants a supplementary, so I ask Ms Drisdelle to keep it brief.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask Mr. Collenette to be very brief as we have three minutes left. I will then bring in Deputy Ó Murchú for a final supplementary question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have run out of time. I thank the witnesses very much for their engagement. This has been a very worthwhile session. I know members were very anxious to underpin the conversation and engagement today by emphasising the importance of the relationship, historical and otherwise. In our recent history, in 2011, the Canadian Government signed off on 10,000 visas during very dark days in this country when many young men and women had to emigrate. The relationship is important. We have evidence of this and no doubt the continued relationship will be positive. Many questions were raised today and there are still a lot of questions. It is very important that we perform our parliamentary and democratic role in asking them. Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe agus leis na baill arís. Guím ádh mór orthu amach anseo.
