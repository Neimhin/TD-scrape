JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Members know the drill about mobile telephones. We have a number of local representatives to discuss the proposed and, as far as this committee is concerned, infamous Narrow Water Bridge. The issue has been on the committee's agenda for a long period. I acknowledge the members for keeping this high on the agenda. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Jim Boylan, president of Warrenpoint Chamber of Commerce, who is joined by Mr. Mark Kelly and Ms Olga Fitzpatrick. We extend a warm welcome to them and we look forward to their contributions. I also welcome Mr. Paddy Malone, outgoing president of the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, who is joined by the incoming president, Mr. Paddy Matthews. By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. Representatives of both chambers will have the opportunity to make an opening statement before we invite members to make observations and put questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Malone, who has set a good precedent regarding brevity. I ask the members to follow suit and make their contributions as concise and specific as possible. I will call members first and then visiting politicians will be given an opportunity.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Members can decide among themselves who will focus on what. There is a vote in the Seanad, in case Senator D'Arcy is not paired.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It will only take a few minutes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will still be here. I invite Ms Margaret Ritchie, MP, to speak, then Mr. Conor Murphy, MP.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is there a seconder for Senator Jim D'Arcy's proposal?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes, we are in public session.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Ritchie. We will now take final comments. Given that we are all on the same page, I ask everyone to be brief in what he or she has to say.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will have a final word from Mr. Paddy Malone. I realise we are already over time and that there is another group waiting.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I realise some Members did not contribute today but they are supportive of the project. Senator Terry Brennan, who is outside the committee, tried to come in, but we are over time. Deputy Joe O'Reilly has spoken on this issue previously as well, and I appreciate that. Some proposals have been put forward. I propose we write to the Taoiseach and the TÃ¡naiste and include a full transcript of the contributions today. Each member is reported in the transcript. I propose to encourage the Taoiseach, who has regular contact with the British Prime Minister, to use his influence to highlight the importance of this project and to press for a decision. Timing is all important at an executive level.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have consensus and general agreement on how we should go about it. We should write to Westminster and Dublin with the ultimate objective of getting a decision from the Executive. I thank members for their contributions and I thank the witnesses for the presentations today, which we welcome. Mr. Boylan put it in a nutshell when he said that it is not about politics but people. If the witnesses want to do some research, there is a bridge in Donegal from the Fanad Peninsula to the Rosguill Peninsula. Prior to the bridge being built, all the talk was of the bridge, but no one mentions the bridge any more. Now, people there talk about being able to go to the post office, going to get a pint of milk and going to mass. The whole dynamic of the communities and their interaction has changed. At one stage, like Warrenpoint, south Down and County Louth, there were ferry boats, but there are no ferry boats there anymore. Mr. Boylan put it well when he said it is about people, not politics. We support him and thank him for coming today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Marie Brown from Foyle Women's Aid. Ms Jo Corcoran is here as well. No doubt they made the trip down this morning from Derry.We look forward to the presentation, particularly on its work. Afterwards members will make a few observations and may ask questions. The committee would be delighted to hear the input of the delegation. Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease to make remarks on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only comments and evidence related directly to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Ms Marie Brown to proceed with her opening statement. 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Brown. Does Ms Corcoran wish to speak? Does she wish to wait until after the members?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call on Deputy Brendan Smith. I wish to acknowledge that he was our point of contact for the group attending today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the members for their contributions. How heightened is the dissident threat that Ms Brown mentioned? An all-Ireland centre was also mentioned. Has any location been chosen? How advanced is planning on this?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Brown for the invitation and I will now take a final contribution from Senator White.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Brown. She has provided us with tremendous insight, which is important. Perhaps this is the start of the conversation. If we are in the north west, we will take up her very kind invitation. I commend our guests on their work. They are strong advocates not just for women but also in respect of other matters, such as supporting families and communities.Ultimately, they are helping to rebuild Northern Ireland and to create a vision for a new Northern Ireland. We wish them well in their work. On the issue of human trafficking, Committee D of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly, chaired by Lord Dubs, is focusing on that matter at present and is taking submissions on it from various groups. If the witnesses are interested in getting in touch with that committee, the clerk to this committee will facilitate them.  Again, I thank the witness for attending this meeting. The committee will now meet in private session and we must vacate the room within 20 minutes.
