JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle. I dtús báire, ba mhaith liom aitheantas a ghabháil leis na príomhoidí uile, na tuismitheoirí, na daltaí scoile, na déagóirí agus an méid scoileanna atá i gceist maidir leis an tionchar suntasach atá i gceist leis na cásanna Covid-19. Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom aitheantas a ghabháil leis na daoine uile fá choinne na ceannaireachta agus na n-oifigí uile sa Rialtas agus sa Roinn Sláinte agus mo Roinn féin as na rudaí suntasacha atá bainte amach ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna as ucht an fhreagra éifeachtaigh, suaimhnigh agus chiúin uaithi. The Department of Education and Skills is in ongoing contact with the schools impacted by the closures to provide support to the school community. The Chief Medical Officer has provided guidance addressing key areas of concern for school staff, students and parents. The Department and schools will continue to be advised by medical experts on these matters. Over recent weeks, the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills worked closely together to ensure we had structures in place to respond if this virus reached our shores. Officials from both Departments and the HSE are in constant communication to ensure that we continue to communicate with our education stakeholders as the situation evolves, and that where there is an impact on a school community, the school is informed as soon as possible and supported throughout the process. All schools, education centres and the education partners have been provided with guidance and information, including child-focused information posters and videos on appropriate hygiene practices. Information for education settings, in consultation with the HSE, is being updated continuously on the website of the Department of Education and Skills and disseminated to schools, education settings and the education partners. There is no need for any school to close unless it is advised to do so by the HSE. A decision to close should be taken on specific public health advice only. It is important that schools and communities follow this guidance and contact the HSE if they have any concerns. Our young people are alert to the danger this virus poses, but also keenly aware of the simple steps that can be taken to minimise risk and combat the virus. Agus mo chuid ama ag teacht chun críche, ba mhaith liom buíochas agus aitheantas a ghabháil le m'oifigigh féin sa Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna agus leis na hoifigigh agus leis an gceannaireacht atá i gceist sa Roinn Sláinte fosta maidir lena stiúradh sa chás seo.
