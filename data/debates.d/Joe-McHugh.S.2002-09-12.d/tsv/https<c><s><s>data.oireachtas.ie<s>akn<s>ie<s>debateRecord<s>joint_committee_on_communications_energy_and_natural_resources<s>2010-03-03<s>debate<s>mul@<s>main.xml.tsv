JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be brief because most of the areas have been covered at this stage.  How thorough was consultation with the stakeholders, assuming that independent radio stations were part of that?  Did it take place in the form of correspondence, or was it an in-depth consultation that examined how radio stations have had to restructure in the past year?  Have they looked at the different restructuring models?  Most radio stations faced a choice of either laying off staff or taking wage reductions.  Some of the radio stations would have opted taking wage reductions to keep staff.  Has the BAI or PricewaterhouseCoopers undertaken a thorough examination on an individual basis of how these restructuring models have come into operation?Every radio station in the past 12 to 18 months has seen a reduction in advertising revenue.  The irony is that many local independent radio stations have increased listening figures, but decreased revenues and an increased cost base.  They are faced with a savage levy which will contribute to more cost increases.  How will these stations balance their restructuring model when the BAI puts this levy on them?
