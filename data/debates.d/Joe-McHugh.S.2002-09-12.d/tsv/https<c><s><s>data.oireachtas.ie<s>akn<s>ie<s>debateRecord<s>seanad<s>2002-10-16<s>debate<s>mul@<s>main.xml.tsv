JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Leader of the House to invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to the House to discuss IDA plans for attracting inward investment. To use a case study in the Milford area in Donegal, the IDA is trying to attract large-scale companies to a rural peripheral area, based on projections that there will be investment in services, broadband and roads. However, this is not happening and will not happen. I want the Tánaiste to tell us what are the IDA's plans and whether we are going down the right road in industrial investment. Maybe we should consider the creation of more indigenous jobs in rural areas.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Bradford for sharing his time. I welcome this Bill which gives me more confidence in the European project. I was one of the 18% of voters who voted "No" in the last referendum because of a lack of confidence in the scrutiny of European measures by the Houses of the Oireachtas. It is understandable why people in my home area of Donegal lack confidence in the European project. For example, a consortium of business people attempted to process a planning application for the construction of a golf course on sand dunes in north west Donegal. Their application was turned down because of European Union directives covering protection of fauna in the area. This sent negative signals to people in the local community, including myself, who were envisaging building hotels and leisure facilities which would have created tourism and employment opportunities, thus helping to secure the sustainable development of their area. We questioned the legitimacy of the authority of these directives, taking the view that the central authority in Dublin should not be obliged to treat Donegal any differently from other regions in the country. In view of this, the Bill is welcome as it will afford me the opportunity to scrutinise legislation, proposals and directives from the Union.Another example of European Union bureaucracy concerns local restaurateurs in my home town. They get endless lists of conditions and requirements from the health boards, which emanate from Europe, often covering as many as 40 or 50 health and safety conditions that must be met before they can welcome members of the public to their premises. It does little for confidence in the European process, especially when those affected travel on holiday to other European Union countries, such as France, and find cats and dogs in restaurants. I hope this Bill will address this aspect and help to reduce the democratic deficit in the European project.The Minister pointed out how much Ireland has benefited from European Union membership. He said it had provided Ireland with the initial and necessary gateway to opportunity and that Ireland should be prepared to give something back. This dependency model evoked by the Minister should be compared to that of the dole man, or, to be politically correct, the dole woman.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	A position of dependency on hand-outs does not instil confidence in the recipient. I have yet to hear a person on the dole say that, while on the dole, he or she respected the social welfare system. Respect will not be engendered if the language of dependency is used to describe Ireland's relationship with the European Union. We also contributed and were involved in the development of the European project. We were not merely bit-part players.The centralisation of our Government system does not instil confidence in people living in rural areas. The same can be said for the European project, which starts in Brussels and stops in Dublin. We should proceed beyond this legislation and decentralise our European project. There should be offices in regions around the country, such as Donegal, Waterford and Kerry. People must see what the European Union is about because, at present, they have no tangible evidence of what it does. There are infrastructure benefits, such as regional colleges, of which the Letterkenny Institute of Technology is an example. However, while these are European Union funded projects, citizens see them as the consequences of spending taxpayers' money. In view of this, offices should be established in each county council to enable people explore how much the Union contributes to projects in their areas.Doubtless, hundreds of thousands of euro have been spent on consultants explaining the democratic deficit and why, at the last referendum, 65% of the electorate did not vote. They did not vote because of their lack of confidence in the European project. It is meaningless to them. In this context the term "subsidiarity", referred to by Senator McDowell, is important. It is concerned with devolving power to the regions and giving them more autonomy. The Leas-Chathaoirleach referred to the BMW region. While it exists in theory, it has little practical significance. If we are to develop along the lines of the  Länder system in Germany or the regions in Scandinavian countries, we will have to fully implement proper constitutional arrangements for our regions, be it at county council or regional level.I welcome the Bill, the timing of which is excellent. According to the latest opinion poll on the Nice referendum, 31% of voters are still undecided. We must tell them that the European project is evolving. We are trying to change the way we operate in Europe, but it will not be easy. Given this, we should be careful not to slag "No" voters. While the "No" campaigners are misleading the public, they are tapping into apathetic voters, those who find Europe meaningless. We should stop slagging them because there is a reason that, on the last occasion, 65% of the electorate did not vote and why, today, 31% of voters are undecided about how they will vote on Saturday.
