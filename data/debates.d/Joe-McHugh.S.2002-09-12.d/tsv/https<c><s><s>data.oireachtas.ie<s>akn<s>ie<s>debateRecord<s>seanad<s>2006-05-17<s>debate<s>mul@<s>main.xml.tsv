JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Leader invite the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to the House for an urgent debate on broadband? This call is in light of a comment from our colleague, Senator Quinn, that information packs on how to use the Internet are being distributed to households in Northern Ireland. It is important to remember people in Northern Ireland are in a very fortunate position in that there is 100% roll-out of broadband there. That is not the case across the Border, so it is very much in our interest to roll out broadband before we even start to think about giving out information on how to use the Internet. Inishowen is in close proximity to Northern Ireland and it is very hard for small businesses there to compete with Derry and Tyrone where there is 100% roll-out of broadband.Recently, the Taoiseach visited Inishowen to open a half finished road, switch on the lights in a community centre and switch off the lights in Fruit of the Loom in Buncrana. The next time a Taoiseach visits Inishowen, we want to hear him or her make an announcement in respect of broadband which is the key to the survival of the small to medium-sized enterprise sector there. We need to remain competitive with our neighbours across the Border. I would like the Leader to expedite a debate on broadband with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
