JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, for introducing this visa waiver policy.  In the short time he has been in office, he has shown courage and the conviction to see it will work.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has also put his weight behind the programme.In this new and different global era, we must think outside the box and do things differently.  Traditionally, we in County Donegal always felt there was a weighted exodus of tourists from America to the south to counties Kerry and Clare.  At the time, Donegal, as a Border county, had to deal with the perception of conflict which did not instil confidence among tourists.  However, Border areas have relied on Northern Ireland tourists.  In the past several weeks, we have recorded in Donegal a sharp increase in Northern Ireland tourist numbers again, even as far north as the Inishowen Peninsula.Efforts in promoting Donegal tourism are made by FÃ¡ilte Ireland's county office, Tourism Ireland, the Donegal Local Development Company and the county enterprise board.  Their aim is to think locally but act globally.  For example, a Donegal live event will be held in Dublin on 22 May to highlight and advertise Donegal's full tourism potential.  In the past, a similar event was held in Glasgow and, in August, one will be held in America with Derry tourism agencies to entice tourists from there.To change how we market this country's tourism industry, we must work on initiatives such as those announced today.  In 2008, I was given the responsibility by my party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, to head up a Border counties forum to examine policy creation.  The forum examined the bilateral arrangements for visa waivers between North and South and Britain and the Republic of Ireland.  I am delighted that as an Opposition Member then I could formulate and take this policy to Government.Members across on the Opposition benches should see Parliament as a conduit for policy.  Policy, they should remember, does not fall from the sky.  Many in the media think policy should be created only in Dublin and politicians should spend their time in the House scrutinising legislation, Monday to Friday.  That is not how politics or policy formulation works.  Policy comes from the people on the ground.  The only way we can frame it is if we listen attentively to what the people suggest.  The visa waiver policy announced today by the Minister for Justice and Equality came from suggestions from tourism industry representatives.  They noticed declining numbers in American and UK visitors and sought new markets.  By listening, politicians can formulate plans that are good for the country and instil confidence.I notice a wry smile on Deputy Timmy Dooley's face opposite.  We in Donegal are not looking to take any tourists from Clare.  I congratulate both Ministers for running with this visa waiver programme.  I also thank the Labour Party for ensuring the policy was included in the joint programme for Government and did not fall between the gaps.  The policy is a good example of how Government and Parliament should work.  When the new committees are established, I look forward to driving similarly constructive and co-operative agendas that can be worked on by both sides of the House.This visa waiver programme is an example of a new way of thinking about tourism.  We must begin inviting tourists from Bangalore, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Uzbekistan as we have invited those from America.
