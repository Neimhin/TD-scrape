JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	May I make a remark before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle puts the question?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to be part of a Business Committee which meets to consider these matters. It is the Business Committee that decides the order of the House. That is a mechanism we have all agreed to.I would be happy to facilitate what is being requested, if that is possible and if a meeting is convened to consider it. I am concerned that we might ignore the policy that is the Business Committee that decides what goes on the agenda. I am also aware, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that we have a very tight schedule this week between the FEMPI Bill, the Finance Bill, and trying to commence the Social Welfare Bill. We did have an agreement but I am happy if there is to be a meeting of the Business Committee on this issue.
