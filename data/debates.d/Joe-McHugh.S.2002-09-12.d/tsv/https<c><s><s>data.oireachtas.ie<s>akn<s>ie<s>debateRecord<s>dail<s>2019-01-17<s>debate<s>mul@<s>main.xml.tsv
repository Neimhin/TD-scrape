JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	This issued was raised with me by FÃ³rsa representatives on Saturday when they indicated that they would be launching their campaign this week. The matter has been raised by a number of Members across this House over a long number of years. Different schemes have been introduced, including that brought forward in 1978-79, and school secretaries and caretakers are also part of the public service stability agreement up to 2020. I am conscious of this issue but I am also conscious of the fact there are issues regarding nurses' pay and new entrant pay for teachers. These are all in the same grouping. I am very conscious of this issue but I am also conscious of the other demands.
