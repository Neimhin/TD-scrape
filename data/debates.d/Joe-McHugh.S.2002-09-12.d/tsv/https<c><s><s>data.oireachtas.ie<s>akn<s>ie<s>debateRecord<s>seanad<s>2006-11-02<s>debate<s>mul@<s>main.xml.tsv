JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need an urgent debate on the follow-up to yesterday's announcement on drift net fishing for salmon. The process has been handled in a simplistic way, pitting drift net men against anglers. This has done an unbelievable amount of damage to the whole fishing industry. I refer to an entire coastal community that has been completely alienated as a result of the decision. It was in no way consulted on it.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The decision was made before most of the fishermen from Donegal and Cork were able to set foot in Dublin yesterday to protest. It was made by Cabinet and not before the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. This is not indicative of consultation.If an adequate compensation package had been put on the table, a voluntary buy-out would have worked. I discovered this on speaking to the fishermen, including drift net fishermen.We have alienated an entire coastal community that is otherwise alienated as a result of a decline in the industry, pelagic boats being tied up in Killybegs, crabmen in Downings having to go to Holland to fish——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was as a result of overfishing in the past but not everybody should be tarred with the same brush. We are talking about livelihoods, tradition——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are talking about a way of life.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I respect the views of Senators Norris and Dardis but the debate should be ongoing. The angler knows well that——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——it is a case of pollution in the rivers arising from raw sewage. There is an unsupervised cull of seals.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The angler knows that this debate must continue and that we cannot just starve an entire coastal community for the sake of a popular decision.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about the poachers?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need to compensate the fishermen who are being made redundant.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need to compensate the fishermen. That is all we are asking for.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can take the Senator to County Donegal this weekend so he can learn all about it.
