JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Chairman for organising this meeting because this is important.  It helps to give us a perspective and it also helps us to understand the dynamic of something we were not brought up with on a day-to-day basis.  It is important to acknowledge that we all come from different perspectives shaped by our own experiences.  My experience and somewhat minimal understanding of parades relates to 12 July.  As a young boy growing up in a farmhouse bed and breakfast, we experienced a mass exodus of people from Northern Ireland to Donegal on that date.  It was a negative experience because people were coming into our home and sharing their experiences and they felt they had to leave the North on 12 July.  That sent out a negative message to me as a young boy and shaped a certain perspective.Times have changed and the presence of the delegation is symbolic of that change.  The change is immense.  It has reconfigured our perspective, blinkered understanding, misgivings and misconceptions.  I acknowledge their presence today because it helps our understanding.We benefitted from an economic point of view.  Our household was packed on 12 July.  I recall my parents vacating their bedroom and sleeping on the floor in my bedroom and my brother's bedroom to facilitate a married couple from Northern Ireland on that date.  As a county, Donegal benefited and, therefore, there is always a silver lining.My first question relates to facilitating the future understanding.  The commission is trying to do great work through the schools in Northern Ireland sharing best practice about parading.  Does Mr. Osborne anticipate contacting the Department of Education and Skills to go into schools in the Border area?  I am being parochial but that might address some of the negative perceptions.  There are parades in Rossnowlagh and Manorcunningham, which I want to learn more about and to understand.  The citizens of Donegal would share that opinion.My second question relates to potential tourism benefits.  Foreigners are intrigued by parading.  Would the commission consider the future of parading as a tourist attraction?  Has it engaged with Tourism Ireland?
