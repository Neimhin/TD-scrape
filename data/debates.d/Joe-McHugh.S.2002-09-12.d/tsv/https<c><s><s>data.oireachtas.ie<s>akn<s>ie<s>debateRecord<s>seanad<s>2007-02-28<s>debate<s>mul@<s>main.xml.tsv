JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to raise some issues in an all-Ireland context, or, more accurately, in a cross-Border context.  The Leader might raise them with the Minister for Education and Science.  An anomaly exists in respect of postal votes, whereby a few students from County Donegal who attend the University of Ulster at Jordanstown and Queen's University, Belfast, have been informed they are not entitled to a postal vote as they do not attend universities within the State.  This anomaly could——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are not entitled to postal votes for a general election.  For example, a person from Carrickart who attends University College Cork is entitled to a postal vote, while someone from Buncrana who attends the University of Ulster at Magee College, which is ten minutes across the Border, is not so entitled.  This anomaly could be cleared up if it was brought to the Minister's attention.  The universities require instruction in this regard.As for the all-Ireland context, many anomalies and complexities will arise.  While Members refer to cross-Border issues, they should be referred to as complex Border issues from henceforth, because many challenges will be faced in areas such as telecommunications, all-Ireland energy markets and infrastructural project markets.  Members must consider the capacity to handle such issues.  Some reports have already been produced in this regard, including one I read this morning, which was an all-Ireland analysis on a cross-Border basis.However, one critical element was omitted, namely, the concept of capacity-building at a community level.  I refer to areas such as Newtowncunningham, which has been recorded as the fastest growing village in Europe.  The 2006 census has indicated that it is growing at an accelerated rate.  However, the critical point in respect of a Border village such as Newtowncunningham is that it has become a dormitory village of Derry city's urban sprawl.People from Derry city who move to places like Killea, St. Johnston, Carrigans and Newtowncunningham continue to send their children to crèches and primary schools in Derry.  They are entitled to so do under the EU regulations in respect of the free movement of people.  However, I will give one example of the consequences.  Last year, on examination of the census figures, a young woman decided on the basis that Newtowncunningham was the fastest growing village in Europe to establish a crèche there.  However, she was obliged to close it down last year because she could only attract two clients.  Serious issues exist along the Border.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Members need to look at the capacity of communities, villages and towns along the Border.  Although such communities are working on their local area plans and are being proactive at a local level, they are disintegrating into two communities.  Two groups of people live side by side.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are not interacting or working at an intercommunity level because they live in one jurisdiction and go to school in another and it is not coming together.  Working with communities on both sides of the Border, a formula or map is required as to how capacity can be built in places——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——such as Newtowncunningham, Killea, Carrigans, Muff and Quigley's Point.  Senator Maurice Hayes will agree that——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——a community in which people simply sleep is undesirable.  People should contribute to that community and involve themselves in it.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Moreover they should be part of that community.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am delighted to have had an opportunity to debate the issue a little.  Yes, a major debate is needed.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I also want to hear Senator Maurice Hayes's opinion on the matter.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He is still here.  He is hiding.
