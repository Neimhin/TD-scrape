JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Toisc nach féidir leis an Aire, an Teachta Richard Bruton, a bheith i láthair inniu, freagróidh mise an cheist ar a shon. My first thoughts are with the workers who are being made redundant and with their families. All the State supports will be made available to any workers affected. As I understand it, the job losses announced by C&C affect a number of the company's plants nationwide. Voluntary redundancies were sought as the company restructured its Irish business and integrated the manufacturing and distribution business it acquired in 2012. In total, I understand 31 voluntary redundancies were sought in logistics, distribution depots and field sales operation, while five staff transferred to a contract haulier. I understand a further ten job losses pertain solely to one of the Tipperary plants. The announcement by C&C is as a result of the loss of a significant private label contract with a retailer and the loss of sole supplier status with another retailer for a private label product. These events will see the reduction of the depot value from the plant concerned. The company is working to replace this business as soon as is possible. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has directed officials from Enterprise Ireland to continue to engage with C&C management and offer any assistance possible. Employment retention and creation continues to be the primary objective of the Government. Since we launched the Action Plan for Jobs, more than 136,000 additional jobs have been created. In County Meath, the number of people employed in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland supported companies increased by more than 1,600 or 16% in the period from 2011 to 2015, compared with more than 1,000 job losses in Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland supported companies in the period from 2008 until 2010, which amounted to a 15% decrease. In addition, the Meath local enterprise office supports 180 small businesses and micro-companies, which added more than 150 new jobs in 2014, an increase of 24%. At the same time, the number of people on the live register in County Meath has declined by more than 29%. As part of the Government's €250 million regional Action Plan for Jobs, a specific mid-east region Action Plan for Jobs will be published. This will seek to build on the jobs progress which has already been made. The Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, and Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, have already hosted a consultation with public and private bodies in the mid-east and the plan is in development. Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the Meath local enterprise office will continue to work with local companies to increase the number of start-ups, grow exports and, ultimately, create the jobs we need. I realise the Deputy's question is more specific and relates to a number of employees or former employees at the plant. Workplace Relations Commission customer service staff are available to meet the employees concerned to provide information and answer any questions on their current circumstances and statutory employment rights and entitlements.

Certainly, I will ask the Minister and his officials to make direct contact with the Deputy on the issue. Whether it is creating a mechanism or communication line with the Workplace Relations Commission, we need to look at some action point. There are statutory protections for workers in the context of redundancy. Under the redundancy payments scheme, eligible employees with at least two years' continuous service in fully insurable employment are entitled to a minimum statutory lump sum payment on being made redundant. A redundancy situation arises where a business closes and ceases to trade. An employee is entitled to two weeks' pay for every year of service with a bonus week added on subject to the prevailing maximum ceiling on gross weekly pay, which is currently €600. The lump sum payment is tax free. In addition, employees are entitled to notice as per the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act. I will certainly convey the Deputy's concern on specific and individual cases.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I want to acknowledge all of the contributions on both sides of the House, which were constructive. Deputy Connaughton pointed out that we have to keep the conversation going and if ideas can be fed through it is important that happens. The Government has shown its commitment to the credit union movement in Ireland by establishing the Commission on Credit Unions in May 2011 to make recommendations on the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to protect fully members’ savings and financial stability. The commission report was co-authored and agreed by key stakeholders, including credit union representatives. The process was a participative one, with wide representation from the credit union movement. The agreed commission report sets out the blueprint for the viability of credit unions into the future. Its constituent elements are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The Government fully accepted all recommendations in the commission’s report which was presented to it in March 2012. Over 60 of these recommendations are contained in the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012, which is the first new legislation for credit unions in 15 years. The 2012 Act was signed into law by the President in December 2012. It was agreed at that time that it would be neither practical nor feasible to commence the 2012 Act in its entirety in one fell swoop. This has provided credit unions with the necessary time to ensure that the required processes and procedures are in place prior to the implementation of each tranche. The report of the commission on credit unions made a number of recommendations regarding the strengthening of the regulatory framework for credit unions. It also recommended that regulation making powers be delegated to the Central Bank. Therefore, it is a matter for the registrar of credit unions to make regulations and set limits for credit unions, including savings limits. In keeping with this, the registrar of credit unions is introducing new regulations for credit unions. Regarding these regulations, it must be clear that the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is the independent regulator for credit unions. Within her independent regulatory discretion, the registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members. In line with the recommendations of the commission on credit unions, and having regard to international best practice, the Central Bank conducted a consultation process in December 2013 on a proposed two-tier regulatory approach as set out in consultation paper 76, CP76.  The Central Bank stated that feedback received on CP76 indicated that the majority of respondents were of the view that a tiered regulatory approach should not be introduced at this time given the amount of change that the credit union sector is currently undergoing. Following on from this, in November 2014 the Central Bank conducted a second full consultation process in the form of consultation paper 88, CP88. A regulatory impact analysis was also conducted on the new regulations. While the proposed regulations are not of a specific tiered nature, the registrar will be provided with powers to make appropriate and timely changes to regulations where it is considered necessary. At the current time, it is the Minister’s intention to commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015, in line with the introduction of the regulations by the Registrar of Credit Unions. These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the 1997 Act. The Government has no role in setting regulations for a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions. The Minister for Finance and the Government are aware of and recognise the concerns of the credit union movement regarding the savings limit of €100,000. However, it must be reiterated that the setting of the savings limit of €100,000 is a matter for the registrar, who has stated that this measure is being introduced to ensure the protection of members’ savings and that credit union funding is sufficiently diversified and not dependent on a small number of members. The Minister for Finance has emphasised that his officials have been in constant contact with representative bodies. He met credit union representative bodies on 12 November 2015, when the perceived impact of the new regulations was discussed. At that meeting the Minister asked credit union representatives to revert with their specific concerns and he has committed to communicate these concerns to the registrar. Further follow-up meetings between the Department of Finance and the representative bodies will take place tomorrow. It is recognised that for a business to grow it needs to develop its business model and credit unions, while not-for-profit entities, need to grow income to ensure sector viability. When the Minister met representative bodies the week before last, they were invited to share any business model development ideas they may have to introduce new income opportunities to the sector to ensure future growth and sector viability. The Minister looks forward to receiving proposals that will support and grow income and maintain viability while protecting members’ savings. It was mentioned by a number of Deputies yesterday that the sector has €8 billion available for investment in social housing. While my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, is primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and the preparation of legislation on housing, Department of Finance officials are scheduled to meet Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government officials later this week to discuss the proposals.
