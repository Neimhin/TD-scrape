JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The World Angling Championships will take place this June in Downings, County Donegal, a place that holds fond memories for Senator MacSharry, about which Members can ask him later. Some of the 15 countries participating include Spain, France, Germany and Italy. The community-led event, which came to my attention only recently, has been aided by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. Will the Leader inform the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism about the competition and ask some of his officials to contact the group in Downings? This is a good example of a community-led tourism project which could form a prototype that we should encourage and promote as we look for more sustainable tourism products.
