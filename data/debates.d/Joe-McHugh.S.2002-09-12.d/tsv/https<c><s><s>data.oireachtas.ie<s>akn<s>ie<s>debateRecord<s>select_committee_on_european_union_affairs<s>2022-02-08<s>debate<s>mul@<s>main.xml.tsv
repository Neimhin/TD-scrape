JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputies Howlin and Calleary. Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur, on behalf of the committee, I would like to extend a welcome to the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ms Ylva Johansson, and her colleagues, to our meeting today. Ms Barbara Nolan is very welcome back to the committee. Mr. Brian Synott and Ms Monika Maglione are also very welcome. We will be engaging on the topic of migration. We look forward to that. I thank the witnesses for the pre-meeting engagement we had for a few minutes upstairs as well. There is so much to discuss on this matter and we look forward to the engagement. I have no doubt the Commissioner's ministerial experience in Sweden adds value to the work she is doing. The witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if any of their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that the witnesses comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In that regard, I ask members participating on MS Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making a contribution to the meeting. Masks should continue to be worn throughout the meeting by all present and should only be removed when speaking. I call on the Commissioner to make her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. Before I go to the members, I ask her to return to her second point about the French Presidency. She broke the policy into three points. The first was registration and she gave a statistic on the second point which I missed; it related to registration.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As Deputy Richmond said, I thank the Commissioner for her openness and frankness and her comprehensive overview of an area that is very difficult and challenging but is not new. When we speak about registration and going through a proper process as an Irish citizen it is hard at times not to think of Irish migration to the United States. We still have a lot of people in the United States who are undocumented. I can totally understand what the Commissioner is saying. If a proper process is not there at the beginning people can get locked into a very difficult situation. A few people from my county have been undocumented in the United States for two decades. They have missed out on family funerals. They have not been home. Their children have been home and met their grandparents in Ireland. When they returned to the United States they started asking their parents questions as to why they do not go home. They asked them whether they have done something wrong or if there is something they have not told them about why they have not returned to Ireland in 20 years. The point the Commissioner made about the process and people getting trapped is something with which we are very familiar with regard to Irish citizens. It is a small percentage but there are people who have not been regularised in the United States. It is a very interesting conversation. I am interested to hear the Commissioner's opinion on the challenge in Africa, particularly in the Horn of Africa. I remember going to a refugee camp in Uganda back in 2016. In the camp I went to there were 500,000 refugees, primarily women and children from South Sudan. The number of refugees in Uganda is now 1.4 million. The Commissioner spoke about proximity and the countries closest to refugee camps. Sudan has many refugees but many of the South Sudanese refugees are in Uganda. With regard to the magnitude of the challenge and the capacity that needs to be built in the Horn of Africa there has been a great move by the French Presidency, which the Commissioner referenced, that this is not an issue that needs to be dealt with within the EU but that it is wider than this. With regard to the capacity building, enabling process and signposting that needs to be done, a representative of the UNHCR will come before the committee after this meeting. It has been doing a lot of work since 1950. In terms of the scale and the magnitude of the numbers in refugee camps throughout Africa, I would like to hear the Commissioner's opinion specifically on education. In a previous life she was a teacher before she got into politics. Within the camps there is a big focus on education. I remember being in a camp in Jordan of mainly Syrian refugees. I met a number of great people working very much on education.However, they did not have the resources that they really needed in that regard. I would be interested in hearing the Commissioner's opinion on education, empowerment and the population increase in Africa.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. If members want to come back in, we still have a few minutes. I have one final question, and I encourage the Commissioner not to be shy about it when she is grappling for an answer. What can we, as a committee, do to help the Commissioner in her work, to help the pact and to help to progress the ambitious plan of the French Presidency under President Macron? What can we do to help this good work?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am not sure where the word "brag" originated. It may be Scandinavian or, perhaps, it is Irish, dating back 3,000 years, but following on from Ms Johansson's use of the word, there has been a large positive response from members wanting to come back in again.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner very much for her time, words of wisdom and advice. We are far too modest a committee to follow the bragging route but it will certainly-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will certainly stay in touch and stay engaged on this issue because it is something the committee is very eager to work together on. If we manage to get over to mainland Europe and Brussels at some stage maybe there could be some follow-up suggestions with different people or colleagues of the Commissioner, as we want to have a bit of continuity on this issue. We are keeping an eye out for the EU-African summit as well. We are willing and eager. We are conscious it is a really important issue. Emigration is part of who we are as Irish people, whether it is Irish people in the USA, Chile, Brazil, Australia or China. Once I start naming countries I must talk about all the Donegal emigrants in Stockholm in the Commissioner's own country who are being well looked-after and working hard over there as well. It is part of who we are. We are very much in touch with the dignity issue and ensuring people have that dignity. Without dignity people do not have freedom. Those are not my words but the famous words of Columbanus from a long time ago. He left Bangor in County Down and headed for Rome. He made it as far as Bobbio in Italy. If you are ever in Bobbio, there is an inscription in Latin that says that if you take away a person's dignity you take away their freedom. Those words are part of the Irish DNA. We understand and want to help. We really appreciate the Commissioner and her colleagues coming here to be with us. It is to be hoped this is the first of many steps in working on this issue. Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe agus guím gach rath orthu leis an obair dhíograiseach thábhachtach. That means their important and dedicated work. We look forward to catching up again.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We resume our consideration of the topic of migration. On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, UNHCR representative for EU affairs, along with his colleagues, Mr. Enda O’Neill and Ms Sophie Magennis. Before we resume our consideration, I must read out a note on privilege and deal with some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members are also reminded of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement and any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making a contribution, to confirm that they are on the Leinster House campus.  Mr. Vargas Llosa will be interested to know that we had a very good engagement this morning with the European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, Ms Ylva Johansson. I acknowledge the work of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR. I had an up close and personal look at its work in Jordan, Lebanon and Uganda back in 2016. I am familiar with the work the organisation is doing. It is important work. The organisation has been at work since 1950. It is also important to refer to the intervention of France to make migration a pivotal issue during the French Presidency. Commissioner Johansson expanded on that earlier and I am sure Mr. Llosa has a view on it too. I invite him to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Vargas Llosa for his contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Magennis. Deputy Haughey has a supplementary question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. Does the Deputy have further questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will hand over to Mr. Vargas Llosa to wrap up and to address those two specific points raised by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Magennis, Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Vargas Llosa for their participation. This is not a one-off intervention on migration, but a topic on which the committee is interested in following through. We enjoyed the deliberations, and we were informed by the contributions of Mr. Vargas Llosa, Ms Magennis and Mr. O'Neill, as well as Commissioner Johansson. I take Mr. Vargas Llosa's point regarding the countries facilitating many refugees. He mentioned Pakistan. I spent time in Jordan and Lebanon, two countries where refugees account for 25% of the respective populations. I also single out Uganda, which has 1.4 million refugees. The figure has tripled since 2016, when there were 500,000 refugees in the country.We do not underestimate the enormity of the challenge but, on the positive side, and in the words of Commissioner Johansson this morning, we are dealing with human beings here. We have a tradition, a history and a legacy of emigration from Ireland over hundreds and thousands of years, so we know all about it. We know the benefits of emigration and the contribution Irish emigrants have made globally, and that should be no different in terms of the challenge we have ahead. Whether we meet up again in Geneva or whether there is a bit of signposting that the Commissioner can give us in regard to some sort of presence in one of the UNHCR camps, where very important work is being done, we, as a committee, are all ears. I thank the witnesses once again for their time. We look forward to further engagement and we appreciate them being with us today. I propose that we defer the private session. Is that agreed? Agreed.
