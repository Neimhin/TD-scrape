JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That will be a matter for the committee to decide.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have no wish to pre-empt any election result.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to speak.  I am not a member of this committee.  I welcome the diverse delegation of politicians and business people.  I am more familiar with the politicians present.  There are several first time visitors from the business community to Leinster House.  All are welcome.  I have read the biographies.  There is diverse expertise.  I imagine the knowledge the politicians are getting is invaluable.  Deputy John Lyons has prompted me to focus on one aspect.  Mr. Richard Hogg from Precision Gear Company is among the visiting group.  Can a member of the visiting group answer a question?  What is the protocol?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I mean no disrespect to the panel before us.  I have a question for Mr. Richard Hogg and Deputy Lyons has prompted me to ask the question.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, is today meeting his counterpart in the UK to discuss exports and renewable energy.  EirGrid will have the interconnector between the UK and Ireland up and running, possibly by this September.  I refer to joint projects between the UK and Ireland.  For instance, David McClarty works closely with me on the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We have been talking for years about cross-Border co-operation but much of the talk has been about intangibles, but it is great to see more tangible results.  How can legislators, North and South, east and west, assist in the work being undertaken by Mr. Hogg who is providing one turbine gearboxes throughout the UK and Ireland and which is providing employment?  The focus of this meeting today is how we can work together on a cross-Border basis.  How can we as legislators in the North and South, work towards advancing the issue of more offshore wind energy in the seas around this island and throughout the British Isles?
