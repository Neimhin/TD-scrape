JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Barrett spoke earlier about an antiquated aspect of the educational system.  There are positive aspects to this scheme.  It was administered by one person and the total administration cost was about €25,000 per year.  We are concerned here with the north Inishowen area of Donegal.  In my constituency of Donegal North East, 53% of young males leave school at 16.  That compares with a national figure of 35%.  That is a massive disparity.In this scheme, four national schools came together to provide support and capacity between parents and teachers, started engaging with communities, and increased the level of student participation at national school.  The results are transparent and are there to see.  This has been an outstanding success since 2001.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In light of this outstanding success and in light of the fact that this is a particular geographical, sensitive area in terms of early school leaving, should we not be evaluating the good schemes and looking at their benefits?  This would be a better approach than imposing a rigid rule for the whole country.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to apologise, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am new to the House and I did not know the difference between a Second Stage speech and a priority question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does the Minister of State accept that the 53% statistic is acceptable?  Does he accept that it is wrong for his party to give a written commitment to these four schools in 2007 that the scheme would stay in place, and then to renege on that commitment?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The issue of Garda resources in the Inishowen area has been raised in the Donegal and national media.  This is not an argument for increased Garda resources along the Border.  As Fine Gael spokesperson on North-South co-operation, I laud the fact the Border is no longer policed as it was in the 1970s, 1980s and the 1990s.  The fading of the Border should be welcomed and encouraged by every Member.  My specific request is for increased Garda resources in a part of north-east Donegal which circulates around the fourth largest city on this island, Derry city.A spate of burglaries across Inishowen in recent weeks has caused upheaval and great anxiety in every home.  Across the area, people are installing house alarms and I have been contacted by many people who are keeping nightly neighbourhood vigils.  I have met senior Inishowen gardaí to discuss the matter.  I welcome the fact that the assistant commissioner is taking the issue seriously which was reflected in his trip to Donegal last week.  I commend the superintendent in the Inishowen district who is taking the issue seriously and the efforts made by the Garda in deployment for the short term.From speaking to many public representatives in the area, I believe it is time to examine the ethos of community policing in the area.  I will use, for illustration, a comparison between the Inishowen area and the greater Cork area.  Cork city has a population of 120,000 while Derry's is 90,000.  If suburban areas are included, Cork's figure rises to 190,000.  However, Derry's figure is distorted by the fact that it does not account for the part of east Donegal that is considered to be a suburb of Derry.  In east Cork, there are 22 gardaí based in Glanmire, a 24-hour station, Carraigtwohill has a 24-hour station and 50 gardaí are based at Cobh.  In the west, 50 gardaí are based in Gurranbraher, 16 in Blarney and 50 in Bandon.  In east Inishowen, Burnfoot has 16 gardaí, Muff, two, Carrigans, five, Newtowncunningham, four, and Carndonnagh, five.  There are no Garda stations in Quigley's Point or Killea.The Inishowen Peninsula is the most northerly part of this island.  It is geographically proximate to Derry city, which is the natural shopping centre and university town in the region.  Inishowen is part of the Catholic diocese of Derry.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in distributing Garda Síochána resources, must acknowledge this fact and, accordingly, allocate such resources as are necessary for a region which is situated adjacent to a major city with a six-figure population.I raised this matter over a five-year period when serving as a Member of Seanad Éireann.  There is still time for action to be taken in respect of it.  In light of North-South ministerial collaboration and co-operation, there is room for progress to be made.The problem I am highlighting only related to Inishowen a number of weeks ago.  In recent days, however,  it has emerged that it is becoming prevalent throughout Donegal.  This problem, which is termed "creeping crime" by some, will soon become all-island in nature.  We must be vigilant and the only way to do so is by deploying additional Garda resources in the rural areas to which I refer.  We must also engage with local communities.  I acknowledge the efforts of the assistant commissioner and the force in general in examining the nature of the community policing ethos.
