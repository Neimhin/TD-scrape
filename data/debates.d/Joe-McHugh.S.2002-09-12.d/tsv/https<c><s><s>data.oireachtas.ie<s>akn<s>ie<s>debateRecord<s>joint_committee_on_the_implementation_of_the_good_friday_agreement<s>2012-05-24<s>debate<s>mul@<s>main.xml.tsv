JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I join in the welcome for the delegation today.  It is always good to get an honest perspective.  Today we are looking at how to move this forward, but it is also important to outline where we are at right now.  If we look around this room, we can observe that we are lacking representation from the Unionist community.  That has been the case since the formation of this committee.  It is always important to point that out.  They are still welcome to come here, and if there are fears about titles and language, we should look at the possible amendment of the Good Friday Agreement to call it the Good Friday Agreement-Belfast Agreement.  That invite is still open.  If we are to move this process forward, we need them here.  This is an implementation committee, and if we are implementing aspects of the Good Friday Agreement, we need everybody around the table.It is good to have the delegation here, because it keeps reminding us that while 1998 is a long time ago, much has changed and there has been a lot of good, but there remains much to do.  We have our own challenge at the political level to implement another aspect of the Good Friday Agreement, which is the North-South parliamentary forum.  We have been making good progress in the forum.  There has been much dialogue and negotiation, and this has happened because we had everybody present.  I would like to acknowledge all the work done by the Speaker of the Assembly, Mr. Willie Hay, our own Ceann Comhairle and his predecessors in trying to bring that process forward.The parliamentary forum will be integral to helping this committee do what it is trying to do.  Mr. Hanratty pointed out that the final piece of the jigsaw is the bill of rights.  Ms McCausland mentioned the red herrings and the Scottish stuff.  That is completely out of our control, but we should look at what we can control and I would ask all parties in the North to look at re-engaging on the North-South parliamentary forum, because I think that is a process within which we can pursue many of the worthy objectives towards which the delegation is aspiring.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As I missed the bulk of the conversation, I do not want to repeat what has been said.  I congratulate and commend the work of safefood in its intervention at school level.  This is all about a mindset.  Any organisation that can add value by getting people to question traditional mindsets is important.  The big question that must be asked is where our food comes from.  We all take it for granted and once it arrives on our plate we just accept it.  We do not know from where the chickens and vegetables we eat come.  Some 30 or 40 years ago people knew that because they grew their vegetables in their back gardens.  The question of where our food comes from must start in primary and second schools.  I am aware that the groups do that intervention work on a North-South basis and they must continue doing it.On occasion groups are criticised and sometimes questions are asked as to whether there is a need for them when certain work is being done at a health service level or by the Department of Education and Skills.  There is a need for groups to become more aggressive in challenging Departments on what they are doing.  We are examining proposals on the location of chip vans near secondary schools.  Groups have an opportunity to become more aggressive in challenging the mindset.  I am aware that a good deal of intervention work is being done at an educational level through the schools, but there is an opportunity in that regard.  We should not accept the status quo.  I agree with Deputy Luke ‘Ming’Flanagan.  Neither we nor the parents know from where the food served in hospitals comes.  Having spoken to her, I know it would not win a Darina Allen food award.  We should know from where the food served in Leinster House comes.  Any group which challenges the mindset in terms of from where our food comes is important.  I, therefore, wish the delegates well in their continued good work.  I suggest the group should be more aggressive and challenge people within Departments because that is where the real debate must start.
