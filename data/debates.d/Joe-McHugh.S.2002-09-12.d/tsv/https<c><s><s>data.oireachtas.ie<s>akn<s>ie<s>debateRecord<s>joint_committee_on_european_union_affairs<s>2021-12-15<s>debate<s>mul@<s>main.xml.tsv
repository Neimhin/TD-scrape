JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an chomhchoiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a fhearadh roimh an Uasal Hugo Sobral. I welcome Mr. Hugo Sobral, head of cabinet of the Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms, Ms Elisa Ferreira, to today's engagement concerning EU cohesion policy and Ireland. Before we begin, I have a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise to engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witnesses’ statements are potentially defamatory of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should also be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence that they give. Members are reminded of the longstanding parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I will ask any member participating by MS Teams prior to making his or her contribution to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I call Mr. Sobral to make his opening statement. He has the floor.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Sobral very much and I have two members indicating their wish to speak. I call Deputy Calleary followed by Deputy Howlin. Before I let them in I do not have a question but wish to make an observation. That has been as clear and as concise a contribution I have ever heard from anybody coming from anything to do with the European Union or the Commission. It was concise and clear in language that was non-jargon-like and was very refreshing. To hear language like we can "hit the ground running" in early 2022 and to looking at the PEACE PLUS campaign with a "grassroots approach" is the language that people are used to, even in respect of the midlands programme, together with his speaking of the PEACE PLUS programme starting on time in the first quarter of 2022. I wanted to say that and I am very grateful. Whether or not Mr. Sobral wrote it himself or his team helped him to do so, I wish to congratulate them and Mr. Sobral himself and no doubt the members will follow now in a similar vein with clear and concise observations and questions. I call Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is up to Mr. Sobral on what he wants to answer. He is here to speak about the specifics of his own role and competencies. I know that the issue of the visas is not within his remit. I will leave it up to him as to whether or not he would like to respond to that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I now call Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On that point, Mr. Sobral mentioned the European Court of Auditors and I have one question. With regard to the front-loading of the disbursement of 80% of the funding prior to the application deadline of September 2023, the Court of Auditors has raised concerns that this may lead to a situation where there are ineligible projects that get 80% funding and they will have to repay it. What is Mr. Sobral's take on that? Does he share those concerns of the Court of Auditors?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If there are no more questions, I take this opportunity to thank Mr. Sobral for his time and for his contribution, and also for his openness in regard to the questions raised by the members. I see that Deputy Ó Murchú has a further question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Sobral for his engagement with the committee and ask him to pass on our best wishes to Commissioner Ferreira. We look forward to receiving the information requested by Deputy Ó Murchú. Tá an cruinniú críochnaithe anois agus beidh an chéad chruinniú eile Dé Céadaoin, an 19 Eanáir ar 9.30 a.m. agus chífidh mé na comhaltaí ansin. I thank Mr. Sobral once again and wish him a nice Christmas and a happy new year.
