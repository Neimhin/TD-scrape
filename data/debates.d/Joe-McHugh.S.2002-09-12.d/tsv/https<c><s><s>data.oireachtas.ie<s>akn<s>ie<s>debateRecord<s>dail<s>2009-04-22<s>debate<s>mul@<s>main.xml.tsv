JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy McManus raised a very legitimate point regarding the fisheries (consolidation) Bill, for which we have been waiting four years.  In acknowledging the work of the former Minister of State, Deputy Se√°n Power, I realise he rolled up his sleeves and took the issue by the scruff of the neck.  We need a commitment that the issue will be progressed before June because if that does not happen, many people will not know where they stand.We have a crazy position currently where the Northern Regional Fisheries Board will not consult with the Donegal Game Angling Federation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a complete breakdown in communication which must be addressed.  The only way this can happen is to bring the Bill through Report and Final Stages.
