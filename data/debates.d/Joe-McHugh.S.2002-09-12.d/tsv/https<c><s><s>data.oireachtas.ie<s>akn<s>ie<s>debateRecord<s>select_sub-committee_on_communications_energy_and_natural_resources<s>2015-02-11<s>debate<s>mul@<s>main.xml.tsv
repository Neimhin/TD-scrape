JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as ucht an cuireadh chuig an gcruinniú seo.  The EPA-sponsored survey involves many stakeholders in Northern Ireland, as well as the Department. It is in the process of being carried out and due for publication, possibly in mid-2016. On the question of how much it will cost, we have in mind a figure in the order of €1 million. Importantly, the consultation process did not just consider the potential environmental health impact but also the human health impact. Many of the submissions received, including from Deputy Michael Colreavy's part of the world in counties Sligo, Leitrim and Cavan, asked for there to be someone on the group with a health competency. I am delighted that there is someone on it with that expertise, as the survey's two major pillars will be to consider the environmental and health impacts. Stemming from a number of public meetings that we held in Sligo last summer, I also asked for some feedback during the process, instead of having to wait two years for the results. I am delighted that there is a dedicated information-sharing website. We will be able to furnish the Deputy with the details. I am also hoping for a mid-term review to be carried out in whatever form in a couple of weeks time. Regarding petroleum, a number of initiatives are ongoing. The Department's expenditure is on promotion because we need to get companies interested. Thankfully, there is momentum within the industry, given the new Atlantic licensing round that will close in 2015. We will not be in a position to say how real the momentum is until the close of the round on the Atlantic margins, but the feedback from companies has been steady. After decades, there have only been four finds, but we must consider the geography of what is available to us. In a European perspective, Ireland is the fourth largest country if the undersea landmass off the south and south-west coasts is included. Ireland is larger than Germany, although not as large as Portugal, France and Spain. The Department is focusing a great deal of its energy on this front, particularly via the Geological Survey of Ireland and the INFOMAR project. The large amount of research involved is being undertaken at considerable expense. There is a partnership between the Government and industry, with the main tenets being transparency, openness and accountability, but the undersea landmass available to us has resource potential. Reverting to the contribution of unconventional systems of extraction and exploration on land and without undermining the independence of the EPA-sponsored analysis, we have a great deal of territory under the sea that can be explored. Obviously, it will depend on companies' exploratory finds. The Minister has specific responsibility for the Corrib field. I hope the first gas supply will start towards the end of the second quarter of this year. In terms of our reliance on fossil fuels, we import 100% of our oil and 95% of our gas. With the new Corrib gas supply coming on stream in mid-2015, we could meet as much as 42% of our own gas needs.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	But seeing as how I brought it up-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy will be aware, the steering committee is broad and extends North and South; therefore, Northern Ireland is represented. The committee is the mechanism by which the information is being gathered. The Northern Irish representatives will have the same access to information as their Southern counterparts during the process. North-South political mechanisms allow Ministers from both jurisdictions opportunities to examine genuine and single-tier North-South issues affecting Border areas.There is an opportunity for the North-South Ministerial Council to be kept informed throughout this process. It will also be an opportunity for politicians, both North and South, to actively engage during the process. Closer to home, as a former chairman, I think there are possibilities available through the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I have spoken to my colleague, Deputy Frank Feighan, about this. We have representation North and South, albeit reduced to one or two political parties. We do not have global political representation from the North. However, there is a conduit and a mechanism for North-South input. With an issue as important as fracking, we should use all the political mechanisms we have available to us. If Deputy Colreavy was to formally put it to his party colleagues to get in touch with Deputy Feighan, I have no doubt Deputy Feighan would be eager to help and assist in the matter. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. At the outset, I wish to acknowledge the role of the officials within my Department. They have been extremely proactive and this has been in response to the genuine proactivity at a local level. Local councillors, Deputies and the local community's swift response on the clams issue in Lanesborough has been positive and has helped the process. Do my section and Department have statutory functions with regard to moving forward the whole issue of the invasive species? No, they do not. However, with that in mind, I wish to acknowledge the efforts of my officials because they have responded to my request to show leadership and to take responsibility in terms of leading on this, which has happened. There was an agreement prior to Christmas. There have been EPA issues and there has been a lot of contact with Inland Waterways and the local authorities. There has been a whole mix of collaboration to try to get a pilot dredge and there was pressure on to do this before Christmas. We got agreement in principle before Christmas to do the dredge. The only thing holding this up at the moment is water levels. The advice is that to do it right the job should be done at lower water levels and we are following this advice. The pilot dredge has been agreed, but we are waiting on the water levels to move to a more satisfactory position in the interests of doing the job right rather than making a half-job of it. To reiterate, my officials in Inland Fisheries have been very proactive on this. It is an example of community engagement. There is a sense of frustration at a local level. There are fears at a local level also, which were taken into account. Can these invasive clams be eradicated fully? The advice I have been given is that they cannot, but we need to focus on containment and ensure that we dispose of them in a proper way. We need to ensure that we do not have fishermen using boats and gear that might transfer the clams to other areas. These are good-practice issues. We are working with Inland Waterways on these and the use of smaller boats and containment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have a number of views on eel fishing. As a person born in the north-west of Donegal and on the coast, I would not have had much familiarity with it before being appointed to this post. However, I have had quite a good briefing on the issue and I have learned a lot. We have had a number of delegations from people who fished eels in the past. There is a problem with stock levels. However, there is also a role for the ESB, which I have contacted formally. We need to sit down and examine how we can-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Exactly, and look at possibilities where we can have quick win solutions. There is a problem with the stocks and the life cycle. It is a long-term life cycle. We are also hearing reports of different examples, such as what is happening in Lough Neagh. We are examining other practices surrounding the fishing of eels. The eel fisherpeople would have been the custodians of the stock. I would like to see the custodians more involved in the consultation. There is an upcoming consultation, and I would not like it to be seen as a token gesture. A number of delegations have come forward with a number of good ideas. I would like to follow through on those.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Summer time.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy about the massive potential. Obviously, there are stocking challenges with brown trout and wild salmon and there are discussions and consultations taking place about management. We could have a very wide debate about the constraints and the challenges, be it pollution, cormorants or seals, but we have a difficulty in terms of stocks. At the same time there are very positive partnerships at community level. I will cite one, which the Deputy alluded to, on the River Lacken. There has been a great partnership project there between the local development company and the people. In fact, workers in the Tús programme came to work on the rehabilitation of spawning beds, looking at walkways and so forth. This work must come from the community. When I meet with members of the board of Inland Fisheries Ireland they talk about the pressures they are under in terms of fewer personnel, enforcement and being vigilant in monitoring, so the community, local angling clubs and the local groups in charge of the various rivers have a massive role in this regard. On the question of money going back to Europe, many of these funding applications are demand led at community level. We have a role to play through the new process under SICAP to encourage groups to get involved. Certainly, there is a role for the Department in facilitating that as much as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree. Nobody wishes to send money back. There was enthusiasm at the Inland Fisheries Ireland board meeting. Many of the members would have been practitioners down the years. There is potential and there are certain aims and objectives on which our Department can follow through. I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion regarding information sharing for creating awareness. Getting away from inland fisheries for a moment, even within the GSI section, where work is ongoing on the Tellus project, which is a mapping exercise looking at water tables and other information that will be shared with different local authorities, the EPA and so forth and on which an extra €3 million will be spent this year, there is a job to be done in terms of creating awareness. Although it is in the very early stages, in case the Secretary General and the Assistant Secretary General fall off their seats, we have just had a discussion on the possibility of bringing the work of the Department, be it on inland fisheries, GSI or in the petroleum division, to secondary schools to bring it to the attention of students.
