JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to be associated with the remarks of Senator Mansergh regarding voluntarism in the context of the coast and cliff rescue and emergency services. As an island nation we rely heavily on voluntarism.Senator Lydon and I raised the issue of roaming charges last week. I am delighted that after our strong representations O2 has decided to refund roaming fees charged over the past six months. Perhaps this will be the start of a more competitive operation between Vodafone and O2.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate Senator Lydon and, without being too smug, I congratulate myself as well.
