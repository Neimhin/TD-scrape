JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Haughey and Senator Keogan. We will now go into private session.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son a choiste ba mhaith liom fáilte a ghabháil roimh an Uasal Barbara Nolan agus Uasal Jonathan Claridge of the European Commission Representation in Ireland. Before beginning there are some housekeeping matters and the privilege notice. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does. Witnesses participating in this meeting from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. For people watching this meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to the constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making a contribution to the meeting, they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. If members are attending in the committee room, they are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. They are strongly advised to practise good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting. Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting. Masks should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking. I am sorry about that. Our time is nearly up at this stage, although we might have a few minutes left. I look forward to this presentation on the state of the Union in 2021. I invite Ms Nolan to open the proceedings.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le Ms Nolan. I will open it up now to the committee members. Deputy Richmond will be first, followed by Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The committee is taking a keen interest in that ongoing issue. We had a meeting about it this morning.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. Her intervention on that issue no doubt has a lot of support in rural parts of the country, not just in one sector of farming but across the board. I thank members for their questions, observations and input and thank Ms Nolan and Mr. Claridge for their participation. There is so much going on. We are all waiting with bated breath for what will come out this evening in relation to the Northern Ireland protocol, which is something in which this committee takes a keen interest. We are following that closely and we are also being proactive, meeting up with Vice-President Šefčovič in early December in Brussels. A date has been secured and we will work a programme around that. Any guidance or signposting the witnesses can give us for that trip would be most helpful. It is a very comprehensive programme and the clerk has been working on that already. The state of the Union address by Ursula von der Leyen focused a lot on health. We had a successful programme in the end with vaccination. There were initial concerns around the distribution of vaccines but that co-operation was positive. It is not new because the European mobility directive for health has been an important foundation for such co-operation. We can look at other ways to be proactive and creative in breaking down borders in terms of healthcare. This committee is keeping a close eye on the future of Europe. We are focused on what is going on in Poland and are looking at those areas specifically. It was good to see the Commissioner in Killybegs recently. Ms Nolan attended and would have picked up on a lot of frustration in the fishing industry. She would have been struck by the heightened level of frustration. It is a contradiction because while rules and regulations are controlled by our Government, they are often introduced against a backdrop of what the Commission says and proposes. A fundamental of the European project and the big principle of interest to many on this committee is the principle of subsidiarity. What more subsidiarity could one get than part-time farmers in south Donegal who will do part-time work in Killybegs for fishing vessels landing with mackerel? Because of the rules, in the last few days many of these boats are landing outside the EU. They are not landing in Killybegs and all that work is lost. If we are looking to build communities at a local level, we need to grapple with the tension that is there, where the fishing industry feels its Government is not representing it and the administrators or people involved at an official level in Government are constantly quoting stuff coming from the Commission.The rules that are in place are not workable for the fishing industry. Everything has to be done properly and people will point to this not being done in the past. The fishermen I deal with and the fishing vessel owners want to work within the rules but they have to work within something that is practicable and workable. I just wanted to mention that point and I am not expecting any feedback on it. I acknowledge the fact the Commissioner was in Killybegs in County Donegal because it is important for him to see and hear where the real tensions are. If any guidance or direction can be provided on that front, we would be open to hearing that.  Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe agus guím gach rath orthu. B'fhéidir go mbeimid le chéile in Brussels nó in Strasbourg i mí na Nollag. Táimid ag súil go mór leis sin.
