JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The delegation from the north west is most welcome and we look forward to discussing the work it is involved in on a cross-Border and pan-European basis with regard to advanced communications technology.  I welcome the representatives from the European Regions Network for the Application of Communications Technology, ERNACT, Mr. Colm McColgan, general manager, Councillor Gerard Diver, chairperson of Derry City Council, board member Councillor Rena Donaghey, Donegal County Council, board member and newly elected councillor of Donegal County Council, Niamh Kennedy, and board member Mr. Brian Boyle, Donegal County Council.  I have a good deal of knowledge about the group, having been a former chairperson, and I am familiar with its work.  This is a good opportunity to put the good work it has been involved in on the public record.  From the point of view of the committee, there might be opportunities to explore, in terms of assistance to different parts of the country, both north and south.  The organisation works to develop a number of digital projects and to secure EU funding.  We look forward to exploring with the delegation the importance of technology in driving economic development and supporting business and to discussing how the experience of other regions can be applied in the north west.  Before I call on the witnesses to make their introductory comments and presentation, I must warn them about privilege.  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Diver to begin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is that the INTERREG programme?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is helpful.  This is tangible and we will put it on the desks of people who need to look at this idea as a possibility.  We appreciate Mr. McColgan's presentation.  With the agreement of members, we will open up the discussion to allow them to make observations and ask questions.  We will have an interactive exchange.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take a number of participants before I call on Mr. McColgan to respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank  Deputy Pringle.  That is helpful in light of yesterday's announcement by the ESB and the connection with ESB International in the North.  It is something we can explore.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Seán Conlan wants to speak.  I will then call Deputy Thomas Pringle followed by Ms Rena Donaghey and Mr. Brian Boyle.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Thomas Pringle and then the panel.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Pringle.  I am conscious of the fact that Mr. McColgan has already indicated that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is supportive of the idea.  He also made the proposal that perhaps we should look at a pilot or one village or town that straddles both areas.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is only a suggestion but Senator Mary White has asked how we can help.  The job of this committee is to ensure that all the contributions are put on the desk of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on this side of the Border and then, obviously, there is a role for local authorities.  I call Ms Rena Donaghey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for interrupting, but I notice there are six pages remaining in the presentation.  Members have all received a copy and we can publish the document to our website.  Perhaps, in the interests of time, Mr. Caughey might summarise the position?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps members will now get involved with observations and questions.  Mr. Caughey is free to respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If Mr. Murphy is leaving those present will be delighted to take him up on his proposal.  I inform the committee that we are examining a broad spectrum of health matters, not just for one meeting but on an ongoing basis, including cross-Border out-of-hours GP services, cross-Border cardiology services and so on.  If a committee member can second Mr. Murphy's proposal we will include the issue of carers North and South in the wide-ranging report.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Our committee will be in touch with Mr. Murphy at a later date.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is this a personal matter?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is fair enough and I appreciate the intervention, enthusiasm and dedication of Ms Mulligan.  After this meeting we can pass this issue on to whoever is Minister for Health after next Tuesday.  We will also ensure Mr. Edwin Poots, MLA, of the Northern Ireland Assembly, is given a copy of proceedings here.  Ms Mulligan can take it she has the support of the committee on this.  The North-South Ministerial Council is next Thursday and we will raise this issue then also.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	CAWT has been before this committee previously.  We will write directly to CAWT to highlight that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are all focused on following up today because Senator Mary M. White was very insistent that this committee should not merely listen to presentations but should use the meetings as a vehicle to follow things up.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will make that point at the North-South Ministerial Council.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am glad we have gone off script and I thank Ms Doonan for expressing her views with such passion.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	One of the proposals made by our guests is to have the home recognised as a centre of care.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In the meantime this committee will look after the aims and objectives outlined by Ms Doonan.  I guarantee her that.  I do not know what will happen in the future.  I am conscious that Ms Van Aswegen has been waiting to contribute.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Van Aswegen.  The witnesses might be ahead of themselves.  Ms Van Aswegen might have her homework done.  The new round of INTERREG V has not been finalised yet but four themes emerge.  What I say must be taken with a pinch of salt, as matters will not be finalised until September but the four themes that emerge are first, health; second, research and innovation, including research, health and lifestyle; third, sustainable transport, and; fourth, the environment.  Assuming that this will be the final make-up of the four areas, Ms Van Aswegen might be on the right track.  I hope that is helpful.  The witnesses will watch the space closely in the coming months.  Are there other observations or questions?  We are coming near the conclusion of the meeting.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious that a vote has been called in the Dáil.  Deputy O'Reilly is going to do something he has never done before and make a contribution in 30 seconds.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We must conclude as a vote has been called in the Dáil.  We have made a number of commitments in terms of follow up.  I am conscious that it is not just a health issue but we will give the presentation to the Minister for Health south of the Border and for the information of the Northern Minister, Edwin Poots.  The mechanism that might be important is the North South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and we will use that opportunity.  Senator White will travel to Armagh next Thursday, and the witnesses can take it as read that she will ensure that this item is on the agenda for the joint secretariat.  Regarding the wide-ranging issues on health that are part of this committee, we are planning that at the moment and the witnesses can take it as read that their North-South carers issues will be incorporated into that.  To recap on INTERREG V, if they are the four emerging thematic areas it will be important to keep a close eye on them.  We said also that we would follow up on writing directly to the Co-operation and Working Together, CAWT.  I thank all the witnesses.  I thank also the people who may have wanted to make a contribution for their patience but Ms Doonan's passion and commitment to the cause was visible to all of us.  We appreciate her, and her colleagues both North and South, being here today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes, I know.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will end on that-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The meeting is adjourned until 10.15 a.m. on Thursday, 25 September 2014.
