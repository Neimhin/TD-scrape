JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I second the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on this very important issue. I agree with my colleague, Senator Bradford, in condemning outright the tinpot dictatorship that is the Saddam Hussein regime.A statement issued by the US National Security Council in 1999 states that the USA will continue to have a vital interest in ensuring access to foreign oil supplies. We must continue to be mindful of the need for regional stability and security in key producing areas to ensure access to and free flow of resources such as oil and gas. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to deduce that this is not just about oil or about Saddam Hussein but about a geopolitical necessity in the Middle East. It is a multi-faceted agenda on the part of the USA and western Europe, and the western world in general, in which we are all involved. Eighty per cent of known petroleum reserves are contained between the Persian Gulf, the Caspian Sea and the South China Sea. Everybody from the monkeys in the South China Sea to the dogs in Baghdad knows that this war is about ensuring the free flow of resources from this region. Afghanistan is now part of this US security policy, as is Iraq. Leverage will also be allowed towards Iran in the near future, allowing access to the Caspian Sea.President Bush is playing a very dangerous game when it comes to al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia. There is no logical link between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime. Al-Qaeda was born in the context of military operations by the USA in Saudi Arabia after 1991 and the presence of Crown Prince Abdullah. There is growing concern about anti-Americanism in Saudi Arabia. This has helped contribute to the US's reasons for wanting to establish a more strategic presence in Iraq.I will not point fingers at anybody. We are all involved in this because of our over-reliance on expendable natural resources. I do not want to come across as a self-righteous person saying we must all cut back on oil and resources, but that is the reality. According to the statistics, by 2050 there will be 13 billion people living on this planet, a rise from today's six billion. Two thirds of known petroleum reserves will be used up in the next 20 years. We cannot sustain our present use of oil or gas. This is a major issue and I know this is not the time to deal with it. However, it is important that we look for alternative means of providing energy. If we do not, there will always be conflict and fighting for resources in the Middle East. It is not about land or imperialism but resources.The amendments deal with the use of Shannon and what is going on here and now. The Government has sanctioned the use of Irish airspace and of Shannon Airport by the US. I am in total disagreement with this decision on the grounds that we did not get international sanctioning from the UN. Article 29 of our own Constitution states that we must explore all avenues of arbitration, on the grounds of international justice and morality, before we engage or participate in any form of war. We are contributing to and participating in this war and in doing so are going against the United Nations resolution.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	This opens a wider debate on neutrality. With respect, I listened to Senator Minihan's argument.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	He did, at the beginning.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	This is no longer a neutral country, as Senator Mooney pointed out. He has gone on the record as saying that it was never a neutral country. It is now open to debate—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	Will I get extra time for this?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	The issue of neutrality must be put on the agenda as a matter of importance because this is no longer a neutral country and it is actually participating in a war. This is a change of rules. It is like playing a football match in which the referee decides at half time to do away with the offside rule. It is a complete turnaround.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	Ireland is part of the United Nations and we use it as an umbrella organisation in terms of our participation in or contribution to military action.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	The interruptions are outrageous.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	We all have a part to play in this—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	—and everybody is entitled to his or her opinion. As Senator Ó Murchú said, we should listen to everybody. I would appreciate if my opinion were respected also.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	If we want to continue to use the United Nations as an international body – if we want to be part of it, to contribute to it and to have faith and confidence in it – we cannot attack or go against it. We should not participate in international affairs that are not sanctioned by the UN. The Fine Gael Party has trouble with recent events because it called for a new UN resolution, but no agreement was reached in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I will finish my point after the suspension.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. I also welcome this second opportunity to speak on this very relevant issue.We firmly believe that if the UN was given more time the Iraqi crisis could have been resolved without recourse to war. There are senior European Union diplomats from all bar two countries who hold a similar opinion. If the United Nations arms inspectors were given more time we would be in a better position to make a calculated judgment in regard to a war in Iraq. It is not too much to ask for time. I cannot comprehend the sense of urgency which necessitated an attack on Iraq in advance of the completion of the report of the arms inspectors. They were prevented from making a calculated estimation of the actual weapons potential in Iraq based on their judgment of what they witnessed there.As I said previously, this opens up a whole plethora of issues in regard to our neutrality but also in connection with the matter of a common European defence policy. This should be put on the table as quickly as possible. Such a debate could be initiated in this House.It is not a question of being pro or anti-American. There is no question that the US and Britain are our natural allies. The Fine Gael Party has always held that view and will continue to do so. It is not a case of our being aligned on one side or the other in this conflict – our bottom line is that more time should have been allocated to finding a resolution prior to resorting to war. I acknowledge the contribution of the United States and Britain in terms of our economy. People will put economic hypotheses forward in this regard, no more so than the potential gains accrued by us through Shannon Airport. We are not pressing this argument; we just wanted to see what the UN arms inspectors would come up with and we also wanted to have a mandate for a second resolution. This did not happen and that is why we have a problem.
