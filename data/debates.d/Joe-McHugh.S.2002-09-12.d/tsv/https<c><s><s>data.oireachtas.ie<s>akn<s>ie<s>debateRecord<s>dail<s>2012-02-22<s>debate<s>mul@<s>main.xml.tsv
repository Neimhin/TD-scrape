JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I wish to commend the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains on the work it has been doing.  It has had a number of specific successes but a total of seven bodies have not been found.  These are the bodies of people who were callously murdered by different paramilitary organisations.I wish to outline the reason why I raise this matter.  Time is running out for many of the families which have an expectation of locating the remains of their loved ones.  It is my intention to create an awareness of this issue and to send out a strong message to those who are in possession of information or who have access to such information.  These individuals they should search their consciences in the context of deciding whether they should make this information available.I want to place this matter in context.  I live on the coast of Donegal and a large number of people in my constituency are involved in the fishing industry.  During my lifetime, many individuals involved in that industry have tragically been lost at sea.  The consolation to people who live in fishing communities comes when the body of someone who has been lost is recovered.  That is a powerful consolation.  I recall attending a wake on one occasion at which a grandmother repeatedly stated "At least we found the body, there is consolation in that".  The position is no different for those who ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago lost loved ones as a result of the Troubles.  They know that their sons' or daughters' bodies are buried in the ground somewhere but they are not aware of the specific location.  However, they do not know whether they will ever find their loved ones during their own lifetimes.  In that context, I call on those with information to consult their consciences in respect of this matter and to take action in order to ensure that the people who have been trying to locate the bodies to which I refer will have some peace.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister said everything that needs to be said.  I echo his call that information be provided.  We must send out a strong signal on the importance of this matter to the families.  Unfortunately we may not have success for all seven families, but even a percentage increase would be significant.  I echo the Minister's comments and concur with him on the efforts of everybody in the commission.  It is a question of conscience.  People will be grappling with their consciences in bed at night.  That is the time to think about it and I ask them to do so.  Everything will be treated in the strictest confidence, as the Minister outlined.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In a way, I admire what Fianna Fáil is trying to do.  Moreover, it is not simply trying to do this at national level, because it also is so engaged at county and town council levels.  It is attempting to disassociate the past from the present.  That is fair enough and is an admirable thing to do but unfortunately, the past always is a significant factorial of the present.  This is the case on an individual basis in one's own life when one looks back on the past and considers how it shapes one's future.  Unfortunately, I refer to the components and factorials of the past in respect of the input of Fianna Fáil's boss man, Deputy Martin, who, as Minister between 2000 and 2004, spent €16 million on reports while creating the HSE.  More ironically, in 2000 he spent €600,000 on a value for money audit while creating the culture of the HSE monster that is alive and present in the world in which Members now live.  As Deputy Hannigan noted, it will take a long time to sort it out.As recently as last Friday, the HSE met in Galway to discuss the service plan for the HSE est region-----

After two hours of that meeting had elapsed, a Fianna Fáil participant made a sensible suggestion.  He advocated that participants should break up into groups based on significant geographical parts to discuss the issues which were relevant to their respective areas.  It was a sensible suggestion which basically was reminiscent of the old health boards in which there was local autonomy, local responsibility and local power over decision-making.  All that was taken away from the people with the creation of the HSE monster.  That is the real and present danger the Government has inherited from Fianna Fáil's past in power and its contribution.  I stated that I admire what it is trying to do, which is to create complete amnesia and to suggest the past does not relate to the present.  However, the unfortunate reality is that it does.
