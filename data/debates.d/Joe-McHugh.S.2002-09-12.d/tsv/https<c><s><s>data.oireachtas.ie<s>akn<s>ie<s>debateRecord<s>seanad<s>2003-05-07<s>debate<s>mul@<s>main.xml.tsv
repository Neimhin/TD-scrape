JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	First, I apologise for Senator Feighan's absence. He wanted to lead on this issue tonight as it falls within his brief. I congratulate the Labour Party on bringing forward this motion.On smoking, there is no distinction between the types of substances smoked. I was in England a week ago where the major trend seems to be in the direction of smoking cannabis. Perhaps it has not hit here to the same extent, or perhaps it has. I am not aware of it because I am not a smoker. However, I would like to indicate my viewpoint briefly. At the weekend I was in a quaint bar in my area. There is a small light that comes down over the bar counter. At one stage towards the end of the night as I watched the smoke rise above it there was an old guy drinking his bottle of stout and a half one and smoking a pipe. I do not think my vison was blurred but it would have made the most romantic photograph – if that is the right word – or snapshot. It was idyllic and romantic.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have to look at the major reports and the push being made by the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation and be realistic, not romantic, in our notion of smoking in bars. I say this without being in any way self-righteous about the matter because I do not smoke. While smokers should have choice – I do not want this to sound like a cliché – they do impinge on others if they are in a closed environment without proper ventilation. Research has proved that passive smokers suffer as a result of inhalation. I am, therefore, definitely in favour of the legislation to come through in January 2004 and commend the Minister for State on bringing it forward. I hope he keeps the momentum going because I have taken soundings from bar staff in my area and those who do not smoke find that their physical well-being suffers as a result of being behind the bar when there are smokers present. There is a percentage of those who go to discos who do not smoke but when they have a few drinks, they make a habit of taking cigarettes from smokers. I include myself in that group. I do not smoke but when I get to a disco, I might occasionally have a cigarette. The new legislation might curtail this habit.I would like to expand a little on drinking because there are two large issues before us today and time does not afford us an opportunity to go into both of them now. I notice that the two Labour Party speakers spoke mainly about the smoking issue but in the time remaining to me I would like to make a few comments on drinking. We have to start with the premise that Irish people love to drink. At times we seem to take pride in this fact. I recall that during the World Cup match in Orlando in which we were competing with the Dutch we were proud of the fact that we could drink more than them, party longer and wake up earlier to start drinking again. I say this without being self-righteous because I take a drink and enjoy a pint, perhaps too much at times.Last weekend when I spent time with my two younger brothers, one aged 24 years and the other 26, I was introduced to their world of drinking. It is a very disciplined lifestyle. They do not drink from Sunday to Thursday. They only drink on Friday and Saturday. As last weekend was a bank holiday weekend, they drank on Saturday and Sunday. The general trend among the younger age group – this is not a generalisation because it is evident from talking to parents – is that there is a drinking indulgence which is expressed in jargon like, "to go flat out for the weekend". On Saturday when I asked one young man whether he was going out on Sunday again, he said, in jest, "I am going to go at it tomorrow like a day's work." I found that remark quite funny but humour apart, he was honest about his drinking. He was going to get his burger and chips at 4 a.m., have a good rest and be up and at it again at 11 a.m. or 12 noon the next day. I, therefore, agree with the part of the motion which relates to advertising. Whatever we can do we must do. As legislators, we have to try everything to tackle the drinking crisis because comments such as these are the language used in peer groups of young men. It is probably not dissimilar in groups of young women but I am reflecting what a young male in his early 20s said to me.The social trend has to be examined. We have to look at it in a very critical light and be proactive. We have to be creative in our thinking and while it may sound contradictory, if imposing regulations is creative thinking, let us do it. Let us be self-righteous about it. My party colleague, Deputy Deasy, has taken a lot of criticism but he has done his homework and researched the issue as it affects young men, in respect of whom there is a trend, an association between suicide and drink. If necessary, as legislators, we will have to make hard decisions. I am in total agreement with the motion.Sometimes we have to look at the issue in a holistic way. Every time I mention mental health I commend the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, who has been proactive in his movements. Many young men are coming into the psychiatric unit at the hospital in Letterkenny and the language being used is that they are cracking up or depressed but much of the problem relates to drink. The onus is on us, as legislators. We have a massive task ahead of us. A cultural change is required. I am fully behind the Labour Party in relation to the motion. It marks a start on the mountain we have to climb.
