JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I dtús báire, gabhaim mo chomhghairdeas leis an gCathaoirleach faoina cheapachán úr agus guím ádh mór air amach anseo agus ar bhaill an choiste fosta. Guím gach rath orthu go léir leis an obair thábhachtach atá romhainn. Chomh maith leis sin, ba mhaith liom aitheantas a thabhairt d'iar-oifigigh mo chuidse i Roinn na Gaeltachta. In 2014 nuair a tháinig an crú ar an tairne bhí siadsan ann agus is mór an tacaíocht agus an cuidiú a bhfuair mé uathu ag an am. The Chairman is conscious of the fact, as am I, that Ministers come and go, so I wanted to publicly acknowledge my appreciation to my former team in the Department of the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and to let this committee know that use of the Irish language will continue in this Department. I have a meeting today with the coiste Gaeilge in the Department. If the Chairman has any
ideas around how we can network and link in with our global diaspora or global networks in respect of the promotion of the Irish language, we will be all ears. I further add that since coming into this Department, I have been welcomed in a very positive way and am really looking forward to working with a positive and strong team. I welcome the opportunity to present the 2016 Revised Estimate for Vote 27 - International Co-operation and to briefly outline our plans for the coming year. As the new Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development, I look forward to a constructive engagement today and throughout my term as Minister with responsibility for Ireland's development programme. I repeat that my officials and I are available to the committee at all times and I hope it will have an early opportunity to visit the aid programme to see and assess its impact for itself. As the committee is aware, Vote 27 - International Co-operation funds approximately 80% of Ireland's official development assistance programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid. The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high-level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, securer and sustainable world. For 2016, the Government has provided a total budget of €641 million, which is an increase of €40 million or almost 7% on the 2015 allocation.This is the first substantive increase in the aid budget in seven years and is a clear indication of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme. Of this total, €483 million is managed by my Department under Vote 27 - International Co-operation, while the remaining €155 million is made up of contributions by other Departments and Ireland’s share of the EU Development Co-operation budget. The Government is committed to the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance, ODA. Our programme for Government reiterates this position and states that we will make progress towards the target as resources permit. As the economic recovery consolidates, we have begun to start delivering on this commitment. Our ambition is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN 0.7% target by 2030, the timeframe for the sustainable development goals. At this stage, we estimate the 2016 allocation will deliver an ODA-GNP percentage of 0.36%. However, the final statistic, which is heavily dependent on GNP, will not be available until next spring. Ireland’s aid programme is strongly focused on the fight against poverty and hunger in the world. More than 80% of our funding is provided in sub-Saharan Africa, where the needs are greatest. Seven of our eight key partner countries are in Africa, the eighth being Vietnam. We are working this year to address the immediate needs arising from the unprecedented level of humanitarian crisis in the Middle East and Africa, while strengthening the resilience of our partners through our long-term development programme. This is a difficult balance, given the scale of immediate need, but it is a vital one if we are to assist in averting future crises as a result of conflict, underdevelopment, inequality and climate change. It is essential that we frame our work in the context of the new sustainable development goals, adopted by world leaders at the UN last September, which provide a new agenda for global development up to 2030. The scale of the humanitarian crisis facing the world was captured by the UNHCR this week. There are now 65.3 million people worldwide displaced from their homes as refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers. The number, scale and intensity of emergencies continue to increase and the humanitarian system is struggling to cope. In the past decade, the number of people who need humanitarian assistance has increased by 237%. Since 2004, humanitarian funding requirements have increased by 490%. Ireland's humanitarian assistance in 2016 will total approximately €150 million, representing a sizable scaling up on previous years. Our support is focused on responding to meeting the acute needs of people affected by ongoing complex conflict crises in Syria and its neighbouring countries, South Sudan and the Horn of Africa and the Sahel region. Ireland is also responding to food insecurity and acute malnutrition arising from the impact of the El Niño weather effect throughout Africa and to crises which receive less media attention such as those in Somalia, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last month, I represented the Government at the first ever world humanitarian summit in Istanbul. At that summit, Ireland made a number of specific commitments which we are now taking forward. These include an increased focus on the needs of displaced communities, more efficient and predictable provision of humanitarian funding and greater coherence between our development and humanitarian funding. Over the coming weeks, I plan to visit Uganda to launch our new five year development programme, which is strongly focused on education and some of the poorest communities in the country. I look forward to meeting with our NGO partners, which are so critical to the delivery of Ireland’s development and humanitarian programmes and to our policy engagement internationally. I will also be engaging with our key UN partners as we follow up on my initial meetings at the summit in Istanbul and prepare for the migration summit in New York on 19 September. We provide targeted core support to a number of key UN partners and other international organisations, whose priorities and policies fit well with ours and who have a proven track record of delivery. These voluntary contributions allow Ireland to participate in development co-operation at a global level in key areas of need and in countries outside our bilateral programme. Our development co-operation is at the heart of Ireland’s foreign policy. Our key objective for 2016 is to continue delivering a world class programme which is aimed at some of the world’s most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives and building livelihoods.We appreciate the continued strong support and engagement of the committee in this regard. I would welcome comments and questions from members.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is encouraging that there is a good deal of experience here in that some members were on the previous foreign affairs committee and I can sense that there will be an ongoing engagement on these major challenges. The Chairman quoted Pope Francis, who referred to food and emergency services not being met because the people needing them were living in war zones or for various other reasons. That is an issue, but I put a challenge to the Chairman and the members. We have to look at our own set-up in terms of the peace process. The Chairman was very involved in the Good Friday Agreement committee and perhaps we have story to share in terms of bringing communities together.I met a priest recently, Fr. Padraig Devine, a Roscommon man based in Nairobi, who is very much focused on conflict resolution in war zones. He sees no point in building schools and hospitals if the conflict cannot be sorted out. He could be an interesting participant in this committee and the Chairman might get a chance to contact him at some stage. The organisation is Shalom. I had not heard of it until I met Fr. Devine a few weeks ago. He has something significant to contribute that might help the members in their engagement. We have a role to play. We can enlist the support of the International Criminal Court where there are examples of genocide, rape and so on to ensure that aid gets to the most vulnerable. The members will be aware that there is a conflict resolution unit in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and I met with the staff in the past two weeks. There is an opportunity for this committee also to engage with that unit. I was asked if we envisaged the designation of a new key partner country in the near future. We do not. We have eight key partners, seven of which are in sub-Saharan Africa where there is a strong strategic commitment to long-term assistance. I refer to Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and Sierra Leone. Outside that continent, there is also Vietnam. That is not to say there is no engagement on funding with other countries. Obviously, events bring change. El Niño brought devastating consequences to southern African and it is affecting food supplies. The cost of food in places like Lesotho is having a major impact. Deputy O'Brien raised again the EU-Turkey refugee facility, which he raised with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, who said he would note that. It was agreed by the European Council to fund services for Syrian refugees in Turkey. The specific commitment given was that it was for services for Syrian refugees. I am aware of a committee that will work in tandem with the decision that has been made and if this committee has reservations, there might be an opportunity for it and our Government to let those be known because it was not specifically about border enhancement; it was about services for refugees. In terms of the funding, the Deputy is correct that it is €22 million over four years, including €5 million from Vote 27 in 2016. We engage, through our officials in Brussels, on the management of funding under the new Turkey refugee facility and no doubt the Deputy will continue to engage with this committee on that. We note his concerns, which he outlined clearly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy also mentioned the percentage of GDP. The Deputy is right. He does not need me to explain that with the GNP widening, and even though we got an extra €40 million for this year, the percentage is not moving.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We can have a timeframe built in until 2030 but we can examine the issue in a comprehensive way and if that means having a multi-annual budget in a two to three year or four year time period, that is a worthwhile suggestion. The very difficult times since 2011 must be noted. When I first heard the figure I had to ask if it was right. We invested €3.8 billion since 2011. That is a massive injection when we consider the need this year for the humanitarian interventions is for $20 billion just to deal with the crisis this year. That is a significant contribution. While taxpayers here were going through a very difficult time, they were still contributing to the global needs in terms of the humanitarian crisis. That has to be noted. I have a note on the reconstruction of Gaza.In response to the humanitarian situation, Ireland has provided €2.5 million to the emergency appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees. This support has helped to provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families. A further €500,000 was recently approved by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, for the Gaza emergency appeal and will fulfil the pledge of €2.5 million made by Ireland at the international Gaza restructuring conference in October 2014. This will bring the total contribution to the 2014 Gaza crisis to €3 million. As a new Minister of State, I will be relying a lot on Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's experience of Africa. I have never been there but I am really looking forward to going in two weeks' time. I had a great opportunity at the Ireland-Africa forum to meet many people from the continent. As the Lesotho ambassador pointed out, the forum had the biggest representation from Africa in five years, so something good is happening in that partnership and it needs to continue. The Deputy also mentioned the green climate fund, for which €2 million has been provided through the Department of Finance. In the context of our commitment to overseas aid, we will work together on the question of the amount as a percentage of gross national income. The embassy in Lesotho was closed on 31 October 2014 following the reappraisal of Ireland's wider diplomatic network and the need to make the most effective use of limited resources, as the Deputy will know. I was in the constituency of Deputy Darragh O'Brien on Tuesday and saw a very interesting project at Portmarnock community school. The ambassador of Lesotho was there. People looking for a confidence-building exercise in addressing global problems will see it there as it is a very practical initiative. The council has been engaged and young people in the school are developing apps. They are looking at mapping a country that is a long way away from us. A lot of it is done remotely - they do not have to get on a plane but can do it using the ICT mechanisms we have. It is a very interesting project and is an example of the voluntary work and practical measures that are being taken outside our financial commitments. Teagasc is involved in partnership exercises relating to food. Africa can supply enough food to feed the world, not just Africa, and all of these measures can help. The Deputy also asked about untied aid, and we will remain committed to that. Deputy Durkan stressed the importance of meeting local parliamentarians. Tax issues were raised, and there are many areas on which we need to work at a global level, such as in the UN and the EU institutions. There are, however, practical measures we can take. I saw some statistics recently about the provision of radiotherapy services, chemotherapy and smear testing, and these are areas on which we can work closely. I would be very happy to support any practical measures suggested by committee members. The ratification of EU economic partnership agreements, EPAs, was also mentioned. Since the conclusion in 2014 of three EPAs with west Africa, the east African community and the southern African development community, the EU and its member states have been working with 27 African countries to achieve ratification by 1 October. Ireland has played its part in this process, signing the west African EPA in December 2014, which was approved by the Dáil last November. The southern African development community EPA was signed on 10 June in Botswana, and EU member states signed the east African community EPA on 20 June. Discussions are ongoing on a date for the formal signature ceremony in east Africa.The Department has to look at a regional approach to this and measures are in place in this respect. If Deputies need any further information on this we can certainly supply it. Deputy McLoughlin asked about decreases in Vote 27 relating to consultancy services and certain administrative services. The major need is for a follow-up to humanitarian crises and the peace and stability fund is up by 27%, while the rapid response fund is up 100% and recovery assistance is up by €5.3 million. The big measures involve dealing with a situation at a given time, such as have arisen owing to 65 million people being displaced because of conflict in vulnerable countries, such as South Sudan and Yemen, and devastating climatic issues arising from El Niño in southern Africa which are outside our control. The Department has great capacity in the shape of its relationship with its partner aid organisations which, as members have said, have done tremendous work and we will continue that work. Deputy Grealish asked about missionaries. I did some research into a certain missionary who left Bangor and ended up in Bobbio in Italy in 516 AD, his name Columbanus, and his work can be seen in France and Austria. This is in our nature and is part of who we are. We like to give, to travel and to help people in need and the Deputy is absolutely correct about the doors this activity opens, something which is also evidenced by our nuns and priests who went abroad. It is important to point out that €15.5 million has gone to Misean Cara, an organisation which does great work in health intervention and education. I was also asked about auditing. We have an evaluation audit unit in the Department which is independent and reports to the Secretary General. It is important that it is independent and robust so that we ensure taxpayers' money is spent wisely. Deputy Durkan said it was important to see for oneself what the situation was in certain areas. He referenced Turkey and has concerns in this area. He made the point that time was not on our side and suggested that, while 2030 might seem a long way away, it is only 14 years. It was 14 years ago that I was elected to the Seanad but it feels like yesterday and 14 years fly by. Time is not on our side and we have serious problems. The agreed sustainable development goals, SDGs, were led by Ireland and co-facilitated by the Kenyan Government to implement the practical measures required. I asked Charles Boamah of the African Development Bank for his perspective on the 700 people from Syria who died in the Mediterranean. He told a story about a man he met who survived the crossing. He asked him why he had risked his life and the gentleman replied that he did not risk his life - he was already dead. I think everybody in this committee gets that. I think everybody in this country, from primary schools to secondary schools, gets it too.A school in Skibbereen, Kilcoe national school, came up with a great project which won the national competition. The project was called "There is No Planet B". Irish people get it both at home and abroad. There is a duty on all of us to address the issues. I look forward to working with the committee. I will report back from my trip to Uganda. I hope the committee will stay in touch. The officials want to work with members also because they know the 14 years until 2030 is a small chunk of time in which to anticipate a population growth of up to 9 billion. I wish you well in your deliberations, Chairman. I know your heart is in the right place and that we can continue this engagement.
