JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that.Perhaps I am being parochial, but one of the first slides shows Errigal mountain with the name "Ó Gallachóir" beside it. Perhaps Dr. ÓGallachóir has a link with County Donegal, although his accent does not suggest this.As regards the technology required for wave energy, I do not know how it operates. There have been difficulties in County Donegal in getting planning permission for wind turbines. There has been trouble, although there have been positive developments in terms of the use of wind turbines.Would an issue arise in terms of the technology used to produce wave energy? Dr. Ó Gallachóir has outlined the economic benefits of wave energy. However, would it have an environmental impact on our beaches? Is it necessary for wave energy devices to be located on beaches? I ask Dr. Ó Gallachóir to outline the practicalities and the technological requirements in respect of wave energy. I notice from the submission that we are in a K4 region. Are there differences among various areas of the country? Would the Donegal coast, for example, have better potential than other parts of the country?
