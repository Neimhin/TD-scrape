JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh Tony Murphy, Uachtarán an European Court of Auditors. Chomh maith leis sin, déanaim comhghairdeas leis as a cheapachán. Nuair a tháinig an nuacht amach bhíomar iontach sásta leis. Guím ádh mór air ar a aistear amach anseo. Chomh maith le Tony, cuirim fáilte roimh Brian Murphy agus Niamh Mahon. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. I call Mr. Murphy to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask Mr. Murphy to elaborate on that nice word from Brussels.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is as if it is something that is just spent.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I do not want to open up a debate but I would like to flag something. Is the asylum seeker piece here separate to the moneys being spent on humanitarian efforts for Ukrainians?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will come back to that. I just wanted to clarify.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Murphy. There is a lot of information in his presentation that the members and I are trying to digest. There are different rabbit holes we would like to go down. I appreciate the comprehensive presentation he gave. We will begin the discussion with Deputy Ó Murchú followed by Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Will members and witnesses check their systems? There seems to be some feedback.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I have a few questions. Some of the members may like to come in as well. I thank Mr. Murphy for his contribution. The perception of auditors and accountants is that they look at and stick to the numbers. Now that he has anointed himself as an ambassador for all things, I will try to tempt him to get into crystal ball territory, although I know this will be difficult as well. I ask these questions against the backdrop of the energy crisis, unemployment risk, the post-pandemic situation, Russia's aggression and ongoing Brexit fallout. On the budgetary risks within the EU, and I am picking out several figures from the material I have, contingent liabilities have increased by 111% in 2021. We are moving into speculative territory regarding 2022 when we look at the 2021 report, but, for example, Ukraine, even before the war, having had outstanding loans with a nominal value of €4.7 billion, along with an EIB grant to the value of €2.1 billion. This was supported by an EU guarantee. This contingency risk also includes two other figures. The Support to Mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency, SURE, scheme, amounts to €50.2 billion. I refer as well to the bonds in the context of Next Generation EU, NGEU, support in response to the pandemic as well. All these inherent risks exist. Where does Mr. Murphy see the main risks coming from in future, at a finance level, without going into the reasons? I am thinking of our national situation, where we are dealing with an ongoing asylum issue as part of the response to the situation in Ukraine. People in my constituency are asking who is paying for this. I ask him to give us a wee bit of clarity around the contingency risks in this context. I am conscious as well that we are now a net contributor to the EU budget and, ultimately, we could all end up paying for many things. I would like his opinion concerning all these areas and then I will have a final question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Murphy. Regarding migration and border management, he highlighted some concerns around that fund. Was this a general concern for all member states or was there something specific about Ireland in this regard? I refer to the figure of €3.2 billion.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is Mr. Murphy allowed to go into the detail?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay. That is the asylum issue. The asylum and humanitarian response are happening side-by-side. While this procurement issue is being investigated, is there also a focus on a humanitarian response?I appreciate that in terms of the humanitarian response to Ukraine, citizens arrive in Citywest and things need to be done quickly. Is the same scrutiny being given to the procurement process for the humanitarian response as is being given to the asylum response?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	This is an area in which we can learn much. We only have to look across to the situation in the UK, which could be seen as an example of what not to do in certain areas. Even in my own parish, last Monday night, 15 coaches arrived that included eight young Ukrainian lads as part of a larger group. There is still goodwill and a willingness to do the right thing. However, there are many things we could do better in terms of involving communities at an earlier stage. If we were to do that, we could have an even bigger response. Invariably, what happens is that there are pressure points, with population buildup in one particular community, which leads to a narrative around pressure on school places and all of that. Communities know best how to handle their own responses, which is what is happening in a good way all over the country. I realise it is about numbers and the need for an immediate response to the emergency. However, I would appreciate if there were some way of feeding back that message about learning lessons from other countries. As Chairman of this committee, I cannot speak on behalf of the country but I certainly can see the value of that approach in my community in terms of people wanting to respond in a positive way. There is no reference to the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, in Mr. Murphy's submission but there is a nice photograph of roads, which I was excited to see. Deputy Howlin does not have to worry about these things any more in the south east, where there are many great roads. However, my colleague, Deputy Harkin, and I live in the north west. Delivery of the TEN-T is not specifically relevant on the way up to Sligo but for the twin towns bypass on the Letterkenny-Lifford Road linking into the A5, these are game-changing moments. From an accountancy point of view, we are talking about Ireland being a contributor to the EU. The north west has massive potential to become a net contributor to the overall economy in this country but one of the big obstacles is road infrastructure. All of the due diligence and the preparatory, investigative and exploratory work in preparing for TEN-T has been done. All those boxes have been ticked. Is the EU still committed to developing the regions that still need to be developed, particularly in terms of roads policy? We have a whole new green agenda, which is right. It is good to have public transportation but for a place like the north west, where we do not have rail services or alternatives, the road is the only option for us at the moment. Is the commitment to connectivity through TEN-T projects still there? I realise this is a specific area and Mr. Murphy may not want to get into it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In fairness, the project is prioritised at a national level and, all going well, it will be the next one on the list. However, it would be good to have assurance there is still a commitment at EU level to roads policy, especially in areas in which there is very poor connectivity.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In the past, some very clever and astute civil servants looked at the delivery of Belfast-Cork cross-Border infrastructure and a lot of money went into Dublin-Cork projects. Deputy Harkin will know about this from her time in the European Parliament. There is a great opportunity, especially at a time when Brexit has done so much damage to the peace process, to look at those acute corridors right on the Border and to show communities there is a dividend from the peace process and that, ultimately, the European project is about peace. That was the genesis of it. I thank Mr. Murphy for his responses.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On that note, gabhaim buíochas le Tony Murphy as an phlé, as an chaint phoiblí agus as an eolas agus sonraí cuimsitheacha agus suntasacha. I thank Mr. Murphy who has given us a lot of information. I thank his colleagues for attending as well. As always, we appreciate the time they have given us. We wish Mr. Murphy well in his new role. I recall an MEP, whom I will not name, in congratulating him saying, "It was great to see a man from a working-class background with no political associations". Mr. Murphy has worked hard over the years and he is a great ambassador not only for the EU but also this country. We thank him for everything.
