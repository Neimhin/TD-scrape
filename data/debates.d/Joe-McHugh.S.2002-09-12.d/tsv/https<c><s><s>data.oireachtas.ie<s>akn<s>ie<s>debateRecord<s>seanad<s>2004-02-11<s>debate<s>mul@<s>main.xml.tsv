JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Such a wholesome town.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate Senator Wilson on his passionate contribution. Maybe he should stay away from scripted speeches because, when he does, he offers more colour to the debate.I want to be equally parochial out of the sheer jealousy of County Cavan getting the headquarters of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, I wish to be constructive in my contribution. Letterkenny is a gateway town, setting itself up as a centre of excellence — departmental officials should take note — in IT. Three years ago, the Taoiseach said that of all the local authorities, Donegal County Council is the front runner for IT development, which is the result of the ERNACT committee and the cross-Border link between Derry and Letterkenny. Derry has already been highlighted in our gateway status.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are trying to build critical mass for IT infrastructure. We already have the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, which is a very good centre. Another 830 jobs out of the 1,300 are to be located and I am telling theMinister for Finance that Letterkenny is the key town. It is a gateway and we want to take the spatial strategy seriously, but like the Chelsea football team, it is great only on paper.
