JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his kind words. I look forward to working with him and with the Minister and departmental officials. The Deputy's question is a broad one and my response reflects that. If there is a specific issue the Deputy wishes to raise, I will be happy to address it in my supplementary reply. Drilling is a normal part of mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and is comprehensively regulated under the authorisation rules of the Department and of other regulatory regimes. Landownersâ€™ interests are fully recognised and protected through statutory notification and public consultation processes afforded by the relevant licensing regime, the statutory planning process and the integrated pollution prevention control licensing regime, as appropriate. Entry onto land is subject to landowner agreement. There are also provisions for the reinstatement of lands and the payment of compensation to affected landowners in specified circumstances. In terms of the impacts of exploration and drilling for minerals on land, it should be recognised that drilling small diameter bore holes to obtain basic geological information does not cause significant impacts. In the case of mining operations, works may be several hundred metres below the surface of the land. When damage or a nuisance is caused under authorisations, there is a requirement under the statute to pay compensation for such damage or nuisance to affected parties.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As already stated, the Deputy's initial question was general in nature and referred to subterranean drilling. Obviously, the latter encompasses mining. I asked him to pose a specific question following my reply and he has done so by focusing on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of rock formations. There is no plan at present to allow hydraulic fracturing to take place. Both of our predecessors in the Department, Deputies O'Dowd and Rabbitte, consistently stated that it is not proposed to consider applications for authorisations involving the use of hydraulic fracturing to take place until research the Environmental Protection Agency is carrying out into the potential environmental impact of this process has been completed and considered. It is important to point out that there are no plans to allow the use of hydraulic fracturing. It is also important to highlight that a call for tenders was issued by the EPA in November 2013 and that a steering group involving various departmental agencies has been established. That group has been reviewing the tenders received and an announcement on the award of the contract is expected shortly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy asked a specific question on protections for landowners. In any context, entry onto land is subject to the agreement of the owner.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Mining on land occurs in this country and there are statutory processes and planning obligations which apply. There are no plans to get involved in the hydraulic fracturing process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I reiterate that entry onto land, be it on the surface or underground, is subject to the agreement of the owner. I am not going to waffle or bluff. That is the answer.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Absolutely.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While the term "hydraulic fracturing" is not defined in legislation, it is a well understood term. I can point the Deputy to a clear definition of the term provided on the Environmental Protection Agency's website in the context of the call for proposals issued on 22 November 2013 seeking tenders to undertake further detailed research on the potential impacts on the environment and human health from unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects. Hydraulic fracturing is defined by the EPA as a process which involves the creation of, or the propagation of, a fracture in a rock layer, by means of a pressurised fluid in order to release petroleum, natural gas, coal-seam gas or other substances for extraction. The energy from the injection of a highly pressurised fluid, such as water, creates new channels in the rock which can increase the extraction rate and ultimately recovery of fossil fuels. The EPA research programme will be significant and will include identification and a detailed examination of potential impacts on the environment and human health, as well as potential successful mitigation measures to counteract the impacts of such projects and operations that have come to the fore worldwide. Where appropriate, it is expected that findings will be accompanied by reference to experiences in other countries. The selection process, overseen by a steering group chaired by the EPA and which includes representatives from my Department and a number of other Departments and agencies, has been concluded. An announcement from the EPA on the award of the tender is expected shortly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I share the Deputy's concerns. We have heard conflicting reports on the fracking process. North Dakota comes to mind. As part of the research, which has not yet been awarded, dual emphasis must be placed on the environment and human health. The Minister shares my concerns and the Department shares these two parameters as twofold concerns. The more detailed research programme will be conducted over a period of two years and will not be published until 2016. We have two years to learn and there are examples in the Six Counties from which we must learn. Let us learn from there, from the United States and from other countries. We must look at the twofold important parameters of human health and the environment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Let us learn from experiences and let us be on the ball. We have a two-year period so we should use all aspects of the mechanics within the democratic House, such as the Joint Committee on Communications and Transport. The community must also be involved in the research over the two years. We must be open with people, learn from experiences and ensure every t is crossed and every i is dotted in ensuring that health and the environment are protected during this detailed research programme.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will be going over the same ground, if Members will forgive the pun. In November 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, issued a call for tenders to engage the relevant expertise to conduct detailed research into the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing technology. The selection process, overseen by a steering group that includes representatives from my Department and a number of other Departments and agencies, has concluded. An announcement from the EPA on the award of the tender is expected shortly. The research programme envisaged will be very significant and will include identification and a detailed examination of potential impacts on the environment and human health, as well as potential successful mitigation measures to counteract the impacts of such projects and operations that have come to the fore worldwide. Where appropriate, it is expected that findings will be accompanied by reference to experiences in other countries. The research programme will take in the region of two years to complete.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Vigilance is key and there will be vigilance in the House. In framing public policy, we must review how we work with our communities and the community representation structures. Lessons must be learned from some of the bigger issues, such as pylons and the question of underground versus overground lines, and about how public policy must include the community. It must be part of this and, within the two-year period, I will be vigilant and adamant that community has a voice about its concerns from the human and environmental points of view.
