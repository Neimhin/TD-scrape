JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 4, to delete lines 32 to 39, to delete pages 5 to 9 inclusive and in page 10, to delete lines 1 to 9.I welcome the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. He had a close call and I am glad he is recovering and before the Upper House again.The Committee Stage debate on this Bill was truncated and too emotional at times and I wish to re-focus it on the Fine Gael Party's position on dormant accounts. Value for money is a major issue in terms of applications for funding made by community groups and how such funding is then spent. There is a problem with regard to the mainstream allocation of funding to groups which need it. It applies both to dormant accounts funds and lotto funding. While funding is useful to disadvantaged groups and community groups seeking money for capital purposes, stop-gap capital for human resources may not be sufficient when allocated once or twice. In the long term, we must focus our capacity on a national basis. To give credit where it is due, the Minister tried to do this and acknowledged the extent of duplication among State agencies.Greater value for money would be obtained in the allocation of funding if much of the work was carried out more thoroughly. No mechanism is in place to track the funds allocated, monitor the way in which they are allocated or the areas which receive them. It is fine to hand a group €100,000 or €200,000 as a stop-gap measure but where are the follow-up and tracking measures? These are necessary if we are to get to grips with involving community groups and empowering them in the decision-making process.The Fine Gael Party's main difficulty with the dormant accounts funds is that the initial structure of the dormant accounts disbursements fund ensured decisions would be taken at the level of partnership groups, specifically Area Development Management Limited. My party opposes decisions on the disbursement of funds being taken by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This issue formed the basis of the debate on Committee Stage, during which Senators only scratched the surface. There is a deep malaise with regard to enterprise boards, community development groups, county development boards, partnership boards and cross-Border institutions. There are so many difficulties regarding where the groups are going, how they are funded and value for money when funding is allocated. We can be political and accuse Fianna Fáil of wanting the money for a pre-election slush fund. However, that is a minor part of the debate. If the shoe was on the other foot and Fine Gael was in power, we would probably do the same.The Minister has tried to address the malaise. He has been to Donegal, which has the Inishowen Partnership, Donegal Local Development Company, Údarás na Gaeltachta and enterprise and county development boards. This plethora of representative organisations are trying to do the same thing at community level. On an economic level, there is the Western Development Commission, the Border midlands and western region, along with numerous cross-Border groups. These organisations all try to do good work. However, we have a centralised type of government. We must start at the beginning and empower these groups. I am not merely talking about development and community and economic representative groups, but also FÁS and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. There must be a decentralisation of power. Those in charge of regional groups must be given more power. There should be a national strategy for a country such as Ireland, which is unique and diverse in every region. That is the problem we have today.What has this to do with amendment No. 1? We are only scratching at the surface of the issue of dormant accounts. We are playing petty politics over an issue which is far greater than the dispersal of funds. The manner in which the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will take charge of the dispersal of funds is not the way forward. However, perhaps the Minister thinks it is the only way because there are so many groups and representative organisations. We must target and tackle the issue of how and where we spend our money, and ensure for the first time that taxpayers are confident their money will be distributed throughout the country. I am putting forward a general argument. It is a pity the Leader is not here because a wider debate is needed.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will take the blame if an argument straying from the amendment arises. I am delighted the Minister said there is too much emphasis on reports and paperwork. Too much money, energy, expertise and time is spent on compiling reports of which the biggest culprit is FÁS. A supervisor running a community employment scheme, in tracking 15 participants, must produce progression reports from training to employment involving reams of paper. These reams go only as far as the regional FÁS centre and no further. Where is the link between this, the central FÁS system and the Department of Social and Family Affairs?With regard to the two to three year projects, I believe the Minister was alluding to the social economy scheme. The scheme was established with the intention of projects becoming sustainable after two to three years. However, it was based on a European think tank's argument that sought to encourage people with social entrepreneurship skills to get involved. That did not happen. The social economy scheme duplicated the community employment scheme. As we all know, community employment schemes are not sustainable but are provided as a first step in the ultimate progression of a participant to the workforce. The problem was at the initial forward planning stage when the necessary homework was not carried out by the relevant Department. While I accept I am being parochial in my reference to Inishowen and have no doubt that Deputy Keaveney has by now hammered down the Minister's door, the social economy scheme in the area is merely serving as a community employment scheme. The scheme is not to blame. The problem lies in the failure to do the homework in the first instance.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I second the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I second the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I second the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I concur with Senator Ryan. The Minister summed up his own stand on this issue in seeking the allocation and disbursement of money to be done on a transparent basis. We are all in the game of protecting ourselves and not putting ourselves in a compromising position. The Minister should not put himself in a compromising position. He should delegate the task of appointments to somebody else, be it the head of CDBs or certain partnerships, agencies or whatever. This wording will put the Minister in a compromising position. Discretion does not come into the question of accountability and transparency and the Minister would be putting himself into a dangerous position if this is included.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I second the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 12, to delete lines 8 to 29.A great deal of information is contained in these amendments. They return us to the issue of funding distribution and the so-called board. I still have suspicions about and problems with who will be accountable and in who will have discretion in regard to the distribution of money. My fear is that this board will be established as a dummy, which merely fulfils the provisions of the Dormant Accounts Act for its own sake. All the indications are that the disbursement of the money will be at the discretion of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and his Cabinet colleagues on the basis of recommendations from the board.The Minister agreed with me that there should be more regional governance because the system is very centralised at present. In that context, an opportunity was missed in the provision of powers to this board. A decentralised regional board could have been provided for, which would represent all the regions. On a board of ten members, will Cork, south Kerry, north-west Donegal or Louth be represented? I am not being parochial, rather I want to do justice to the thinking which is being undertaken by people on the ground. Leaving aside the specifics of Donegal, a sort of north-west regional think tank has developed in this regard. Will this area be represented on the board and, if it is, what powers will any representative have in directing funds to his or her own region?The Minister stated that three criteria will be strictly adhered to in the allocation of funding, namely, socio-economic disadvantage, educational disadvantage and educational disability disadvantage. As the Minister knows, these criteria cover every type of activity from setting up an egg hatchery to developing an ostrich racecourse. Economic and social disadvantage covers everything and creates a window of opportunity for the Cabinet to consider every project which lands on its desk as eligible for dormant accounts funding. There is no restriction in terms of what will be funded and what will not.At the outset of this debate, I referred to a deeper malaise which still exists, in regard to which an opportunity was missed in the provisions to establish this board. If we decide to nominate a board, which makes recommendations and proposals to the Cabinet, one-off grants will be awarded, for example, €100,000 to group A or €200,000 to group B, which will only gratify short-term needs but go no way to addressing the long-term sustainability of projects. Perhaps this money would be better used to examine regional governance and how we could give more control and autonomy to the major players outside our centralised Government, which Senator Ryan described as a Stalinist-type system.This is a stop-gap measure which will be politicised and the Minister knows in his heart that is the case, although he will not say so on the record. I acknowledge that the Minister is genuine in his intentions, as Senator Ryan has stated, but the system will be politicised at the Cabinet table and will be used in a manner which will provide no long-term benefit to the projects which receive the funding in the short term. It is no different from national lottery funding, the only benefit of which is that capital projects have been invested in. However, in terms of the money being well-spent and in terms of value for money, my colleagues in Fine Gael and I have a serious problem with the establishment of this board.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister makes a plausible case and I do not believe he is being devious or trying to mislead Senators. As Senator Ryan stated, he is genuinely trying to map out the way forward and I agree with much of his language and many of his hypotheses. The bottom line, however, is that this dormant accounts fund will be a slush fund subject to ministerial approval at Cabinet level. It flies in the face of the approach taken by the Taoiseach who has always been an advocate of partnership. I agree with the Taoiseach's vision of partnership and multi-agency and inter-agency approaches as the way forward.I advocate regionalising, decentralising spending and empowering the respective agencies in the regions. The real skill lies in tying together the different tiers, whether at agency level or among the voluntary or community groups, in a longitudinal way as opposed to taking a centralised, vertical approach. The public is sick to the teeth of vertical funding of projects, one-off allocations, slush funds and stopgap measures to appease certain groups and the wider electorate.In the past fortnight, the Taoiseach and the Ministers for Arts, Sport and Tourism and Health and Children have visited County Donegal. I know the political reasons for their visits. Their job was to meet and appease certain groups by providing them with one-off funding and grants. These groups are fighting hard and lonely battles to try to mainstream their projects and form some kind of sustainable future for them. The Minister knows the public is sick of this type of distribution of funds. People are sick of the politicisation of grant aid with funds allocated to groups subject to ministerial approval.While the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board will still be in place, it will not decide where the money goes. The Minister agreed that an inter-agency approach is the way forward. We need longitudinal thinking, rather than a vertical handout mentality.The public will give out to Opposition parties and politicians, saying it is terrible certain groups get funding while others do not. They will claim there is no planning or preparation with regard to funding allocation. However, the public fall for it every single time, which is why the system still operates. Slush funds work politically because the public fall for them before elections, remember them for approximately six months and forget about them after a year. Perhaps it is a sad reality of human nature, but the way to counteract this is to have a more accountable, transparent system where funds are distributed through State agencies using an organised inter-agency approach and not through the Cabinet in a centralised manner.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Minister, but will his Cabinet colleagues be on the same wavelength?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Cabinet was not involved in that decision.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a great difference.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Cabinet can be the watchdog and safeguard against any discrepancies in plans not being followed, as Senator Ryan rightly pointed out. The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board should be used to decide which projects, on the basis of merit, deserve funding. The Minister and his team may be thinking this through, but we still need a commitment on the safeguards. That is the kernel of the issue.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 12, line 16, to delete "is to have regard" and substitute "shall strictly adhere".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 36:
In page 17, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following:"16.—The Freedom of Information Acts shall apply to all aspects of or relating to the functions and activities of the Minister and the Board under this Act and the Principal Act.".All the activities of the board and the Minister should be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. I presume there is a stipulation which allows this. If not, there should be.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister who stimulated the debate. He does not just follow the party line but gets involved in the issue. We set out our stall in regard to future distribution of State moneys and public funds through what I hope is a more organised multi-State agency approach.As a point of reference, we must look at the whole area of process. I use the example of progression in regard to community employment participants whose progression reports are sitting on desks collecting dust and do not provide any value in terms of expenditure. All sides of the House are in agreement that this is not a matter of appeasing the electorate.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move:That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government for its inaction in relation to:(1) A full review of days at sea, and also a comprehensive review of tonnage allocation, particularly in relation to the white-fish industry;(2) fishermen and co-ops who are frustrated at licensing delays with the lack of response from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources;(3) the lack of progress in relation to promised investment in harbour development;(4) the new licensing and control regime for aquaculture and shell fish farming;(5) fish farming delays in relation to licensing; and(6) the promotion of sea-angling as a viable option for future tourism development.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House and congratulate him on his new portfolio. His appointment indicates a deliberate attempt by the Government to acknowledge the needs of the fishing sector, as the Minister of State has the expertise, skills, knowledge and experience of living by the sea as well as understanding the intricacies of everything to do with inland and other fishing.This motion is tabled in a form which is critical and negative. However, I hope it will stimulate debate in the long term since positive debate is required to meet the future needs of the fishing industry. It is particularly essential given the conditions which prevail at present. In our own back yard, there is a great deal of negative labelling of the fishing industry, which is overshadowing the good concrete work which has been done by the major players in the past few decades in Donegal specifically and which has a resonating impact throughout the rest of the country.The biggest impact is that people from different parts of the country feel the marine sector is not getting the recognition it deserves in terms of a Government portfolio. It is included in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and I understand a fight took place for it to be included in the title of that Department. Aside from all the domestics of the recent Front Bench re-shuffle, Fine Gael has highlighted the importance of having a specific marine portfolio, which is why Deputy Kenny thought it appropriate to appoint Deputy Perry to the Front Bench as the specific spokesperson on the marine. A further dilution of the marine portfolio would be bad for the people involved in the sector and for its potential.The total length of the Irish coastline is 7,500 km and the marine industry employs 15,000 people. The total available supply of fish from fishing activity and aquaculture amounted to 354,803 tonnes, valued at €313 million at first point of sale. Sea fish landings at home and overseas amounted to 293,868 tonnes valued at €206 million. Landings made directly into overseas ports, mainly in Scotland, Norway and Spain accounted for €35 million of this value. The aquaculture sector produced an output of 60,935 tonnes in 2001 with a value of €107 million. Some 2,500 people are engaged in the sector farming finfish such as salmon and trout and shellfish such as mussels and oysters. Production of finfish in 2001 amounted to 25,082 tonnes valued at €79 million, while shellfish farmers harvested 35,853 tonnes valued at €28 million.The home market for seafood is currently valued at €290 million at final point of sale. In 2001, seafood exports reached €433.4 million with a total tonnage of 310,879. Some 76% of exports were sold in EU markets with the remaining 14% going to third countries. The leading market destinations in 2001 were France, Great Britain, Spain, Italy and Germany. Other EU markets amounted to €22 million. Trade with third countries amounted to €96 million, the leading markets being Egypt, Japan, Poland and Romania.In addition to the core activities of sea fishing, aquaculture production, processing and marketing, the industry generates additional business for ancillary services including transport, equipment supplies, chandlery and net-making among others. This activity provides employment for up to 2,000 people. Fine Gael took this on board seriously by appointing a dedicated marine spokesperson, while the Cabinet has yet to appoint its own marine Minister.Fine Gael supports any move that would seek to safeguard fish stocks in Irish waters. It is in the environmental and economic interest of the country, not to mention the many communities that rely on fishing for their future. The difficulty many have with the policy is how it reaches its aim and the disadvantage to which many smaller fishermen are put because of the way in which the CFP is implemented. The agreement provides for a range of fishing days, from no restrictions at all to 12 days per month, depending on the type of fishing gear used and the level of cod, sole and plaice catches. Total Irish quotas for 2004 amounted to 204,379 tonnes, compared to 189,500 tonnes for 2003, an increase of 8%.The deal secured for 2004 also included additional quota secured under the Hague preference system under which Ireland gets additional whitefish quota at the expense of certain other countries. Despite this, the time is right to look at the detail of the deal and see how many Irish fishermen are losing out under the scheme.Fine Gael's Front Bench spokesperson on the marine, Deputy Perry, has also raised the issue of fines for breaches of these rules. Figures from the European Union show that the average fine for unauthorised fishing in 2001 was €84 in Finland and €1,040 in Denmark, but in Ireland the fine was a staggering €12,700. This is more than 11 times the EU average. The fines for the use or keeping of prohibited fishing gear in this country are seven times the EU average and for failing to record data in logbooks, Irish fishermen pay almost six times the EU average fine. Such breaches are considered criminal offences in this country, while in other EU states only administrative sanctions are imposed. What is more, unlike elsewhere, the entire catch is confiscated upon detection of a breach of the rules.In no way do we condone the breach of the CFP and we fully support the European Union's attempts to preserve fish stocks but there must be a level playing pitch. It is vital there is a common approach to penalties to ensure Irish fishermen are not put at a disadvantage to their EU counterparts.The Government has shown its complete indifference to the marine tourist sector by not allocating a penny in funding for the marine and natural resources tourism programme. Although the Estimates published last month indicate that €2 million has been allocated to the sector, which is a cut of 30%, this money will not be spent as it is ring-fenced for the four infamous marina projects at Kenmare, Roundstone, Rosses Point and Caherciveen, which were given the green light without the required EU approval by the former Minister, Deputy Fahey.The €2 million allocated is unlikely to be spent in light of the huge difficulty in Europe brought about by the manner of the then Minister, Deputy Fahey's, announcement of the four marina projects. These projects were not part of a €25 million EU-approved project to develop and transform coastal tourism in Ireland shelved two years ago because of the "economic climate of the time". With an improvement in the public finances, surely now is the time to dust the scheme off. It is particularly disappointing when combined with the 9% cut in funding for development and upgrading of harbours for fishery purposes. The Government, which has long neglected the needs and livelihoods of fishermen, is now abandoning those who are trying to create alternative ways to sustain communities and protect jobs.Ireland's tourism industry is booming and it is vital that Ireland exploits its significant potential as an attractive destination for sea angling tourists. With the abundance of coastline and inland waterways, Ireland is the perfect destination for all types of angling holidays. Salmon, trout and sea trout are native species and Ireland's lakes and rivers have preserved their character in a landscape which has changed very little over the centuries. The Irish coastline is also one of the most varied, with dramatic cliffs and many miles of wide strands. This variety offers unlimited opportunities to the sea angler, who can find somewhere to fish all year round.Ireland also has some of the cleanest and most lightly-fished fresh waters in Europe. The Irish landscape has over 11,000 km of riverbank for the coarse and pike angler. This natural asset is valued by a plethora of bodies from Bord Fáilte to the Central Fisheries Board but Ireland continues to lack a consistent, persistent, aggressive marketing of its fisheries tourist potential. If it is a matter of money, let the Government contemplate the following fact, contained in the national development plan's provision to the BMW region — it was an allocation for "recreation and sport facilities" designed to include fisheries and address the urgent need for their development. By mid-2004, not a single penny of that allocation had been spent. It is not unreasonable to suggest that this underdeveloped area of our tourist potential be targeted for that investment in the years to come.As well as the nitty-gritty of this motion, Fine Gael's aim in discussing this vital issue is to continue to put pressure on the Government to belatedly take the marine sector seriously. For too long, fishing communities, businesses in the angling sector, seafarers and all who rely on the waters of Ireland have received scant attention from a Government which, as the Celtic tiger roared, lacked the vision to see that Ireland has an invaluable resource that needs to be protected and promoted.Fine Gael is determined to protect the livelihoods of those who work in our seas and rivers. That does not mean endless subsidies or wishful pipe dreams. It means innovative investment, proper planning and a sense of social justice. Anyone who favours those principles should support this Bill.I want to make particular reference to a few areas. Without going into too many of the specifics of the days at sea, the groundswell response from many involved in the marine is that the days at sea versus tonnage argument is not working. It is a model designed in Europe which affects seriously the livelihoods of many small fishermen along the coast. As I stated at the outset, it is an area which requires further debate. Finding solutions to issues in the marine sector is not an exact science. The marine sector is changeable. Changing times result in different needs and demands.There is much hypotheses and theory and many consultancy reports putting forward ideas of coastal zone management and how best aquaculture can survive alongside fish farming and tourism. Many of the studies lack common sense on how all these industries can survive together. Many aquaculture industries such as mussels, scallops and oysters are emerging, not for the first time but perhaps on a grander scale. There should be more emphasis on developing the shellfish sector in conjunction with our natural commercial product, whitefish.The Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, will relate to this. The lobster season, although short, is able to sustain the livelihoods of many fishermen through the country. It would make common sense to encourage fishermen to tag and throw back the female lobster. Although the lobster industry is thriving in certain parts, our aim is to conserve. We do not want to fish our waters bare. The Minister is in total agreement with me on this. We certainly want to work on restocking. If this means fishermen getting paid to catch a female lobster, tag it and throw it back in, then that is the way we must move forward. That is one of many measures one could take. There are many such examples of what can be done for the marine harbours in Donegal. Fish farming is thriving in Scandinavia and there is no reason that it could not thrive here also. The Minister is also well aware of the issue of the allocation of licences, which should be addressed.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was written by fishermen.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Thanks to former Deputy Thomas Gildea.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Grants are not the issue.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That was 20 years ago. We are talking about the here and now.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Minister of State but former Deputy Thomas Gildea is taking credit for it.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will bring that up the next day.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator still has not said anything about fisheries.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I certainly will reply.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Daly should say something about it now.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Outside or in here?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am absolutely delighted. Many people approached members of Fine Gael over the past three or four years regarding issues and concerns they have relating to the marine industry, which are not being addressed. I acknowledge the Taoiseach's appointment of Deputy Gallagher to the marine portfolio. Fisheries present a major challenge. Senator Daly is correct that inland fisheries is an issue. However, there are many issues in this industry and the Minister of State did not respond appropriately to the sea-angling issue. This not only involves dolphin watching; private entrepreneurs in Donegal are taking German and Dutch tourists on sea-angling trips off their own bat. The issue is the need for a comprehensive marine strategy, not the provision of grants.We have raised the tentacles of Government Members in regard to the marine industry. I recall when I was a teacher I accused a young lad of not doing his homework in front of the class. His father had called me that morning to say he had not done it. The young lad lost the head when I confronted him and he went bloody mad. Similarly, when I accused the Government of not doing its homework on the marine industry, Senator MacSharry lost the head and went absolutely berserk.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not be political. There was no veiled criticism of the Department. The Department must be complimented from Greencastle to Castletownbere. The Minister of State acknowledged there were delays in the issuing of fish licences.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That was acknowledged by the Minister of State. A plethora of challenges lie ahead on marine issues.Inland fisheries will become a major issue in Donegal. Approaches have been made to the Minister of State in this regard. The issue does not centre on whether drift net fishing is abolished. It is all about balance because there are no simple solutions to fisheries issues.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The issue is on the table for local authorities to address. Will the local authorities and BIM draft a tourism framework for inland fisheries while disregarding the views of angling clubs? Anglers in Donegal are fed up because they were disenfranchised during the consultation process. I am flagging this issue, about which there are rumblings. Hopefully, it will not result in a scenario similar to the rod licence war.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Everybody involved must be consulted, including game anglers and commercial fishermen. Fishermen are responsible people. They are the custodians of the sea in the same way farmers are the custodians of the countryside and they will not be found wanting when it comes to conservation of ecosystems and fish stocks.Fine Gael wants to flag that it supports the marine sector. As Senator Feighan stated, we will appoint a Minister for the marine.
