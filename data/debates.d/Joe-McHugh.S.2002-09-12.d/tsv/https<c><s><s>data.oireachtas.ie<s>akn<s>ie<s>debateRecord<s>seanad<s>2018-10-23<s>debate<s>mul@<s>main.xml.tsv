JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach as ucht a chuid focal. I thank Senators Bacik and Ó Ríordáin for raising this matter. I assure the House that ensuring all children with special educational needs are supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for the Government. Funding for special education provision in 2018 will amount to €1.75 billion, up 43% since 2011 and equivalent to almost 19% of the Department's overall budget. The July provision scheme provides funding for an extended school year for students with severe or profound intellectual disabilities and students with autism spectrum disorders. The scheme was developed to reduce potential regression in learning associated with these specific categories of special educational needs over the summer holidays. The scheme does not make provision for children with other categories of special educational needs. The National Council for Special Education's policy advice on education provision for children with autism spectrum disorders was published in July 2016.In the course of preparing the advice the NCSE consulted widely with a range of stakeholders, including parents, teachers, academics, experts, psychologists, HSE officials and others. The NCSE also reviewed relevant national and international research. The policy advice which is available on the NCSE's website includes a review of the July provision scheme. The NCSE review has found that in general parents value the July provision scheme because it provides daytime respite care for families and a structured day for students. However, the review has found a number of problems with the scheme as currently organised. They include concerns that the scheme may be inequitable because it is not provided for all students with complex special educational needs. The NCSE has advised that in general the scheme is not meeting its original objective which was to reduce possible regression in academic learning. The council recommended that the relevant Departments consider how an equitable national day activity scheme could be developed for all students with complex special educational needs. The proposed scheme would provide a structured, safe social environment for all students with complex special educational needs, which might include some children with Down's syndrome. My Department has convened an implementation group with representatives of the NCSE, the NEPS, the inspectorate and other Departments and agencies to ensure the report's recommendations are fully and appropriately considered. There are no plans to change the July provision scheme coverage until this work is complete.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not have information on the decision-making involved in this matter. The NCSE makes its decisions based on evidence in its own research. I am informing myself in my new brief and will be happy to take on board the Senator's recommendations, suggestions and observations. I note, in particular, that she is voicing the concerns of up to 5,000 parents who have signed an online petition. I hope the implementation group which is considering the recommendations of the NCSE will soon complete its work. However, I do not have a timeframe for completion. There is a suggestion the implementation group will also consider the issue of children with Down's syndrome. I will seek to inform myself about the issue the Senator raises about the reasons for the exclusion in the first place. I note that the focus of summertime provision was to prevent regression in education. From my earlier work with people with special needs, disabilities and different challenges, I am aware that any forum for providing any education, formally or informally, is good and important for their continued engagement with education. I thank the Senator for raising this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teach as an seans labhairt leis na Seanadóirí inniu agus táim buíoch as na focail cineálta fosta. Tá an ceart ag an Seanadóir. Tá sé iontach tábhachtach don todhchaí, is léir go mbeidh daonra ollmhór i gceantar Fhine Gall, agus táim sásta an freagra seo a bhaint amach. I thank the Senator for raising the matter as it provides me with the opportunity to clarify the current position on my Department's plans to meet the demand for school places in St. Joseph's secondary school in Rush and in Skerries community college in the Fingal area. As the Senator may be aware, my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools in the next four years, 2019 to 2022, inclusive.The announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department to assess the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. The announcement includes three new post-primary schools to be established in the Fingal area, as follows: a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede, Howth and Dublin 13 school planning area, to be established in 2019; a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Blanchardstown West, Dublin 15, and Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, school planning areas as a regional solution, to be established in 2020; and a new 800 pupil post-primary school to serve the Donaghmede, Howth and Dublin 13 school planning area, to be established in 2021.  In addition to the new schools announced, my Department’s capital investment programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms in existing schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified. The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, have regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision, as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. With regard to St. Joseph’s secondary school, Rush, my Department recently received an application from the school for additional accommodation. The application is being assessed and a decision will issue directly to the school shortly. I will make sure it is kept very firmly on the radar. The Senator will also be aware that a major building project to provide a new replacement school building at St. Joseph’s secondary school is included in my Department’s six-year construction programme. A site is required for this purpose and currently being pursued. In addition, the Senator will be aware that in September 2013 my Department established a new 1,000 pupil multi-denominational post-primary school, Lusk community college, under the patronage of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, to serve the Rush and Lusk school planning area. With regard to Skerries community college, my Department has been liaising with the school’s patron, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, on the applicant level for school places. I understand the school has indicated that it has been unable to offer a place to all applicants in September 2018. I advise the Senator that, in response to an application for additional accommodation from the ETB, my Department approved in principle the provision of additional permanent accommodation consisting of three general classrooms, one science laboratory, one art room and three special education teaching rooms. I am aware that the provision of additional accommodation on the site must be carefully planned, considering the limitations of the site. In that regard, my Department’s professional and technical staff will shortly be visiting the school site to determine how the project can be advanced. As an interim arrangement, my Department has approved the rental of temporary accommodation to the school, pending the delivery of the permanent accommodation solution. My Department will continue to work with the ETB to address the school’s interim and long-term accommodation needs.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be brief. I take very seriously the issues the Senator raised. There are obviously concerns in very heavily populated areas. I get the concern of parents and understand the need to progress matters as quickly as we possibly can. I am also conscious, however, that we have been dealing even today and over the weekend with legacy issues of schools having been fast-tracked over too short a period. We learned many lessons from that. We are looking at longer lead-in terms, but this cannot be used as an excuse for not dealing with the immediate pressures. I get the Senator's concerns. As I said, a request for additional accommodation has been submitted. We will make a decision on it and ensure the officials are proactive in that regard. As for the Senator's observation on the inclusion of Donaghmede and in defence of the officials who prepared this answer, the first part of the question referred to Fingal, although I acknowledge the Senator's interest was in the two areas to which he referred. Walking the corridors of this House and bumping into colleagues from every constituency, I am finding out about the increasing pressures, demands and populations in their areas. These are issues, but the only way we can do this properly is to have a trajectory of a long-term plan. For this reason, the Government has provided funding of €8.4 billion in the ten-year capital plan. It is the first time in the State we are working on a ten-year plan. I understand news of ten-year plans is no good to parents whose children are going to school today, but we must manage this issue. In raising the matter today the Senator has highlighted the need to deliver as speedily as possible, while adhering to new policies and guidelines which are also necessary to provide the right solutions and buildings.
