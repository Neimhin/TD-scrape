JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaithe as ucht seans labhairt i dtaobh imní atá ar na daoine sna scoilenna i gceist agus i dtaobh an ábhair iontaigh thábhachtaigh seo. I appreciate the opportunity to update the Dáil on the structural assessments that were undertaken at 42 schools constructed by Western Building Systems and the next steps to be taken by the Department of Education and Skills. Throughout this process, my priority and that of my Department has been the safety of school students and staff. We fully appreciate and acknowledge the disruption and inconvenience that has been caused to parents, teachers and pupils by the assessments and by the precautionary measures implemented. I am aware that the recent disruption has been difficult for families and that many parents have had to arrange childcare or take time off work because of these developments. I want to take this opportunity in the Dáil to recognise that. Tá sé ráite go bhfuil an fhírinne searbh ach ní searbh atá sé; tá sé garbh. It is often said the truth is bitter but it is not; it is rough. This has been a rough truth for many communities, many that have been involved in building and many involved at every step of the way with the schools. It is also a rough truth for the staff, parents and young people who go to these schools. I am committed to ensuring we have these problems rectified in as timely a manner as possible. I express my sincere thanks to school principals, patrons and boards of management who have worked and continue to work in close co-operation with my Department through this difficult period. The outcome of all 42 structural assessments, including the full list of schools requiring precautionary measures, was published on 1 November. The summary of the situation is as follows: 19 schools were cleared to open in full this week without any precautionary works; a further 19 were enabled to open in full following external precautionary measures in the form of a fence around the building, or part of a building, and protective decking at all entrances and exits; three schools, two in Tyrrelstown and one in Lucan, are being enabled to open, initially at ground floor level only, following the implementation of both internal engineering solutions and external precautionary measures; and one building, namely phase 1 of Ardgillan community college, built in 2009, remains closed but with the use of phase 2 of the college and overflow accommodation it has been possible for the school to open fully. There has been intense deliberation and contact between the education and training board, ETB, the CEO, Paddy Lavelle, and the principal, Michael O'Leary, to come up with a solution. I acknowledge the role of the ETB in that regard. I would like to give a more detailed update in regard to two of the schools, St. Luke's national school in Tyrrelstown and Tyrrelstown Educate Together national school, which have required internal as well as external precautionary measures. Following feedback received from the school authorities at a meeting with Department officials on Monday, further work was undertaken over the past two days to minimise the impact of the precautionary measures on the smooth running of the schools. Time has also been required this week to work through other operational and logistical issues, such as a traffic management plan. As only the ground floors of the buildings will be opening initially, some students will need to be accommodated in alternative locations. Prior to the reopening of the schools, the school authorities have invited parents this morning to view the precautionary measures in place and to raise any questions they might have. Representatives from the independent structural engineering firm that conducted the assessments, along with Department officials, are on site at the schools to assist in answering any questions arising. We are collectively working towards the reopening of both schools this week; however, the arrangements for reopening will be communicated by the schools directly to parents and pupils. The Department's clear priority over the mid-term break was to ensure that the structural assessments were conducted and any precautionary measures implemented to ensure safe occupancy this week. This required significant mobilisation of engineers and contractors. I acknowledge their commitment and support.In total, some 250 workers were on site in the 22 schools requiring precautionary measures. All measures were in place by Sunday night, 4 November. I acknowledge all the individual communities who worked hand in glove with the school boards of management and principals to ensure solutions were put in place in this tight timeframe. The Department now intends to move as quickly as possible to the next phase, which is to initiate more detailed structural investigations at the 42 schools and, following this, to implement the permanent remediation works required. We cannot give a precise timeframe at this point for the duration of precautionary measures or the implementation of permanent works as this will depend on the outcome of the next phase of investigations. Every effort will be made, however, to keep the duration of temporary measures to a minimum. I wish to give a direct message to principals that my team of officials and I are committed to ensuring we do this in a speedy way because we do not want principals to face uncertainty as to what length the fencing around their schools will be, such as the 3 km fence around the three-campus school in Ashbourne. My commitment to the principals and the school communities is that this will remain a priority when we start the more comprehensive investigations into the 42 schools. The structural issues uncovered during the programme of assessments have raised many questions and concerns that need to be addressed. It is important to restore trust in our school building programme. Schools are at the heart of our local communities. As a part of that, it is our intention to initiate a programme level review of the Department’s design and build programme to include aspects such as procurement, quality control, workmanship and oversight. This review will be informed by the detailed structural assessments at WBS constructed schools. It will be an independent review conducted by a person or entity from outside of the Department. I want to see this done in as timely a manner as possible. I am not in the business of having a six month or nine month review which will potentially hold up proceedings. I want to ensure this review, examination, investigation or whatever people wish to call it will be done independently and in as speedy a manner as possible. It will be a single process. If there are specific lessons for the Department or the wider system, we want to learn them and ensure they inform our building programme. As Minister, it is my duty to fix whatever needs to be fixed. I want to be crystal clear, however, that in parallel with this we fully intend to pursue WBS through all contractual and legal challenges for the costs arising from the structural defects. Under the public works design and build contract, the contractor and the contractor’s design team are clearly responsible for ensuring quality and presenting certificates which confirm that the buildings are constructed in accordance with the works requirements and building regulations. The certificates signed by WBS are on the Department’s files. As we have seen, significant issues were uncovered in buildings which were confirmed by the contractor as having been compliant with regulations. As we turn our attention to some of these important questions, I am conscious that it is school students and staff who must deal from day to day with the significant disruption and inconvenience caused by the structural defects. Our priority remains their safety and that will continue to be the case. No effort will be spared in ensuring all defects are remedied on a permanent basis and that students and teachers can enjoy the highest quality education environment. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine uilig sa Teach agus sa Seanad, go háirithe baill an chomhchoiste oideachais, don chumarsáid agus don chomhoibriú thar an coicís atá imithe thart. I thank all the Members of this House and the Seanad, in particular, the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills for their co-operation and communication over the past fortnight. Níl sé éasca do na daoine uilig sna scoileanna. It is not easy for all the people within the schools, ach tá mé tiomanta don ghealltanas atá luaite agam le coicís anuas agus arís ar maidin. The commitment I give this morning and have given for the past two weeks is that I will ensure the safety of the pupils and staff in these schools and get this work done properly to the highest possible standards.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, I do not agree there was a cover-up. An intensive assessment of 55 schools was begun in quarter 4, 2017. Last August, a team and plan were put in place to ensure the opening of works, which happened two weeks ago. Before that, assessments were also done in 2014. Fire defects, however, must be separated from the structural defects that were found in the past fortnight.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a clerk of works from the Department on every major project. Obviously, there are different summer work schemes of perhaps one or two classrooms where there is no clerk of works, but on major extensions and major capital programmes, there is a clerk of works on every one of them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the question about the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, there has not been an assessment of costs for the past fortnight's work and some of the work is ongoing this morning. As soon as we receive it, we will look for the costs to be recovered. The significant cost will emerge next year and, therefore, I do not expect the Department to seek additional money through the Estimates process this year. The significant work will be when the comprehensive assessments are carried out in 2019. On the second question, I meet Deputies and Senators in the corridors every time I leave the Chamber and they raise with me various projects that need to go ahead.I am committed to ensuring they will go ahead. We also have a very extensive ten-year bundle of capital projects worth upwards of €8.4 billion. It is important that we continue with those schemes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There was a mobilisation of the team in the last fortnight. Over the bank holiday weekend people from different parts of the Department came together in Tullamore. Thirty staff members, from a total Department staff of 1,300, were working on this interim accommodation measure to find solutions for assessment. In the last fortnight there was a deployment of staff. Obviously, this has had an impact on their day-to-day work. There has been a focus on getting students back into class and teachers back teaching, which is what they want to do. Once that has been done and the interim arrangements for transportation to other venues have been mobilised, we will get back on track to pursue important things such as other building projects.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	According to the information I have, no alert whatsoever was received of any structural issue in any of the schools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I need to separate the two elements. In the case of schools where internal and external works are needed such as in the two schools in Tyrrelstown and the school in Lucan, internal works are now complete on the ground floor and we are looking to do the first and second floors in the next few weeks. We are looking to get the students back into their school campuses in the coming weeks. In the case of the 42 schools where more permanent works are needed, we will go to tender and get the structural engineering company that wins the tender to assess the extent of the works that need to be done. That will take a little longer. I reiterate the commitment made in Tullamore to getting students back into the two schools in Tyrrelstown and the school in Lucan within a matter of weeks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have made no contact with the local authorities. As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, the local authority building control units have a role in this regard. It is important to get their input into any review of the design and build process. I will be happy to encourage it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his questions. I appreciate that there are difficulties in a number of schools in his constituency. I will begin by providing clarification on certification of compliance. Unlike the Deputy, I have never been involved in major works on building sites, although I did a bit of hod carrying in my day. I remember that there was a need for vigilance, oversight and responsibility on site. I make it clear that responsibility for design, build and operate projects lies with the contractor and the design team, on which we rely entirely for certification of compliance. They are responsible at each stage. For example, when the inside cavity wall is finished, somebody has to look down to ensure there are enough wall ties in the right places. The onus is on the contractor and the design team to make sure that happens. As I said at yesterday's meeting of the joint committee, I know from speaking to people in the private sector that the new regulations which have been in place since 2014 are adding approximately 18%, on average, to the cost of buildings. There can be delays in getting in fire safety officers. It is right that design teams are very pernickety to ensure every stage is completed properly. It is important to point out that although four schools which have been built since the introduction of the 2014 regulations have shown signs of potential structural issues, there has been a move towards a more regulatory environment. I remind the House that the clerk of works has been on site since 2017, which provides an added layer of oversight. The Deputy asked about certification of compliance. Once again, the onus is on the contractor and the design team. There has been a debate about certification of completion because it is a grey area. Certificates of completion are signed off on by representatives of the Department. They are signed on the understanding all other works have been completed. If one goes to Ardgillan and Tyrrelstown, one will see nice and lovely new schools that have been freshly painted, but one does not know what is inside the walls. An unacceptable lack of standards and workmanship has brought about the situation in which we find ourselves. I would like to separate a few of the schools. Ardgillan community college is an outlier. The Deputy asked whether there were visible signs of some of the defects. Issues were noted when Ardgillan community college was opened up. There was an insufficient number of wall ties in the right places. The inside timber relief was not joined to the steel structure or properly embedded on top of the concrete. Such standards are completely unacceptable. That is why the phase 1 building from 2009 has been closed. It is closed today. The school also has a phase 2 building. There has been disruption. Over 200 students have been relocated off-campus. The schools in Tyrrelstown and Lucan also have internal issues. Engineering solutions have been agreed to to make the internal walls safe. Junior students in Gaelscoil an Eiscir Riada in Lucan were able to go to school on Monday. In the schools in Tyrrelstown there were a few jagged edges with the new supporting and strengthening timber infrastructure. The principals, staff and boards of management have rightly worked with the team. I acknowledge the Tyrrelstown team for also doing that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am committing to initiating a programme-led inquiry specifically to examine design, build and operate projects. It has to be independent. The Minister for Health Deputy Simon Harris, appointed an international expert to inquire into CervicalCheck. I am open to suggestions from this House regarding the design of the inquiry to ensure we address culpability and accountability and, first and foremost, have safe schools for our younger generations. On the other issue the Deputy raises, my total focus over the past fortnight has been on safety and finding a solution for the short-term problem of relocating students. That is why the Department established a team to deal with interim accommodation and a second team to deal with communication and keep principals and parents informed. That has been the total focus to date. I will take on board the Deputy's suggestion. This matter is moving very fast and is very fluid. I agree that there must be a sense of urgency about setting up the review, which must not impact in any way on our legal processes. The legal processes and channels we are pursuing have to continue. We have four litigation cases ongoing with WBS in four separate schools and I want to continue with those apace.  The type and model of the inquiry have not been decided. I want to ensure there is accountability and that a message goes out to members of the public, some of whom have had to deal with housing defects in recent times. I have personal experience of the mica issue in County Donegal where people are living in houses that may fall down. This type of culture drives people crazy but it is not reflective of the entire construction industry and the many bricklayers, blocklayers, carpenters and electricians who work hard and comply with the rules. This case sends out a bad message that the problem is across the board when that is not the case. There is substantial compliance with the 2014 legislation and even during the crazy years of 2008, 2009 and 2010 there was considerable compliance. The case of Ardgillan community college shows clearly that we had unacceptable practices. We have to find out what went wrong at that school and with the design, build and operate system with which there was not proper compliance. Culpability has to be followed up in that regard. The Deputy also cited a figure for costs. I will not state a figure as to what this will cost. To give an indication, the 42 schools in question cost upwards of €151 million to build. We will not even approach that figure because many of these schools will not require the level of structural work as other schools. I do not have a figure for costs. The important issue is to have the comprehensive assessment done as quickly as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy made a series of observations and asked some questions, to which I will try to respond as best I can. To be clear, it was the role of the clerk of works that I was talking about yesterday at the meeting of the joint committee. That role is to give additional oversight. If the clerk of works sees something that indicates safety is not being done right, he or she has a responsibility to issue a direction and ensure it is done right.That might involve ensuring that the work is happening within a particular period of time. The clerk of works has a general role, but it is not his or her responsibility to ensure compliance. I made that distinction yesterday. Compliance is the responsibility of the contractor, even if he or she is sub-contracting the work or supplying different bricklayers for the site. I am not blaming anyone for this because we have no evidence yet. We are pursuing legal channels to establish the facts. The contractor has responsibility for compliance, and the line of communication between the sub-contractors and contractor is important.  At each stage of the building, be it the closing of the cavity walls or the putting on of joists, extra oversight costs money and is therefore resource dependent. Perhaps something will emerge from the investigation or review into design-build-operate, DBO, contracts in that regard. We need to be very realistic about this. There is a culture of taking responsibility in this country. There are good bricklayers working this morning, and contractors and designers are doing their work in compliance with regulations and legislation. This is why it is important to pursue legal channels, to ensure that the deficits or weaknesses in this system are addressed. There is no correlation between a fire safety audit and the structural defects found in Ardgillan. However, as a result of the findings that some schools have severe fire safety defects, there is now a correlation established between fire safety and structural issues. This has been highlighted in the last fortnight.  The Deputy mentioned criminal investigations and asked whether An Garda Síochána will be asked to investigate. My job is to ensure that the legal team in the Department continues to work closely with the office of the Attorney General and the CSSO to ensure there is a proper and deliberate pursuit of truth and an inquiry into who is responsible for this. We will see what emerges from that investigation.  The awarding of contracts was discussed. In this DBO 60% is awarded on technical merit and 40% is awarded on cost.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has raised a number of very important points. When one speaks to people in the building trade and at a wider level it is clear that smaller companies feel that they are precluded from tendering for contracts, even when they have a proven track record, because of the turnover threshold. I am on public record on that issue, and I certainly agree that it is an issue that should be grappled with. We should ensure that smaller companies with good track records should not be precluded from tendering. My Department is looking at bundling projects for the Higher Education Authority. I have publicly commented on that issue in the past. The head of building control has agreed to give a briefing to the members of the committee on the processes that are employed. I am taking the DBO process very seriously in this instance. There were unacceptable building standards applied to schools, and those unacceptable standards have led to chaos for families and children. Parents are wondering if their children were in a school that was unsafe in the first place and if the school they are attending is now safe. It is completely unacceptable. Whatever the findings of this review in terms of culpability and accountability, and whatever the legal outcome, I want to learn from this to ensure that personal responsibility is taken. We cannot have a situation where someone is looking over a bricklayer's shoulder and checking every block that he or she lays. That is not possible. However, we can provide legislative accountability in terms of who is responsible, i.e. the contractor and the designer. The Deputy has identified a weakness with the role of the clerk of works in this particular DBO process. I am happy to highlight that, and I am sure the review-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	-----will highlight it as well.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has covered a broad range of issues. I want to clear up the issue about the clerk of works. The clerk of works is involved on a permanent basis on each major build, be it a major extension or a major new school building, and that has been in place since 2017. That has acted with respect to, and added further, oversight. When examining this review, we have to take account of what that impact has been. The Deputy mentioned the Department officials. The only thing I can say about them is that in the two weeks I have been in the Department they have shown versatility in being able to deal with a major crisis, in responding to it and in listening to suggestions I made, and I received suggestions from colleagues in this House and from people within the building trade. I noted their adaptability in listening to those suggestions. I commend to the team that put this plan together. Potentially 16,000 students were going to be decanted. That was the issue we faced on the Friday the walls were opened in the Ardgillan school, which posed a potential hazard. We were thinking about decanting students to other schools. It was a major issue but the officials demonstrated a great level of versatility and foresight in knowing what to do in that situation. I hope the review will bring together all the information, suggestions and proposals to ensure we learn from the mistakes and start building trust again with school communities. Those 42 school communities would have been actively involved in the build up to those schools, which are part of their communities. I appreciate the buy-in they have had in that process but now they have had to face this issue of trust, and of trusting the people at every single level. We, as politicians, have to be trusted in terms of opening schools on the basis of understanding that the cavity walls are done and that the fire-proofing is in place to make sure the firewalls are protected. All that is based on an understanding but the more oversight we can put in place the better. Obviously, however, that is resource dependent and those will be decisions that will have to be made.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. KSN was the project manager on up to 12 schools. To be clear on what a project manager does, the project manager does not certify any issue of compliance on the project. It went through a process to get the job with regard to the 55 school assessments, the 30 Western Building Systems, WBS, schools and the 25 other schools - a random audit. It got that, having gone through the process. Obviously, its know-how and knowledge of these buildings were paramount during this process. They were very important linkages in ensuring that we took the proper steps during the past two weeks but, ultimately, PUNCH Engineers was the company that carried out the structural assessment. It was the independent assessor and was not involved in any of these schools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As far as I am I am aware, it went through a proper tendering process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Let me be clear about it. That company acted and advocated on behalf of the Department. In terms of the certificate of completion, it was not the Department officials who signed off on the certificate of completion but the company acting on behalf of the Department. The project manager was KSN and it was working on the understanding that at each stage of the compliance process all the work had been done and carried out by the company and the designers. It does not act in an oversight role in certifying compliance, and that must be made clear.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	From listening to some of the parents of the students in Tyrrelstown and from speaking to the principal, fears were expressed about the fact that KSN had been involved in a number of schools on a project management basis, but let us be clear. In terms of certification of compliance at each stage, KSN was the Department's representative in signing off the certificate of completion that the works were complete on the understanding that at each stage the company or the contractor and the designers were complaint the whole way along. That is something I take very seriously.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Just to be very clear, we are not just looking at structural issues. We have been looking at the assessment of fire safety. We are taking that very seriously. That assessment was completed in August of this year. Works now need to be done. We have asked Western Building Systems, WBS, to look at four particular schools to see whether it will come forward and do the required work. The Deputy is aware that those four cases are undergoing litigation, so I am being careful as to what I say in that regard. We are going to be looking at all the outcomes, all the recommendations, all the weaknesses and all the defects from the fire assessment reports that were completed last August. A total of 55 have been assessed. Some 51 reports are in and there are four outstanding. We will be pursuing WBS for those as well as for the structural issues. To reiterate once again, I want to find out all weaknesses, deficiencies or shortcomings that are in this design, build, and operate scheme because I want to ensure that we restore confidence and build up the trust that has evidently been lost in respect of this particular type of system.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, I have no concerns.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Let us be very clear about the process. The process was set out very clearly in the immediate aftermath of Grenfell, which I believe happened in June 2017. These assessments in the fourth quarter of 2017 included 30 schools built by WBS because they were showing weaknesses in other assessments, along with another 25 schools. That assessment was completed in August of this year. A team and a work plan had to be put in place. I arrived in my job on a Tuesday and got the first report that there was going to be a wall opened in Ardgillan on Thursday afternoon. I got a call at 3 p.m. on Friday to say that there was structural issue with Ardgillan. Obviously there was then concern around all the WBS schools. We are working now. I am working on the information I was given on a Friday at 3 p.m. My first concern was the safety of the students. The Deputy should also remember that once this issue came into the public domain, there was a lot of concern around continuity of education. That is why we set up the team.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom an cheist sin a fhreagairt don Teachta fosta. It is very important to point out that while the fire assessments were being carried out from quarter 4 in 2017 through to the end of August this year, concerns and potential concerns were being highlighted about fire safety issues, including fire walls, fire stops, door jams, etc. However, it was not until the physical invasive works were carried out - they were carried out at Ardgillan over two weeks ago - that structural issues were found. When the former Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, commented that he was satisfied, he was doing so on the understanding the certificates of compliance had been adhered to by the contractor and the designers. He had no way of finding out what was going on inside the cavity walls. We have a very clear example at Ardgillan of an unacceptable level of workmanship. I intend to get to the bottom of that matter and also in the other 42 schools to ensure whatever remedial action is needed will be taken. In terms of taxpayers' money, accountability and culpability, we will pursue every channel to ensure there is accountability in respect of the people who were in the wrong and that they will pay for it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will take the first question from Deputy Brassil. Deputies will find that when people come to me with suggestions and common-sense and practical solutions to issues, I am all ears. I thank the Deputy for raising that issue. It is one that came up in my own county when we were looking at closest distances and the nearest school rule. Roads that were virtually impassable for buses were earmarked as routes. If there are practical solutions concerning distances and the adjacent and non-adjacent rule, I am certainly interested in bringing them into the debate with my officials. I will raise it with them very shortly.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	The Ministers of State, Deputies Mitchell O'Connor and Halligan, have been doing the heavy lifting on this issue since this Government was appointed in 2016. We thought about doing the usual tonight: voting against a motion because Government votes against an Opposition motion, until we realised there are certain elements of it where we are singing from the same hymn sheet. We are all aspiring to get more and we are not there yet but we adopt this position in the interests of being collaborative, as Deputy Curran said, and co-operative because it is an important issue. I acknowledge the role of the Ministers of State in the past two years because it has been a learning experience in the past two weeks to find out how much work has gone on. I served my apprenticeship in Departments with responsibility for communications, the Gaeltacht and foreign affairs and sometimes a Minister of State could be beavering away and coming up with new ideas but nobody would know about it. I commend the work of both these Ministers of State. They have engaged with the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and industry. This is industry and demand led. There was an 80% drop in registration during the recession years. We are moving into a more positive position. I hear the point on the gender issue. That is a real challenge. When I was a secondary school teacher trying to teach mathematics, business studies and geography there were always one or two students who knew when they were 12 or 14 that they were not heading for an academic world but were heading to be plasterers, mechanics or something in the engineering sector. We do have to listen to secondary school students and what they want and where they feel the world of work is going. We have to be robust and both Ministers of State appreciate and understand that. The world of work is changing and there will be different types of work. We do not know where 40% of jobs will be in the next five years.I acknowledge the different organisations, including institutes of technology, the university sector, and the education and training boards, ETBs, in particular. Traditionally, the ETBs had a specific focus on vocational education and they have kept that culture and philosophy. I also acknowledge other schools that offer engineering and crafts. We are looking at changing needs. I learned there are 17 new consortia-led apprenticeships in a variety of sectors, ranging from financial services to logistics, and ICT to hospitality. We have to adapt. Few apprenticeships were developed in the past 20 years. However, by the end of the year, the Government will have almost doubled the number of apprenticeships available and we hope to have reached a figure of 33 by the end of 2019. These sectors all saw the value of offering apprenticeships with a new flexible approach. The State dictated model was not able to be expanded and we are now having the conversation about new possibilities. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaithe as an gcomhoibriú seo. I thank Fianna Fáil for its suggestion on how we can work collaboratively on this issue. The House needs to hold the Government to account but it must also be flexible to ensure we can have debate and bring concrete solutions forward. I acknowledge the great work of my two colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Mitchell O'Connor and Halligan, in the past two years.
