JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Senator Martin and Deputy Duffy. Today we will have an engagement with Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni.The Commissioner will put me right if I am pronouncing that in the wrong way. On behalf of the committee, I welcome the European Commissioner for Economy to our meeting. Before beginning there are some housekeeping matters and the privilege notice. Members and all in attendance are asked to exercise personal responsibility in protecting themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19. They are strongly advised to practice good hand hygiene and leave at least one seat vacant between themselves and others attending the meeting. Attendees should also maintain an appropriate level of social distancing during and after the meeting. Masks, preferably of a medical grade, should be worn at all times during the meeting, except when speaking. I ask for everybody's full co-operation in this. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Mr. Gentiloni to make his opening statement. He is very welcome.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Agus go raibh maith agat. The Commissioner's Irish is excellent. It is the first time I have heard a speech with James Joyce's Ulysses and Brexit in the same speech, so that is an achievement in itself. It is very obvious the Commissioner put much effort into today's presentation, for which we are very grateful. We will now open the meeting up to members. I will call Deputy Seán Haughey, to be followed by Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú. A number of members are attending online, including Deputies Harkin and Howlin, who will follow.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Commissioner is doing good. He is very concise.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is fine.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Ó Murchú, we will come back to you. We have plenty of time. I remind the members that they have to be on the campus to ask questions. I call Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am not sure that Deputy Harkin is on the campus.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to ask questions on your behalf, Deputy Harkin, if you wish to send them to me. I have sent you a message. I call Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry about that, Deputy Howlin. Is Deputy Richmond there? He is not, so Deputy Ó Murchú has the floor again.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Marian Harkin has sent in a question. She is a former Member of the European Parliament whom the Commissioner may have met along the way. She thanks the Commissioner for his presence and his flexible approach to the Stability and Growth Pact. Having listened to inflexible statements for many years on it as an MEP, the Deputy is pleased to hear we will not repeat the mistakes of the past. Her question relates to the taxation of the digital economy. She believes the Commissioner is considering revising some existing directives. She wants to know what specific directives are being looked at. She also wants to know how the Commissioner sees the common consolidated corporate tax base progressing.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Deputy Haughey want to contribute again?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. Deputy Ó Murchú is itching to get back in again. Prior to that, I will make a point. It is good to hear the Commissioner speak in human terms today. I have been reflecting back on the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. We talked about that period ten years ago. There are still people living with, and through, that trauma. The conversation we had was very rigid. It was about deficits and surpluses. We were throwing out billions and banks were being bailed out. Basically, we were taking €5, €10, €15 and €20 out of people's pockets in the form of austerity to the tune of around €28 billion to €30 billion over a period of five years. People are still dealing with that trauma. Are they convinced that something like that is not going to happen again? No, they are not. They are quite concerned, because they are looking at the perfect storm of potential carbon taxes.Fossil fuel, oil and gas prices have gone up in the past few days even and people are concerned. It is reassuring to hear the Commissioner's language regarding the lessons learned from ten years ago and to hear that there will not be a cliff edge in dealing with this crisis. He referred to citizens and no doubt he was thinking of his experience with Italian citizens and how austerity impacted them. How do we assure Irish citizens that, while in the region of €34 billion was borrowed to deal with the pandemic in this country, they will not have to deal with the impact of this crisis in the same way they did with the previous one ten years ago?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. Deputy Ó Murchú is itching to get back in.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious that the Commissioner is due to leave at 6 o'clock and we are not far away from that time. I will perhaps mention something that has been raised a number of times at this committee. We introduced a defective blocks scheme in 2020 for houses that are crumbling because their blocks are defective. It was similar to a pyrite scheme that was introduced in 2013. It was a national catastrophe, which the Government moved in to address. The scheme that was introduced in 2020 did not go far enough for the homeowners, however. It was basically unaffordable. We are talking about thousands of houses. Is this an issue the Commissioner has come across in his own country or in other European Union countries, whereby an issue of defective blocks resulted in cracks appearing in the walls of houses? Many people eventually had to leave their houses and some of these houses have been demolished in the last year. Second, is there a role for the likes of the European Investment Bank in supporting these people?It is very much an issue that is coming close to a conclusion. The Government is working on a plan at the moment to try to accommodate and facilitate people whose lives have been shattered, who feel unsafe in their houses and who basically want to get on with their lives.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Commissioner. I think we are all good. We are all questioned out at this stage.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are really grateful for the Commissioner's time and very appreciative of his openness and frankness. At a time democracy has its challenges in terms of trust in politicians and in the political process, and in the bureaucrats and at an executive level, the more forthcoming we are in terms of being upfront in our honesty, the better. We appreciate that today. To the Commissioner and his team, go raibh míle maith agaibh. I thank them very much. The meeting is now adjourned. The next meeting of the joint committee will be held on Wednesday, 22 September 2021 at 9.30 a.m. in private via Microsoft Teams.
