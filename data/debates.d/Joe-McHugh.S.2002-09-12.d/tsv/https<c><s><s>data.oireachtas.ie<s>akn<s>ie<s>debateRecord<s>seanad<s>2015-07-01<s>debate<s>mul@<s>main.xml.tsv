JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the Senator's concerns in this matter. There is no definition of what constitutes "as low as reasonably practicable", ALARP, set out in either domestic or international legislation. The concept has been considered by the Court of Appeal in the United Kingdom and by the courts in Ireland. The Judiciary has found that for a risk to be determined as ALARP, it must be possible to demonstrate that the cost involved in reducing the risk further would be grossly disproportionate to the benefit gained. The concept of reducing a risk to as low as is reasonably practicable is best practice internationally and the concept is reflected in the offshore safety directive. Providing guidance on what constitutes ALARP is a matter for the Commission for Energy regulation under the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010. That Act places an obligation on the CER to, among other things, establish and implement a risk-based petroleum safety framework which includes standards and a system for assessing safety performance. In 2013, the commission published a document entitled ALARP Guidance, the purpose of which is to provide detailed guidance to petroleum developers on the CER's requirements concerning the processes that must be used to determine whether or not a risk is ALARP. It is the responsibility of the petroleum developer to ensure the cumulative risk from its activities is reduced to a level that is ALARP and to demonstrate this through its safety case. The CER will assess whether that demonstration is adequate given the full array of information provided and having regard to the requirements of the 2010 Act and the safety case guidelines. The ALARP demonstration forms a central part of the safety case submitted by the petroleum developer under the framework. The ALARP guidance is intended to reflect best international practice in this field. In preparing the guidance document, the CER drew on guidance issued by statutory bodies regulating safety in the petroleum exploration and extraction industries internationally, particularly those in the United Kingdom and Australia. The commission may amend the guidance document from time to time to take account of changes in national or international practices. It is important that the concept of ALARP be kept under review and modified periodically to reflect developing practices. Given that the CER has an existing statutory obligation to provide guidance and has already acted in this regard, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will address both points. While the subject we are discussing is broad and complex in its scope, I want to reiterate that the Bill is narrow legislation. Many proposals were implemented through legislation in 2010. On gas flaring, for the purpose of clarity and context, I would like to establish that the transposition of the offshore safety directive which is the purpose of the Bill is to ensure there is consistent regulation throughout Europe with respect to the potential for a major petroleum incident. The flaring of gas is a technology that has more than one purpose. For example, in the case of a gas processing terminal, the flaring of gas can be necessary for safety reasons. When industrial plant equipment items are over pressured, the pressure relief valve is an essential safety device that automatically releases gasses and sometimes liquids. Those pressure relief valves are required by industrial design codes and standards. Any application to flare is subject to safety case assessment and permission from the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, together with subsequent verification and auditing procedures. More generally, where gas flaring is contentious, it is where the technology is used in the context of a producing oil field. Gas that is produced with the oil is then sometimes flared as producing the gas would not be commercially viable. In Ireland, we do not, unfortunately, have oil production. If we have commercial oil development in the future and the flaring of gas was to be proposed, it would be subject to an environmental impact assessment, including public consultation.  Regarding unconventional gas, with regard to the conduct of unconventional gas exploration and exploitation, the offshore safety directive relates only to offshore oil and gas activities. Accordingly, this Bill relates solely to the safety regime that applies to petroleum exploration and production activities in the offshore area and has no implications whatsoever for unconventional gas exploration and exploitation. It should also be noted that a multi-agency transboundary programme of research on the potential impacts on the environment and human health from unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects or operations has been commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency. That work is ongoing and it is not expected to report until the middle of 2016 at the earliest.  The research programme is broad in its scope, covering several environmental parameters, as well as operational practice and regulatory approaches around the world. It would be untimely, at this point, to pre-empt the outcome of this research by prematurely seeking to introduce legislation without being fully informed on the findings of the research programme. The issue has been raised today and Senator Feargal Quinn raised it last week when he called for ongoing debate, which could not be anything but good. However, because the flaring of gas and unconventional gas exploration is outside the scope of the Bill, I do not propose to accept the amendments.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Section 7 imposes a range of obligations regarding petroleum undertakings on operators and owners. These obligations include an obligation on an operator or owner to take suitable measures, including suspending an activity where the activity poses an immediate danger to human health or significantly increases the risk of a major accident.  Section 15(2) already provides that where an operator or owner takes such a measure, it shall notify the CER within 24 hours. The section also provides that the CER can determine the form such a notification should take and what information should accompany it. As there is an existing provision to report to the CER, this amendment is unnecessary and, therefore, I do not propose to accept it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The focus of the Bill is safety and the prevention of major accidents related to oil and gas exploration and production activities. I accept the Senator's point about current momentum in the context of the current round of the Atlantic margin ending in mid-September next. However, I must again reiterate that the focus of the Bill is specifically safety and regulation of oil and gas exploration and production activities.  Regulation of metering is principally an economic regulatory function. Under the existing regime for oversight of metering, prior to the installation or modification of metering the detailed specifications of all metering stations must be submitted for approval by my Department. Metering stations may also be subject to inspection by my Department. In addition, detailed records of all meter calibrations and checks of equipment for accuracy must be retained and made available for inspection and verification. Metering of petroleum volumes also constitutes part of the safety management systems described in any developer safety case which is required to be assessed by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. It should be noted that all equipment operated under licence or statutory consent is the subject of a safety case assessment and verification and auditing procedures by the CER. As this activity falls within the current assessment regime, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree on the need to learn from past mistakes. No greater mistake was made than that in respect of the construction industry. The old adage that those who fail to plan plan to fail comes to mind. I agree with the overall principle of the Senator's argument. It is important, however, to point out that in the history of the State only four fines have been issued in respect of commercial production.  In regard to whether the State or the company should bear the cost of works in this area, the decommissioning regime currently in place in respect of the Kinsale and Corrib gas fields is based on the full cost of decommissioning being borne by the holders of the petroleum lease and not the State. Licensees are also obliged to provide an outline of plans and timeframe for decommissioning of the facilities, including full details of the methods, timing and cost of decommissioning, which are included in a separate facilities decommissioning plan. This plan must be agreed with the Minister early in the life of a producing field and is then subject to review over the lifetime of the field. Such plans will generally make provision for a financial formula relative to reserves left in the field versus the cost of producing those reserves. This provides a trigger for the decommissioning process. Provision is also made for the obligation on all parties to the lease to post a decommissioning security once the decommissioning process has been triggered. A petroleum lease also includes a condition that requires a parent guarantee, which means that a deed of guarantee and an indemnity in favour of the Minister must be given by each licensee. This, in effect, means that the Minister has the authority to call on this guarantee in the event of a breach of the lease condition, including obligations with regard to decommissioning.  This Bill is focused on safety and the prevention of major accidents and the question of liability for the cost of decommissioning is already addressed elsewhere. I do not, therefore, propose to accept the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are a lot of broader issues being discussed. As I stated, it is a complex issue. There is no harm in raising the issues and, at a different stage, having these debates. There is a safety regime that has been agreed to, with a system of fines for companies that are not following the proper implementation of that safety regime. The issue of environmental damage is separate from this legislation. It is merely a fine for failure to ensure that the safety case and safety management system are implemented. As I said, there is a separation. This is not the section that addresses liability for environmental damage arising from petroleum activities. The fine has no bearing on environmental pollution or clean-up costs relating to a major petroleum hazard, to which I will refer. As for the amount of the fine, it is set at €3 million for an instance of non-compliance with a safety case or safety management system. This is considered proportionate and is consistent with the provisions of the existing fines set out in the Petroleum (Exploration and Extraction) Safety Act 2010. Turning to the question of liability, section 7(9) of the Bill which transposes Article 7 of the directive provides that "a petroleum undertaking is financially liable for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage". The Bill does not propose a limit on such liability. More generally, section 22(2) of the Bill provides that in assessing an application for any authorisation, the Minister must consider, among other matters, the ability of the applicant "to meet the costs for the immediate launch and uninterrupted continuation of all measures for effective emergency response and subsequent remediation in the event of a major accident". The Minister must also be satisfied that the applicant for an authorisation has "put in place appropriate insurance, indemnity provision or other financial assurance instruments to cover liabilities potentially deriving from the particular petroleum activity or activities in question". As the Bill needs to provide guidance on the maximum level of fines that may apply, I do not propose to accept the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The purpose of these technical amendments is to correct typographical errors in the cross-referencing of sections within the Bill. I commend them to the House.Government amendment No. 8:In page 27, lines 11 and 12, to delete "section 13KC(2)" and substitute "section 13KC(3)".
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will try to be as co-operative as possible. Every company has bought into a safety regime and companies will have their triggering and alert systems. That is done straightaway, but this provision is about providing a report. It is not a one-line or two-line message stating an incident has happened at such and such a place. It refers to a full and extensive report. The purpose of the Bill, to elaborate on the matter a little, is to transpose the offshore safety directive into domestic law to ensure that there is consistency in the regulation of safety with respect to petroleum activities throughout EU member states. Section 15(2) of the Bill is a direct transposition of a provision in the directive, which states: Where an activity carried out by an operator or an owner poses an immediate danger to human health or significantly increases the risk of a major accident, Member States shall ensure that the operator or the owner takes suitable measures which may include, if deemed necessary, suspending the relevant activity until the danger or risk is adequately controlled. Member States shall ensure that where such measures are taken, the operator or the owner notifies the competent authority accordingly without delay and no later than 24 hours after taking those measures.The purpose of this provision is twofold. First, its intention is to ensure the owner and operator are bound by these obligations. Second, the primary function is to ensure that immediate action is taken to address the cause of any imminent danger and that the company concerned, having done so, notifies the regulator as soon as possible thereafter. The directive requires immediate notification in the event of a petroleum incident. It requires notification within 24 hours where an operator or owner takes suitable measures, including suspending an activity where the activity poses an immediate danger to human health or significantly increases the risk of a major accident. With the prescribed timelines, the directive differentiates between an incident that has actually occurred and a potential danger that an owner or operator has acted to address. It is reasonable, therefore, that the text of the directive be transposed into Irish law as set out. On this basis, I do not propose to accept the amendment. On the face of it, I appreciate the argument Senator Mark Daly put forward. However, it is important to point out that the reporting mechanism is not a telephone call or a one-line e-mail. It is a full report of what the company did and how the owner or parent company implemented its safety plan within that short period of time, which, obviously, might mean shutting down operations.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will address the point which may put the Leas-Chathaoirleach at ease also. If an incident occurs it is a case of instant notification. That is the prescription for a potential incident but, obviously, the focus is on preventing it from happening. Within that 24-hour period, a full written report of what happened has to be provided. I assure the Senator that if an incident occurs off the coast of Cork, there is instant notification in that regard. I want to have that matter clarified.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not propose to accept the amendment, but if the Senator wants me to read my reply for clarification purposes, I will do so.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I propose to discuss amendments Nos. 10 and 11 together.  Article 26 of the directive relates to an investigation following a major accident. It provides that member states shall initiate thorough investigations of major accidents occurring in their jurisdictions. A summary of the findings pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be made available to the European Commission either at the conclusion of the investigation or at the conclusion of legal proceedings, as appropriate, and the member state concerned shall make a non-confidential version of the findings publicly available. The concept of a non-confidential version of the investigation report is to ensure the publication of the findings of such an investigation is not delayed due to ongoing legal proceedings or enforcement action. It also recognises that an investigation will have access to information that may be commercially sensitive. The approach proposed in sections 16 and 17 is fully consistent with the directive.  It is also worth noting that the Bill provides for a mechanism through which the Minister can give consent to the publication by the CER of a non-confidential version of a report in the normal way. It would be open to the Minister to publish a report when received. In making such a decision, the Minister would have to consider whether commercially sensitive or other confidential material should be published.  As the relevant provisions of the Bill represent a positive initiative with the intention of ensuring the fullest possible information is provided as soon as possible, I do not propose to accept the amendments.
