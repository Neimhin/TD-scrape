JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When is it proposed to take the merchant shipping (miscellaneous provisions) Bill?  The Minister will be familiar with this legislation from his previous ministerial role.  I have raised this matter — which is also relevant to you, a Cheann Comhairle — because at the moment there is a complete embargo on investment in the Valentia and Malin Head coastguard stations.  In light of deliberations, decisions have still to be made as to whether the coastguard stations will continue, be discontinued or moved elsewhere.  There is complete confusion over whether further investment will be made in these stations.  When will the maritime safety Bill be enacted?  If the Department does not spend on the appropriate infrastructure and telecommunications in both these stations, lives will be put at risk at sea.
