JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Tánaiste to comment on the value added tax consolidation Bill.  The optional use of reduced VAT in certain sectors is one of the actions identified by the economic recovery plan approved by the European Council in December 2008.  Following agreement by ECOFIN on 10 March 2009, this took the form of a directive.  In light of the Government making a dog's dinner of this matter and the creation of a VAT anomaly on a cross-Border basis, which has been commented on by Fianna Fáil backbenchers as far away as Cork——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——will the Government consider harmonising tax in consultation with the British Chancellor of the Exchequer or will this be done in the form of the directive from Europe?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I emphasise the need for calm and sensitivity in this debate.  It is a very raw matter for many people and couples.  There is another element in that there are many post-adoptive families and I am acutely aware of the sensitivities in this regard.We need to hear stories.  I have one from the mother of a lady in my constituency who is in this process and finds herself very much in limbo.  On public radio the mother said this should not be a political issue and should be dealt with in a cross-party way as much as possible.  Is there anything the Minister of State feels the Opposition side can do?  There is not much to be gained by shouting across the benches because of the sensitivity around the issue.  From speaking to colleagues about this I wonder if we can sit down calmly and rationally and deal with the future parents who find themselves in this limbo.  It is horrific, a horror story.  I had a connection with parents whose adoption process broke down some years ago.  It is likened to a form of bereavement.We must be measured but bold in our ambition concerning what we can and should do.  There are legal parameters — and I know the Minister of State has a report sitting on his desk since August — and the legal issues will take time to resolve.  On this side of the bench, and including the former spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, who spoke to the Minister of State prior to this Adjournment motion, we have the legal expertise to find a solution to this.  I do not know how to go forward with this, either singularly or as a politician in Opposition.  The area is raw and emotional and is much too sensitive.  I cannot even begin to understand it.  All politicians can do at the moment is empathise but we must be bold, measured and deliberate in trying to put something together to bring these possible future parents out of limbo.
