JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	We announced the summer scheme, something I committed to doing before Christmas.I also committed to doing minor works before Christmas to give schools a better lead-in time. We announced â‚¬307 million for both primary and secondary schools. I want to give a better lead-in time so we are planning for the summer 2020 works. Applications for both internal and external categories, which cover categories 7 to 10, inclusive, will be open for schools to apply for early in the new year.
