JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	At the outset, I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes on tabling this important and timely motion.  However, had the Minister's predecessor the wherewithal or foresight to roll out the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act in time, this debate would not be taking place because the overarching right of each child with special needs would supersede any debate in this House and any motion that my colleague, Deputy Hayes, might table.  I wish to focus on the EPSEN Act aspect of this debate tonight.As legislators, Members have a role to honour the commitment to the rights of the child with special needs.  The rights of the child must be honoured because at present there is pure mockery of such rights nationwide, arising from the limbo in which parents, teachers and principals find themselves as to where they will stand in September and whether a special needs assistant will be available or alternatively, whether the special educational needs organiser, SENO will in August put a pen through different schools and resources and state they will not be available.  This limbo must be dealt with and the only way to so do it is by rolling out the EPSEN Act.While this cloud hangs over special needs, the national council still exists.  One could perceive it in a cynical manner, just as the Government has done a great job in distancing itself for the HSE.  County councillors and candidates from Government parties will claim that issues raised have nothing to do with either the Department of Health and Children or the Government as they are the responsibility of the HSE.  I can envisage the same thing happening in respect of the National Council for Special Education, whereby people nationwide will claim that issues are the fault not of the Department or the Minister but that the council is to blame.  This has happened and is happening nationwide.Members need conclusive evidence from the Minister that there will not be a reduction in the roll-out of special needs assistants because I have heard figures of reductions of 25% through the grapevine.  The grapevine is never far wrong, where there is smoke there is fire and Members require clarification that this will not happen.  The NCSE knows its role, knows what it must do and is familiar with the policy.  However, the Minister, not the council is in charge.  The buck passing, grey areas and fudge between the Department and the NCSE must end before progress can be made in this area.I will provide an example of the bureaucratic monster that has been created within the Department of Education and Science, the details of which I can supply later to the Minister.  It concerns a principal in a school with a child who has challenging educational needs.  The principal was obliged to apply in November but did not get word by February and still does not have word as to where the child stands.  This type of logjam must disappear.  As for the Minister's position, his response regarding capital projects, disabilities and all elements of education is that there is no money.  That response is not good enough, as creative solutions exist.  Such an answer is not good enough at a time when speech therapists and recently graduated teachers are on the dole queues.  Creative solutions are needed and as the Minister is in charge, he must face up to his responsibilities.
