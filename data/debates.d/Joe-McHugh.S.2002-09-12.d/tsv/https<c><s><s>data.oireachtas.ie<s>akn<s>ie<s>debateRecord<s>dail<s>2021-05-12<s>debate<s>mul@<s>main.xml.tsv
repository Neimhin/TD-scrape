JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On Saturday, 1 May, during a bank holiday weekend, an impromptu meeting was organised at very short notice between the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, NPHET officials, Dr. Tony Holohan, Dr. Ronan Glynn and HSE officials. I thank those who represented these organisations and the Ministers for organising this impromptu meeting, which was constructive. The proof was in the pudding a few days later when test centres were rolled out. It was a very important intervention. It is important to point out the community in Donegal has reacted very positively over the past week to ten days to ensure we continue to try to suppress the virus. Businesses are responding in a very proactive way and are getting ready for a busy tourism season. My question is on the vaccine roll-out. We have incredible proactivity among GP surgeries. Today, I spoke to one medical practice that has not wasted one vaccine. The centre in Letterkenny needs to move to a seven-day week. The rule on retired GPs over 70 not being allowed to administer vaccines has to be looked at again.
