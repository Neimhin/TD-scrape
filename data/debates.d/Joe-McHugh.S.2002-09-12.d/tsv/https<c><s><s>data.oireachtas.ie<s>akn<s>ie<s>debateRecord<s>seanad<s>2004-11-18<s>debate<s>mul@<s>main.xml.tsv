JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with my colleague, Deputy Brian Hayes, on the issue of the smoking ban. It is appropriate to the Border counties where business has been affected given that the smoking ban operates on the southern side and not on the northern side. Given the importance of maintaining the momentum of the peace process the uniformity of the smoking ban needs to be addressed.I agree with my colleagues, Senators O'Toole and Ryan, on the matter of the Irish language. The cost of translation services was raised in an article in The Irish Times by my colleague, Deputy Deasy, during the summer. When the Irish language Bill was going through the House we discussed value for money and the need for a sensible Bill because we do not want millions of euro wasted on a translation service. That will not help the Irish language and it will not encourage people to learn it. An example can be highlighted here today. This House is being provided with a service, of which we were all notified yesterday, involving a CD and different pamphlets encouraging us as political representatives to learn the Irish language. There are challenges for the Irish language Bill and Senator Ó Murchú will agree there are opportunities to involve people in learning Irish. People talk about learning the Irish language, their willingness and their hope one day to have a conversation in Irish or even to be able to utter a few sentences in Irish. The means to do this through courses, etc., must be provided. That is the challenge.
