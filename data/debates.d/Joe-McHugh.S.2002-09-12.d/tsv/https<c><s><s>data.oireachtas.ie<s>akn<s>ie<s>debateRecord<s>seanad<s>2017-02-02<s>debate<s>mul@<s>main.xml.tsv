JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as an gceist tábhachtach seo a chur faoin tseirbhís thar a bheith tábhachtach ar son muintir na hÉireann sa Bhreatain.  By way of background, in September 2014, RTE announced plans to shut down its longwave 252 service, which enables RTE Radio 1 to be broadcast into Britain. While the initial plan was for the longwave 252 service to close on 27 October 2014, it was further deferred until 19 January 2015. On 18 December 2014 a decision was taken to continue long wave radio services until 2017. Following this announcement, the Government’s emigrant support programme which is administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade supported research into listenership figures in Britain for RTE's longwave 252 service. The purpose of the research was to obtain concrete data for the current listenership and also to explore the possibility of continuing the service using alternate technologies. The research was conducted by the Social Policy Research Centre at Middlesex University which was appointed following a competitive tender process run by Irish in Britain, the national representative organisation for the Irish community in England, Scotland and Wales. Information was gathered through individual and group submissions and focus groups. Overseeing the research was a consultative group of key stakeholders which was composed of representatives of RTE, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials based in Dublin and at the Embassy of Ireland in London and representatives of the Irish community in Britain. The figures show that of 3,191 people who completed the individual surveys, 72% of those who responded were over 60 years, 68% of respondents were born in Ireland, while 62% were retired. For the majority of respondents, the long wave service was seen as a lifeline to Ireland, helping them to maintain a sense of Irishness and keep up with events back home. The majority of listeners in the focus groups preferred the familiar, analogue service, as opposed to digital platforms, computers, laptops and smartphones. The Government recognises the special value placed on RTE's longwave 252 service by some Irish citizens in Britain, especially the elderly, and my Department is working closely with RTE to ensure the views of this community are heard in any decision-making process. While any decision on the future of long wave services in Britain is ultimately an operational matter for RTE, it can, as a result of the study, now be informed by awareness of the role the service plays in preserving and enhancing links with Ireland and keeping Irish people living in Britain informed of important events and developments such as the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union and the Irish Government’s position. A meeting of the consultative group will take place in London next week in order to discuss the next steps to be taken, explore possible ways forward In the context of maintaining the link with audiences in Britain and keeping the Irish community involved in decision-making. I am hopeful a positive outcome can be achieved.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Out of respect for the Senator's global reach which is not just confined to the United Kingdom, there is an intensive effort to continue the dialogue and conversation with all front-line services in America. It also continues at a political level in the US Senate and House of Representatives. The Senator is involved in that effort. He took part in a very important meeting in America on 12 January. The meetings with the consulates and the embassy are so important. In the context of what we can control in terms of the budget, €2.3 million was allocated as part of last year's programme to the emigrant support service. We support many emigrant support services, be they in San Diego, San Francisco, Boston or New York, and we need to continue that support. We also need to continue work to maintain our strong relationship with the United States. When the Taoiseach travels to the White House on 17 March, it is going to be about that relationship. Foremost in the mind of every politician, including my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, who is in the United States this week, are the undocumented. It is a top priority and will continue to be. It was my priority when I was in San Francisco, New York and Boston. I am due to go again - the Senator will be joining me- to visit the the east coast and we have to make it a priority because there are people who feel vulnerable. We have to ensure the relationship between Ireland and the United States will continue, in a similar vein to the Senator's comments on the relationship with the United Kingdom. They are two separate issues but one and the same in keeping relationships strong.
