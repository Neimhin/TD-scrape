JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Leader request the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to investigate management systems at Glenveagh national park in light of employee dissatisfaction? Will he investigate as a matter of priority recruitment processes, employee satisfaction and the promotional methods used as a result of the amalgamation of the management structure at that State park which has changed in the last three years?On rail transport, it is a shame this Seanad was not sitting prior to the closure of the Sligo to Donegal rail line because it seems we are all in agreement to keep the present rail system. As Senator Dooley said, maybe we should consider reopening that line.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, to her new position and congratulate her as a fellow Donegal person. I wish her well and hope she will have some form of inspiration that will help her through the difficult task ahead of her. I also welcome the other two Ministers of State who are here this evening. On a point of clarification, Deputy Michael Noonan, the former leader of Fine Gael, was not the Minister for Finance in 1997—
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have to look at social inclusion from a holistic point of view. We cannot debate social inclusion in the House by bringing in any one Minister or any one Department. We must look at the Tánaiste's Department and at Departments which are in charge of training, budgeting and education. Rather than talking about this broad issue generally, I would like to home in on a couple of areas.Economics is about booms and troughs. An economy cannot continue indefinitely on an upward curve. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, while they were in Government, enjoyed a boom period. Where do these economic booms emanate from? There are various contributory factors, such as our education levels, our talented population, our industrialists and membership of the European Union. There is no single indicator. These two parties happened to be in Government during an economic boom. When you are in Government and are enjoying the fruits of a boom, there will be money in the kitty to distribute. We, as a society, did not capitalise during that boom period in terms of social inclusion and sustaining social inclusion.I wish to refer to community employment schemes, a matter not within the remit of the Minister's Department. Community employment schemes were an idea set up through FÁS to bring people off the live register, to train them in different skills and to give them confidence in re-entering the market. The last Government contributed towards these schemes when it had the money and the supervisors were dotted around the country.People who came off the live register joined the schemes, gained the confidence and learnt the skills, and the vast majority of these people are employed today. However, the Minister, Deputy Mary Coughlan, is now faced with the problem that there was no thought or foresight put into how to sustain community employment schemes. I have a meeting with supervisors in Donegal next week to discuss cut-backs in these schemes. It is acceptable to talk about what was done but the sustainability of these schemes has not been addressed. Supervisors who have mortgages no longer have jobs. People on the live register – and the number is increasing – will not now have the opportunity for training on smaller schemes. This crucial issue was not considered during the economic boom of the last four or five years.Every housing estate, local authority owned or otherwise, in urban areas had a vibrant, hard working voluntary sector which helped communities by taking underage football, helping pensioners and so on. These committees and voluntary groups existed before the boom and were an asset to the country. However, as a result of the boom we have problems with our voluntary sector because during the previous Government's term in office jobs were given to the paid sector – to youth workers and co-ordinators of community development projects. These were great jobs, some of them worth €40,000 or €50,000 a year but the paid workers went into the communities and the voluntary sector began to fall apart. Volunteers questioned why they should work for nothing when others were being paid. No thinking went into the sustainability of voluntary communities in urban estates. When cutbacks begin, the first people to lose their jobs will be the paid workers in these estates so we will have not only lost the voluntary sector but the paid sector too. This is due to the lack of foresight in relation to sustainability.Anyone who studies the basics of economics knows that it is about booms and troughs rather than what party is in power – be it Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats happened to be in Government when pensions were increased. This is hardly surprising given the economic boom. Of course Fine Gael was not in a position to hand out as much as the last Government because when that party was in Government we were in a trough. We need to be honest as political parties and stop attacking one another about the events of 15 years ago or two months ago. We need to get to grips with the realities of economics, to talk about social inclusion in holistic terms and work with all Departments in harmony – Education and Science, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs – to examine how we can make a sustainably more equal society and look to the long term rather than to this election or the next.I thank the Minster of State for coming to the House to listen and if there is anything we, on this side of the House, can offer in terms of advice or contribution, we will be more than willing.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was referring to Donegal.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of information, the two points are not related.
