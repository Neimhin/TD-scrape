JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Thank you very much, a Chathaoirligh.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his kind words this morning. My Department's decision to acquire the site was taken in the context of a review of demographics of the area which demonstrated a substantial projected growth in enrolment, known limited land availability and the impending sale. From a school provision perspective, this site is well located to serve south Dublin city. In March 2017 my Department requested of the Irish Greyhound Board, that the DPER Circular 11/15: Protocols for the Transfer and Sharing of State Property Assets be followed to advance the acquisition. This circular requires the Valuation Office to provide a determination of market value of the property to be disposed which is binding on both the disposing and acquiring Government Department or State body. The Valuation Office is an independent office which provides independent and impartial market valuations. It is staffed by civil servants. The Valuation Office completed its valuation on the Harold's Cross site in April 2017 in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation professional standards and international valuation standards. The valuation took into account, among other things, an analysis of the existing market, the property's zoning relative to residential values and the need to clear the site of existing structures. The Valuation Office report concluded that the site had a market value of €23 million. In May 2017, a formal offer was made by my Department to the Irish Greyhound Board for the site in line with this binding valuation. The acquisition was completed in May 2018. In the interests of transparency I have arranged for the Valuation Office report and an update from the office related to that valuation that was received by my Department earlier this week to be published on my Department's website.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The first question I asked when I was briefed on the issue yesterday was if there were any property value comparisons in the area because I wanted to get my head around it. The sum of €23 million for 6 acres is big money. The Valuation Office concluded in April 2017 that the appropriate market valuation for the site was €23 million, which breaks down to €3.8 million an acre. To place the valuation in context, subsequent to the valuation report I understand that a 3.43 acre site on Harold's Cross Road, about 1 km from the site, achieved a price in excess of €15 million, or more than €4.367 million an acre, in mid-2017. That is only one example which provides a context. I reiterate what Deputy Thomas Byrne said about transparency and the independence of the Valuation Office, which is made up of civil servants. I know the Deputy is not questioning the office's valuation, but he does raise a very important issue in the context of the overall bundle of money that is available that the sum of €23 million is sizeable.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to ask the officials to look at the matter again. There has been ongoing engagement on the site going back to 2016. I hope the information which will be provided on the website tomorrow morning will be comprehensive but if Deputy Thomas Byrne needs further information I will be happy to work him. The issue is new to me as of yesterday and I have been briefing myself on it. One thing I have learned is that when there is a sale from one State body to another they are removed from the equation and that is the reason it was so important to set up the Valuation Office, which is an important bridge in that regard. I can ask one of my officials to phone the Deputy if needs be.The information will be on the website tomorrow morning.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy and I look forward to working with her. I will reiterate what I said at the committee this morning. I see the committee providing a key role in my roadmapping and in how I perform my duties as Minister. I am certain about the knowledge the committee has built up during the past two and a half years. I want to continue with the conversation and bring it in to the construct that we are trying to put together for 2019. We want to work on a plan for 2019 but I want to have a more defined three-year action plan as well. I look forward to working with Deputy Funchion in that regard. School transport is a significant operation managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department. Bus Éireann is required to apply the rules of the scheme equitably in the interests of all those using the service and in delivering value for money. The purpose of the school transport scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside in remote areas from their nearest school. In the 2017-18 school year in excess of 117,000 children, including more than 12,000 children with special educational needs, were transported in more than 4,500 vehicles every day to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country covering in excess of 100 million km annually at a total cost of almost €190 million in 2017. The scheme is under significant financial pressure arising from growing demographics and the increasing numbers of children with special educational needs seeking transport. Children are eligible for school transport if they satisfy the distance criteria, if they are attending their nearest school and if it is economically feasible to provide a service. In the latter case, children are eligible for a remote area grant to assist with transport. Children who are eligible for school transport and who have completed the application process on time have been accommodated on school transport services for the current school year where such services are in operation. Children who are not eligible for school transport can be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated. Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available Bus Éireann allocates tickets for the spare seats on the basis of an agreed selection process.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The terms of the scheme, which are regularly communicated, make it clear that concessionary places are not guaranteed and are allocated year to year. It is understood that the cases referred to by the Deputy relate to children who are not eligible under the rules of the scheme or who failed to complete the application process on time. Under the terms of the scheme, routes will not be extended or altered, additional vehicles will not be introduced, and larger vehicles or extra trips using existing vehicles will not be provided to cater for ineligible children. Making exceptions to this would effectively create an open-ended scheme with unquantified exposure to the Exchequer and the taxpayer for the resulting cost. Such an approach would not be in the public interest.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the frustration of Deputy Funchion on this issue. I realise we are well into the first term. I can understand how frustrating this can be for parents. I will provide some background for the three areas in question. I will suggest something then that Deputy Funchion may decide for or against. Currently, three school transport services operate from the Paulstown and Gowran areas to Kilkenny city post-primary centre. Bus Éireann has confirmed that six children who are eligible for school transport did not submit payment details by the deadline. A total of 14 children who are not eligible for school transport were unsuccessful in obtaining seats for the 2018-19 school year. In Ballyhale there are two school transport services operating in the national school in Ballyhale. Bus Éireann has confirmed that three of the children who were eligible for school transport did not submit payment details by the deadline. A total of 12 children who are not eligible for school transport were unsuccessful in obtaining seats for the 2018-19 school year. However, under one of the transport services there are two trips in the afternoon: one at 2 p.m. and one at 3 p.m. A total of 11 of the 12 ineligible children have received tickets on the afternoon service only. The Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, has been working on this issue in several locations throughout the country. He is open to engaging with communities. He is not in the country at the moment but I will certainly ask him to meet Deputy Funchion to establish if there is any way that a local solution can be found to this important matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to speak to the Minister of State. I know several of my colleagues have contacted me on the matter as well. Maybe we can have a cross-party group meeting with the Minister of State to see if, as Deputy Funchion pointed out, there is a local solution. That is something I would be happy to pursue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy has pointed out, my Department provided a comprehensive update to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills, of which he is a member, on 30 September last and has committed to providing updates regularly on the status of the 42 new schools to be provided over the next four years from 2019 to 2022. The current focus for my Department is to prioritise the 17 schools opening in 2019 so that patrons can be appointed and accommodation solutions can be put in place as soon as possible. My Department has appointed a project manager to assist this work, and potential interim accommodation solution options have been identified for the majority of the 17 schools. My Department's design and build programme will be the main delivery mechanism for providing permanent accommodation for the 42 new schools. A procurement process is under way to facilitate the appointment of a project manager who will assist my Department in the provision of permanent accommodation for the new schools to be established from 2020 onwards. A patronage process is ongoing in respect of the four post-primary schools due to open in 2019 and I expect to make an announcement shortly in this regard. A patronage process for the primary schools due to open in 2019 will commence shortly thereafter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Parents like certainty when it comes to knowing which school their children will attend. It is something I take very seriously. On ways by which the system can be improved, I will be making an announcement shortly. I am saying this publicly as the Deputy needs that certainty. There are five post-primary schools, namely, those in Donaghamede, Howth, Galway city, Laytown and Wicklow, included in the 2019 bundle, but we also have the other 17. The Deputy also asked when the process to decide the patronage of the other schools would start. I will initiate a conversation with my officials in that regard to set the process in place.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Before I get to that point, interim measures, an issue the Deputy raised in his first question, will also be needed. It should be noted that, where necessary, an initial start-up phase is envisaged for the new schools. It will typically involve the use of interim accommodation as part of my Department's forward planning. This is the first time the requirement for new schools has been set out over a four-year horizon. It will provide for a better lead-in period in the planning and delivery of permanent accommodation solutions. To return to the question of patronage which is important in the context of the lead-in time, parents' choices and delivering certainty, an online patronage processing system has been developed by the Department to provide objective information for all parents which will allow them to make informed choices about their preferred model of patronage for their child's education. Parental preferences were previously collected based on direct engagement with patron bodies. I take the Deputy's point about lead-in times and the mechanisms involved. They are matters on which I will be happy to work with him.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy is aware, the school to which she refers is included in my Department’s six-year construction programme. The acquisition of a suitable site is required to facilitate the project. With the assistance of officials in Fingal County Council under the memorandum of understanding for the acquisition of school sites, a number of site options were identified. They were comprehensively assessed and a preferred site option has been identified. Negotiations with the landowner on the proposed acquisition of the site are ongoing. The Deputy will appreciate that negotiations on school site acquisitions can be complex and price is only one of multiple aspects which need to be agreed. Nonetheless, officials are working to bring matters to a conclusion at the earliest possible date. Owing to commercial sensitivities in site acquisitions generally, the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to provide further details at this time, but I can confirm that the school patron is being kept apprised of developments in the site acquisition process. In the interim, since September the school has been based on a temporary basis at the former Institute of Horology property on Mill Road, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Unfortunately, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, I am not in a position to offer the clarity the parents want. However, we have a new system in place under a memorandum of understanding between the Department and local authorities which act on behalf of the Department in negotiations. I have no doubt that that the Deputy raising the matter publicly in the House will focus the minds of officials in Fingal to ensure a speedy resolution of this matter. I reiterate that the local authorities act on behalf of the Department in negotiations on the acquisition and purchase of land.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry for repeating myself but the site acquisition process is complex, as the Deputy knows. It is subject to completion of successful negotiation and conveyancing processes. Given the complexities involved, I am not able to give a timeframe for the completion of acquisition today and I would be disingenuous in doing so. I and my officials will endeavour to bring the process to a conclusion as soon as possible. I understand the frustration on the part of parents, young teenagers and younger children who are looking forward to a new school. This is something that I am very conscious of.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. I remember that day very well and also the Deputy quoting Mark Twain. I think the quote was about the two most important times in our lives being the day we are born and the day we find out why we were born. I will not say what the Deputy told me about that second day but she may tell her constituents in private. She did not say she was born to meet me, to be clear - she gave a different reason. I agree with the Deputy that this is a really important area. The special needs assistant scheme has been a major factor in ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and the provision of support to pupils enrolled in special schools and classes. This support is very much valued by students, parents and schools, as they provide an indispensable service. Increased investment has allowed the Government to increase the number of SNAs by 42%, from 10,575 in 2011 to 15,000 by the end of this year. A further 950 SNA posts are being made available for allocation in budget 2019, increasing employment opportunities in this important field of employment. The current public service collective industrial relations agreement, known as the public service stability agreement, PSSA, was reached with the public service trade unions in June 2017 and is due to run until 31 December 2020. The pay benefits of the PSSA range progressively from 7.2% to 6.2% over the three years from 2018 to 2020. At the end of the agreement, FEMPI pay cuts will have been restored in full to 90% of all public servants. With regard to the issue of new entrant pay, the measures recently agreed between the parties to the PSSA provide a credible pathway to addressing new entrant pay and represent a fair and reasonable outcome for the approximately 5,000 new entrant SNA recruits since January 2011. My Department has put in place supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs on foot of proposals brought forward by the Labour Relations Commission. These arrangements give priority to serving special needs assistants when work is being allocated and enhance the SNAs’ working conditions. The arrangement has been demonstrated to work effectively for SNAs and schools.  In 2016, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was requested to lead a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme. The review set out to ensure that the scheme is achieving the best outcomes possible for children with special educational needs, supported by the special needs assistants. The review was published on 30 May 2018.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
One of the review’s recommendations is for a new allocation model which would front-load supports into schools. Such a model would remove the existing need for assessments for many students and ensure the support is available to them as soon as they arrive in school. If implemented, it would also substantially further improve job security for SNAs in schools, ensuring greater certainty for them regarding their employment status. The review also recommends ongoing professional development options for SNAs be provided. The training and development recommendations made by the NCSE review are in recognition of the fundamental importance of building schools’ capacity to meet additional care needs of students. These and other recommendations of the review are currently under consideration. I am committed to the continued effective operation of the SNA scheme in consultation with education partners.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for her observations about the importance of SNAs in schools. I know we talk about the broader global figures, which will exceed 15,000 in 2019, but I place a high value on the work SNAs do and have gained insight into how they contribute to the overall running of the schools. They play a vital role. We need to provide them with certainty and ensure that they have proper conditions. That is why the review published on 30 May 2018 was so important. Once we publish a review there is a series of recommendations so the hard work of choices starts now. These and other recommendations of the review are under consideration. There are a couple of elements to highlight, such as continuing professional development options for SNAs and ensuring that we substantially improve job security for SNAs in schools, providing greater certainty in respect of their employment status. I also raise another matter publicly today, one which I raised with my officials on my first morning on the job. There are issues and weaknesses in every organisation. One area which I highlighted when in opposition, and on which I will be happy to work with colleagues across the House, is the position of secretaries in primary schools. Their contracts stop at the end of the school term, as do their pension entitlements. This issue, which I have been aware of since I was first elected to the House in 2007, has not been addressed either. I do not want to create expectations that it will be addressed but I will say that primary school secretaries, as well as SNAs, perform an integral role in schools. I want to work on this issue and I would be happy to hear my colleagues' opinions on it in the time ahead.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The recommendations are under consideration and in the meetings and briefing sessions - my head is about to explode with all the briefing sessions I have had between yesterday and today - SNAs were a subject of those conversations. We will give the recommendations in-depth analysis and ensure they are given proper and adequate consideration.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No pressure. I thank the Deputy for raising the question. I confirm that the school to which the Deputy referred was approved for funding in 2017 to provide a mainstream classroom, two resource rooms and a WC for assisted users. The project is devolved to the school authority for delivery. This means that the school itself engages a design team to bring the project through the design stages and on to construction. The school authority recently submitted its stage 2b report to my Department for approval. This is the detailed design stage of the architectural planning process. The contents would be expected to be in line with the accommodation approved. However, in this instance, the accommodation outlined in the report exceeds that originally approved by my Department. This has a consequential impact on funding. I understand that the school is offering to make some of its own funding available to offset the additional cost. The stage 2b report will be fully examined by my Department. Given that the accommodation approved does not coincide with that outlined in the report, this will also now require a review of the schools long-term accommodation needs. This will be done as quickly as possible and a decision will issue directly to the school authority as soon as it is available.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The really important piece of work is the reassessment of the school's long-term accommodation needs. It will be required to ascertain the merit or otherwise of the school's proposal. As the Deputy will be aware, over recent years decisions on the location of schools have been based on demographic analysis. The 42 new schools announced earlier this year point to increasing pressures and population demand. It is important that the decision is made promptly. I will certainly speak to my officials to ensure this happens. A decision will issue directly to the school as soon as this process has been completed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has made suggestions and I will certainly relay them back to my officials. I am happy to do that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	My Department’s capital allocation for the school building purposes is €540 million in 2018 and this will increase by 15.2% in 2019 to €622 million. This is facilitating an ambitious schools building programme. Construction activity in 2018 and 2019 will involve over 130 large-scale projects and about 280 smaller-scale projects under the additional accommodation scheme. These projects will deliver about 40,000 additional and replacement school places; the replacement of more than 600 prefabs which is a key element of our prefab-replacement programme; enhanced sports facilities through the construction and modernisation of 48 physical education halls at post-primary level and 82 general purpose rooms at primary level. The enhancement and modernisation of physical education, PE, facilities in schools will also facilitate community usage of these facilities; and more than 200 modern science laboratories which will support the delivery of the reformed science curricula and the roll-out of computer science as a leaving certificate subject. As part of the significantly expanded building programme, the current design and build programme to cater for urgent accommodation needs is being ramped up. In the past this programme delivered an average of 12 new schools per year. The current programme involves 27 projects in design that are scheduled to commence construction before the end of 2019. The Government remains committed to delivering on existing projects in the school building programme as soon as possible. I am satisfied that the €8.4 billion investment available under the National Development Plan 2018-2027 will enable us to modernise and transform our school infrastructure in 2019 and in the years ahead.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There will be a summer works programme next year. From speaking to principals and school boards of management, I know they need a good run-in time. That announcement will need to happen sooner rather than later. There will also be a minor works programme, for which there will be a good enough lead-in time. I know there is no application process involved there. The Deputy is correct in what he says about existing schools. In particular many secondary schools were built back in the late 1970s and 1980s and we need to consider retrofitting them. I have already raised that issue with my officials and I hope to progress it. Even though we have 42 new schools, many of them were chosen on the basis of demographics. We cannot allow existing school accommodation not to get infrastructure enhancement. The Deputy's suggestion of looking at the economics of a school building in terms of heating and retrofitting is important.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is an issue I have already raised with my officials. The timing is very important. School principals are under enough pressure without delayed funding. I have asked my officials to ensure that money for minor works grants is paid at the end of this year, not in January. If we can do it in November, that will be great, but I cannot commit to that here today. One thing I can commit to is that I want this paid out before Christmas.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have been made aware of the building project for the school to which the Deputy is referring. Delays have, unfortunately, been experienced in delivering this project. These arose because the contractor encountered unforeseen bad ground conditions, together with severe weather events, which we will all remember from earlier this year. The project had been scheduled for completion for September 2018 but, in view of the issues met by the contractor, the likely completion date is now April 2019. I know how disappointing this is for the school and I understand how difficult it is for it to manage a growing enrolment until its new building is in place. It is, however, in the nature of any building project, whether it is a school, an office block or a house, that unforeseen issues can arise. The objective is always to deal with these as efficiently as possible to minimise delay. The project is being delivered by the local county council, which is continuing to pursue the contractor for as speedy a delivery of the project as possible. The council has the full support of my Department in its efforts to achieve this without compromising the integrity of the building being delivered. To ensure the school is kept fully up to date with progress on the project, the county council will be providing the board of management with monthly updates. The intention is that this approach will provide accurate and precise information to help the school to plan and manage its needs until its permanent accommodation is available.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While the Deputy will be aware of the status of the project, for the purposes of the public record, I point out the contractor is on programme to complete the development in line with its construction programme by April 2019. More than 90% of the blockwork is complete overall, with 100% of the structural blockwork complete to roof level. Concrete roof beams are almost complete and the roof steel is due on site next week. Over 45% of the mechanical installation is complete on the ground floor and over 85% of site drainage works are complete. Works have commenced on the provision of the staff car park and the set-down area, including internal roads and the foundations for the boundary wall. In preparation for the opening of the new school, phase one works to upgrade the footpaths on the road extraneous to the site are completed and the county council reports this has made a great improvement to the safety of this road for motorists and pedestrians. Nonetheless, I take the Deputy's point in terms of the frustrations. People want to see progress, particularly parents and students.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A number of issues have arisen on the project, as the Deputy will be aware from hearing it anecdotally on the ground, and these have been referred to conciliation in accordance with the contract. Conciliation is confidential as it deals with contractual issues. While I cannot give the specifics of the issue in this conciliation case, I take on board that the Deputy has raised this issue with a view to getting this project across the line as quickly as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In 2018 my Department will spend some €450 million on access measures for further and higher education students. This includes approximately €380 million on student grants and related activities, which is expected to benefit approximately 78,000 further and higher education students. Some 16,000 students are expected to be assisted in 2018 through the student assistance fund at a cost of €9 million. In addition, 12,000 students are expected to be assisted through the fund for students with disabilities at a cost of €10 million. Under the National Access Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019, my predecessor as Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, created a new funding stream called the programme for access to higher education, PATH. To date, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, who has responsibility in this area, have secured over €16 million for the roll-out of three strands of the PATH programme aimed at increasing participation from under-represented groups in initial teacher education, a new 1916 bursary fund supporting 600 students over three years, and new initiatives to attract an additional 2,000 students from under-represented groups into higher education. A further 850 students will benefit from the provision of scholarships and bursaries to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The block grant paid to higher education institutions includes a specific weighting to promote access to higher education. This involves an additional premium for all eligible access students and takes account of the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from under-represented backgrounds. For those from targeted socio-economic groups and mature students, this is applied for the first two years of course duration. For people with disabilities, a further weighting is applied for the entire length of the course.Regarding other steps, the national student accommodation strategy was published in July 2017 to promote and enhance the supply of student accommodation in line with the timescale envisaged in Rebuilding Ireland. It sets a target of 7,000 additional purpose-built student accommodation bed spaces to be delivered by the end of 2019 and the construction of at least 21,000 propose-built student accommodation bed spaces by 2024. This initial target will be exceeded with over 10,000 bed spaces completed or on site as of October 2018. Price is ultimately a function of supply and demand and the national student accommodation strategy is explicitly aimed at increasing the supply of accommodation available to students.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take the point on the wider constraints facing students and, in most instances, parents given those costs. Since the launch of the strategy, 18,729 bed spaces have been completed or are in the planning process. The figure is broken down as follows: 5,500 bed spaces have been completed; 4,800 bed spaces are under construction; planning has been approved for nearly 8,000 bed spaces and a further 472 bed spaces are in the planning process awaiting a final decision. Student accommodation and the affordability of rent are issues we need to tackle together on a cross-Government basis. I have not yet sat down with my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to discuss that but I will certainly do so very shortly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to work with the committee on that. I will also be working closely with my colleague, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, in this regard. I am happy to take on board Deputy Funchion's suggestion that we work collectively on this matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy whose kind words I appreciate. I look forward to working with him on a number of important education matters. No doubt, the Ceann Comhairle will be very interested in a number of these issues also.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 57 together. The Department is currently advancing building projects in a number of post-primary schools in the south Kildare school planning area and these projects will, when completed, provide additional capacity in the region of 1,700 school places. The current status of each of these projects is as follows. At St. Conleth's community college, Newbridge, the project is on site and is due to be completed shortly. At Athy community college, the project brief has been completed and the project has been devolved to Kildare and Wicklow ETB for delivery. At Cross and Passion secondary school, Kilcullen, the project is at project brief stage. At Patrician College, Newbridge, the project is at project brief stage and at St. Paul's secondary school, Monasterevin, the project is at stage 2b, detailed design stage. Recently, my predecessor, Deputy Richard Bruton, announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, 2019 to 2022. In addition to the new schools announced, there will be a need for further school accommodation in other areas in the future. While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school in the south Kildare school planning areas, a review of provision at post-primary school level across the school planning areas in south Kildare is now well advanced and the outcome will be made available by the end of October. The review will include an assessment of the extent to which projected needs in the area will be met from the additional capacity being provided by the projects already approved and how any specific additional needs will be best catered for, recognising the importance of maintaining a balance between existing and any additional school provision.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are a number of schools in the area. I will say one thing about the ongoing building programme and capital plan. In my very short time in the job, I have learned that I cannot walk from one end of a corridor to the other without meeting a Deputy or Senator who is looking for information on a project in the capital plan. In fairness, the previous Minister, Deputy Bruton, introduced a communication system whereby the website shows the different stages at which the projects stand. It is important that we can communicate any changes in this regard. As for the specific schools to which the Deputy refers, if any further information is needed or if the Deputy's colleagues in the Kildare South constituency need to sit down with one of the officials in the building unit, I would be happy to organise that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy's observation on the review of the provision of post-primary schools in the general school planning areas of south Kildare is important. It is well advanced and I will certainly make it available by the end of October. Demographics is the research tool used to prioritise accommodation need. If we go back to 2011, when Ruairí Quinn was in office and developing his plan for the period 2016 to 2021, the measurement was to ask where the population pressures lay. My predecessor, Deputy Bruton, oversaw the capital programme starting in 2016. We are still in that 2016-2021 period but we do have a trajectory now over ten years and an €8.4 billion capital fund, which is double the size of that for the ten years prior to the national development plan timeframe we are envisaging. I will keep the Deputy updated and ensure that the commitment given today, that the review will be made available at the end of October, will be honoured.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know that we are tight on time and that Deputy Catherine Martin wants to get in but I wish to take this opportunity, as a former member of the Business Committee, to thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for his collegiality and co-operation at that committee and the Ceann Comhairle and his team for a wonderful experience in how consensus politics can work in getting things done. I just wanted to put that on the public record. In February 2018, my Department published Circular 0013/2018, which set out an approach to the arrangements that were to be made for religious instruction and worship in education and training board and post-primary community schools. This arose as a result of concerns that multidenominational education and training board, ETB, schools were requiring attendance at classes with Catholic religious instruction. Section 4 of the circular provided that the school is required to ascertain parental wishes in respect of the child's attendance at such religious instruction. Where a parent did not want his or her child to receive religious instruction, the school was required to provide an alternative subject. Where there was any practice of combining or including religious instruction and formation or worship in the same class time as the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, religious education syllabus, parents were made aware of this fact in order that they could make an informed decision to withdraw their children from that class if this was their wish. The newly published circular to which the Deputy referred clarifies in section 3 that withdrawal with an offer of an alternative subject does not arise in respect of the NCCA religious syllabus where there is no religious instruction or faith formation. Religious education is an examinable subject just like history or geography, for example. It aims to develop students' ability to examine questions of meaning, purpose and relationships, to help students understand, respect and appreciate people's expression of their beliefs and to facilitate dialogue and reflection on the diversity of beliefs and values that inform responsible decision-making and ways of living. Crucially, it is not delivered from any one religious perspective. The second important clarification is that where a school intends to provide religious instruction classes, parents must give consent before admission to the class. This means that the issue of opting out does not arise because the parent has requested a place in the religious instruction class. This circular has no impact on the right of parents under the Education Act or the Constitution to opt out of any subject for reason of conscience.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I forced the Deputy to wish me good luck.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will ensure that I get proper clarification. I will direct my officials to do that. I have some additional information that I hope will be helpful. As a former philosophy student at Maynooth University, I agree with the idea that space should be provided within the curriculum for people to address many of the difficult questions we all face on a day-to-day basis. That does not mean instruction. There is no religious-specific instruction within the religious education syllabus. As part of its normal inspection processes, the Department's inspectorate will inspect whether the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment's religious education subject is being delivered in schools in accordance with the requirements of the circular that was published recently. Schools have discretion in the context of religious education. They may choose not to offer the subject at all. If religious education is to be mandatory or optional in any particular class, group or year, it is to be treated the same as all other subjects, such as history or geography, for these purposes. It is subject to inspection. I reiterate that religious education is a separate subject. It does not involve instruction in any one faith or another. It probably provides an opportunity to broaden the discussion regarding well-being at a time when children and young people have different anxieties and pressures that teachers are dealing with. At this morning's meeting of the joint committee, we discussed how to make progress in the area of well-being. I certainly think there is value in this approach.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I repeat that it is the prerogative of each school to decide whether to offer this subject. My information tells me that instruction from the perspective of any individual religion is not part of this. I am happy to continue the conversation on philosophy because I think young people need space to reflect. As a convent boy who was educated in a Loreto secondary school, I value the philosophy and the caring and compassionate ethos that is espoused by the Loreto order. That is my perspective. It is not coming from the Department of Education and Skills.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was more of a Descartes fan in philosophy. We have to be very clear about what happens when schools make decisions. My philosophy and vision for my new job is that schools should be empowered to make their own choices.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy will be aware of the many pressing demands in education which my predecessor and his predecessors, including Ruairí Quinn, have had to consider in recent years. Important changes have been made. Provision for children with special educational needs has been resourced and reformed, junior cycle reform has been rolled out, school leadership has been strengthened, primary class sizes have been reduced, guidance teachers have been restored, provision has been made for extra students at all levels and provision has been made for new skills needs in apprenticeships, traineeships and higher education. I fully recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools. I was pleased that my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, was able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools. This will apply from the start of the 2019-20 school year. I must be prudent in the context of ongoing budgetary pressures. As it is not possible to do everything I would like to do in the education sector in one year, especially in the light of increasing enrolments, I have to prioritise. To answer the Deputy's question in as black-and-white a manner as possible, I intend to seek funding for further capitation increases in future budgets.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know from my travels around my constituency in recent years that the capitation grant always comes up when I speak with principals of primary and secondary schools. The grant is a lifeline for many schools as they seek to meet their running costs. There was a massive reduction of 11% in 2009. We have increased it by 5% this year. Annual funding would need to increase further by approximately €25.5 million if grants are to be restored to pre-2011 levels. I will not give the Deputy a false picture of how we can get there in a specific period. However, I can give her a commitment that we will have conversations on this matter when we look at our 2019 programme. I have no doubt that it will be discussed at the joint committee. I want the committee to feed into the three-year strategic plan so that we can ascertain how to get there as quickly as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is an issue and it is one of a number of priorities I raised with my officials yesterday. I made the point that we have to find a pathway in the short-to-medium term to put extra revenue into capitation. I have committed to that. I look forward to working with the Deputies on establishing a consensus regarding how to reach to that point. Having met a number of officials from my Department - I have not met them all because there are 1,300 in total working hard in Athlone, Tullamore and Dublin - I get a sense that they are heeding the importance of long-term planning for schools. Deputy Catherine Martin mentioned the minor works scheme. That money needs to be announced this side of Christmas, as does the funding for the summer works programme. We need to consider giving schools more lead-in time. They face enough pressures and have a great deal on their plate. There are principals who are teaching, performing administrative tasks and carrying heavy loads. The overall issue is something that I will be very conscious of in my role.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the two Deputies for raising the matter. It is a broad one relating to Caranua's 2017 annual report and the appeals process, so I have a fairly broad answer, but there are statistics and bits of information that might be relevant to the discussion. Caranua is an independent statutory body established in 2013 under the provisions of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund, RISF, Act 2012 to utilise the €110 million cash contributions pledged by the congregations to support the needs of survivors of residential institutional child abuse. It is entirely funded by those contributions and no Exchequer funding is involved. The board adopted the service name Caranua in October 2013 and set up a website, www.caranua.ie. Section 22 of the RISF Act provides for a right of appeal against decisions made by Caranua. Mr. Pat Whelan, the first appeals officer, was appointed to that position in 2014 with further one-year periods in 2015 and 2016. Two appeals officers, Ms Geraldine Gleeson and Mr. Brendan O'Leary, were appointed in May 2017 to deal with a backlog of cases that had built up. The 2017 annual report, which is Ms Gleeson's and Mr. O'Leary's first report, covers the period 15 May 2017 to 30 April 2018. The report was published on 4 October 2018. There were 140 cases outstanding when they took up their position and they received an additional 87 appeals between May 2017 and April 2018, giving a total of 227 appeals for consideration. A total of 193 cases were completed during this reporting period, leaving 34 appeals on hand. The report confirms that of the 193 cases completed between May 2017 and April 2018, 83 or 43% were upheld, that is, the original decision on the application was revoked by the appeals officer; 18 cases, which is 9%, were partially upheld; and 26 cases or 14% were referred back to Caranua for reconsideration in accordance with specific directions from the appeals officer. A total of 54 cases, 28%, were not upheld, that is, the original decision was affirmed by the appeals officer; and 12 cases, 6%, were either discontinued or withdrawn. Of the 87 additional appeals received during the period covered by this report, 26 related to home improvements or repairs, 22 related to personal well-being and health matters, 15 related to household and personal items, eight were for funeral expenses, seven were for education, four for eligibility, four for travel or transport, and one for financial assistance. The two appeals officers were appointed in May 2017 for a one-year term. For personal reasons, one of the appeals officers decided not to accept reappointment to the position. Given that the number of appeals on hand is manageable by one appeals officer, I do not intend to appoint a second appeals officer at this time but the situation will be monitored. I take on board what was said here tonight in that regard. To date, costs amounting to €82,200 have been incurred in relation to the work of the appeals officers. Administrative support is provided by a Department official. The annual report addresses a number of specific policy issues, including issues raised in previous annual reports. The perception that Caranua made an administrative decision to refuse to process further applications from applicants, on the basis that they had received support and services, in favour of those who had not yet applied or received support was a core issue of previous annual reports. Caranua's position is that it must manage the fund so that it can be shared fairly among all people who can apply to it. This policy issue is primarily a matter for the board of Caranua. Decisions of the appeals officer may be appealed to the High Court on a point of law. One such appeal was initiated in 2017 by the board of Caranua. The case centred on the personal allocation limit introduced by Caranua in the revised guidelines published in June 2016. Based on the legal advice received, the case was settled by the appeals officers. There is ongoing litigation in the High Court, with seven cases being taken against the appeals officers on the grounds that the personal allocation limit of €15,000 should not be applied retrospectively where the applicant has received funding for services from Caranua.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take those contributions seriously, whether we are talking about length of time, lack of information or the system being too bureaucratic, given the ordeal of institutional abuse the survivors have gone through and the stage of life they are at. I take on board the suggestion that there will possibly be a need for a second appeals officer. I will monitor the situation and speak to my officials after this debate to see if there are ways in which we can make it easier for this most vulnerable group of elderly people who have gone through such an ordeal. Words such as empathy and sympathy were used, as was the importance of avoiding any form of adversarial approach in the State's dealings with the survivors. I am supportive of working with Members on that. I take on board what has been said and also the fact that Members are affording me the opportunity to get into my brief. I will speak to my officials and get a comprehensive update from them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	You are always nice, Clare.
