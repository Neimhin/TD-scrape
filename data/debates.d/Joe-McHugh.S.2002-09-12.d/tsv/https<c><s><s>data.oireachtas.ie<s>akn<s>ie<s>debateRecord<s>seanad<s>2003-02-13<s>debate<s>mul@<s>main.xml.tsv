JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, four Senators wanted to speak in the debate last night but could not get in.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister to the House. I compliment Senator Cox on the candour and honesty of her comments on better local government. Without being political, she has given an honest view of what is happening on the ground.In my own short experience of three years in local government, there have been considerable changes through the Better Local Government initiative and work carried out on various plans. I was involved in the county development plan in County Donegal and the waste management plan. We had our ups and downs, including tensions between the elected councillors and the executive. With regard to the provisions of this Bill, I believe that giving additional executive powers to managers will ultimately erode local democracy and result in a decrease in confidence on the part of the general public. Civic duties and responsibilities will also be undermined.It is the function of local authorities to maintain a strong and effective working relationship between the executive and local authority members. This Bill places all the ongoing work of the last three years in jeopardy. A fundamental principle of better local government is to give citizens more rights and greater confidence in local authority members. It also involves giving people an influence in policy at a local level through the SPCs.When we were involved in the waste management plan in Donegal, we were faced with many obstacles and problems. In sorting out tensions between the executive function and the role of elected members, we had to negotiate and reach accommodation on various matters. Ultimately, we endorsed a waste management plan after due negotiation and deliberation. That was accepted by the public on the basis of a decision by the councillors rather than a reserved function of the county manager.We opted for a three tier approach in our waste management plan rather than giving the public just one option. In relation to landfill, we looked at the possibility of six or seven local sites being identified and explored in terms of their acceptability. We also considered a regional approach involving Northern Ireland and a further regional approach involving Sligo and Leitrim. All the options were assessed in conjunction with the executive board and we decided not to impose any plan on the public.If we now decide to give increased executive power to managers, that will send out the wrong signals. People will take the message that there is no point in voting for local authority members who have no real say or function in decision making. That is a dangerous situation. The county development plan which Donegal County Council passed a few years ago is now up for review. Where do elected councillors stand in that regard? Have they the necessary confidence in their role to come up with a completely new county development plan?Senators have suggested we should discuss one-off housing and other housing possibilities for rural areas. When we in Donegal put a county development plan on the table in two or three years' time, we will be faced with the possibility that the manager may overrule the wishes of councillors. I believe managers do not actually want this particular role. They want to maintain an effective working relationship with the council members, even though there may be serious tension and conflict around estimates time.SPCs have enjoyed a honeymoon period over the past few years. Quite frankly, the members of local authorities are becoming frustrated with the rather ineffective operation of SPCs, which are supposed to influence policy at local level as a form of decentralisation function. However, if the dual mandate no longer applies, much local authority legislation will be implemented by executive powers. While I originally had confidence in the proposal with regard to the dual mandate some months ago, I am now quite worried about its abolition in the context of this Bill. In a situation where council members lack confidence in SPCs and are concerned about policy being dictated at their level, where do we stand as Oireachtas Members representing our various regions? We find ourselves in a very difficult situation.Ministers may find themselves in difficulties where decisions have to be made at local level. The NIMBY – not in my back yard – argument comes into it. They are faced with a very difficult situation where they have to step in and overrule the managers, but that is an isolated instance.We are negating all the good work and all the positive developments in local authority best practice in the majority areas. It must be remembered that local authority members play an active role. For example, six of the members of Donegal County Council work full-time on local authority business and they do not have any other jobs. They are confident that things have changed under Better Local Government. If something like this is put on the table, however, and if they feel that their power or jurisdiction in terms of representing their constituents will be overruled, the work of local authorities will be set back three to four years. That is the danger about which I am concerned.Perhaps the following is a strong statement to make, but is it a case of direct rule being instituted? I do not mean the type of direct rule – Senator White might know from where I am coming on this matter – we have always experienced. Are we returning to that type of direct rule from managers where we are just dealing with the psychology of having the freedom of living under a jurisdiction where we do not have direct rule? Perhaps Irish people, in particular, are just coming to terms with the psychology of the anti-establishment, anti-authority mentality. If members of the public discover that county managers will have power to overrule members in respect of decisions affecting waste management or the environment, it will do nothing to instil in them further confidence in the system even in terms of agreeing with local authority rules or guidelines.What we are discussing here is a larger argument about the nature of the psyche. A view exists that perhaps Irish people are, in psychological terms, anti-establishment and anti-authority as a result of many years of direct or colonial rule. That is a philosophical argument and perhaps the Leader will facilitate a debate on it in the future.If the citizens of Donegal were told that power was being taken away from the members of the local authority, it would do nothing to instil in them confidence about the democratic process. We have a devolved government at local level. Donegal County Council has opened up four decentralised district offices. It is amazing what is happening in Donegal because people no longer rely on their councillors. They do not need to ring up the councillor or Deputy asking to be sent a form for a DPG or ERG grant, they can actually walk into a civic office and request what they need. They are now in a position to say, "Hold on a minute, I am entitled to this. This is my democratic right. I do not need the services of a Deputy or county councillor."I accept that cynicism exists. It has always been evident in the democratic process and the type of parochial politics practised in Ireland. Perhaps we – I include myself in this – are to blame because we might give the impression that it is we who are delivering and who are giving the people that to which they are already entitled.Returning to Donegal County Council, the decentralised programme under Better Local Government is an example of how we have moved forward. We are moving forward because we are continually devolving power to local authority members and to ordinary citizens. The latter are becoming more active and involved as a result. They are involved in different fora, they are becoming involved through their membership of community groups and they are represented on the county development board. There is no point in us talking the jargon of Better Local Government if we are not going to follow it up with principles and guidelines through which the 29 councillors on Donegal County Council will eventually have the ultimate power for that region.I find this contradictory. When Europe is moving towards more devolved regional government systems and is seeking active participation from its citizens, why are we considering a system of more direct rule? I hope I am not using the term "direct rule" out of context – I accept it has many connotations – but it is direct rule by a manager to overrule members without due deliberation. Our waste management plan and our county development plan were not immediately accepted by the councillors; they were discussed and were the subject of negotiation. It takes time for plans to be accepted because they must be trawled through.I do not mean to be negative, but perhaps I have come across as such. We still have an opportunity – there is cross-party support on this – to reconsider this and re-examine the authority of county managers. If we asked the citizens, they would say they are not happy with it. Local authority members, who are democratically elected, are not happy with it. The main persons on the executive boards, the county managers, are not happy with it either.At times Opposition Members can play politics with an issue. We will not do so today, but we will look for a little common sense because, as Senator Cox stated, the people in Galway are not satisfied with the Bill either. That is the message we want to put forward here.On the dual mandate, I will be less comfortable giving up my seat on the local authority if this legislation is enacted. I intend to stay on. I will serve my mandate until 2004, irrespective of any calls or demands placed upon me. I feel it is my duty to do that because I have been part of a system for three to four years in which we have moved forward. We are actually gaining the respect of the public. This would be two steps backwards. The message for the Minister today is that I am not happy with this legislation, my colleagues in Donegal County Council are not happy and, ultimately, the citizens will not be happy.
