JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, recently introduced measures in the budget for alternative and renewable energy. Although these measures must be welcomed, in a global context they are paltry and do not go far enough. Donegal people are not impressed. Our Ulster colleagues in the Six Counties can avail of generous grants for micro-scale rooftop wind energy devices. The system is even more advanced in Scotland. Best practice in Denmark and Oklahoma suggests that rooftop wind generating systems work and when they are grant-aided at a household level are installed sensitively and are welcomed by the people. I would like to ask Deputy Cowen why, if these reports from Denmark show this is a success, we do not share it with the electorate but instead continue to kowtow to monopolies and big business. We are elected to lead and represent the citizens. When these schemes are available across the Border, why are they not standardised and made available here? A report produced by a UK Government-sponsored body has shown that by 2050, 30% to 40% of the UK's domestic energy needs could be provided by these micro-scale wind energy systems. We have the evidence and should do something about it.
