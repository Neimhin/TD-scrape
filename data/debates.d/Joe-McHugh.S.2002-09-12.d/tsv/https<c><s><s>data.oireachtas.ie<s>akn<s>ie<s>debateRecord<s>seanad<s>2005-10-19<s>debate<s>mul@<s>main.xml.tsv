JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Last week the Leader acceded to a debate on road tragedies and road deaths. Has there been any update on when this will happen? There is growing demand for such a debate in the House.The following matter will be close to the heart of the Leas-Chathaoirleach as he is from the west of Ireland. I am delighted Senator Norris raised the issue of An Taisce's objections to An Bord Pleanála. We need a serious debate on An Bord Pleanála, an east coast representative group. There is a weight of opinion coming from professional fields such as town and urban planning, architectural planning and others. There is a lack of representation of Ireland west of the Shannon and a lack of representation of rural and community groups and economic forward planning in rural areas. It is vital that debate takes place because normally it is councillors, Senators and Deputies who shout about the inadequate decisions taken by An Bord Pleanála in the west. It is time we had a representative voice that can speak on behalf of the west because the west is different from the east. There are historical lineages in terms of the distribution of family settlement patterns but An Bord Pleanála is not voicing those concerns. I am pleased Senator Norris raised this issue. It is appropriate and timely because we need a debate on An Bord Pleanála.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House. I have a few questions about the National Salmon Commission, which has been discussed at length in Oireachtas committees. In respect of the representative group body on the commission, I know the Minister of State intends to appoint a nominee from Fáilte Ireland at some stage. Point 4 of the terms of reference of the commission states, "to engage, as appropriate, in a proactive dialogue with representatives of bodies and organisations prescribed for the purposes of Section 55A(2)(b) of the Fisheries Act 1980”. I hope there will be intensive dialogue between the commission and the local authority in terms of, as the Minister of State just mentioned, pollution.The Minister of State is aware that many anglers in Donegal fail to mention that rivers are being polluted at an alarming rate when they highlight drift and draft net fishing. This pollution is not the fault of farmers; they keep slurry back from the rivers. The problem arises from the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage into rivers and streams. If we are to have any discussion on salmon stocks in river beds, we must positively engage with local authorities. For example, the local anglers in the village of Glen in Donegal are irate because raw sewage is entering the river. We can have a lengthy philosophical debate about drift and draft net fishing but when raw sewage is entering a river, it is a major problem and can lead to an epidemic of disease among fish.The Minister of State spoke about the four interest groups in this debate. There are many interest groups — tourism, angling, commercial fishermen and the community. There is a traditional community focus and tradition of drift net fishing in the west and along the coast of Donegal. It was a way of life and has contributed considerably to the economy and wealth of the area. The fact that it was a tradition and way of life must be placed on the record. It is a four-way debate between tourism interests, anglers, commercial fishermen and the local community that must be brought together and concluded sooner than later.The year 2007 has been designated as the year when a decision will be arrived at regarding the National Salmon Commission's outcomes, conclusions and recommendations. This year is too far away because there is sufficient scientific evidence and empirical data to show us the correct route to take on this issue. There has been a long and extensive debate and 2007 may be too far away.I congratulate the chairman of the National Salmon Commission, Joey Murrin, who is from Killybegs, on his appointment. He has a great wealth of experience and expertise and is a very good appointment. Hopefully, he will head up a team which will move quickly on this issue. I sat on the Donegal County Council committee on fisheries. To return to a point referred to by the Minister of State, the issue of seals was raised at every meeting I attended for five years. It is a major issue for salmon stocks and it is very important that attention is paid to the effect of the seal population on salmon stocks.The figures regarding the fishing effort are available and show that there has been a decline of 36% from 220,000 in 2001 to 140,000 in 2005. It proves that there is a serious problem. Fine Gael believes that people in the drift and draft net fishing sector who are interested in voluntary buyout should be facilitated and negotiated with sooner than later. It is a major philosophical and holistic question and must be addressed sooner rather than later. I hope we will not employ a consultancy company to draw up the conclusions and recommendations of the report. I am not saying this simply because it is a trendy topic of conversation in the past few weeks. I hope a consultancy company will not be employed to draw up the conclusions and recommendations of the report. There is enough expertise within the Department to produce a report on the conclusions and recommendations of the salmon commission. There is no need to employ a Deloitte & Touche or any other consultancy company unless, perhaps, the Minister of State can recommend one in Donegal that has expertise in the area.
