JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Bhí mé ag smaoineamh fadúda uimhir a ceathair ach tá sé socraithe anois. Tá mé anseo. Cuirim buíochas roimh an Seanadóir faoi choinne na ceiste fosta. Is ceist tábhachtach í. I thank Senator Lawless for his own individual campaigning and as a representative of many groups down the years which have campaigned on this issue. No doubt the Senator is in constant communication and liaison with them and he will pass on my message and the Government's message about our commitment to this issue.  The announcement by the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia that a referendum will be held over whether Irish citizens resident outside of the State, including potential voters in Northern Ireland, should be allowed to vote in Presidential elections was a historic moment. It recognises the importance that Ireland places on its relationship with all our citizens wherever they may be. In times gone by, leaving Ireland meant a person severing their relationship with the State. We now want to give Irish citizens wherever they may be a chance in choosing the person who represents Irish people at home and abroad. Many other countries give citizens resident outside the state a chance to vote in elections. However, I acknowledge that in respect of our citizenship laws, Ireland has some unique features which make the policy considerations more complex here compared to other countries. This is a timely development for Ireland given the ongoing and strong commitment of this Government and, indeed, successive Governments to deepening real engagement with our citizens who reside outside the State. Ireland's diaspora policy, published in 2015, recognises the need to nurture and develop our unique and important relationship with our diaspora. The issue of voting rights is of enormous importance to Irish citizens abroad who feel it is important that they have a say in electing the President who also represents them as Irish people living overseas. We drew on the skills and support of our diaspora in recent times of economic crisis. This initiative is a fitting recognition of the enormous contribution made by Irish people abroad historically and more recently to Ireland's recovery and development. The Government's decision to hold this referendum is in line with the recommendation with the Convention on the Constitution in its fifth report. Some 78% of its members were in favour of citizens outside the State having the right to vote in presidential elections. Last Wednesday, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, published an options paper which sets out how the recommendations of the Convention on the Constitution might be realised. That paper, prepared in conjunction with my Department, provides a detailed analysis of the legal, policy and practical implications of extending the franchise. It shows the complexity of the issues but also that the various challenges which arise can be addressed with sufficient planning and resources. The options paper will inform public discourse on the proposal that will be put to the people at the referendum. The upcoming Global Irish Civic Forum in May will further provide an opportunity to discuss the options paper with representatives of Irish communities abroad. It is intended that this and wider public discussions will allow the Government to identify a preferred option to put to the people in a referendum. As this House knows, I have had a strong and public personal commitment to extending voting rights to citizens abroad in Presidential elections. I was pleased to be there with the Taoiseach at the Famine Memorial in Philadelphia when he made the announcement. I have seen the vibrancy of the Irish community during the St Patrick’s Day parade and acknowledged the contribution of the Irish to the United States at the memorial to Commodore Barry and at Independence Hall. I saw for myself the positive reaction from Irish emigrants and Irish Americans as the Taoiseach said there was "no more fitting time or no more fitting place." Article 2 of our Constitution requires us to cherish our special affinity with Irish people abroad. I believe the Government’s decision to hold a referendum on extending voting rights to Irish citizens abroad sends an important message to them on the value we place on them and their connection to Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Senator that we have a history of referendums. I will not talk about my own county because it has a consistent history in regard to them. I am not naive that this will be an easily won referendum. It will not be. There will be opportunities in both the Seanad and the Dáil prior to the referendum and proper, open and honest discourse, prior to the preferred option being chosen, will be important. I know that Senator Lawless will be participating in the Civic Forum on 4 and 5 May. I want to make one point, which the Senator mentioned, about the symbolism of the office.We are talking about votes for the diaspora in Presidential elections specifically. I have seen the role of the office evolving over the last 20 years. Look at the mark left by Mary Robinson and the imprint Mary McAleese left in the relationships with Northern Ireland and elsewhere and among our welfare organisations internationally. Within 48 hours of getting this job as Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, I was at a summit in Istanbul with President Higgins. He was our President, but he was seen as an international voice; a voice of hope for a lot of people in humanitarian crises and development. The international community looks to Ireland for leadership. I have had a very positive insight into the symbolism of this role at both national and international levels and want to acknowledge the international role that President Higgins is playing. When one sees African leaders giving the President of this country a standing ovation for his commitment, his words and his inspiration on the international stage, that is where Ireland is going and we should never forget that.
