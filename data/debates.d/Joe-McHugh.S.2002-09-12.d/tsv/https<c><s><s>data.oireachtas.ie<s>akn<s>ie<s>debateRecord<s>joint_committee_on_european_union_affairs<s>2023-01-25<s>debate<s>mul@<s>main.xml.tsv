JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The next speaker is Deputy Haughey but Deputy Ó Murchú is under a time constraint, which is not unusual. If that is okay I will go to Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I greatly appreciate that and thank the ambassador. I call Deputy Haughey for a supplementary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are all straying beyond the ambassador's Presidency remit, but I invite him to respond if he is able to do so.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador for his attendance. We may well need to interact again over the course of the next six months. On behalf of the committee I wish the ambassador and all of his colleagues well. We know how demanding a Council Presidency is, and we all like to put our best foot forward. I know Sweden will do splendidly in its third opportunity to lead the Council.
