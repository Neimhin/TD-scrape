JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I also welcome the calls for a debate in this regard, as well as welcoming Senator Quinn's intervention to facilitate next week's debate in respect of energy. It is unfortunate that whenever we debate energy we do so as a reaction to price increases. However, much good work is being done at local authority level where the debate is ongoing. A conference on renewable energy is taking place in Donegal on Friday, 19 May. Donegal County Council is being very proactive in examining the choices and solutions with which we are faced.It is a problem that there is a 90% reliance on fossil fuels. Nuclear energy is also an option which is not sustainable in the long term. We must consider other options and solutions. Perhaps local authorities could get involved in rolling out their own energy options and solutions, including methane from former landfill sites or taking ownership of tidal power or wind power. We are all aware that the financing of local authorities is becoming unsustainable in the long term. This is a debate which must also take place.Perhaps the Leader of the House will intervene in regard to the Youth Work Act. It has been on the table for a considerable time and many youth practitioners are getting very worried about their jobs and the sustainability of youth work programmes. Some 17 full-time youth work jobs in Donegal will be on the line at the beginning of 2007. These jobs are funded through the peace and reconciliation fund programme. As ADM-CPA will no longer be able to provide funding for jobs, it is important to implement the Youth Work Act provisions through the VEC and put in place the proper mechanisms to employ full-time community development workers and community youth workers. It is preventive and important work which should be rolled-out.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, to the House. My Adjournment matter involves an issue close to his heart as the Minister of State's constituency has many agricultural issues.The specific issue concerns farmers' access to information. Mechanisms are in place which work, and many advisory bodies such as Teagasc do a phenomenal job in getting information to farmers and clarifying matters in the bureaucratic regime in which we live. Diligent people work at departmental level and perform in the face of many constraints because they must deal with a plethora of issues. As more legislation is introduced, more issues will raise their heads.However, we have entered a new period in agriculture with an increasing amount of legislation coming from European directives and at national level, and it is becoming more of a headache for farmers. More information and clarification is required on a daily basis, not on a weekly or monthly basis. Increased legislation and bureaucracy creates a need for more information. We must also take into consideration that farming practices have changed. In the past, a farm set-up could have two heads of household. A husband could be in the farmyard while his wife was at home. Farming practice has changed, and many farmers involved in part-time farming are therefore not as available as much to make phone calls to the Department's offices. They may be at other work, for example.I am specifically calling for the Department to look at the possibility of introducing lo-call numbers at a regional level, or even a freefone number for farmers, where they can have 24-hour access to information at departmental level. With advanced communications systems and technology, as well as information systems, this is not too much to ask. It is important that the idea of having access to information for farmers is put on the record and advanced at least to a debating stage.Extra staff are required. The staff currently working at Department level, in the midlands or in the peripheral areas that have Department offices, are overworked. They must deal with many information queries, and in doing this they are not able to facilitate every farmer every time. Farmers can become infuriated and frustrated, perhaps as a result of having to stay on the phone line for an hour or an hour and a half. Time is at a premium for many people, no more so than farmers. If we are to introduce layers of bureaucracy and legislation, making it ever more difficult and turning farming into an administrative business, it is important we facilitate the new measures.We should facilitate farmers with regard to their time constraints as they may be working on a part-time basis. Such farmers do not have time to be on a phone for an hour or an hour and a half, waiting for a person on the other end to give them a small piece of information. It is imperative that something is done sooner rather than later. Farmers are stellar custodians of the landscape and are still fighting a battle. Future generations of farmers still wish to partake in farming practice. It is incumbent on us to make it easier for this to happen and to facilitate farmers.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The last part of the Minister of State's speech has summed up the issue. The concern is that there will be major reductions, which will leave existing staff under severe pressure. The question of whether there will be enough resources to accommodate the existing queries of farmers generally will be highlighted.Some farmers have compared their farming business to people on the minimum wage. Farmers do not have a minimum wage. A statistic being disseminated now is that a farmer would need to be paid €300 for a ewe in order to make the minimum wage. As it stands this week, a farmer would be lucky to get €40 or €50 for a sheep come next autumn. The farmers have not put themselves in such a position. With more bureaucracy, more information will be required. More resources will be needed for dissemination of this information, including more IT resources. We still need human contact. Farmers cannot be left to deal with computers and recorded voice messages. Human interaction between the farmer and the Department is necessary.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important to keep the resources or they will be taken away.
