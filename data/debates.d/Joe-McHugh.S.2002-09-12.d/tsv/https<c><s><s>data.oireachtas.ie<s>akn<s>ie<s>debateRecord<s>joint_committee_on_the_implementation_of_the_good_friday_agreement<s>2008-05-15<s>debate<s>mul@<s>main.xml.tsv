JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I join Deputy Blaney in thanking the Chairman for organising this meeting and for making it a priority.  It is a good sign of where we want to go as a committee.  I welcome the officials from the North, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey and his officials as well as the representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs.I am disappointed that the Minister at the Department for Rural Development, Mr. Conor Murphy, MLA, is not here today but I understand he is attending another very important meeting.  I accept that and look forward to working with him in the future.I wish to quote something from Agenda Northern Ireland which Mr. Murphy might have chosen to put on the record of these proceedings today, had he attended.  It is just one sentence.  Mr. Murphy said, "I want public transport to be seen as a realistic alternative to car travel and to play a real part in promoting social inclusion and cohesion".  This is a very acceptable objective and I welcome it.  People might regard it as realistic or idealistic.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating but it looks good on paper.  Internally Northern Ireland is making a commitment of £76 million on rail improvement works between Ballymena and Derry, which I very much welcome and a ten-year railway investment projection of £456 million, which I also welcome.  When I examine the policy of where this will be spent I accept that much of this investment will go on upgrading the Belfast to Dublin track, but there is much work to be done on the overall strategy.  I am also conscious of the fact that both sides of the Border have bought into an integrated transport strategy in the Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement, depending on what one wants to call it, and it is important we examine the integration and overall policy.On Ms Brown's input on examining further policy areas on rail and future routes, I welcome her statement that if there is a case for such development it would need to be proven.  I accept that, as do all the groups from the north west which lobby for rail transport whether the North-West Rail Corridor Group, the North-West Rail Loop or Into the West.  These are very pragmatic people and they do not think one builds rail for the sake of it.  I ask the officials in the Northern department to examine the possibility of assessing this as an option.  All we seek is assessment in partnership with local authorities and groups and the Department of Transport here in Dublin.  It can be done and has already started to happen.  Donegal County Council has started the ball rolling by committing the small figure of €10,000.  Many council areas have no rail, for example counties Fermanagh, Tyrone, Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, whence the two respected gentlemen here hail.  Both Departments, North and South, could play a facilitation role in assessing the possibility of railway to the north west.  A critical mass of 500,000 people do not have access to public transport.  If this cost-benefit analysis proves the idea is utter balderdash, my colleagues in the north west and I will accept that.  However, it may be a worthwhile venture to put into policy.  We are not looking at putting down tracks or buying trains but at the assessment, and that is what I ask of both officials and Departments, to examine that appraisal.Like the Chairman I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, back to this portfolio.  In terms of consistency I welcome the fact the Minister is still in this Department because he is serious about it and has a reputation of being a strong advocate of rail.  He has had ongoing involvement with West=On=Track and Fr. Micheál MacGréil talks very highly of his proactive approach to rail.  The Dublin to Navan line is another example of his commitment to rail.On the cross-Border sustainable transport initiatives, I ask both Departments to examine a cross-Border learner drivers training scheme that took place recently between Strabane and east Inishowen taking in places such as Killygordan, St. Johnston and Carrigans.  It was worked on a cross-Border basis and they are looking to go to the next level and having a joint cross-Border rural scheme.The Minister's script mentions that €580 million is set aside for the A5 from Derry to Letterkenny.  Following representations from my county council, is it possible to get one engineer from two county councils, Monaghan and Donegal, to sit on that working group?  I ask this because both of those county councils' spatial strategies and development plans will be impacted by the route selection.  It is important that east Donegal and north Monaghan have some sort of input at local level.  Either Ms Brown or Mr. Allister said, "the key success to the A1 scheme was ongoing involvement of county councils".  The Minister will say there are officials from the NRA on that working group, but there is an official request from Donegal County Council to have a resident engineer on that working group.  I ask that both Departments examine that today.I am sorry for going on but I welcome this opportunity.  We are ready to move to the next level on showing the tangibles to the people North and South.  We can talk about the past and the benefits of the peace process, who did what, when they did it and how it happened.  However, we have a very demanding public and rightly so, asking how their lives and their children's lives can improve as a result of the integrated North-South Belfast or Good Friday Agreement.  It is the job of politicians to raise the bar because we cannot keep putting on paper cross-Border idealistic notions about where we are going if the tangibles are not in place.  The ordinary man or woman on the street will say there was cross-Border co-operation before the peace process, for example the Belfast-Dublin rail link, and the cross-Border co-operation between Malin Head, Belfast and Larne coastguard stations.  There are examples of cross-Border co-operation before the 1998 peace process.  I ask that we raise the bar and do justice to the people who have been working on a cross-Border basis for the past 30 years, the people involved in groups from the North West Region Cross-Border Group, ICBAN and people working at the community interface level.  Cross-Border co-operation is not new to these people.  It is new at a departmental or national level in both our jurisdictions.  We must do justice to the Agreement, move forward and raise the bar.  If we do not begin to produce tangibles in access, roads, rail travel or other public transport provision we will undermine the confidence people still have in the Good Friday Agreement.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	With the permission of the Chair, the Donegal county manager made a specific request for this--
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He will know whether it is a waste of time.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	My issue is one for politicians to deal with not officials on either side of the Border.  A blind person would see that there is a complete vacuum in terms of joined-up policy on both sides of the Border, be it on a Monaghan-Tyrone level or a Donegal-Tyrone-Derry level.  We have to raise the bar.  What is the point in investing €580 million in a stretch of road from Derry to Aughnacloy, which is a dual carriageway, and then creating a bottleneck across the Border?  This is the type of issue on which we, as politicians, have to focus.  I am worried about the approach being taken.  The North-South Ministerial Council has been meeting.  This is an issue that should be debated at next week's transport meeting within the North-South ministerial framework.  The Border area and the counties on both sides of the Border have been more affected socio-economically and politically in the past by the Troubles and we have to bring about joined-up thinking in terms of policy.  I am pleased we have the opportunity to meet today.  We need these meetings to highlight issues.  However, joined-up thinking does not exist.  I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is not going to keep the door open in terms of having somebody involved from Monaghan County Council and Donegal County Council.
