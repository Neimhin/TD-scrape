JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Ba mhaith liom i dtús báire buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine thar lear i Meiriceá atá ag obair ar son daoine Éireannacha, go háirithe iad siúd atá gan aitheantas. I wish to address the House on the matter of the executive order signed by Presided Donald J. Trump on 27 January 2017. As Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora I have had an opportunity to meet a great many organisations and individuals working with Irish immigrants in the United States.Last September, I visited San Francisco and had a meeting with representatives of the Irish Immigration Center, which supports Irish immigrants in the Bay area. I met great people, such as a fellow townie of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Fr. Brendan McBride. Such people are heroes in our eyes who have worked continuously and tirelessly for people who need support in these areas. I subsequently travelled to New York, where I chaired a round-table meeting with representatives of the coalition of Irish immigration centres, which brings together Irish immigration centres from across the US. This was an important opportunity to reassure them of the Government's support for those working with Irish immigrants in the US, as well as its commitment to the twin objectives of relief for the undocumented and greater pathways for migration to the US. I also acknowledge the work of Senator Billy Lawless, who has been working very closely with me. He attended the meetings in New York and in January was at the meeting in Washington with the ambassador, Ms Anne Anderson, and her colleagues in the different consulates. In addition, I travelled to Boston and western Massachusetts last November where I again met with representatives of Irish immigration and pastoral centres, including the Irish Cultural Center of New England, the Irish Pastoral Center and the Irish International Immigration Center, as well as Irish citizens living in the US. These briefed me on the plight and uncertainty of some Irish citizens living in the United States. I wish to make clear the Government's current and future actions in helping Irish citizens abroad through the emigrant support programme, which allocated upwards of €2.3 million, or 70% of the funding. These ongoing efforts to secure the best for our citizens abroad are just one area where we benefit greatly from Ireland's close historic and cultural relationship with the United States, a relationship we must do our best to maintain and grow. We talk about the unique relationship a lot and we have to be conscious of the great people involved such as Colleen Ward, who organises an annual festival in Milwaukee on which 3,000 volunteers work and which is attended by some 500,000, and Máire Colcannon in Canton, Massachusetts who works to protect the Irish language and as a custodian of all things Irish. Ireland's relationship with the United States predates the independence of either nation. Our bonds are based on a shared history and culture and underpinned by common values including democracy, the rule of law and respect for all, regardless of ethnicity, religion or origin. Engagement with the new Administration is not confined to the events surrounding St. Patrick's Day but is continually reinforced by state visits throughout the year. Our diplomats in Washington and across the United States strive ceaselessly to sensitise local and federal leaders to Ireland's concerns and objectives. Likewise, our embassy and consulates provide consular services to Irish citizens in distress on a daily basis. As has been noted, it is only by continuing to engage with policy makers in the US that we can articulate our concerns, whether it be with regard to the recent executive order or concerning the need for immigration reform, to bring relief for undocumented individuals in the US. The Government will continue to use all opportunities which arise to set out its case, in the interests of our citizens. I have taken a personal interest in the undocumented and have met many people who pay their taxes but have had to use Skype for funerals and have missed significant family events back home such as weddings. I met a couple from my own county who are both undocumented. They had to drive their children to an airport last summer but were unable to join them and there are many hardship stories such as this. I acknowledge all the people working in the consulates and Irish immigration centres for the great work they do on behalf or Irish citizens abroad.
