JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the work of Deputy Pádraig MacLochlainn in bringing his legislation forward. The detail and the Minister's insight will obviously result in a different perspective on this side of the House. Let us consider the views of the individual citizen watching the circus of the CRC and the Rehab debacle. A farmer watching the 6 p.m. or 9 p.m. news looks at the amount of regulation at farm level and notes the regulation requiring his jeep to be tested every year. He notes all the regulations and bureaucracy in his life and his family's lives only to turn on the television to see a man receiving a golden handshake worth €742,000 without regulation. That is what is driving people daft and silly. It it is not just a case of annoyance as no word can describe it. The issue surrounding the CRC and the golden handshake is just disgusting. One should bear in mind the great work done at the CRC and the great work done for people who need and rely on its services. The downside may be a lack of funding for them as a consequence of this debacle. With regard to Rehab, I want to make a point that indicates some confusion in my mind. Last night, the Minister commented on figures and asked questions about the proportion of money coming in as opposed to going out and the net profit showing. The Taoiseach did so this morning. They were legitimate enough questions bearing in mind ministerial responsibility to this House. How could Rehab, the plaintiff, have a spokesperson make a public comment on the very same issue at a committee meeting on 9 October 2013 and yet regard the comments made last night by the Minister, Deputy Shatter, in his capacity as a member of the Executive, a responsible position in this House, as inappropriate? That confuses me and verification is required.
