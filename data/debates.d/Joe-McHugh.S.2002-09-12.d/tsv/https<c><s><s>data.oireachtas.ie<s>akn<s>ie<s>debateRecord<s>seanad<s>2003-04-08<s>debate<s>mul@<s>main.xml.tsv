JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh:	2002-09-12	None	I previously welcomed the inclusion in the spatial strategy of the Letterkenny-Derry area and the fact that it will be highlighted as a gateway access. There remains an opportunity in this regard under the strategic rail review. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has said he is not handcuffed to that blueprint and is open to negotiation and suggestion.It is in the national interest to provide railway access from Derry to Letterkenny and, in the long term, from Letterkenny to Sligo. If we did so, it would be a true cross-Border project. It would show our counterparts in the North that not only are we interested in peace and the ending of all paramilitary violence, but that we are also interested in the real beginning of peace, which is economic and social integration. I call for an urgent debate on this strategic document because a foreigner looking at that document, the existing railway track and the proposed railway lines would assume that there is nobody living in the north-west of Ireland. Donegal people are as entitled to railway tracks as anybody.
