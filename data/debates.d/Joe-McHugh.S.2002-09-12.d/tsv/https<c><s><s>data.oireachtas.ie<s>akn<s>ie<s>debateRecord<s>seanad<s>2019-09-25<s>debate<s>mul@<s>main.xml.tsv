JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	The Acting Chairman has gone to great lengths, even painting the place for my arrival. I appreciate that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is good to be back here. I presume the Senators are well settled in at this stage.  I thank the Joint Committee on Education and Skills for producing this report on relationships and sexuality education, RSE, which addresses a significant matter and one which Members know my Department has moved to address. I welcome this opportunity to listen to the views of Members on this important and timely report. I also wish to acknowledge the organisations and individuals who contributed to the work of the committee, as well as the dedication and diligence of teachers throughout our schools, and the work that has been undertaken so far towards making relationships and sexuality education fit for Ireland's young people. I acknowledge the Chairman, Deputy O'Loughlin, and her team of officials, a couple of whom are present, for the work they have carried out in this regard. The House will be aware that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is currently carrying out a review of RSE on foot of a request from my predecessor. I have asked the NCCA to consider the committee's report as part of that review. The NCCA review involves an examination of the curriculum at both primary and post-primary levels, including an examination of the experience and reality of RSE as delivered in schools and how the RSE curriculum is planned and taught. The NCCA review comprises a number of dimensions, namely, a desktop review of recently published research studies, consultation with individuals and organisations working in this area, and an online survey to gauge the views of students, parents, teachers, etc. The NCCA is also working directly with schools to examine the experience of RSE in the classroom, which is a core part of the review. The review by the NCCA, which took place between June 2018 and March 2019, addresses the key issues raised in the joint committee report. The committee's report has contributed greatly to the evidence-gathering process for the NCCA review. The NCCA is currently engaging in consultation to ensure that the findings and the related draft advice are reflective of the views of students, schools and parents. This consultation process is open until 25 October. I would encourage people and groups to continue to use that mechanism and the opportunity of consultation to have their views heard. I emphasise clearly that no decision has been taken at this stage. I repeat, because I am aware from different groups that there are fears around quality and what will be contained in this curriculum, that no decision has been made. I am sure that when we are finished this process, whatever decisions are made will be delivered in an appropriate way to students in different classes in the various demographics. I expect to receive the NCCA's completed review before the end of the year. It is very appropriate that the time is now being taken to carry out a major review of how we educate our young people about relationships and sexuality. Issues such as consent, contraception and sexuality need to be taught in a way that not only acknowledges our changing society but also addresses issues that arise in society which indicate a lack of understanding of these areas. It is vitally important that our education system prepares our young people for life in an Irish society that values each individual's sexual orientation, respects decisions regarding contraception and understands consent. We all recognise that relationship and sexuality education in this country must be fit for purpose and meet the needs of young people today in modern Ireland. It is important that topics in social, personal and health education, SPHE, and RSE are dealt with in an age-appropriate manner at all levels. There is much uncertainty about what is currently taught in relationships and sexuality education in schools. Schools are obliged to teach all elements of the relationships and sexuality education curriculum and no element can be omitted on the grounds of school ethos or characteristic spirit. Every student in our schools has a right to access information about sexual health, relationships and sexuality. We should acknowledge the commitment of our teachers and recognise their professional expertise in dealing with a difficult topic. I acknowledge the extensive resource materials prepared by a number of organisations to support implementation of the curriculum in areas concerning RSE. This includes the HSE, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and the sexual health crisis pregnancy programme. There are some excellent resources available to teachers to support them in delivering the RSE curriculum. The Talking Relationships, Understanding Sexuality Teaching, TRUST, resource developed by the HSE may be used to supplement RSE at senior cycle. This resource focuses on consent through the following topics: loving relationships, intimacy, assertive communication, understanding boundaries, communicating boundaries without consent, and when sexual assault becomes a reality. The development of the LGBTI+ youth strategy is a key commitment for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the programme for Government and also makes a contribution towards the Government's broader commitment to continue to strive for full inclusion of LGBTI+ people in Ireland. The Department of Education and Skills is inputting to that process. We must also acknowledge the role that parents play in the education of their children. The RSE provided in our schools, coupled with education provided at home by parents, is associated with the best outcomes for students.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Members for their contributions. I enjoy being in this House because it provides a space for an indepth examination and critique of many subjects and this is a very important area. I value everybody's contribution to the debate. Senator Mullen said nothing had been decided and that is the case. There will be a consultation process until 25 October and this evening's contributions will form part of that. When the then Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, initiated this he tasked the NCCA with completing the report, which it will do so that, at the end of the year when I hope it will be finalised, we will be able to see where we are. I take on board other people's opinions and that includes parents' fears. Parents hear different things but, ultimately, it boils down to three very important words, namely, value, respect and understanding. Irish society should value each individual sexual orientation, respect decisions around contraception and try to understand issues such as consent. These words were part of our core curriculum when we went through school and all these words were in use at my Loreto school in the 1980s, as were dignity and compassion. Society is rapidly changing but we can still hold on to and harness what is dear to us in our value-based system. Resources have to follow and Senator Byrne referred to training in this context. Whatever decision is made, resources will have to follow. I came across a piece of research recently which showed that just one in three of the young people who were interviewed felt their parents listened to them. One out of ten felt politicians listened to them, which reflects a stark reality and seems to be the inverse of the situation in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.There is a very close relationship between parents and young people, one which has moved into a space of mutual respect. Even at this late stage, I encourage parents to use the consultation mechanism to make their viewpoint heard on this very important decision before 25 October. We will be in a position to have a report from the NCCA at the end of the year. I have taken note of a number of contributions and viewpoints. The message reflected in all of them is that this issue is complex and requires much more than one silo effort in the area of sexuality education. It also relates to mental health and the serious anxieties young people experience in the world we live in. We have to grapple with that and take this much further. Consent starts with self-respect, respecting oneself, and then showing respect for other individuals. We have to do much more work around building capacity and empowering the cumas of the individual and student. Teachers have worked through that over the past two decades and are in a completely different place now. We have discussed curriculum change but a lot of good work is being done in secondary and primary schools around empowerment and capacity building. We are on that journey together. The contributions made tonight will be included in the consultation and I am sure the NCCA will listen closely to the views expressed in this discussion. We cherish inclusivity and believe we live in a pluralist society. If there are people who feel their voices are not being heard in this debate, I encourage them to continue to make their voices heard. We will see what the NCCA comes up with at the end of this process.
