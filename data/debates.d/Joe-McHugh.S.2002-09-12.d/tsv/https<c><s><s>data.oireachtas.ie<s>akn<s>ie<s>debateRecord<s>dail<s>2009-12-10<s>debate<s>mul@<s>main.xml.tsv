JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While I welcome certain aspects of collaboration under the framework of the Schengen Agreement and the common travel area agreed in 1987, things have changed in the past 22 years.  I wish to focus on tourism.  A tourist from China or India can apply for a multiple visa costing â‚¬50 within the 25 countries zone.  We are putting ourselves at a considerable disadvantage, particularly in respect of all-island tourism.  We aspire to targeting the Chinese and Indian markets but we must facilitate some form of harmonisation.  Will the Minister consider some mechanism to facilitate all-island tourism for those from outside the European Union?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The thrust of my argument is to examine facilitation.  I appreciate that we do not seek to interfere with the common travel area but the common travel area should not be the sacrificial lamb to get more movement to attract tourism.  A tourist from outside the EU arriving in Belfast for an all-island tourism experience and travelling by train to Dublin via the Minister's constituency must apply for two visas.  We should examine this difficulty.  I ask the Minister to engage with his neighbours across the water and examine harmonisation for tourism.
