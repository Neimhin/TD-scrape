JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As many people in this House will be aware, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, Rory O'Donnell, Earl of Tyrconnell and the Maguires of Fermanagh, along with their families, left Ireland forever in an event known as the flight of the earls. The date was 14 September 1607 and the place of departure was Rathmullan, County Donegal. This was of major importance to Ireland as it drew a symbolic line between the Gaelic way of life, with its richness of tradition and the new modern Ireland, with its centralised control and imported customs. I am asking the Government, through the Leader, to put in place adequate resources to allow the group in Rathmullan to organise a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the flight of the earls. This is not just a once off event; it is a symbolic occasion involving people North and South. This event will encourage and facilitate co-operation between people on both sides of the Border. The only way we will move forward, in terms of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, is if we have co-operation. This symbolic celebration could contribute towards relieving the political stalemate and there are two and a half years in which to organise it.
