JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, as an seans labhairt inniu faoin ábhar iontach tábhachtach seo. I thank the Deputies for raising this matter. I regret that this situation has arisen for the students and staff of Grafton College. The fact that we are coming into Christmas lends added significance to the matter. It is important to note that the majority of English language schools in Ireland are privately run. The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract, and issues relating to working conditions, including payment of wages, are matters between the two parties and do not come under the remit of the Department of Education and Skills. That said, I know there has been a public request in this regard, which the Deputies have repeated. I would be happy to meet the delegation. I can try to juggle and rejig my timetable this evening. If a delegation is in the House today, I would be happy to meet it in my office. I will stay in touch with the Deputies in this regard. I am, however, also conscious of expectations, which is why I put on the record my role in such matters. From a human point of view, I would like to meet the delegation. Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, is closely monitoring the situation arising from the Grafton College closure and is engaging with all relevant stakeholders to ensure the closure will be as orderly as possible. Grafton College is a member of Marketing English in Ireland, MEI, an association of English language schools. I understand that students from Grafton College will be able to complete their studies in another MEI member school. Employees affected by the closure of a business may be entitled to apply, through the liquidator, to the insolvency payments scheme, which is administered by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. I have spoken to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, in this regard. The Minister of State with responsibility for higher education, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, is progressing legislation through the Oireachtas which is intended to strengthen substantially regulation and quality in the English language education sector. The Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Bill is scheduled for Committee Stage in the Seanad today, 5 December. The new Bill will establish the international education mark and a learner protection fund. The international education mark, IEM, is a core component of the Government's policy for the English language sector. Only those providers that meet the robust quality assurance procedures of Quality and Qualifications Ireland will be allowed to carry the mark and recruit international students. The IEM will provide learners, or potential learners, with the necessary confidence that providers with the IEM have been quality-assured by QQI. Upon enactment, the Bill will also empower QQI to establish a learner protection fund which will be resourced by an annual charge from those providers covered by it. The fund will be used to "teach out" a programme in the event that a provider fails to provide a programme. Should this not be possible, the fund will be used to reimburse students for the most recent fees that have been paid. The Bill also contains provisions to provide QQI with additional statutory powers to examine the bona fides of a provider. Providers will have to satisfy QQI in respect of issues such as their legal personality, ownership and corporate governance arrangements in addition to ensuring that adequate financial resources are in place to ensure the viability of these businesses. This will mean that only providers that satisfy QQI in these areas will have their quality assurance procedures approved by QQI and be eligible for the international education mark and to recruit international students. These measures will militate against the prospect of further college closures. The issue of employment rights for English teachers has also been raised in the context of the qualifications and quality assurance Bill. I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, will respond to issues raised by Senators on Committee Stage of that Bill this afternoon. As in the case of any Bill going through the Houses, the Minister of State will consider any amendments and they will be subject to her decisions as they are dealt with. A number of amendments have been tabled.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. We will work out the logistics afterwards. I thank the Deputies again. We are talking about the current human problem we have so close to Christmas and the disruption and difficulties it is causing. We are also talking about how we will prevent this from happening again. The QQI legislation is integral to this, as is the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017. I know all Deputies of all parties and none have been working and pushing that agenda very hard. We must look at employment rights. I have been speaking to my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty. We will continue to ensure that the Bill passes all Stages in the Dáil. It is progressing through the Seanad. The Deputies will be aware of its key provisions, which relate to zero-hour contracts in certain circumstances and the introduction of banded-hour contracts. That second element is really important. I have come across this issue so many times in my time in politics. In Gweedore, in my county, we had to deal with the heartbreak and difficulty of a company that went belly up on the eve of Christmas.One of the big issues at the time was that employees wanted to find out what was available to them, how could they pay for the important stuff over Christmas and how could they get through it. They were the questions. What we did, collectively, in County Donegal on a joint Oireachtas basis, was to ensure the people with the answers, that is, representatives from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, were available. When we are thinking about how we are going to organise the meeting, I want to ensure the people with the answers will be there also. I will try to organise for somebody from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to attend the meeting. I would meet a delegation in my office, but as everybody wants to have a say, let us try to figure out some way to do it. We can have a chat about it straightaway afterwards, if the Deputies are agreeable. Across the spectrum, we have all known of recent examples of subbie busters, where people have not been getting paid and companies have gone into liquidation, etc. There is nothing more heartbreaking, difficult or disruptive to family life. I understand that and I am happy to meet the people who have come here today and not just out of courtesy. I am here as a representative of the Government to see how we can organise a pathway to deal with this problem. If it is a case of looking at long-term progression such as extra training or employment prospects in the sector, let us look at all of the options. I am happy to do so, but I would like to have the right people in the room to give the right advice, especially this close to Christmas.
