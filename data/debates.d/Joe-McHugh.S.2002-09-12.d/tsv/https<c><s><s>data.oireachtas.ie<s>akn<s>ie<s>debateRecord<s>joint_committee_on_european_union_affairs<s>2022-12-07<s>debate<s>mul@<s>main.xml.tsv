JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh an tOllamh John O'Brennan; Jean Monnet chair of European integration at Maynooth University, Ollscoil Mhá Nuad, go dtí an cruinniú. Táimid ag dúil go mór leis an díospóireacht agus amharc a thabhairt ar na bealaí agus na deiseanna difriúla atá ann fá choinne na daoine óga, ní hamháin sna meánscoileanna ach sna bunscoileanna fosta. Beimid ag amharc ar na deiseanna fostaíochta san Eoraip, i Strasbourg, i Lucsamburg agus sa Bhruiséil. I welcome Professor O'Brennan to this discussion today on opportunities not just for young people but any Irish people looking at career paths or career change opportunities within the European Union. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if a statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity the witness will be directed to discontinue. It is imperative that any such direction is complied with. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. We know the drill now and we know the rules around that. I call Professor O'Brennan who is in his 15th year in Maynooth university to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I commend Professor O'Brennan on going off script a little on that point. Does each university have an equivalent to the department of sociology in Maynooth?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Professor O'Brennan has quite a long speech and there is a lot of good stuff in it. If it is okay with Professor O'Brennan, it might be better that members interrupt rather than the committee moving to staged questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Let us imagine I am a secondary school student who is not doing the leaving certificate but coming out of junior cycle. I am in transition year and do not know where I want to go or what I want to do. Perhaps I will study for an arts degree in economics. I arrive in first year in Maynooth and I still do not know what career path I want to follow. Should I be targeted or should information sessions about opportunities in Europe be provided at an early stage, once I arrive in university? Should we reach out to secondary schools or career guidance teachers? How can we - Professor O'Brennan used the word "mentor" - how can we identify students? Perhaps Professor O'Brennan will say a bit more about that process.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is a lot of information in Professor O'Brennan's presentation and I do not think he is going to get through it all. I recommend that he pick out bits and pieces.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is refreshing that Professor O'Brennan is not holding back in the context of what is not and what is working. I reached out to some schools prior to today and I know that some career counsellors and the head of politics and society classes are listening. We can pursue Professor O'Brennan's proposal on trying to have more contact with politics and society teachers. There was a lot in his contribution. We can certainly send it on to the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and the Minister-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Are there any takers? Does anyone want to make a proposal in that regard.? We could also involve the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science because much of this relates to his brief.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	A hundred years later we are still waiting for job description.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On Professor O'Brennan's point about a permanent citizens' assembly that would move around the country, every time there is a big question on the future of Europe, a referendum is coming up or some kind of treaty change, we have town hall meetings. We know who will be in the right-hand corner of the room and who will be in the left-hand corner. The idea of having a citizens' assembly to discuss these big questions is excellent.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are meandering towards a conclusion. I have two final points. The first is an observation that when the Professor is giving his opinion he is not afraid to shoot from the hip, which is really refreshing. We all need to be challenged, and governments certainly need to be challenged. However, there is a very current and hot topic issue at the moment relating to teacher career leave. In my opinion, the teachers who get career leave come back much more informed and experienced. Without opening up the hornets' nest around that, is there a potential pathway for teachers who want to go to Brussels? I am thinking about those who teach history, geography, Spanish and French. There are a lot of Irish teachers with expertise who are spread all over the world, be it in Shanghai, Beijing, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah, Qatar, Oman, Dubai or Abu Dhabi. Teachers are going to continue going to these places. I was a teacher and I certainly would not be critical of them. As a nation, we go abroad to broaden our minds. Is there an option for teachers who want to take a career break to go to Brussels and bring all that knowledge back into the classroom and into their communities? Is there an opportunity there for enrichment? I was in Prague recently with Irish translators and interpreters, and the full interpretation suite as Gaeilge. It was great to open up the monitor and see Gaeilge on a par with Italian, French and German. It is great to have that expertise there. I commend all the people out there. They are doing a massive job. It is also a highly skilled job. For students from Ireland with Gaeilge who are looking at pathways, I presume it is the usual drill for interpreters and translators of having to have three languages. Now, however, Irish is one of them. They can tick the Irish and English box and they just need a third language. Can Professor O'Brennan just confirm that for people who are listening in? I would be interested in his thoughts on those two points.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is not yet.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are very grateful to Professor O'Brennan for his openness and his engagement this morning. It has been really helpful. The clerk to the committee will follow up in respect of inviting the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs to come before us. We will send the Professor's presentation to the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science and will try to bring in whomever is going to be the holder of that office in the new year.Táim fíorbhuíoch de John O’Brennan agus, ar son an chomhchoiste, guím gach rath air as a obair féin agus as a moltaí i leith na hEorpa fosta. Tá mo dhuine iontach buíoch faoin gcaidreamh, as an díospóireacht agus as an gcaint oscailte inniu fosta. Is é sin é.
