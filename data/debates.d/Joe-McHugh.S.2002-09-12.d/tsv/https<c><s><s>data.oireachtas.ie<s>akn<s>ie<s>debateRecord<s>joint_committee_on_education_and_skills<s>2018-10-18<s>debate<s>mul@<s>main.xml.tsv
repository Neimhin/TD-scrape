JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Chair and committee for the invitation. I acknowledge that they are reaching out and want an inclusive approach here. That is the language that I was speaking to my officials with yesterday. I see a role for this committee. The work and report it has done on positive mental health and well-being and the committee's suggestions are of critical importance. I will be looking at a 2019 plan and I would like this committee to be part of that plan, front and centre, for 2019. At a wider level, we will be looking at a three-year education plan and I would like the space and time at this committee to see how we can work together on that. We have cross-party representation and Independents here. They all have their own experiences, having been together as a committee and working on education matters for longer than I have. I have been thrown into the job in the last 48 hours. I spent yesterday trying to familiarise myself with a wide range of policy. At 10 p.m. last night, my head was about to explode and I had to stop. My take away from my first day on the job yesterday is this. I was a secondary school teacher in 1993 and the world of education is different now. I acknowledge everybody involved in the education sector, the teachers and the creative work that has been done. I will get a chance to talk about that on a wider level later. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an gCathaoirleach agus le baill an Chomhchoiste um Oideachas agus Scileanna de bharr na suime atá léirithe acu maidir le cothú na folláine agus na meabhairshláinte dearfaí sa chóras scoile. Ba mhaith liom fosta mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an gcoiste as ucht an chuiridh labhairt anseo inniu. Tá mé sásta go raibh an deis seo agam an t-eolas is deireanaí a roinnt maidir leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag mo Roinn i dtaobh na moltaí a cuireadh chun cinn sa tuarascáil Positive Mental Health in Schools. I thank the Chair and members of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills for the interest they have shown in the area of well-being promotion and positive mental health in our schools and for their invitation to attend today to update the committee on the progress being made by my Department in implementing the recommendations made in the committee's 2017 report on Positive Mental Health in Schools. My statement today will primarily address the role of the Department of Education and Skills in the promotion of well-being and positive mental health; the Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023; and progress made on the recommendations of the joint committee's report on positive mental health in schools. The promotion of well-being is an essential element of the ambition of the Department of Education and Skills to achieve the best education and training system in Europe by 2026. Schools and centres for education are crucial to the ongoing development of our children and young people's well-being and we are fortunate to have schools already doing so much to enhance children and young people's knowledge and skills in this area. The Department of Education and Skills has a key role to play in the promotion of the well-being of children and young people in Ireland, in collaboration with the Departments of Health and Children and Youth Affairs, and with other Departments and agencies. The promotion of well-being in the education community is a priority for the Department of Education and Skills. My Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting schools in promoting well-being and positive mental health. The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. The action plan for education for 2016 to 2019 from the Department of Education and Skills set out a number of objectives and proposed actions specifically targeting the promotion of well-being and positive mental health in our school communities.These actions build upon and complement well-being promoting measures that have already been put in place. They include improved curriculum content, including the introduction of the junior cycle well-being programme; more training for teachers and school staff, including the roll-out of evidence based programmes to promote social and emotional competence, resilience and school connectedness; the introduction of best practice models of school based student support teams; an increase in the number of NEPS psychologists; and the restoration of guidance posts. Key among the objectives within the Action Plan for Education 2018 was the publication of the Department’s Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023, which was launched in July 2018, providing an overarching structure encompassing existing, ongoing and developing work in the area of well-being promotion. The Wellbeing Policy Statement and Framework for Practice 2018-2023 sets out the ambition and vision of the Department of Education and Skills that, by 2023, the promotion of well-being will be at the core of the ethos of every school and centre for education in Ireland, that all schools will provide evidence-informed approaches and support, appropriate to need, to promote the well-being of their students and that Ireland will be recognised as a leader in this area. The well-being policy statement and framework for practice describes how schools can best promote well-being. In practice, such schools are those that recognise the importance of well-being promotion, where the voices of children and young people are heard, and where they experience a sense of belonging and feel safe, connected and supported. They are schools which provide children and young people with positive experiences, high-quality teaching and learning, and in which approaches to well-being are developed, implemented and self-evaluated. Furthermore, they are schools that can signpost students and their parents to internal and external pathways to support, as needed. The well-being policy statement sets out the evidence base for best practice in regard to school well-being promotion, which indicates that schools should adopt a whole-school, multi-component, preventative approach to well-being promotion that includes both universal and targeted interventions. A whole-school approach involves all in the school community engaging in a collaborative process to improve areas of school life that impact on well-being. This will be achieved through the use of a school self-evaluation process taking well-being promotion as its focus. It will allow schools to benchmark their practice against indicators of success and statements of effective practice, and identify areas for development, implementation and review. It is envisaged that schools will engage with the statements and adapt and develop the best practice items as they meet the needs in their own school community. A multi-component approach encourages schools to address areas, not only relating to teaching and learning, but also relating to other essential elements of well-being promotion, including school culture and environment, policy and planning, and relationships and partnerships. Working preventatively and providing for both universal and targeted approaches is described as providing a "continuum of support". Schools are encouraged to provide supports to promote the well-being of all within the school community, as well as providing some targeted interventions for children and young people presenting with vulnerabilities in the area of well-being. These areas are embedded in the well-being framework for practice. It is my Department’s aim that, by 2023, all schools and centres for education will have embedded this dynamic school self-evaluation process focusing on well-being promotion. The implementation of this well-being promotion process is an ongoing process that will ensure the necessary focus on supporting children and young people in having a sense of purpose and fulfilment, and the skills necessary to deal with life’s challenges. Schools will be supported in this work by a comprehensive national professional development programme currently being developed and trialled, and a full national roll-out will commence in 2019 and run to 2023. This will include facilitating the engagement of schools in the school self-evaluation for well-being promotion process, which will build professional capacity. The implementation plan for this policy also sets goals to promote the well-being of teachers and to address the learning needs of current and future teachers in regard to well-being promotion. Work is under way to map the range of existing supports that schools can already access through the Professional Development Service for Teachers, PDST, health and well-being team, the Junior Cycle for Teachers service and NEPS, with a view to ensuring there is a comprehensive and easily accessible set of resources to address school-identified well-being promotion needs. There is also a plan to develop a research based framework for the evaluation of well-being promotion in schools. A well-being policy implementation group is in place which will co-ordinate activity with other Departments. This group will link with the Pathfinder project structures when progressed. The Department collaborates in the implementation of Healthy Ireland 2013-2025, the Connecting for Life strategy 2015-2020 and Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures 2014-2020. The well-being policy statement and framework for practice has incorporated some of the key recommendations of this committee’s report on positive mental health in schools. I thank all the committee members for their work and input in that regard. Key recommendations in regard to the whole-school approach, the importance of listening and of feeling a sense of belonging, and connectedness to school are highlighted as areas to target in school well-being promotion. The implementation plan recognises the need, and plans to provide for additional teacher training and the development of more resources for schools. The needs of children and young people with well-being vulnerabilities are also recognised, and actions that require co-operation between the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments and agencies, including the Department of Health, the HSE, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla are included in the implementation plan. My Department will continue to work closely with other Departments and stakeholders to ensure an aligned approach and a continuum of services is provided to promote the positive mental health and well-being of all of our children and young people. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an gcoiste as ucht an cuiridh an doiciméid seo a chur ina láthair agus páirt a glacadh sa phlé. Tá mé breá sásta aon cheist atá ag baill an choiste a fhreagairt. Once again, I thank the committee for the invitation. I am happy to take any questions members may have.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the chairperson and the members for their contributions and their approach on my first day at committee. Engagement is important and I am accountable for a large budget of nearly €10.8 billion. I know the honeymoon period will not last long, but I look forward to that as well because dialogue-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Did the Deputy not say for the whole day? Was it just the morning? I will go through each person's contribution, if that is okay.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If there are areas where more information is needed, we can get back to the committee directly. Deputy Martin said education is an investment and not a cost. Education is wider, broader and different. The old Irish word "oideachas" suggests it is about the second family and parents entrusting their young people with the second family, whether it is in naíonraí, primary school, secondary school or university. I am happy to work with the committee on that. On the Deputy's point about the paragraph on the recommendations, I have a full copy here that I was given as a brief yesterday. There were 18 to 20 recommendations that the committee made. I have a brief on that which I am happy to circulate to the committee.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Everybody will have a copy. Has school-based counselling been tried and tested? A lot of work has been done on the well-being policy as it relates to the Australian model but also in relation to mental wellness at primary school level. I am in total agreement that it has to start at early stages for young people when they are entering a different world and there is an overload of information and they are dealing with all sorts of anxiety challenges. I agree with the committee. There was a commitment in the programme for partnership Government for 65 NEPS psychologists. We are up to 31, so we are not there yet.The Deputy also asked about maternity cover and maternity leave. If there are critical incidents and they are needed for support when somebody is on maternity leave then that will be provided. There is a National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, psychologist to respond to queries and there is access to NEPS support and development work. There is no panel as far as I am aware but it is something that we need to work towards and I am happy to do that. On looking after teachers, the text messages have already come in with anecdotal advice and information but I am getting a sense that there is information fatigue or initiative overload-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am getting that feedback and as I step into my brief I will get more feedback. I am meeting the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, tomorrow and I will continue that intensive engagement for the short to medium term. That is why I want to look at the 2019 preparation and work with the committee on a 2019 plan and a three year plan to see what is working and what is not working in the action plan and to see what its strengths and weaknesses are. I know that at the centre of all teaching is caring and kindness as different contributors pointed out today. I am conscious of the well-being of teachers as well and it is something that I want to work closely on. I do not want to talk about my experiences as a teacher as it was a long time ago. Everybody has their own anecdotal evidence. Deputy Catherine Martin worked as a teacher for 20 years and the experiential learning we have will hopefully be helpful and constructive as we approach our dialogue. One hour on mental wellness-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In fairness there has been a massive drive on mental health in this current Parliament over the past two and a half years, not just because Deputy Catherine Martin came here, but because of the significance of what is happening with this new type of politics. As somebody who has been in the position of Chief Whip, the consensus approach where I engaged with the likes of Deputies Mattie McGrath, Ó Snodaigh and Michael Moynihan was one where we had to get consensus every week and I want to bring that type of approach and philosophy to the work that we are trying to do here as well. I do not have a monopoly on wisdom on what the Deputy's approach is but I am all ears and the communication line is really important. On how we treat each other, I know Chris Ruane MP from my British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly days as well. He is a good Liverpudlian and a good person and I am happy to work on any initiative within the Oireachtas.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are leaders and that leadership is in a public manner. This committee is being broadcast live today. People could be in their kitchens today watching. It could be a mother or father whose children are at school or it could be a child who is not at school today listening to this so how we engage with each other and treat each other - the word "respect" was used - is all important in our leadership role and position. Day to day politics needs to be done as well but if there is a mindfulness initiative here I am certainly happy to be a part of that if I am invited and I will be happy to offer any support that I can give.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to forward that information to the Deputy and as a final point before the Deputy leaves, whether one is a physics teacher or a French teacher one also has the mindfulness responsibility. The teachers do that really well and it is a whole-school approach which was the Deputy's number one priority coming to this committee. I do not know if her priorities were outlined chronologically but the whole-school approach was the first priority. We have to acknowledge the fact that a lot of the mindfulness, caring and child-centred approaches are already being carried out by teachers. I take the Deputy's point and I will get that information to her.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I look forward to working with Deputy Thomas Byrne and I refer to his questions around guidance counselling. He raised the issue of responsibility for counselling. This goes back to the collaborative suggestion that the Chairman was making. The responsibility for the provision of mental health services and counselling for young people lies with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive but we have to reach out, whether that is with Tusla or the HSE. I am happy to work with the Deputy on that and if it means bringing the three committees and the three chairmen together along with the Ministers responsible then we have to drive that collaborative approach and I know that was key in the recommendations. The measures announced by the Department over the course of budgets 2016, 2017 and 2018 mean that 500 guidance posts, or two thirds of the guidance allocation that was withdrawn in budget 2012 has been restored to schools from September 2018. I thank the Deputy for his own personal contribution to ensuring that this happened. These 500 posts are allocated separately and transparently and outside of the quote on the normal schedule of posts, there is an obligation on schools to ensure that these hours are used for guidance activities. Schools can decide to allocate more hours to guidance than the amount allocated on the schedule. They cannot allocate fewer hours and a guidance plan will outline the school's approach to guidance generally in how students can be supported and assisted in making choices and successful transitions in their personal and social education and in career areas. I am interested in the Deputy's point about how the role changes and on the evolving nature of the challenges that we have. The Deputy also mentioned NEPS and NEPS psychologists and I referenced that already. On the code of practice for people and different groups coming in, a new circular was issued in July to update schools on what is appropriate in terms of using external providers and programmes so that can be used as part of a whole school-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	But there will still be different groups and individuals-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am with the Deputy on that. He also mentioned school nurses possibly coming into schools as well and that is part of our wider conversation, whether that is with the HSE or the Department of Health. On focusing on the structure, the Deputy is right that teachers only have a certain amount of time. They are under pressure and I referenced initiative overload already so we have to take stock of what Deputy Bruton and the committee as a collective have been working on and the initiatives that have been taking place within the Department over the past two and a half years. I am happy to do an evaluation of where we are at. Let us see what is working and what areas we can do better in.  The Deputy mentioned joint responsibility and what he would like me to do as Minister. He said that not all schools should be thrown together and there should be joint responsibility. That is a wider conversation that we can have in the future. He also referenced child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, and that goes back to where we get this-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes and it goes back to acknowledging that there are different initiatives in different schools. They involve such matters as the school helping the local athletics club building a new track. That collaboration is there. We can learn a lot from these individual examples where initiatives are working and the collaboration and volunteerism is thriving. There are plenty of volunteers coming into schools but it goes back to the Deputy's point about the code of practice. There is a philosophy, ethos and code of practice in the school that needs to be adhered to as well. Deputy Hildegarde Naughton differentiated between well-being and empathy which was a very important point when we are moving into the area of emotional intelligence and being able to deal with those situations along with being able to deal with all of the pressures that there are on young people, whether it be anxiety issues or other challenges in the different worlds that they live in. We have to be able to adapt to that but again it goes back to schools. So many schools do this so well. There are so many good leaders and individuals and if there are examples of initiatives working, we have to be open to those new ideas.As somebody who comes from a community development background as well as a teaching background, I know the bottom up approach is where the real leadership is. When I come in as a new Minister to meet my officials in the Department, I know my vision is no good unless it is inclusive, which we talked about, and unless we are learning from the good things happening already. There are 1,300 staff working in the Department of Education and Skills. I met a number of them in Marlborough Street. I will look to them to find out what they have learned and where they see the strengths but also to this committee and the practitioners themselves, including teachers and anybody in a leadership position in the primary, secondary and third level sector. It will be a cross-school and cross-community partnership approach. It is all in the document. I flicked through the well-being document last night. It talks about relationships, partnership, collaboration and working together. There are also incentives and new digital strategies. There are incentives around clustering. There are all these new initiatives that we need to bring focus to but there are examples of how we can work together. Culture and training have been mentioned. It is a question of decisions around resourcing. Where do we allocate the resources? These are the decisions that are made in the context of budgetary decisions.  Senator Byrne talked about well-being, mental health and also mindfulness. A lot of work is being done on mindfulness. There is also a recommendation in the mental health report to establish an expert group to investigate the appropriateness, feasibility and best practice approach regarding the introduction of mindfulness. I have an expanded circular here. It is a skill that can be usefully taught to young people as part of the SPHE curriculum. The use of mindfulness in education has a lot in common with and can complement the SPHE curriculum which aims to teach children about managing emotions and developing relationships. Mindfulness is likely to be useful to support this implementation but it is unlikely to replace it. It can have a positive impact and can fit into a wide range of contexts for pupils and staff. The practice of mindfulness can be part of developing a healthy lifestyle. There is quite a bit of work done on that. We are considering the introduction of mindfulness as an approach that can be used to promote well-being. It would be an important factor. Access to psychologists is really important and timely. If a psychologist was on maternity leave, for example, it is important that there would still be support and access. Inclusiveness was mentioned. We have to be inclusive. That is an agenda I will be pursuing in my new role.  Deputy McLoughlin referenced working relationships and communications. If we are not communicating with stakeholders and if we are not working on a two-way street, communication breaks down and we are not moving forward. It is something I am very conscious of. We worked closely together in my previous role. If a Deputy or Senator, from either side of the House, is trying to find out information, for example on a school project or the status of a capital project, I will work hard to provide that information because it is critical to the work we are involved in, whether in advancing a new school or updating, upgrading or extending classrooms. Deputy McLoughlin talked about 2023. We have an evolving and fluid change within the education system. That is why I want to tighten it to see what we can do within a three-year period. I flagged with my officials yesterday morning that it is what I want to do and that is where the committee comes in. I appreciate the committee's involvement at an early stage. There is no point working on a 2019 plan in January or February. Within the next couple of weeks I will be happy to come back in here and discuss it again. The Chairman spoke about mental health and mental illness and the distinction between them, with which I agree. She also spoke about the collaboration with the Department of Health. The promotion of positive mental health was nearly the cornerstone of the report. We have cross-departmental work, which the committee will be aware of. In the 2018 report on the pathfinder project, the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs reported on youth mental health and proposed setting up an office to co-ordinate services. It will continue to work on that. It goes back again to the relationship between different Departments and the communication and collaborative approach. I am happy to work with the committee on that.  The well-being plans were mentioned. Every school will have to self-evaluate. There will be a self-evaluation project. The recommendations were mentioned. I will have an expansive breakdown of those. There will be more information and engagement on the development stage. Promoting well-being among teachers is really important. I will repeat myself on the issue of how we can support teachers. If we support our teachers, the students are supported. They have natural abilities. They are caring, kind and empathetic and have emotional intelligence and all that but they also need support if the workload is impeding them in any way. That is why it is so important to get it right in terms of what is and is not working and where the weaknesses and strengths are.  With regard to a pilot initiative by the Department, led by the Association of Teacher Education Centres Ireland, ATECI, and part of the creative youth plan to enable the creative potential of every child and young person, I have already spoken to my previous Secretary General in the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to see how we can work together on the Creative Ireland projects. If there are initiatives we can work together on, I am happy to do that. We can work collaboratively to create clusters within the 68 schools selected as part of the schools excellence fund.  If the committee has any follow-up questions, I am happy to take them. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There was one question asked about the NEPS psychologists. I think it may have been from Deputy Byrne. Of their work, 20% is to build the capacity of schools to support all students. That includes delivering CBT continuing professional development training to teachers on a programme to reduce anxiety and build coping skills. The incredible years programme builds social and emotional competencies and develops student support teams. There are two or three messages I want to give today. First, I do not have the wisdom or knowledge about how to move forward but I have the capacity to work really hard. It is my job to listen to what the committee has been doing in the past two and a half years and to build on it and to identify the strengths and ways to move forward. I really look forward to working with the committee.
