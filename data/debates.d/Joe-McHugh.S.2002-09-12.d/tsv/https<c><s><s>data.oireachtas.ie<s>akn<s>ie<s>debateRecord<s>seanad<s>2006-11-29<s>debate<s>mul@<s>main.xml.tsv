JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share time with Senator Bradford.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I also welcome a fellow Donegal man, the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher.  He will be aware of the challenges in providing housing in our county.  However, we must debate an issue such as this on a national basis.  With regard to stamp duty, the issue has been avoided in the course of the debate and in the Government's amendment.For the past decade, construction has been this country's lifeblood, with significant revenue and other benefits accruing from the sector.  The 90,000 houses which were built last year produced average fees worth €80,000 for solicitors and architects, as well as 13% profits for builders.  Last year, the construction sector contributed a total of €6.4 billion to the economy.  However, nobody in Government appears willing to ask questions about long-term sustainability.  The blind belief persists that the good times will not end and the construction will remain sustainable.  Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat politicians privately agree the industry is not sustainable, yet they have not introduced any measures to address the problem.  Other industries which were traditionally sustainable, such as fishing and farming, are being ignored.  No strategy has been put in place to divert resources into alternative industries.Three weeks ago, Mr. John Bruton shared with this House his perspective as European ambassador to the United States.  We can become blinded as politicians by our work at constituency level but he was a former Taoiseach and is now able to evaluate the country from the outside, which allows him to recognise the risk that our financial capital will be exported.  People are investing in countries such as Bulgaria, Romania and Poland, or taking their money to Germany or the US.  We should be debating the reasons for this exportation of our financial capital.  We have to find solutions that incentivise the people who made money from the booming Celtic tiger to keep their capital in this country.  We can do that by offering rewards for innovation or investments into public goods such as primary schools and sewerage schemes.The threshold on stamp duty for first-time buyers must be increased on a pro rata basis because the situation varies across the country.  Fine Gael’s policy is to seek ways of abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Power, to the House, since he has already had a long evening here.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have tabled this important matter on the Adjournment to seek clarification of the current status of co-operation between Belfast and Donegal regarding facilitation of cancer patients.  I ask not as a matter of concern but for clarification, since the relationship is evolving.  I acknowledge the good work that has been done to date and the negotiating team that has set up the facility in Belfast to give people in Donegal the choice between there and Galway.I also seek clarification of the arrangements regarding the different levels of cancer treatment and who is being facilitated.  Are all patients being given the choice, or is there a select group?  As I stated, co-operation between Belfast and Donegal is evolving, but ultimately we must keep the Donegal public well informed.  I have anecdotal evidence which suggests that a patient in Donegal was not being facilitated in Belfast within the past few days, and that is what caused me sufficient alarm to table this matter.  However, it may have been the case that the proper mechanics had not been set up between Belfast and Donegal.In a general sense, I initially welcomed this co-operation, as I would any in an all-Ulster context.  However, it is most important that the people of Donegal and the north west be assured that this will not be a long-term solution.  Galway and Belfast are still peripheral to the north-west region, and it is politically very important that the pressure be maintained to ensure a satellite radiation facility is established in the north west in the medium to long term.  There is still significant demand among the people of the region for their own local services.  A critical point in that regard is that we do not want services to be provided willy-nilly all over the place for their own sake.  However, the people of the north west want a fair share of the pie and a transformation from the present situation whereby patients must spend hours travelling long distances to access basic essential services.With respect to the more local dimension to medical services in the north west, in the past few days there has been an extremely serious blockage regarding general services at Letterkenny General Hospital.  I ask that the Minister of State use his influence to expedite construction of the new wing and admissions unit there.  We will have new modular facilities in January, but we must keep a very sharp focus on the short to medium term.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and am seeking, first, clarification regarding the systems that will be employed and who will be allowed to use facilities in Belfast.  Second, it is important to recall that the Minister stated in this House that Donegal patients will be facilitated in Belfast only after priority patients from the North have been cared for.  That means that it is not a first-class, transparent system for the people of the north west.  While we welcome it and congratulate those involved in fast-tracking it as part of the negotiating team, one must remember that there is not equal access for the people of Donegal.  It is not an all-Ulster initiative or a primary accessible treatment facility for the people of Donegal.  The only way to get around this problem is by the setting up of a standalone radiation treatment centre for the north west in the long term.  We must keep a sharp focus on that objective.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is extremely important that we remain focused on the demands of the people in the north west, and not only those in Donegal.  I speak of others straddling the Border, from Tyrone down to Fermanagh and back up to Derry.  There is an urgent demand to ensure a north-west satellite radiation treatment centre.  I acknowledge that this is a move forward and accept that there has been very positive co-operation between North and South.  I also acknowledge that this is more than simply a relationship between the two Departments but something symbolically significant.The point I wish to make is simple.  Prior to the 2002 general election, a commitment was made, in writing, that a north-west satellite radiation treatment system would be put in place.  I have been asking for such a service for almost four years but have yet to see any evidence that this commitment will be fulfilled.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.  Is the Government interested in setting up a satellite radiation service in the north west?  It requires only a simple "Yes" or "No" response.
