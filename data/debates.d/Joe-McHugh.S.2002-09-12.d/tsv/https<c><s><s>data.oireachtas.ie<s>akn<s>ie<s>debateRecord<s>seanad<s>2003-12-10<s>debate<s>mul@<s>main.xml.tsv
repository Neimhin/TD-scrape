JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I refer to the new rural social scheme for 2,500 people announced in the budget. I welcome it but it does not go far enough to deal with rural development problems and there should be a debate on farming and rural development. Under the CAP reforms, farming and rural development will go hand in hand and it is important that we keep the portfolio under observation.Will the Leader consider No. 17, motion 25 on the Order Paper, on fisheries? It is another portfolio that has been relegated to the second division. The location of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in County Cavan was a heavy psychological blow to fisheries. I am not being parochial but the headquarters of the fisheries sector could have been located anywhere from Killybegs to Castletownbere. The combination of the marine sector with communications eroded the democratic voice of fishermen. There must be a debate on this because we do not want the sector to be relegated to the third division.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Fine Gael did not table any amendments to this legislation as it is a straightforward Bill. I wish to raise the question of the infrastructural needs and deficits of the west coast and west Donegal. The Irish word for infrastructure is infreastruchtúr. As a learner of Irish at beginner level, I have been told that there is a better Irish equivalent word – I believe the word is buneagraíocht. Gael Taca has been in contact with me and its mission is to avoid the use of Béarlachas in Irish and the over-use of English words. That word for infrastructure is perhaps a direct translation, but I am nit-picking.With regard to the infrastructure in west Donegal, it is very important that the island communities are given these services under the Bill. The Minister is well aware of the infrastructural and community needs. This morning on the Order of Business I welcomed the rural-social scheme the Minister is hoping to devise for farmers. The Minister has covered much ground in terms of providing funds for these projects, but I hope he keeps his eye on the ball with regard to infrastructural deficits and the road network which leads to the islands.Gael Taca has also brought the matter of signage to my attention. It wants to see the use of equal sized font for the two languages. I am aware that the Minister is an advocate of such equality. At present the Irish language version of road signs is sometimes in italic script and I suggest the same font should be used for both languages to give them equal status. I am aware that I have digressed from the subject of the Bill, but I wanted to mention those issues to the Minister. My party welcomes the Bill and it tabled amendments in the other House.
