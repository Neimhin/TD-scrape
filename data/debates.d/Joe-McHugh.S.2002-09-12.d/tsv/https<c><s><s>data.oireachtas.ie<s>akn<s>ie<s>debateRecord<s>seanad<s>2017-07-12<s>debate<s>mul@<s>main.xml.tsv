JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht a chuid focal. Táim fíorbhuíoch as an seans labhairt leis an Seanad inniu ar an ábhar seo. Tá sé thar a bheith tábachtach. I thank the Senator for raising the important matter of an Irish language Act in Northern Ireland, as provided for under the St. Andrews Agreement. The Government's firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements, including the St. Andrews Agreement, must be implemented in full. This is reflected in the programme for partnership Government. As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is unstinting in its work to achieve the full implementation of all outstanding commitments. Respect for linguistic diversity and the Irish language are central to the Agreement and, indeed, can be seen as something of a litmus test for mutual respect. The 2006 St. Andrews Agreement explicitly provides for an Irish language Act for Northern Ireland, to be enacted by the British Government. Unfortunately, to date, there has been no agreement within the Executive to take this now devolved matter forward. Successive Irish Governments have advocated in favour and the Government has continued to do so over the last number of years. In the Stormont House negotiations in late 2014, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and other Government representatives sought that the commitment to an Irish language Act be honoured and implemented. Regrettably, it was not possible at the time to reach agreement for such an explicit undertaking. Nevertheless, in the final text of the 2014 Stormont House Agreement, the Government and the British Government, recalling commitments from previous agreements, endorsed the need for respect for and recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland. At successive review meetings for the Stormont House Agreement in 2016, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade specifically raised the issue of outstanding commitments from other agreements, including that relating to the Irish language, and suggested there should be regular consideration at future review meetings to ensure that they remain on the political agenda. Most recently, in the discussions at Stormont Castle that began in March of this year to support the formation of a new Executive, the Government made consistently clear to the British Government and to all the political parties our strong support for a statutory basis for the Irish language in Northern Ireland, as envisaged under the St. Andrews Agreement. In this regard, the Government also underlined to the British Government the leadership role that both governments must play in ensuring that all provisions of previous agreements are appropriately respected and that the focus remains on achieving full implementation. The talks process at Stormont Castle concluded without agreement on 29 June. However, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has made it clear that the Government will spare no effort in fulfilling its solemn duty as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. This includes continuing to work to ensure the effective operation of all of its institutions and also the implementation of outstanding commitments, including an Irish language Act. The Government will continue to work to this end with the British Government to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to reach agreement on the formation of a new Executive. The Government wishes to see this achieved as soon as possible. Finally, I wish to note that the Government will continue to support the Irish language on an all-island basis, including through financial support for the work of Foras na Gaeilge be it in the area of the Irish language itself and also the Ulster-Scots Agency. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá cúpla focal gasta agam. Chonaic mé an athbheochan cúpla bliain ó shin nuair a chuaigh mé ar mo thuras féin. Chas mé le cuid mhór daoine ón Tuaisceart, mar shampla fear ó dheisceart Ard Mhacha ar chas mé leis i nGleann Cholm Cille. D'fhoghlaim mé cúpla focal uaidh ag an am. Bhí cuid mhór oibre déanta ar an talamh. Chonaic mé na rudaí a rinneadh sna Gaelscoileanna agus sna bunscoileanna agus rudaí maidir le cúrsaí oideachais fosta. Ba é Béal Feirste ceantar an fhir féin agus is ceantar Linda Ervine é. Bhí sé ag múineadh agus tá sé fós ag múineadh faoi láthair. Tá cuid mhór deiseanna ann. Tuigim go bhfuil deacrachtaí agus míbhuntáistí ann maidir leis na demands fadúda an teanga sa Tuaisceart faoi láthair. Aontaím le tuairimí an Seanadóra féin maidir leis na deiseanna agus na buntáistí atá ann don teanga amach anseo. I acknowledge the Senator for raising this issue. It is so important that there is enlightenment about the language in Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. People must realise that it is a gateway to our past and allows us to discover more about our traditions. As a Government, we recognise all traditions and cultures for which we have formulated policies.  In 2014, I resumed learning the Irish language and my eyes were opened to a lot more than just the language. My learning journey has changed my approach to politics and life. Learning the language has deepened and enriched my understanding of who we are as a country and as a people. The ultimate objective for us as legislators, and we can only speak on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann, is to reassure people that they should not be afraid of the language. We must convey to them that it is part of all of us, it is part of who we are and it is part of our history and heritage. We must work together, as legislators, to break down any fears that people have about the language. I understand why people fear the language, particularly in Northern Ireland. It is our job, as legislators, to break down those fears and barriers. I am glad to say that many people are thinking about learning the language. Ms Linda Ervine has done a tremendous job of teaching the Irish language in east Belfast and many people from a wide range or strata of society have availed of the opportunity.  Tá an dualgas orainn uilig. We must allay negative perceptions, fears, inhibitions and nuances exist. We must convey to people that the language is much greater. It is bigger than the current narrative about obstacles, disadvantages and fears. Anybody that I know who speaks Irish or is learning it has been enriched by the experience. Everyone in these Houses can work together and we have a duty to break down fears and inhibitions. I am happy to work with Senator Ó Donghaile. I have a lot of plans, especially in my new role in the Creative Ireland programme. Culture, heritage and the Gaeltacht are part of my Department's remit. I will examine ways to transform and develop the Irish language in this country. As we learned from the 2016 commemorative events, when people start looking back it might help us to position ourselves as we look forward.
