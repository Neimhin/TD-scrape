JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As a guest of the committee, I will try to be as civil as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Chairman. To take up Senator Blaney's point, confidence is at an all-time low in the seed potato sector. It is unfortunate that the majority of seed potatoes are imported which is difficult to comprehend in a country that was seen 20 or 25 years ago as an ambassador in Europe for the sector.The IFA is still unhappy about the charges, although the Minister has met the organisation and tried to provide some leeway. The IFA is beating itself up in this regard. On the one hand, the Minister is trying to instill confidence in the potato sector by announcing plans to introduce grant aid and other incentives for producers. On the other, she is taxing them in the first instance. This is not the correct approach for a sector for which incentives are required. It is timely that the charges should be reviewed.The Minister attended a private in-house meeting with other representatives in County Donegal last Friday at which she used a comparative analysis between charges in Northern Ireland and the South. I hope she does not object to me raising this matter. I may be taking a parochial attitude in this regard but one cannot compare the rich alluvial soils of Northern Ireland with the land of County Donegal. We cannot compare my small part of the country with that of the Minister or Deputy Blaney. I am playing the violin but it is a necessary musical instrument in dealing with this issue.I understand the Minister plans to meet again with a delegation from the IFA . I encourage her in this endeavour and ask her to listen to that organisation's concerns and arrive at a compromise. In what context and to what extent is she considering the introduction of grant measures for seed potato growers? IFA representatives do not want to hear the talk but about tangibles. Will the Minister outline what she means with regard to grant aid and incentives for seed potato growers?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister spoke about the commercial sector. Would she be prepared to offer grant aid to the small farmer with 40 acres as an incentive? There are many market ventures in small rural towns. The sad reality in rural Donegal is that all one sees growing in the fields are houses. Some farmers in the REPS scheme keep a few cows and engage in dry stock farming. There should be an incentive for small farmers to set two or three acres of spuds.
