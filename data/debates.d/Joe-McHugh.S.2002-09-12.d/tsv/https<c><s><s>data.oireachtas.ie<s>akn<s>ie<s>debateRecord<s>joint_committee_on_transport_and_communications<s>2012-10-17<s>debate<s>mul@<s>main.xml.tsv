JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  As a result of the changes in the closed school rule and the changes to the catchment boundary areas, there have been significant consequences for families and communities.  Pupils are travelling to different parishes as a result of these changes.  For example, there could be four children from one family going on one bus to a school and another child from the same family travelling on another bus to the nearer school, which might be in a different parish, as a result of these logistical changes.  I compliment Bus Éireann staff on how they have dealt with this because it has been difficult.  They have dealt with the matter in a helpful and professional manner.  In the context of the value for money report 2011, what savings, if any, have been made as a result of the changes to the closed school rule and the catchment boundaries?  I appreciate Mr. Nolan may not be able to give a specific answer on that today, but I would appreciate it if he could come back to me on that.  How many students avail of free school transport nationally?  Again, Mr. Nolan may not have that information, but I would appreciate it when he can provide it.    My next question relates to a specific route, Rathmullan to Letterkenny.  The bus leaves Rathmullan at 8 a.m. - it is a Lough Swilly Bus service - but it does not return to Rathmullan.  Has Bus Éireann looked at this particular route or does it look at weaknesses in such areas?  The local community feels quite aggrieved by the fact that the bus leaves at 8 a.m. for Letterkenny, but only returns as far as Ramelton, not Rathmullan.  I look forward to a response on this.  I appreciate being allowed participate in this committee as I am not a member of it.  Senator Mooney referred to working and collaborating with other bus transport operators, be they rural service providers or private operators.I know there is a drive in County Donegal through the Donegal transport committee to have a one-stop shop information sharing exercise. How involved is Bus Éireann in this exercise? Does Mr. Nolan value the possibility of having a one-stop website where all information is provided, not just information on Bus Éireann, but also where private and rural transport operators can publish their schedules in order that the public can go to one website and see all routes? Has Bus Éireann had an input into that? I will not be present to hear the response but I look forward to reading it. I apologise for having to leave but I must go to another meeting.
