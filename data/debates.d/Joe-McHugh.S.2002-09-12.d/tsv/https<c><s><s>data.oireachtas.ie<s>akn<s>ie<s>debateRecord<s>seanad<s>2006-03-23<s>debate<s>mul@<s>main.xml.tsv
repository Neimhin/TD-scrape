JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I received a letter yesterday evening from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. I assume every Member received the same letter.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This letter is a perfect example of reactionary politics and political spin. The Minister is reacting to a situation in such a way as to justify his own position. In doing so, he referred to one part of the country, namely, Dublin. When the Minister is drawing up these analyses, could he outline how many new gardaí are sitting behind desks and engaged in administrative work, rather than serving on the beat?There is life outside the Pale. When the Minister gets his civil servants to perform these detailed analyses to protect him and react to a situation, could he look outside the Pale and give those of us who live in the country an analysis of the increase in gardaí in places like Cork or County Donegal? When the Minister carries out an analysis of a city like Dublin, he must also take Derry city into account. Derry city is the fourth largest city on the island, although it is outside our political jurisdiction. Towns like Killea, St. Johnston and Muff border Derry city but the area does not receive one additional resource because the fourth largest city on the island is on its doorstep. The Minister should take this fact into consideration when he is engaged in reactionary politics, justifying himself and fighting to perform for the Progressive Democrats in the next general election. It is a further example of regressive, rather than progressive, party politics.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not being well looked after.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 11, line 27, after "fish" to insert the following:", but for the avoidance of doubt does not include a seafishing boat".I welcome the Minister and his official back to the House. It was timely and fortunate that I had the pleasure of meeting members of the fishing fraternity — the drift net and draft net fishermen — outside the gates following yesterday's Committee Stage debate. I am not sure the Minister met the group but I am sure Senator Kenneally went outside to meet a few of his constituents. The fishermen who protested outside the House yesterday were drawn from communities around the coast, from the southernmost part of County Cork up to Gola, Tory and Inch islands in County Donegal.The fishermen I spoke to were aware that the legislation had been before the Seanad yesterday. They appealed for more common sense to prevail in the Government's approach to the fishing industry and welcomed the Minister's statement in the House that he intended, once the legislation was enacted, to broaden the debate on the marine industry and touch base with fishing organisations on how to move it forward. While exhaustive consultation is sometimes an evil, it is clearly vital in the case of the fishing industry if we are to determine how the sector is to be advanced.The amendment seeks to avoid ambiguity by stipulating definitively that seafishing boats are not covered by the definition of the word "equipment".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 15, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:"(8) The master of an Irish sea-fishing boat may depart from the terms of any notice under subsection (7) where exceptional circumstances (such as force majeure, the safety of the crew or the safety of the vessel) so require.”.During our general discussion on a similar amendment on Committee Stage, I digressed a little to raise the grant aid available for health and safety features on vessels. The Minister responded positively, indicating that he would endeavour to expedite the matter as much as possible.On the issue of force majeure, the definitions and legislation governing the fishing sector have created some grey areas. While it is important that the master of a ship informs enforcement officers of the quantity of catch and the port at which it will be landed, provision must be made to take account of changing circumstances, for example, the necessity to change destination in inclement weather conditions. Force majeure must apply when vessels are forced to deviate from their intended course. The concept of force majeure is widely used in the Department of Agriculture and Food. This was particularly true of the allocation of single farm payments in 2002 and 2003 when stocks were at low levels.The Fine Gael Party favours strict legislation but seeks a level playing pitch for all players in the fishing industry. While it does not support special dispensations for those who break the rules, exceptional circumstances will sometimes force vessels to deviate from their specified routes. I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter, despite his refusal to do so on Committee Stage.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I understand the need to legislate for all ills. Recently, a councillor from the south suffered a wrathful response for asking that a special dispensation be granted to an old man who drove his tractor to the pub for two pints. There has to be a level playing field because legislation cannot be passed to allow some people to drink two pints, while prohibiting others from doing the same.We are at a crucial stage in terms of the future of the fishing industry. Some within the industry have flouted the law but they are a small minority. As a result of their wrongdoing, the fishermen who operate within the law are being punished.Concerns arise with regard to the watchdog system. Calls have been made by gardaí for a right of independent appeal with regard to decisions made by the Ombudsman. I hope we can devise mechanisms so that law-abiding fishermen do not suffer at the hands of an overly-zealous enforcement system. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources needs such a watchdog mechanism and, while the Minister is ultimately responsible, he does not have eyes in the back of his head. I hope he can devise mechanisms to protect the fishermen who work within the confines of the law, as well as enforcement officers.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 31, lines 43 and 44, to delete "2 months' and substitute "1 month'.We discussed the length of prison sentences on Committee Stage. We propose to reduce the sentence from two months to one month. Our concern is that there may be instances of fishermen who make mathematical errors or mistakes when filling in log books, thus stepping outside the legal framework. Although we do not condone such actions, we do not want to turn fishermen into criminals.There have been cases where fishermen have flouted the law but others do not consciously do so. It is not the same as a person who drives at 60 mph in a 30 mph zone and who knows he or she is speeding. For one reason or another, there will be instances where log books are not properly completed. We do not want to criminalise fishermen. A fisherman told me quite recently that the industry is under pressure and we are looking at a scenario where the fishing industry may go in the same direction as the farming industry. Many coastal fishermen, from the west of Ireland and Donegal in particular, have a tradition of emigrating to places such as the United States, and a criminal record will certainly not increase their chances of being let in. This was a specific example I was given. If laws are broken deliberately, the perpetrators must be punished. I am trying to replace the proposed two-month prison sentence with a one-month sentence, and to replace the €5,000 maximum fine with a maximum of €3,000.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am singing from the same hymn sheet as the Minister in terms of obeying the law. The introduction of sanctions to make people adhere to the law will protect the overall industry. I wish to raise two issues, the first being due process. There is a fear that due process will not occur in many cases. What will due process be in terms of identification of a ship that is working outside the realms of quotas or tonnage, for example? What is due process in terms of malpractice, and how will such ships and their captains be identified?A few weeks ago there was an intensive intelligence operation in County Louth. The PSNI and the Garda Síochána worked for months on a particular case, and they did not come on site until months of investigation and due process were complete. Is this similar to what will occur within the fishing industry? It is easy to identify a boat at sea, and there are sufficient surveillance measures to do this. Will enforcement officers board a boat on suspicion of illegal activities? I am considering the rights of fishermen who work within the law, and I call for the protection of these fishermen carrying out their business in a proper fashion.My second concern relates to the air of suspicion hanging over fishermen. What mechanisms are in place to protect the rights of fishermen who work within the law? We must work more on them. The Minister said there would be an exhaustive consultative process but I am trying to anticipate problems that will arise in the future and of which we should take note. These involve the protection of fishermen's rights and could take us into a whole new legal realm. The gardaí cannot enter a premises, a building or a farmyard without a search warrant so I fear the future legal implications of this provision.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 32, line 20, to delete "€5,000" and substitute "€3,000".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 34, line 5, after "and" to insert "may be subject".I will try not to deviate from the point but I am trying to provide as much information as I can in anticipation of the debate that will take place in the future. This amendment was discussed on Committee Stage yesterday and the Minister refused to accept it. However, I ask him to reconsider.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 38, line 3, after "appealable" to insert the following: "save for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law".This amendment was also discussed on Committee Stage. I refer again to the rights of the majority of fishermen who go about their daily business without breaking the law and who invest substantially in their fleets. Those fishermen have been facilitated by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources with substantial grant aid and work long, hard hours to make repayments on substantial mortgages on their boats.The debate has gone pear-shaped against a backdrop of extreme frustration in the fishing industry over the belief that it has become an industry of contradictions. On one hand substantial European grant money and national Exchequer funds have been invested in the fleet, in addition to fishermen's own investments. On the other hand quotas have been introduced and days at sea have been reduced, as has fishing effort. Some measures were necessary on grounds of sustainability but competing with other European countries for a level playing field in terms of days at sea and fishing effort causes frustration. There is not a level playing field where the rights of Irish fishermen are concerned.Our coastline is a national resource which is both a heritage and an industry and fishermen are left frustrated with this legislation over the fact that investment handouts are being made but quotas reduced and tonnage taken away. In addition to that a small minority of fishermen have been breaking the law, as acknowledged by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and the vast majority of fishermen will suffer as a consequence. The Department is between a rock and a hard place because it must legislate against criminality.I am calling for mechanisms to protect law-abiding fishermen, as I have consistently done throughout the debate. This amendment proposes the right of appeal to the High Court. The Minister said on Committee Stage that it was provided for in another section but any measure that offers protection for law-abiding fishermen should be adopted. Senator Kenneally, on first reading the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage, accused us of trying to bend the rules and looking for loopholes but that is not the case. As legislators, we are all between a rock and a hard place. Fianna Fáil backbenchers and we on this side all have problems with the legislation, even though it is an important Bill. We have all agonised over it, as it seems they have for some time in the Department. The Attorney General has even been involved. The Bill is not straightforward or easy. Neither is the matter as simple as my making outlandish statements about protecting innocent people at all costs, only to fail to introduce measures. They must be introduced but there must be balance and common sense.The Minister's proposal yesterday was the light at the end of the tunnel, that is, to engage in a healthy ongoing consultation process with the fishermen's organisations. This matter does not relate only to sea fishermen. There is a plethora of issues with respect to fishing, such as angling tourists and drift-net fishermen who have specific interests, aquaculture and salmon fishermen. The only way forward is to roll out an exhaustive consultation process with the key people in the fishing industry. Everyone in the industry has an interest in it, whether it is someone with a B&B who looks out on Mulroy Bay and sees a salmon cage or someone else. The industry has a future and it is our responsibility as legislators to represent its members who wish to continue therein.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are faced with many dilemmas in the fishing industry, the greatest of which is balancing conservation and sustainability with livelihoods. Fishermen came to Leinster House yesterday from the area in which Senator Kenneally resides, from Mizen Head, from the west coast and Gola Island, Inch Island and Urris in north Inishowen. These fishermen spoke of surviving and of their traditional way of life with which we must strike a balance. The Minister is a smart man and realises that life in the fishing industry is not black and white. I believe the fishing industry has a great future and enough people in the industry wish to strike a balance with conservation. Fishermen must take the lead through their representative organisations. Some, such as the crab fishermen in north-west Donegal, produce scientific research with Trinity College and UCG on their own initiative.I spoke to a man with triplets, three four year old sons. He told me he wishes to see them grow up to be fishermen though he does not necessarily want three Government grant-aided boats.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, but there will be girls if the sons get married.
