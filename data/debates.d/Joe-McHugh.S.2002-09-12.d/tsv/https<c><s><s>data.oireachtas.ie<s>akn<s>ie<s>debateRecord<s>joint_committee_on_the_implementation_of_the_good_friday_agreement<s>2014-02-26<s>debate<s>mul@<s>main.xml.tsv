JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Frank Feighan, Senator Mary White, Ms Naomi Long, MP, Mr. Alasdair McDonnell, MP, and Mr. Mark Durkan, MP.Members know the drill with mobile telephones. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Costello, is present to discuss the Department's view on foreign policy and external relations. The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade originally intended to be here but unfortunately he cannot attend. However, we are delighted that the Minister of State is present and his portfolio encapsulates a broad range of issues. The North-South element is of particular interest to members. The Minister of State is most welcome and we look forward to his presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State. I welcome that there will be a new strategy for funding, whether through the anti-sectarianism fund or other supports for cross-Border projects. The committee gets representations from many groups seeking funding. We welcome this review and will have an invaluable input into it. Even in assessing funding and the efficiency of funding and especially in light of much of the outreach work we are doing in Northern Ireland, there are concerns about sustainability of projects with a lifespan of two to three years after which the funding runs out and they are left hanging. It is something of which the committee is very conscious. We certainly welcome that a new mechanism for funding will be announced in 2014 and no doubt the members of the committee would like to have an input into that process. While we appreciate the Minister of State has said he will not give feedback on suggestions today, one hopes they will be taken as formal observations.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy's comments regarding immigration reform in the United States. There is a renewed focus today with a certain airline proposing that people could get to the United States for €10 in a number of years.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Gildernew covered a good deal of ground. She even strayed into south Donegal. As I am conscious that the Minister of State is facing time constraints, I ask members to be brief.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will take Senator Moran followed by Deputy Feighan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Do not be looking at Ms Gildernew.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I know the Minister of State is pressed for time.  He will have noted that brevity is alien to this committee but it reflects the enthusiasm and commitment of the members and shows their personal interest in North-South relations.  I commend all members on their ongoing personal interest in the work and their endeavours through their party structures.  The interest and enthusiasm is a reflection of the current situation in Northern Ireland which has become a changed place.  I agree there are challenges such as legacy issues.  This committee visited Derry which is a changed place.  The Minister of State will know this from his interest in Derry.  I refer to the legacy of the Fleadh Cheoil and the city of culture events which have made Derry a changed place.  It was a privilege and delight to be there as a member of this committee, to hear about the success of the events of 2013.  People were also talking about the future.  This committee wants to be part of that change but not because we want to make ourselves feel good.  Deputy Martin Ferris summed it up that people need to see the economic dividend of the peace process, not just symbolic projects such as the Narrow Water bridge and the A5 road.  We know the economic dividends which these major projects bring to that part of the island.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's reflection about the North-South Ministerial Council's change in focus and direction to look specifically at economic projects.  The north-west gateway is firmly back on the agenda.  As noted during our trip to Derry this agenda is not exclusive to one city but it will include the entire region and a widespread population.  The Minister of State is under time pressure.He will not have time to go into every observation, but his summation will undoubtedly reflect the mood of the committee. I thank him and his officials for their attendance at this meeting.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State, his officials and the members. We will take him up on the offer to have a specific session on the new funding mechanism. We appreciate that offer. I thank the Minister of State for spending more time here than that to which he was committed.
