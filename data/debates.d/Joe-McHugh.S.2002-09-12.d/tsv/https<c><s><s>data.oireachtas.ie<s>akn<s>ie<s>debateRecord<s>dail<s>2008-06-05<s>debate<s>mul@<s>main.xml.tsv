JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would like to pick out a few key phrases from the Government amendment.  "Long-term strategy" is mentioned twice.  We see references to the Energy Policy Framework 2007-2020, a strategic framework up to 2020 and the aim of achieving zero net carbon emissions by 2035, which is 27 years away.  The situation is said to be subject to ongoing examination by the Departments of Finance and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and we are told there will be no free carbon allowances after 2012.  There is not one mention of the short term or the medium term but only the long-term strategy.  There is no mention of the here and now or of the people who must pay up to €1,000 for 1,000 litres of home heating fuel.  There is no mention of how people in the haulage industry or the fishing sector are to deal with their short to medium-term needs.  It is an absolute abdication of responsibility.  It is cute-hoorism at its worst.A gentleman named Deputy Bertie Ahern, a former leader, sat in the chair where the Minister of State is sitting now.  When history is written he may be the man who is given credit for the Celtic tiger and he may smile and say he was the man who delivered the Celtic tiger, but the impending economic recession is the elephant in the room.  Not one Member on that side of the House, including the noble Green Party Members, one of whom is en route to Luxembourg, is prepared to take on that elephant.  They will blame the United States and the Middle East.  They are prepared to abdicate their responsibility in trying to tackle this issue in the Chamber.  A person once said “How do you eat an elephant?”  The answer is “One bite at a time”.  What we are trying to do on this side of the House is offer a suggestion that we decrease the VAT rate from 13.5% to 12.5%.  It will not change the economy overnight, but it is a bit-part solution to a larger problem.  The irresponsibility and recklessness of the opposite side of the House in stating that our suggestion is not even worth examining is disgraceful.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That we are unprepared to tackle the problem disgraces the people.  There is a short-term solution in respect of the fishing industry, where the price of green diesel has increased from 25 cent to 80 cent in the past three years.  The solution is to introduce the €20 million tie-up scheme, a scheme encouraged by the EU across the Union.  The Minister of State must ensure that the tie-up scheme is considered because the fishermen will have no medium term or long term if the here and now are not addressed.  This is the responsibility of the Government's side of the House.On today's "Morning Ireland", Mr. Barry Kenny, communications spokesperson for Iarnród Éireann, stated that there would never be a rail solution for the north west.  However, the Green Party has stated the opposite.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, is on record at the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources as stating that he is willing to explore and examine the possibility of rail to the north west to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.  Mr. Kenny was reading the script of Government policy.  Fianna Fáil is taking the hand of the Green Party Deputies.  They are talking the language and are thinking long term — 2012  and 2035 — but the reality of the here and now is not being addressed.We must consider practical solutions and I commend Deputy Coveney's motion.  His solution, while it would not create overnight miracles in the economy, would be a realistic start.  Last week in the House, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, had the audacity not to answer my question on the Ad Blue systems installed in new lorries by the haulage industry.  Those systems are environmentally friendly, but industry members are not being rewarded or compensated for installing them.  The haulage industry is on its knees.  The Minister of State knows of haulage contractors in County Sligo who are losing their jobs.  He also knows that only 3% of our rail services are being used to transport heavy freight with no plans to consider additionality.The people are struggling and are concerned by inflation in the cost of their food baskets, home heating oil and their mortgages.  As Deputy Naughten stated, they are also concerned about their sons and daughters getting on aeroplanes at Knock Airport and Belfast City Airport.  As there are no solutions in Ireland, people from County Donegal and elsewhere are going to London, finding a scarcity of work and considering solutions in Dubai, Australia or, illegally, America.  It is disgraceful that the Government has abdicated its responsibility to develop short-term and medium-term solutions.  Anyone who has condemned the motion in the House should ask his or her constituents whether it is right to call for a tax reduction to give back to the consumer and to decrease the cost of home heating oil.  Would the answer be "Yes" or "No"?  Since the Minister of State knows which, it is disgraceful that the Government will not even consider the possibility of discussing our practical solution.
