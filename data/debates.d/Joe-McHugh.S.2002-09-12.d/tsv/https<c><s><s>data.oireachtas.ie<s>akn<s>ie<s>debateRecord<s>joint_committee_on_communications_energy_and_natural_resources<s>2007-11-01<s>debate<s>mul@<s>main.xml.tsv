JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate the Chairman and the Vice Chairman.  The latter may be aware of the local protests being made against the pylons for the cross-Border project.  This committee has a role in ironing out issues before they cause too much public consternation.  I support the proposals to meet someone from Eirgrid and to consider the avenues available to us in terms of putting ESB cables underground.  I am familiar with this issue because it arose in County Donegal when we were prevented by public protests from bringing high-voltage power lines into Gweedore.  This committee might act as a mediator between the public and Eirgrid.
