JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Grealish mentioned the cultural centre in Boston and I had the pleasure of being there last year. There were many Connemara people there.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They were all asking for the Deputy. It is a fantastic facility as it is but it is an ambitious group and it wants to go forward. The Deputy is aware of the plans.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Last year, €2.3 million went to welfare organisations through our emigrant support programme, which was 70% of the overall programme funding that went to the United States. In San Francisco, there are ambitious plans for remodelling the centre there. We will stay in touch with our consulate and I have asked the group in Boston to stay in touch with the consulate there and ourselves to keep us informed. With regard to the funding for this year, the applications closed yesterday and there will be approximately 400 projects from 200 organisations to be evaluated. I do not know if Boston is in that group but I can find out. The Deputy can ask the group to stay in touch with us and our officials and let us know what are the specific plans. As I mentioned, the group is ambitious and has a fantastic facility. The Deputy has been there and knows about the football pitches. They have brought in different types of activities for young people and it is a great model that we should promote for other centres around the world. It is inclusive and it addresses the generational gap as many centres and communities in the United States find it difficult to get young Irish people involved. That is a great model. The Chairman mentioned the undocumented and, as I mentioned, 70% of the funding goes to welfare organisations that support the undocumented. We are looking at extra funding for that. I have been to San Francisco, New York and Boston already and have been working very closely with those organisations. At a political level, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington from late January to early February, where he met representatives from both sides of the US Senate and Congress. His meetings are a critically important part of the strategic approach that we have adopted to the issue of the undocumented Irish. Ms Anne Anderson, the Irish ambassador to the United States, held a meeting on 12 January that was attended by Senator Billy Lawless and representatives of all our consulates. The Department has adopted a strategic follow-up approach rather than a piecemeal or one-off approach. While I do not want to create an expectation for the undocumented Irish, I note that prior to the new Administration taking office there was fear about the J1 programme. Last night, however, extra J1 places were announced. The point is we have a rich American-Irish relationship that the Minister has nurtured on a weekly basis. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Today is the second time that Deputy Grealish has raised this issue. My officials are in contact with the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on this issue. In order to make more progress, I am prepared to set up a meeting where both Deputies, myself and officials from both Departments are in attendance. Ultimately, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has responsibility for the matter but I am happy to set up a meeting.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the opportunity to present the 2017 Revised Estimate for Vote 27, international co-operation, as well as to briefly outline our plans for the current year. Last May I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora and international development and I have greatly valued the work and advice of this committee in the period since. Vote 27 funds about 80% of Ireland's official development assistance, ODA, programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid. The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world. This year the Government has provided €651 million in official development assistance, an increase of €10 million on last year's allocation. The increase builds on the momentum started in 2016 in increasing budget allocations for official development assistance in a measured and sustainable way. It also represents a clear demonstration of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme. In the past year we have consistently reaffirmed our commitment to making progress towards achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of gross national product, GNP, as official development assistance. The programme for Government makes our position clear that we will make progress towards the target as resources permit. As economic recovery consolidates, we have begun to increase ODA allocations and hope to continue to deliver on this commitment into the future. Our ambition is to continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with the commitment we have made with our fellow EU member states to collectively reach the UN target of 0.7% of GNP by 2030. I recognise the challenge the target presents and look forward to engaging with the committee on our common commitment to achieving it. Over 80% of Irish Aid's funding is provided in sub-Saharan Africa where needs are greatest. The priority we attach to Africa is also a wider European one, given the increasing connections and the common pressures facing the two continents. In July I visited Uganda and in December, Kenya. I saw how Ireland's aid programme was sharply focused on helping vulnerable people in the poorest regions from Karamoja to Adjumani in northern Uganda to Samburu County in northern Kenya. I also had the privilege of visiting several inspiring projects run by Irish missionary organisations in Kenya, as well as meeting Irish missionaries who have made such a remarkable contribution to Africa and developing an empathy with it among the Irish people. I also saw how our embassies integrated their work across all areas, from building trade to political, cultural and people-to-people links between Ireland and Africa. The committee will be aware of the daunting, unprecedented scale of humanitarian need globally. Over 128 million people in 33 countries around the world are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, with 65 million displaced from their homes. The United Nations requires $22.2 billion in 2017 to reach the most vulnerable, five times the amount required a decade ago. The humanitarian crises we face are the result of natural disaster, climate change, drought, wars and conflict. The conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen will remain among the greatest drivers of prolonged humanitarian needs in 2017. I will travel to Lebanon and Jordan in the coming weeks to assess the impact and the humanitarian response. The officials in the Department will be more than happy to facilitate a visit by the committee.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes; that is why we are going there. Since 2012 Ireland has provided over €67 million in response to the Syrian crisis, including €25 million last year alone. We are monitoring closely the difficult situation across the Horn of Africa and responding. I am particularly concerned about near-famine conditions in several countries, including Somalia, South Sudan and Nigeria. I am determined that we will continue to provide support for the so-called "forgotten" crises in places such as Darfur, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic which often do not receive attention in the media. Development co-operation is at the heart of Ireland's foreign policy. Our key objective in 2017 is to continue delivering a world class programme, aimed at some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalised peoples and helping to save lives and build livelihoods. I would welcome comments and questions from committee members.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The only way we can work towards achieving the 0.7% target is collectively. I am on record already in that regard. In regard to the sustainable development goals and the 2030 plan I do not think it is good enough to say that in 14 years we will achieve the 0.7% target. If we want to hit that target we need to put in place a mechanism to do so and the only way we can do that is working collectively. Since 2011 to date, the total development package which Irish taxpayers have contributed is €4.5 billion. When I indicate that at various events, people are surprised to hear it. It is reflective of where people are at in terms of what they want to do and their contribution to the global challenges. In a survey undertaken by the UN before Christmas, Ireland was ranked ninth in the world in terms of per capita contribution.In fact, we are ahead of the United States because, while the United States signs the biggest cheque for development globally, we are ahead of them per capita. I do not, however, accept that we should be at 0.3%. We could do more but we have come through an economic period which left us faced with certain choices. In 2011, 2012 and 2013, very harsh measures were taken on respite care, people with disabilities etc. but the ODA budget stayed the same. The Irish taxpayers need to be acknowledged for that. I am happy to work with the committee on this. Deputy O'Brien asked where we were in terms of opportunities to partner with other countries. We are in consultation with fellow EU members and are looking for joined-up programming opportunities and these will happen. I acknowledge the work that David Donoghue and his team have done. They have built up their reputation for work in Kenya and Jordan over decades. Missionary work down the years also allows us to open doors. I met missionaries to Africa in Limerick at the beginning of the year and they used the word "authenticity". We have authenticity in our reputation at the moment. The Department of Finance in Kampala in Uganda asked us to get more involved in business. Many of them were educated by Irish priests and nuns and they see our honesty and integrity. It is not about using that as a platform and as an opportunity for business but it is about business connections helping in a wider sense in areas such as sustainability. I had a wonderful opportunity to meet Sr. Mary Owens in Nairobi, Kenya. She started off as a principal in my alma mater in Milford in 1966 and was three years there before going to Africa, where she has been since. She is working with young children and teenagers on a HIV programme. A laboratory has been built with financing from Irish Aid. It is a wonderful project and such investments in humanity by Irish people should never be forgotten. They have ploughed the furrow for the rest of us. A question was also asked on evaluation auditing and the money that goes to different groups. We have a very strict and accountable system for funds, which amounted to €651 million this year. There is a very good system of governance which is evolving all the time to adapt to different challenges. It is a requirement of all grant agreements that partners in receipt of Irish Aid funding, with the exception of international organisations, provide annual audited accounts. Audit coverage is close to 100%, though there may be exemptions for very small grants. The number of partners and grants, both at headquarters and in partner countries, will vary each year, as will the number of audit reports received annually. A reasonable estimate would be more than 200 reports each year. Audit requirements for international organisations, such as UN bodies, are laid down in international agreements. The Department usually receives audited financial statements from these bodies. In addition, with regard to UN bodies, the Department receives reports on internal audit activity presented to the executive boards.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to do that and there is also an invitation to the Seanad. Perhaps it could be co-ordinated.
