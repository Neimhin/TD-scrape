It is good that there is a constructive approach to mobile telephones in general, and to this area in particular.  We must be honest and acknowledge a bullying issue in respect of customers of mobile telephone operators.  For example, even at the lowest charge of between €300 and €400 per month, I have incurred costs of some €36,000 over ten years.  Including inflation, I could have bought a house with what I have paid to mobile telephone operators over that period, though that is matter for a wider debate on another occasion.The final part of Ms Kiernan's presentation was very important.  Mobile telephone operators must show leadership because, at present, schools spend a lot of time dealing with hurt on the part of teachers and students.  If a mobile telephone ban is imposed, however, would teachers have to confiscate 1,000 telephones per day?  The practicalities of the issue are significant.  Principals have a fight on their hands because, for example, www.o2online.ie facilitates free access to Bebo sites and that is proving to be a problem.  Some under 13s have their own Bebo sites, which is illegal, so there needs to be monitoring and surveillance of the problem.What is Ms Kiernan's opinion on introducing something into the school curriculum in this area of communications technology?  We who are involved in making policies must drive and design a change of curriculum to meet the needs of society.  People go to bed with their mobile telephone and use it to wake themselves up in the morning.  They text somebody last thing at night to say goodnight and it is very much a way of life.  It is very important we look at the overall design of the education curriculum.  There is an opportunity for a communications element to be included in the curriculum to look at the moral aspects of mobile telephones, computers and sites such as Bebo.
