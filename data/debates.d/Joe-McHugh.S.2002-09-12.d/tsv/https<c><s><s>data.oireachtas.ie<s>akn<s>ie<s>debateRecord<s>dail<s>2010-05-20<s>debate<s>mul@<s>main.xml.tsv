JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Approximately 70,000 applications are sitting unprocessed across the road in the Passport Office.  The public is under the impression that this problem has gone away.  It is only starting, as we approach the summer season.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Passport Act 2008 is on the Statute Book so there is no legislation but there is a problem across the road.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are not actually.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A colleague of the Tánaiste acknowledged on the radio that her office is very busy with increased representation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are two reasons for that — passports and the fact there is a Deputy missing in the area.  There are two issues at stake.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Tánaiste should personally engage with this issue because there will be a major problem come the summer.  The waiting time has gone from 15 days to 20 days at least.  Obviously the Tánaiste is happy with all the representations coming into her office.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government has not learned that past performance is a good indicator of future performance.  The Minister of State should check what has happened within the HSE, where the role of county councillors, while it was retained, was not kept at a local level.  A county councillor from Culdaff would have to travel to Galway to make representations for his constituency and was caught up in the whole debate on water pollution in Galway.  In this instance, the diabolical nature of the HSE model is being used as a bailiwick to avoid introducing county councillors to these boards.  It is important that there is local county council representation on this board.  It is an opportunity missed that should be re-examined.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	How does the Minister of State intend employing these county councillors in the structure?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I did not say that.  In terms of the structure, did the Minister of State analyse what went wrong with the HSE, where county councillors in Donegal had to attend meetings in Galway?  We should keep this at a local level.  That has not been teased out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not accept facetiousness from the Minister of State.  I am making the point that the system for county councillors on boards of the HSE does not work.  I am asking the Minister to State to ensure county councillors serve at local level and do not have to travel around the country, which could happen under this Bill.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is a facetious remark.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not attacking the Minister of State.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I need to inform the Minister of State——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Hold on a minute.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of clarification——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——I introduced——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——the point of view here that mistakes were made in the composition of the HSE board in that county councillors from Culdaff discuss issues in Galway that are not relevant to their local needs.  I am encouraging the Minister of State — not attacking him — to ensure that lessons are learned from this HSE model in which county councillors from Donegal travel to Galway and vice versa.  They should be kept at local level.  I am not speaking about the composition of the board, but about where county councillors are located and what job they have to do, and not having county councillors from Waterford travelling to Donegal.  That is all I am doing.  I am offering assistance.  I am not disagreeing with or attacking the Minister of State.  I resent the fact that the Minister of State is saying that I do not know what I am talking about.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Exactly.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am saying that there should be.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	And I agree with the Minister of State.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Lessons have been learned.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is good.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, but what if they have the skills?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I resent the Minister of State's facetiousness.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State.  I threw out the past experience as a good indicator of future performance and I appreciate him taking on board that there are lessons to be learned.  Certainly, there are people with the skills required on local authorities and they could be on the board.  I appreciate what the Minister of State has said.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I concur.  Members of the angling fraternity feel they probably need stronger representation.  With the disbanding of the Salmon Commission as part of this Bill, a serious debate is needed on the conservation of salmon stock.  The debate has been of a one-way nature and has put the whole and collective blame on drift net and draft net fishermen.  It has now been proven, even in the absence of drift and draft net fishermen.  We need to have a serious debate as to why salmon stocks are not returning and why the larger populations of seals which are being reported are not being investigated.  We need to examine what type of damage has been done to salmon stocks by seals.  We need the Marine Institute to work closely with that.We also need to take cognisance of something which I raised at the initial Stages of this Bill.  The locks agency is becoming a bureaucratic monster.  Every regulation it introduces has to go through London, Stormont and Dublin.  It is becoming a very difficult piece of work, in terms of getting commonsense practice at a local level.  We need to keep and eye on these things.  More challenges will come down the track.In Foyle, as the Minister of State is well aware, there are 18 drift net licences and 19 draft net licences.  The fishermen concerned decided not to take a voluntary buy-out and decided, because of historic and traditional interests, to keep these licences.  They are not destroying the salmon stocks compared to other possible reasons, such as pollution or the seal population.  We need a debate on what we can do to try to protect them.  We have completely banned drift and draft net fishing from our island.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have an opportunity to keep them and I bring to the Minister of State's attention the idea that we should try to protect the tradition as well as the salmon stock.
