JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy will be aware, the recent budget was framed in the expectation and fear of a no-deal Brexit. It was not a budget I wanted to be part of in terms of education. From a point of view of responsibility and the point of view of the country, there was an acceptance that we would make indicative moves on the pupil-teacher ratio. That is why we reduced the ratio in respect of schools with four teachers or fewer. We were not in a position to do anything more. The Deputy will be aware that we are spending €120 million on interventions through DEIS. This is working well. It is bridging the gap in terms of schools that were disadvantaged prior to DEIS. I want to build on this area. I am having discussions with my party colleagues on how we can build on the €120 million DEIS intervention.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy for my officials to follow up on this.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would like further details of the school situation. It is important to point out that there is a scale of prioritisation with the need for new schools, extra classrooms and special education provision. There is a big budgetary demand but I am happy to have my officials look at the application.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising the question. I am aware of the pressures in the area. I reassure the parents who may be listening that we have put specific focus on this issue through the Department in Tullamore. I know the Acting Chairman is very interested in this issue. The Deputy made a point on doing analysis as part of planning for school provision. We constantly do this. We have a team in this school planning area and it uses geographical information systems and data from a range of sources to identify from where the pressure for school places comes. The Department uses this information and offers a determination on where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. The case the Deputy has raised is with regard to post-primary places. As the Deputy is aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans to establish 42 new schools over the four-year period from 2019 to 2022, including five new primary schools and three new post-primary schools in the north County Dublin Fingal area. In addition, four new primary and seven new post-primary schools were established in recent years in the area. The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, will have regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. Sometimes it is difficult to make this calculation. Even though planning permission could be sought for 400 houses, it is not say that those 400 houses will go in immediately as they could be built on a phased basis. It is a difficult enough exercise in itself, but at the same time communication between the local authority and the Department is very important because it can provide a proper determination. In addition, the Department's capital programme provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms. Where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed, there is a fast-track process. At the beginning of this year, Ennis and Ashbourne were faced with a similar situation. The Deputy has pointed out we are at an earlier stage now and this is the time to have this conversation and debate. When I was in Skerries a couple of weeks ago, I was able to hear firsthand the stories and pressures. In the Dublin Fingal area the Department is particularly aware of the enrolment issues in Skerries for 2020. In this context, the Department is in ongoing direct contact with the patron of Skerries community college in respect of the capacity in the school. Skerries community college has expressed a willingness to increase its long-term projected enrolment to 1,000 pupils. While visiting Skerries, I was able to inform the school that the Department was working on a proposal for a devolved build of three 49 sq. m general classrooms, three 15 sq. m special education teaching rooms and offices, a science laboratory and preparatory area, an art room, toilets and circulation space. In addition, interim accommodation has been approved for Skerries community college pending the delivery of future accommodation needs. The patron of Skerries community college is tendering for the approved interim accommodation, and it is expected to have all interim accommodation in place for September 2020. While I understand the enrolment situation may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice, the Department's main responsibility is to ensure the existing schools in the area can, between them, cater for the demand for school places in September 2020. It is a matter for the board of management as to which selection criteria are included in enrolment policy and in what priority the criteria are applied. The selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. Schools in the Fingal area can apply for additional accommodation under the Department's additional accommodation scheme if they believe there is a shortfall in their current accommodation. Applications will be assessed by the Department, and if it is found that additional accommodation is required, funding will be provided for a devolved build to the school. I assure the Deputy and the Acting Chairman that our officials are examining the area and there is engagement with regard to finding solutions. At all times when interim temporary applications are submitted, we are open to prioritising those applications.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will continue to give it the focus it needs. It is about ensuring that once we have the information and once we know there are demand issues, we get in early. Engagement from the principals is critical here, and without singling any of those schools in the areas the Deputy mentioned out, I have met the majority of the principals. The Deputy is correct in saying I was in Portmarnock community school but it was not in recent weeks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In St. Joseph's secondary school in Rush, I was able to hear firsthand about the pressures and the frustrations with the processes involved in acquiring sites. There are external factors outside of the Department's control. One matter we are committed to as a Department is that where there is extra demand, we try to provide solutions. We have to work towards the long-term and we will put those measures in place, but there are short-term needs now. We are focused on September 2020. We will continue the dialogue with the principals to ensure whatever short-term temporary provision we can bring in fits the needs. I understand some sites, such as St. Joseph's secondary school in Rush, will not have adequate space for additional accommodation, but we have to look at other ways of satisfying that demand. I emphasise again that a lot of the demand can be skewed in some instances. I am not using the example of this area, but in a different area in a different part of the country it was a school of choice and it was skewed because everybody wanted to go to this school. When it was pared back, it became clear that when the duplication of applications was taken away, there were still school places available. I know this is acutely sensitive in terms of the demographics, the increased population and further housing developments. I will keep this on the radar and no doubt the Deputies will keep me on my toes as well.
