JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire, Teachta Coveney, agus roimh a chuid oifigeach go dtí an cruinniú inniu. Táimid ag dúil go mór leis. Mar atá a fhios againn, táimid ag pointe tábhachtach maidir leis an mBreatimeacht agus an comhrá atá de dhíth thar na laethanta agus na seachtainí atá romhainn. Before we begin, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on the Minister to make his opening statement. He is welcome.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes. I think we will have enough questions here to keep the information flowing. I propose that we take three members at a time. Three members have indicated. Deputies Ó Murchú and Richmond, and Senator Chambers. I will take members in that order. I ask members to keep their questions, as many as they want, sharp and concise because we want to get as much information as possible. I thank the Minister and I call Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is great. I understand the need for the preamble before answering the questions. I have another batch of members offering - Deputies Haughey and Howlin, and Senator McDowell. I ask those who do not have microphones who want to speak to indicate and they can organise a swap between themselves and their respective colleagues, if that is okay. I was interested in hearing the Minister's line that he has not been around forever. I think God used that line one time as well.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. I call on Senator McDowell.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister. A final round of members is offering to speak. Deputies Marian Harkin and John Brady have offered.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will need ten or 15 minutes for business in private session, so we are very tight for time. I know the Deputy will indulge me by trying to be as specific and concise as possible. I will call Deputies Harkin and Brady and Senator Chambers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Minister to wrap up. The committee will then go into private session for a few minutes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I do not have time to wrap up but I thank the Minister, Mr. Gardner, and all the officials for all their work.
