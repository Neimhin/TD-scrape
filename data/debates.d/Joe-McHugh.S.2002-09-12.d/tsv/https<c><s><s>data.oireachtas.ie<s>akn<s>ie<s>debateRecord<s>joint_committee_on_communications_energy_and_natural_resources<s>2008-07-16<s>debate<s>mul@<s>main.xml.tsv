JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being late. I welcome the delegates.  I congratulate them on their ongoing work, which has given us something to consider in terms of best practice in building critical mass in information technology.  This area is a broad spectrum.I will be specific.  My first question is similar to Deputy Coonan's because we all seek to look after our own patches.  The idea of a digital hub between Letterkenny and Derry city has been spoken of and a cross-Border group is working in this area, I particularly refer to the Eirnet group.  We have the ideal physical and educational infrastructure; there is Magee College in Derry, Letterkenny Institute of Technology and I should not leave Sligo out.  There is a sort of triangle with regard to the possibility of building something like this.  Are there legislative proposals that could be considered at a national level to entice or encourage SMEs to enter into a project such as this or encourage people to set up their own SMEs?We are all trying to get the economy going again and to drive our export market.  We have been very weak in this area in the past five to six years.  Are there legislative changes we could introduce which would allow people to invest?  We all believe that the banks are not giving money and that people do not have money, but the reality is that there are still people out there with money who are not going to go into the stock market or into property and who are afraid to put their money into certain areas.  Are there legislative proposals we could consider which would encourage people with money - not just in Ireland, as we have a widely distributed diaspora - to invest in such projects?  They would obtain a minimal return on their investment, because there would be an ideological aspect to investing back in Ireland.  People are holding on to their money and are looking for avenues for investment.
