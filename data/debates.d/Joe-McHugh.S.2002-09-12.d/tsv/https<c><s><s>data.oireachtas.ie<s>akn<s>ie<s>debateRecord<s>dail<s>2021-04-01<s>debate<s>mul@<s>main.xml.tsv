I refer, in this regard, to Google, Facebook, LinkedIn and many other companies based in Dublin. We do not just want them to get workers to live in their houses, we want them come to remote places such as Carndonagh, Gweedore, Carrigart, Letterkenny, Finn Valley, Donegal town, Kilcar, Buncrana, Milford, Ramelton and Falcarragh.
