JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome my fellow Donegal men. I thank Mr. Tony McLaughlin, Mr. John McLaughlin and Mr. Andrew Ward for their presentation so far. We may hear from the other gentleman a little later. To give a bit of a background on the matter of Inishowen, my involvement indicates there is no more resilient a breed of people in this country. Perhaps much of this is a result of Inishowen's proximity to the North during the Troubles combined with its good entrepreneurial system, be it due to isolation, peripheral location or whatever.I like the presentation's outward focus on the marine sector, be it at angling level or tapping into the resources that are available. I have spoken to Mr. Tony McLaughlin previously. To use a success story, though it is outside the ambit of the marine, the Isle of Doagh farm is an example of an industry that survived and grew without any real State support. It is a tourist project that works well in the summer peak season and has developed a product for the winter "off" season due to the industriousness of the proprietor, Mr. Pat Doherty.The road the delegation is going down as a Leader group is the right road. As Mr. Ward mentioned, it is important to avoid getting bogged down in bureaucratic centralisation. Groups such as his must facilitate and encourage local indigenous investment in an entrepreneurial way. Any support a company can be given should be given. I certainly do not need to tell these gentlemen about the recent history of transition from a manufacturing sector, as everyone knows about it. Hopefully, we will move on and the IT, organic and tourism sectors will fill this void. The resilience, location and history of Inishowen will stand it in a good stead. At the same time, Government focus should be "zoned in" on whatever ideas are coming up from ground level. The only groups and representative bodies that will provide these ideas are those such as this delegation.Mr. Ward mentioned there is a Donegal marina strategy through the Deloitte & Touche report. As far as I am concerned, we have moved on since this report and we should be examining the issue of marinas in terms of a cross-Border and national focus. There is a marina in Kilrush, County Clare. The closest one in our county is Fahan. I am of the opinion we need a necklace of marinas. Many people talk about that and I am in favour of having an all-Ireland strategy on marinas, which we do not yet have. There are worthy locations within the county. Priority cases were involved in the Deloitte & Touche report. The local expertise of Inishowen Tourism Society Limited is needed to input into a national and cross-Border strategy. I am keen to be involved in that process. The members of the delegation are here today to sell their wares and to identify what should happen in the future. Can they expand on the type of Government or financial support they seek?
