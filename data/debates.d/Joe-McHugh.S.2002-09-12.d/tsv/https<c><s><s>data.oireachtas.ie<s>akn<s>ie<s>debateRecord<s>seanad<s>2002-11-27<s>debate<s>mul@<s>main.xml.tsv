JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Community, Gaeltacht and Rural Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to attend the House for a debate on the Downings Harbour development project? Urgent confirmation of the project is required. A community led development group in Downings was given a commitment of €631,000 by the former Minister, Deputy McDaid, on behalf of the previous Government.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Confirmation is needed because the money earmarked for the project has been withdrawn. This constitutes a serious breach of faith by the last Government, which is the same as the current Government.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Not one cent has been made available for Downings Harbour. Since the situation is serious the Leader should confirm whether the money has been withdrawn.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While this may seem a parochial issue, it is relevant to other parts of the country. A few weeks ago students in Ramelton, County Donegal, protested at bus overcrowding. They considered that a basic human right had been removed from them. Their protest involved them walking in the rain from Ramelton to and from two schools in Milford. In this instance students decided that their educational entitlements were not respected and they decided to protest. There are few avenues open to them to have their concerns addressed in County Donegal and as they considered they were getting nowhere, they decided to protest.While this may be a parochial issue, it impacts on the rest of the country. It can often arise that an extra 20 or 30 students may need to use the school bus service. This has insurance and safety implications. While I am disappointed the Minister for Transport is not present, I have no doubt the Minister of State will be a competent replacement.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response. We are aware that there is a three person per two seat ratio but perhaps we can review the whole issue because we are talking about young adults of 17, 18 and 19 years of age. On this particular bus there is an average of ten to 15 students standing because two people on the seat will not move to make room for a third person. Perhaps this can be the start of the review process. I thank the Minister of State again for his reply.
