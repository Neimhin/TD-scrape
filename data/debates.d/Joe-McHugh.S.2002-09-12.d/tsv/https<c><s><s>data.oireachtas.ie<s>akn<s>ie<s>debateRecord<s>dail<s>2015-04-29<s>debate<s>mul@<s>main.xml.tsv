JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Part of the previous speakers' contribution with which I agree is that we have an opportunity not only to look at the economic snapshot presented by the statement but to have a debate prior to the next budget. There is an onus on all of us, be it on the Government or the Opposition benches to collectively examine better ways to do things and better ways to live up to our democratic responsibilities and our duties in this House because nobody in this generation, and Deputy Calleary is a good bit younger than me, will ever forget the last number of years. It has left a deep scar on the psyche of many people. A large number of people are disaffected. The mix within the black and white, opinion poll-type politics, in which we as politicians sometimes get caught up with regard to what will be the composition of the next Government does not register with the disaffected. Many people are disaffected, be it about the past, the mistakes of Government, or an irresponsible Opposition that has come up with the idea that money grows on trees and that there are quick-fix solutions to a deeply complex situation in the years that we have come through. We have to reach out to the disaffected, the people who are making the decision not to vote in the next generation. That trend is reflected across the European Union. Addressing that is not only a responsibility for this House but a responsibility of the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council to the citizens of the European Union. This economic snapshot had to be laid out and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan talked about the long term with respect to 2018 and looking towards full employment and to 2020 and beyond. The Spring Economic Statement looks not only beyond the next election but beyond the election after that. That is the space into which we must put ourselves as responsible legislators. We must be honest with the public about the fact that things have been complex and difficult. There has been deep heartache across the State, be it in regard to emigration, people losing their jobs or homes or people being deeply disillusioned, to whom we must reach out. Within that mix there are many positive stories. I visited a company that represents a positive story this morning. It is a small company that uses a very clever technique for alarms and it is going to operate through the medium of Irish. That company is in a positive place. We have positive stories and very talented and highly skilled, digitally-minded, media-graphic focused people. I was in the Ring Gaeltacht last week and met young skilled people in a company that employs up to 50 people in the digital media sector. They are all fluent Irish speakers, all from that Gaeltacht and they are all staying in that community. It is a challenge.  One of the challenges set out in the spring statement is how do we work towards a regional recovery. The reality is that while the recovery is sporadic it has not reached the regions. If I were to speak to the companies with which I consult and engage to see if they are interested in decentralising or taking even part of their business to the regions, they would tell me that two big factors militating against that are energy security and broadband. That is why the Government has taken seriously the issue of broadband. My colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Alex White, has responsibility for the national broadband plan. He is keeping all Members informed on a monthly basis of the progress to date. The Department will go to tender towards the end of the this year to ensure a bidder or bidders will undertake the roll-out of the national broadband plan that will bring connectivity to areas where companies will not locate. While that is happening, it must be acknowledged that there is private sector responsibility. Private sector companies are stepping up to the plate in rolling out different types of partnership models, as in the case of Letterkenny where there will be a collaboration between Vodafone and ESB, but we must acknowledge that we must have a regional spread of provision to instill confidence for the people living in more rural areas in order that we can attract investment. Broadband is part of that critical mix. This snapshot in time has given us as legislators an opportunity to reflect on the last four years. I was reflecting on the canvass trail for the 2011 general election in my county. The biggest response I got at the doors was that we would have to clean up the mess if we were to go into government. As an Opposition politician, I did not fully understand the scale of what was ahead of me. I recall one man asked me if I had any idea of what was ahead of me. I probably said that I did but I did not fully understand the human impact of what was happening when people were going to be under severe pressure and we were dealing with the emotional response in a crisis that was causing chaos. It was very difficult. During that time hard decisions were taken. We are entering a period now where there is growth and an opportunity to build on getting unemployment down to hopefully single digit territory by November of this year. We have an opportunity to build on that and there is a role for Opposition politics to do that. I said last night that there was a different tone to the Private Members' motion tabled by the Technical Group. I have not come across it in the past four years but I commend it for its interventions. That is important if we are to instill confidence in the democratic process that has been badly affected and damaged. There is an issue of confidence and at times when there is probably tit-for-tat politics in this House people switch off. However, we have to rise to that challenge of ensuring that we are properly representing the people of this country. The Minister for Finance also pointed out that the era of "if I have the money, I will spend it" is over. It reminds me of the Irish version of that in my parish of Na Dúnaibh where the conversation is predominantly in the modh coinníollach. Dá mbeadh an t-airgead agam, chaithfinn é. I would spend the money if I had it. However, the citizens of this State realise that prudence is essential and that there must be responsibility, but account must be taken of broader issues, including the needs of people with disabilities and the most vulnerable. It is not that people on the Government benches are not aware of this. We have to work in collaboration with all the representative groups and we have to put up our hands and say where we have made mistakes, but at the same time we have to drive forward an agenda for the next generation. It is the next generation for whom we are working.Obviously the wounds inflicted on this generation will not be forgotten. People will never forget the effects of the reckless and irresponsible behaviour of some prior to the crisis of 2008 but we must learn from our mistakes and work towards the creation of a better society. Part of that better society is the need to work on the social and cultural agendas and the commemoration of the 1916 Rising will have an important role in that regard. Primary and secondary school students and those involved in the arts and creative sectors will be able to rise to the wonderful challenge of commemorating the past and also working towards a new vision of the new Ireland that we all want to live in. That challenge will be met by many people across the length and breadth of the country.
