JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation members and Mr. P.J. Bradley, MLA, and Councillor Tim Atwood from Northern Ireland.  Their presence is a sign that Northern Ireland and the Republic are intrinsically linked when it comes to providing broadcasting services.Are places which have poor coverage included in the 98.5% coverage figure?  The representatives can revert to me with answers because, as a parliamentarian, I find it disadvantageous to put down parliamentary questions only to be told they are not relevant to the Minister concerned.  Places like Gortfad, Clonmany, Milford, Derryhasen and Downings have very poor signals.  In respect of the remaining 1.5%, what assurances will these people get?  I refer in particular to places like Meenletterbale in north-east Inishowen, which not only lacks RTE but does not even have broadband or mobile telephone coverage.  What assurances can we give these communities that digital terrestrial television will be the solution to their needs?  We often discuss next-generation technology but these are places where people do not have access to RTE.  I would be involved in next-generation communications technology.  There are examples within our country and society where people do not have access to RTE, so what assurances will be given to such people?  Will they be encapsulated in this new service provision, which they ultimately should be as within the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act 2007?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that but I was using that as an example of those who are disadvantaged and would find it ironic that we are even having this debate.  They have no access to technology whatever.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would be delighted to make contact with the network people because these communities have been fighting this battle for a long number of years.
