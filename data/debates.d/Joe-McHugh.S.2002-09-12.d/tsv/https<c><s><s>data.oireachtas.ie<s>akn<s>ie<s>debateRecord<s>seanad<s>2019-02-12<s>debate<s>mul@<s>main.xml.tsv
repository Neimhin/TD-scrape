I welcome the opportunity to provide an update on the status of broadband services in schools. The delivery of high quality Internet connectivity for all schools is a key objective of my Department. It is accepted that good connectivity is essential to ensure that schools can progress the embedding of digital technologies in teaching and learning and facilitate the implementation of new and revised curriculums. An interdepartmental group involving my Department and officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is working to determine how best to address high-speed broadband connectivity to all primary schools. This group will take account of developments in the Government's national broadband plan and its associated intervention strategy, which targets areas for the State intervention element of the national broadband plan. Broadband capacity can vary due to geographical location and local available infrastructure, which can impact on the level of service that can be provided. The policy of my Department is to offer the best quality connectivity to all schools in line with the technical solutions available in the school location. In terms of the broadband services in the school referred to by the Senator, it should be noted that the school is located in the national broadband plan intervention area and services in this area are targeted under the national broadband plan. This school currently has a service which provides broadband speeds of up to 3 Mbps on a DSL line.In an effort to improve services to the school, it was recently the subject of a broadband mini-competition organised by the Department. The provision of service to the school has been awarded to a wireless service provider, which will deliver upgraded speeds of 17 Mbps. The provider is currently working with the school to arrange installation and to deliver this improved service to the school. To assist children with particular educational needs, the Department operates a scheme of grants towards the purpose of essential assistive technology. Equipment under the scheme is provided for children with more complex disabilities who, in order to access the school curriculum, require essential specialist equipment. Funding was provided under this scheme to the school in the case referred to by the Senator. It should be noted that the equipment provided does not require an ongoing broadband connection to facilitate access to the curriculum. If the school has concerns or needs advice, it may consult the visiting teacher service of the NCSE, which will be able to assist. Under the current schools broadband programme, the Department's practice is to review constantly the availability of broadband with the aim of improving services to all primary schools as broadband connectivity improves throughout the country.

With regard to whatever information is available to me, I will certainly ensure the Senator will be able to connect with the school and, hopefully, with the contractor who has won the tender for the wireless option. Wireless has been a solution for rural Ireland for many years. It is not the preferred solution if one is trying to get up to 1,000 Mbps. A similar scheme has been announced by SIRO in the larger towns. Ennis in County Clare might have been covered by that. There are other options through Eir and through copper connectivity. The focus in the short to medium term - not the medium to long term - has to be on the national broadband plan. The schools that are not getting broadband at the moment will be covered by that. It is important. I appreciate the Senator's decision to raise this matter. It is about equality of access. People cannot be discriminated against just because of geography. That is the reason I wanted to come to the House. If there is anything the officials in the Department of Education and Skills can do to expedite this, I will be happy to ensure it is done. Gabhaim buíochas arís leis an Seanadóir fá choinne an cheist seo a ardú. Beidh mé sásta na sonraí ó mo chuid oifigigh a chur in iúl don Seanadóir. Beidh mé i dteagmháil leis.
