JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to raise an issue under the proposed customs Bill, No. 31 in the legislative programme.  This morning in Burnfoot, County Donegal, 11 customs officers — that is an anecdotal figure — were stopping cars at checkpoints, as they have been doing for the last couple of mornings.  They are carrying out their business but obviously interfering with business and law abiding citizens.  One gentleman was stopped this morning and fined €400 on the spot.  They brought him to a cash machine but he did not have €400 in the account.  His 18 month old child was with him in the car and he had to wait until his parents arrived.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have a question on the legislation.  The man has been given seven days to re-register the car and if he does not do so within seven days, he will lose his child benefit.  How can he re-register that car when the waiting list for re-registering cars in Letterkenny national car test centre is 21 days?  That was in the reply to a parliamentary question I asked yesterday.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is an absolute nightmare.  The customs Bill proposes to consolidate and modernise national legislation relating to the administration of customs.  It is outdated, outmoded and a callous way of collecting taxes.  We need to start using a little common sense when dealing with members of the public and the business community.
