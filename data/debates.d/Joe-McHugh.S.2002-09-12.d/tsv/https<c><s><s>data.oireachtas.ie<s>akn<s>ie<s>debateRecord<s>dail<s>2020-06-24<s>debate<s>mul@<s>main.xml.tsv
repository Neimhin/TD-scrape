JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Chathaoirleach agus leis na Teachtaí uilig as an seans labhairt leo arís inniu ar chúrsaí oideachais agus na dúshláin atá ann ina leith. I take this opportunity to provide an update on the planned summer provision and the preparatory work towards reopening our schools. When I was last in the House I advised that I would bring a report on both subjects to Cabinet on 12 June. I will now update Deputies on the position since I brought that report to Cabinet.  I have previously stated that it was a priority to have summer provision this year. Since my last appearance in this Chamber, I have launched Summer Provision 2020 - Reconnecting with Education, which comprises a number of summer programmes focusing on children with special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage. Since the launch last Friday week, we have had a very strong response. Two hundred schools have registered to run the school-based summer education programme and 36 schools, 35 of which will also run the school-based programme, have registered to participate in the HSE-led programme of support for children with complex needs. It is estimated that 3,400 children will benefit from this school-based programme. Almost 9,200 children are registered for the home-based programme.  On the DEIS summer programme, 210 primary schools have expressed an interest in participating, which is an increase on the 72 schools which were already signed up for summer camps. At post-primary level, 14 schools have registered, with a number of others considering participating in this new programme. In addition, over 230 SNAs are working with families as part of their temporary assignment to the HSE. This level of response is welcome. It is a real demonstration of the commitment of local schools to their local communities. The willingness of principals, teachers and SNAs to answer the call to support their students following what has been an unprecedented period of uncertainty for these students and their families is fantastic. I am sure Deputies will have examples from within their own constituencies of schools rising to this challenge. I note the leadership at Scoil Íosagáin in Buncrana where 70% of the students are signed up to the programme and where there is a maximum return of SNAs and teachers bar one because of health considerations. There is also a willingness on the part of teachers within that school but outside of special educational needs who want to participate to help reconnect the students. The Government gave the go ahead for the summer provision last Friday week. Since the announcement was made, my Department has had positive engagement with colleagues in the health sector and with the education partners to develop the guidance. Today, I am announcing that further guidance for primary schools involved in delivering summer provision 2020 will be published tomorrow. This follows guidance to primary schools published yesterday on issues such as planning and preparing on returning to school, advice on preventing the spread of the virus, control measures, and dealing with a suspected case. The detailed guidance will support schools in planning and preparing for the programme to support students with disabilities and students attending DEIS summer camps. Many schools had initially sought guidance from my Department before confirming their participation in the schemes. I can confirm that a template for a school Covid-19 response plan has been developed for use by schools in preparing for running the summer programme. This was provided to schools earlier this week. The template can be adapted by schools as their own Covid-19 response plan in the context of reopening for summer provision. The school Covid-19 response plan contains useful information on issues, including planning and preparing for return to school, general advice to prevent the spread of the virus, including handwashing, respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, control measures, including cleaning and use of personal protective equipment, and what to do in respect of a suspected case of Covid-19. The Covid-19 response plan details the policies and practices necessary for a school to meet the Government's return to work safely protocol, the Department of Education and Skills plan for schools reopening and measures to prevent Covid-19 in the school environment. A helpline has been put in place to assist families of children with special educational needs, provide information on the programmes and help guide them to useful supports. As Deputies are aware, it is my strong preference, the Government's intention and my Department's focus, as well as that of stakeholders with whom we are engaging, to see a full return to school in late August-early September in line with individual schools' usual timetable. I know of schools that have already communicated to parents and students the date of return after the summer holidays, albeit noting that this will be subject to appropriate arrangements and guidelines which are currently being worked on. It is worth reiterating that we are between nine and ten weeks from the scheduled reopening of schools. This gives us time to continue to consult the public health experts to develop and plan appropriate guidance. It is my ambition, and that of my officials, to work with the education partners to minimise the work involved at an individual school level. Where we can, we will provide centralised support and guidance to schools to enable them to reopen in a safe manner in the new school term.  As a country, we have made real progress in getting the virus under control. We have learned and taken the precautions necessary to protect ourselves, our families, our colleagues and everyone in society. The knowledge about and understanding of the virus is growing all of the time and experience available from each phase of the roadmap as well as what is happening in other countries will help us to get it right for reopening our schools. The report I brought to Cabinet on 12 June outlines the ambition of the Department to develop a sustainable plan to reopen schools, the overriding objective of which is to protect the health of staff and students while promoting the educational and development needs of the nation's children. The key activities under way include public health advice, which will inform the guidance to be issued tomorrow to support schools that will operate summer provision, and interim public health advice, which will be kept under review to ensure it is informed by the latest evidence on Covid in advance of the reopening of the schools at the end of August. In addition, guidance and templates to enable schools to comply with the requirements of the national return to work safely protocol are being developed centrally in consultation with education partners. There are regular meetings of the primary and post-primary stakeholders to ensure stakeholder views can inform the guidance documents. Meetings are taking place on this every week. There will be further engagement tomorrow with stakeholders. Guidance on online training modules, webinars, etc., are being developed centrally and will be available for use by schools, parents and students. Resources for return to school will be made available for schools operating a summer programme. Additional resources will be provided to schools to enable enhanced cleaning. The existing handwashing facilities in some schools are not designed for the enhanced level of handwashing envisaged as necessary in the Covid-19 environment without significantly impacting on educational class time. A drawdown framework will be established by the Department to enable schools to purchase hand sanitisers for use in schools and classrooms. The procurement process for this framework is under way and it will also deal with any other potential PPE requirements. It is not envisaged that significant PPE will be required in school settings. Details on funding will be provided in due course. Principals who used their initiative and purchased equipment in the last couple of weeks will be reimbursed in that regard. There will be a strong focus on supporting the mental health and well-being of students and staff in the reopening of schools. Central guidance will be provided. The Department is working with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, the inspectorate and other experts to tailor teaching and learning appropriately to the needs of students as they re-engage with school.Notwithstanding our overall objective, planning for a blended learning approach online and in school will be a feature of our plan to reopen schools, as there may be circumstances where schools will have to have the necessary agility to respond quickly to changed circumstances at local or regional level. My Department continues to engage closely with education partners and other key stakeholders on the development of guidance and supports for the reopening of schools. A dedicated web page will be provided to enable the sharing of information and updates in an open and transparent manner. Physical distancing requirements are a function of public health advice intended to reduce the risk of infection at particular times and current guidelines are being kept under review. We have seen the roadmap to reopening society reviewed and in some cases accelerated as that public health advice has evolved. Consideration of other mitigating factors in a school setting and emerging evidence of low infection transmission by children may also mitigate some of the risks considered as part of broader public health advice. We also have to be cognisant that maintaining physical distancing in all situations is not possible or appropriate. In particular, it may not be practical for children who are quite young or have special educational needs. In these situations we need to ensure there are appropriate measures in place to protect children and school staff. In relation to summer provision, there will not be a requirement for strict social distancing for children with special educational needs as this would be neither practical nor possible. Given the limited number of students attending camps in DEIS schools as part of summer provision in 2020, the requirement for physical distancing should be maintained but this should have no impact on the running of the programme in schools. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his contribution. One of the obvious gaps was in relation to special needs, so there was regression. That is anecdotal and measured through contact and interaction between our inspectorate and schools in terms of where the gaps were. One clear message right across the sector, whether tertiary, post-primary or primary, is that computers cannot replace teachers. Computers and digital technology can enable processes but they will never replace teachers. One of the big gaps identified is to ensure that we get back into the classroom. I take the Deputy's point as to whether there is a need for research into this. Not to talk about programmes for Government today, but I know there was a lot of focus in the talks on having a research focus within the Department and there will be plenty of time in the future to do research on this important matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is a very good question and I thank the Deputy for raising it. One thing that we did not have on our side, and I will probably be accused of not getting guidelines in quickly enough, was that schools were allowed to open as recently as last Friday week. We have been working on this for two weeks. We are working continually on the school transport issue with a focus on August and September. The solution that we have come up with for the interim is that we will give a grant to parents. I acknowledge that will not be a solution for every parent. The Deputy mentioned children with severe and potentially profound intellectual disabilities, who normally have an escort on the bus. It was a challenge to come up with a potential solution in such a short time but we are giving a grant directly to parents to use in whatever way is possible for them. We are monitoring this as well.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his questions. I am sorry that I will not get to the other pertinent questions from the other Deputies but I will try to answer these three as quickly as possible. In a normal year, 650 schools are eligible for July provision, including up to 126 special schools, as well as schools with special educational needs, SEN, based tuition. It was always 650 schools. Last year more than 200 schools applied and this year 200 did. I am absolutely delighted with the level of response and positivity coming from the sector in a very challenging year. The Deputy asked about eligible students. Any student with autism, Down's syndrome, severe, profound or moderate intellectual disabilities will qualify for the July provision. The Deputy also asked about the HSE redeployment. Some 230 SNAs have signed up to the redeployment schemes. They are working under HSE contracts at the moment and I thank each and every one of them for doing so because they are doing really important work. As regards schools reopening, we are all working to get them reopened. I am well aware of Holy Family national school. As the Deputy knows, there were local factors involved in the time delays and he knows what the issues are at local level. However, we have been working through them and we hope we are in a position to open that school in time for the new cohort of students.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	My ambition is clear as I want to facilitate as many children with special needs as possible in summer provision. Traditionally, 70% of students go for home-based tuition and I cited 24,000 as the maximum number that could apply. Currently, we have nearly 10,000 and another 2,300 have been signed up to the Health Service Executive programme. I am still confident that more could sign up as the days go on. Let us be very clear. The Deputy stood up in this House and said only four or five schools would sign up. That type of messaging coming from this House does not help.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Approximately 200 schools have registered for this and I thank every one of those schools for the work done. It is correct that they need the proper information and the guidelines must be right with respect to student and teacher safety. Last year, a grant was awarded directly to people with Down's syndrome for primary and post-primary education. This year, we have included primary education in the summer programme and we are engaging with Down Syndrome Ireland to ensure every post-primary student with Down's syndrome is facilitated as well. That is really important. As the Deputy knows, most of the summer provision is at a primary level. The Deputy indicated he was confused about my statement last week on schools reopening. I said last week that my clear intention and the goal both of the Government and the entire education sector was to have a full reopening of all schools for all children at the end of August and into September. There was no ambiguity there.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will deal with the last point first in respect of SNAs. I wish to publicly thank the SNAs for their ongoing work over the past months since 12 March. Somebody who spoke earlier was correct in saying that the school buildings may have closed but, like that of the teachers, the work continued. One of the additional features of the summer provision this year compared with July provision is that parents of children with Down's syndrome, autism or severe and profound intellectual disabilities and moderate intellectual disabilities have the choice of availing of an SNA or a teacher as that tutor for the home-based provision. Currently, almost 10,000 are registered. We are relying, first, on the choice of parents to opt for either an SNA or a teacher but, second, we also are operating under a voluntary structure. However, I am confident from the level of enthusiasm and ongoing dedication at a school to student level that we will be in a good place in that regard. With regard to the reconnection point, teachers get the gaps in that regard. They understand the regression aspect in regard to children with special educational needs. It is about reconnecting with the schools. Another Deputy raised the issue of preschool. That is the reason I added the early intervention year as a feature of summer provision, in terms of that transition. Deputy Michael Moynihan raised the issue of transition from sixth class for children with special educational needs. If there are specific examples around that, I am happy to address that. I will send a formal reply to the Deputy on her other question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will rattle through those questions. Deputy Dillon raised the issue of the fifth year post-primary students. It has been raised a number of times in this House and it is something I am conscious of in terms of their own loss. It was not just about the leaving certificate students of 2020; it was the leaving certificate group of 2021. In terms of what we are doing in that instance and what is ongoing, discussions are taking place between the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and Department of Education and Skills officials in regard to the curriculum and trying to meet the needs of that particular group because not alone did they lose out on class time, they were also disadvantaged even in terms of preparing for practical work and getting important work like that over the line. We are taking that into consideration but there will be a conclusion to those deliberations and I will keep the House informed on that. The Deputy spoke about prospective student teachers and making sure they have information in time. That will be critical and I will ensure that will happen. He also spoke about the island communities and ensuring that we have provision in respect of the issue he raised. Deputy Higgins spoke about the profound and complex needs of a constituent.Unfortunately for some parents, a school will not be available for one reason or another. In some instances, schools have never opened for July provision, and doing so this year would be a big departure. I assure the Deputy and the parents of children with severe or profound complex disabilities that we will try our best to facilitate them. If the Deputy could send on the details of the individual in question, I will ask my officials to look into the case.  Deputy Feighan keeps raising the issue of Carrick-on-Shannon. I cannot give the House an update today but I will be happy to ask my officials, one of whom is sitting to my right, to follow up on that issue and contact the Deputy and the school directly. Deputy O'Donnell mentioned St. Gabriel's school. He has raised it with my team several times now. The school's management is looking for clarity and public health guidelines to protect students as we open summer provision. Schools will be provided with an update on guidelines. I am confident that when the final public health guidelines on social distancing are published following a meeting with stakeholders tomorrow morning we will be in a position to facilitate the likes of St. Gabriel's school. As I outlined in my speech, social distancing will not be a requirement in the case of children with special educational needs. We have to apply common sense and a real-world understanding of that interaction. Special needs assistants and teachers have very special relationships with children with special educational needs. Sometimes that special relationship manifests itself in a close physical relationship and it is very important that special educational needs are facilitated. That will be made clear in the guidelines tomorrow. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. His comments included seven questions. My time might be a bit short but I will give it a go. We are not alone in our ambition to fully open schools. I was on a conference call with ministers from Northern Ireland, France and Denmark yesterday. Their ambition is to fully open schools in the new term. At the end of the day, there will still have to be guidance on how to adapt to the new world of Covid-19. In common with our most senior citizens, young people take social distancing very seriously. They understand it. They are the ones who monitor adults when they stand a bit too close together. There is buy-in there. I am confident that, with the proper instruction, training, advice and guidance for teachers and staff, we will have a new environment in schools. It will be completely different. We will ensure safety through measures like the provision of hand sanitiser outside schools and all the protocols that go with that. The key message I always repeat, and on which my officials are really focusing, is that we have to keep the virus out of schools in the first place. How to do that is the big question. All these measures will be really important.  The Deputy asked for assurance that all schools will open at the end of August or September. That is the plan we are working towards. It is my ambition at this point to ensure that collective engagement with and interaction between the stakeholders, which is now held on a weekly basis, continues to provide us with suitable advice. I do not want to put a timeframe on it, but realistically schools need to be given this advice in July at the latest if they are to prepare.  The Deputy referred to a centralised procurement process for the purchase of sanitisers and whatever cleaning equipment is needed for proper hygiene in schools. There will be a centralised procurement system. The pupil-teacher ratio will be a budgetary decision for whoever ends up in that particular hot seat. I agree that if capital investment is front-loaded, schools must be to the fore. I remember the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government of 2011, when we had all the cutbacks in the world.One of the areas that was ring-fenced was the capital building programme for schools. That was really important. The Deputy referred to the question of health advice versus risk assessment. Health advice is paramount because this is about the safety of staff and students, but there also has to be a risk assessment in terms of the loss that is encountered by students by their being out of school potentially for a period of six months. We have to get that balance right. The Deputy spoke quite passionately about the outdoors and gardens. Something that has been very obvious in the lockdown - my own personal circumstances, as the father of three children, mean I am very aware of it - is that there has been a massive reconnection with nature. Many schools do good work in this area anyway but it has been phenomenal to see people reconnecting with the outdoors. There has been talk about how the world of work is going to be different after this crisis and how our lives in general will be different. Schools will also be different and making the most of the outdoors has to be a permanent feature of that. The Deputy asked about grants for sheds and all sorts of stuff. One never knows, the Deputy might get the call to be Minister for Finance and he will be able to write the cheque himself. We will see what happens if that comes to pass. Finally, school transport is an area where there have been issues and gaps in provision. There was a change to the criteria in 2010 or 2011 which made it difficult for a lot of rural primary and secondary school students, who now had to go to their closest school if they wished to avail of the scheme. I managed to make a change for the post-primary sector so that the second closest school could be included. We need a complete review of school transport, which is what I called for before Christmas. A review team has been set up and its terms of reference have been created. This is not about rural versus urban but about trying to get the bigger piece together. The Deputy is correct that some parents do not have enough time to get this right and will need an advance warning before their children go back to school.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an dá cheist. Bhain an chéad cheist leis an chostas agus an buiséad chun na bunscoileanna agus na meánscoileanna a oscailt i mí Mheán Fómhair. Tá an ceart aige. Beidh costas níos airde i gceist. Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil comhrá ar bun idir an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe agus mo Roinn féin maidir leis an phlean. Is é sin an chéad bhealach.Ach is é an dara bealach ná, nuair atá an plean le chéile agus muid ag breathnú ar an reachtaíocht, na pleananna atá againn fá choinne na scoileanna a oscailt i Meán Fómhair - na lámha a ní agus an reachtaíocht atá i gceist fosta. Táim cinnte go n-éireoidh an costas níos airde. Sin an fáth gur inis muid le Teachta Donohoe go mbeidh cinntí móra de dhíth maidir leis na rudaí sin nuair a bhíomar ag caint le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Rialtas an tseachtain seo a chuaigh thart. The first question the Deputy raised related to the costs. He is right that there will be a massive cost involved in schools returning fully and having the proper guidelines in place and the necessary infrastructure around it to ensure teachers, staff and students are safe also. The engagement is ongoing now between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The memo I brought to Government last week outlined very clearly that there will be a decision to be made and approval from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for this exceptional cost. I will address the second issue that the Deputy raised in the minute I have left. As he correctly pointed out, the school meals programme kicked into gear at very short notice last Easter and at the time we were very much indebted to the schools for adapting to it so quickly. There was also a big voluntary engagement, some schools used the local GAA club and different voluntary groups and An Post stepped up to the challenge as well. I am having the conversation with the Minister for Social Protection, Regina Doherty. We are looking to do something in this area. I appreciate the Deputy raising it here today as well and something like this is not a political issue to be tossed across the Chamber. I certainly would be interested in hearing Deputy Ó Ríordáin's viewpoints on how we do this. As he is aware, the schools have been under pressure in dealing with the calculated grades process. In the more than 200 schools that have registered for the summer-based provision we will provide school meals, as well as for the DEIS schools involved in the summer camps, so that will be covered anyway. If the Deputy has any ideas or suggestions around how we do this and my instinct is that there is a great capacity out there at a community level as well, whether it is youth groups or community groups, perhaps there could be some sort of support there in trying to distribute the food as well because it is something that I would like to support.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to do so. The Deputy raised a number of issues and asked why we do not have the guidelines today. We do not have them today because the engagement with stakeholders is happening tomorrow. A central ingredient in this process, whether it relates to the junior cycle, cancelling written examinations or calculated grades, was to get buy-in from stakeholders. It has been an incredibly positive process which will continue, and it is the only way that we will get to the other side for September. The Deputy is correct that the decisions can be slow. If he considers, however, that we cancelled the leaving certificate in their 95th year and then, within a few weeks, came up with an entirely new system of calculated grades for which we secured buy-in from teachers and schools, he will agree that while it is not the perfect system, we were not slow. I know in the real world of politics that we can work on an hour to hour or day to day basis, but the reason the decision on the cancellation of the leaving certificate examinations was slow was quite evident. One does not announce the cancellation of the leaving certificate examinations without having a proper alternative plan. That is why it was important that the day the stakeholders agreed to cancel the examinations, they also had to be walked through the calculated grades system. The picture in September will be the picture in September. We hope to be in a much stronger position if the country continues to have such a positive outcome of keeping Covid at a low level. We want to continue to move but we are monitoring countries such as Denmark, which is saying it wants everybody back in the classroom in September. It is the same in France and Northern Ireland. There will have to be close collaboration to ensure that we get to that point. If the Deputy wants me to paint a picture, I am confident that, in September, we will have all students back in class, studying and preparing for the year ahead.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What was the question?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Regarding the safe reopening of schools, at the heart of any decision will be the fact that the advice is clear. The advice we get from NPHET, and the advice we have always been getting, has been based on the safety of our citizens. It will be no different for schools. It will have to be safe and no Minister is going to make a decision that would put students or teaching staff in jeopardy. That is not the case. Ambition is important, as is hope. Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to creating hope. We have to hope that we will be in a better position to ensure we have the full reopening of schools. We are no different from any other country in Europe that shares that ambition. Some countries have done this differently. Sweden has never closed its schools. Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England kept their schools open for the children of front-line workers. France opened on a partial basis, and Deputy Murphy is correct about Denmark also opening on a partial basis, as did the Czech Republic and Greece. We are learning from those partial reopenings, but the ambition of those countries now is to work to a full reopening of schools in September. It is only right that we have the same line of purpose and ambition for our students, because if we do not get this right, if we do not have all of our children back in schools in September, they will have been out of school for six months. We have seen the gaps regarding regression in respect of special educational needs students. That is only one category, but other students and children have lost out and that has to remain the focus.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy has raised an important issue, and it is one on which I have had representation from the Acting Chairman, Deputy Lahart, as well as my party colleague, Deputy Brophy. I have asked my officials to give priority to this issue. The Deputy is correct to state that there are ongoing discussions to look at a potential solution. We are still in that space, but I am happy to go back again to my officials today after this issue has been raised, because it is an important matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for asking these specific questions. His asked when the written leaving certificate examinations will be held. They will be held this year and the earliest possible date for that is November. I stated publicly that I would like those examinations to be held during the Hallowe'en break in October. They cannot be held in August because the calculated grades will not be out until then. There is an enormous process now to be gone through. The opt-in option for people who are engaging in the calculated grades will arise in a few weeks' time and out-of-school learners will also have an opportunity to opt in. There will then be a process of standardisation. It is, therefore, a complicated process. I publicly stated my ambition to have the results out as near to the traditional date as possible. As the Deputy knows, that traditional date is in mid-August. There are no guarantees that will happen but once we move to the next phase of the opting in, we will be in a better position to see where we will be in August. The answer to the Deputy's question about the SUSI grant is "Yes". While SUSI grants are based on 2019 income streams, there will be an option for parents and students to look at changed circumstances in 2020. The Deputy raised the issue of the parameters for social distancing during summer provision. Guidelines and advice on social distancing have been given. As the Deputy will be aware, schools were informed of the guidelines two days ago and are awaiting the specific guideline on social distancing. That has not been published yet because there will be a meeting with stakeholders tomorrow. Once that meeting has taken place, we will be in a better position to publish the guidelines. On the issue of school returning, let us face it, we were given the green light to open schools by public health officials last Friday week. Our schools were closed on 12 March and we were given the go-ahead to open them last Friday week. Since then, we have been prioritising summer provision and the rules, guidelines and guidance for teachers and principals. I get the frustration. There is no question but that people are frustrated because a principal has the goodwill of special needs assistants and teachers to go ahead with July provision but is still awaiting the guidance. We will be in a better position tomorrow. I am over time but I will respond to the last question the Deputy asked about the support of children with Down's syndrome. I expanded the scheme. The scheme was specifically for children with autism and severe and profound intellectually disability. We expanded it to include children with moderate cases of disability and Down's syndrome. We also expanded it to include early intervention classes but students who are not in those early intervention classes are not included. Nobody feels more than I do for the parent whom the Deputy talked about but, unfortunately in this instance, only early intervention classes will be included.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The first matter the Deputy raised was on monetary guarantees. There is going to be a cost involved but I reassure the Deputy that discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are ongoing and before there is any conclusion as to how school reopening will look in September, there will have to be financial commitments from that Department.That will happen. I take the Deputy's point on the special needs issue. It has been difficult. The last three months have been difficult for people in different sectors, for people losing jobs and front-line workers and all the different pressure points. However, the area we are all thinking of is that of people with children with special educational needs. That is why I really wanted this programme to go ahead. I wanted to expand it and what a year to try to do it with all the unknowns, constraints and uncertainty. One thing is for sure and the Deputy will be hearing it in his own constituency in Limerick. The goodwill, enthusiasm and solidarity within the education community to make this happen is going to make it happen. Unfortunately there are going to be deficits such as school transport but I reassure the Deputy that parents will get a grant. The SUSI grant will be looked at in the context of new deliberations.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can assure the Deputy that the Department is not stale. There are 1,300 people working there and over the last three months they have been faced with unprecedented challenges. They showed amazing resilience and had the ability to be creative as well. On the issue the Deputy raised in respect of operators outside the Bus Éireann contract, he is correct that it is the Bus Éireann-contracted private operators who get the 50%. There was an issue and I know it was raised in my own county. We have a contract as a Department with Bus Éireann and it is specifically with Bus Éireann. On school bus tickets, the Deputy is right that we are faced with this conundrum every summer. It is unnecessary pressure for parents at times because it is a difficult one to get right. On the new guidelines that were introduced in 2011-12 for the nearest school, I managed to change the criteria for post-primary whereby the second closest school could be included. We still have issues for primary school. That is why I have set up a review for the school transport sector and it is really important that it is not just going through the motions. I have the terms of reference and we have a group set up internally in the Department. No doubt the House will be kept up to date on it. The student representative body of the secondary school students played a phenomenal role during the debate on the leaving certificate. Their voice was critical and crucial. The Deputy mentioned Ciara Fanning from his own county. She was so articulate and so on the ball in representing the pressure and stress on students at that time. I acknowledge that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The matter of external candidates has been raised by several Deputies. External candidates will be asked to opt in. That will be in about two weeks. I advise those candidates that as part of the process of opting in they will have to register an account of how they were being taught, who was teaching them and as much detail as possible as part of opting in. That will feed into the calculated grade and how the student progresses. The Deputy asked about a grind school with a registered teacher. Absolutely, if a registered teacher is providing that tuition-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, but if it is a registered teacher or a retired teacher, for example, whose registration may have lapsed, they will be in the position. The person will also have to provide data on when the tuition was provided and over what period. Hopefully that is of some help. Many Deputies have raised the retention of teachers. This was a year for the schools to hold onto the teachers but when the teachers know that the numbers are not going to be there for a given year, they move on and many of them have been reappointed at this stage. Where we have teachers looking for work on a substitute basis or on the supplementary panel or there is any availability of teachers, there will be demand in September. I want to make that clear. I have been contacted by a few teachers who have concerns and were given advice because they are immunocompromised or because of their health needs they cannot go into the classrooms themselves so we need to have substitute teachers ready for that. Whether existing bus routes are extinguished all depends on the level of demand. If the students are there, and they were there last year, there has been no change in policy. The only change in policy that I introduced last year was to include the second closest school for post-primary. There is still an issue with primary but there might be common sense about where we are going with school transport as part of the review. Maidir leis na daoine agus na daltaí scoile speisialta, aontaím leis an Teachta go bhfuil dúshlán agus dualgas orainn faoin treo is fearr dóibh. B’fhéidir go mbeidh deiseanna ann tríd an samhradh nó tríd an bhliain chun tacaíocht nó cuidiú a thabhairt do na tuismitheoirí uile. Tá siadsan faoi bhrú maidir leis an mbearna thar an 12 lá i Márta agus táim cinnte agus dóchasach go mbeimid ag breathnú ar scéim don samhradh atá ag teacht taobh istigh de chúpla seachtain. B’fhéidir go mbeimid ag bogadh ar aghaidh leis an scéim sin agus má tá deiseanna nó buntáistí á bhaint amach as an scéim, b’fhéidir go mbeimid ag tabhairt tacaíochta amach anseo sa bhliain seo chugainn.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Acting Chairman for his indulgence. I covered much of it in subsequent interventions. I did attend a virtual meeting of European Ministers for education yesterday where we shared the latest updates and plans for reopening across Europe and the things learned and experienced in other jurisdictions continue to shape the development of our own detailed guidance. We are now beginning to see how the public health guidance is starting to evolve in other jurisdictions as progress is made in suppressing the Covid-19 virus. This is enabling these countries to bring more students safely back to the classrooms so they can get their schools operating at or close to normal levels. I am particularly conscious of the ongoing need to have regard to the situation in Northern Ireland. Last Friday guidance on reopening schools from 24 August was published. The Northern Ireland Executive has an objective to see a return to school for all pupils as soon as possible. It is envisaged that the refinement of the social distancing arrangements and maximising use of space within school buildings will enable class sizes to return to near normal levels. The experience from countries across Europe shows us that the journey to bring schools back close to or near normality is evolving based on careful consideration of risks.Given that the response to the pandemic must adjust and adapt to the circumstances prevailing in the country at the time, the guidance issued this week to schools in the summer programme will be updated further in the coming weeks in preparation for the return to school at the start of the next school year. This will ensure that the best advice, based on the most likely situation that will apply for the next school year, can be given. There is also significant collaborative work ongoing in the tertiary sector to prepare for reopening. The diversity of provision in tertiary education means that situations of specific response within the overall roadmap are necessary. My Department is working closely with the sector to develop an adaptation framework, which will provide a shared structure for Government sectors, institutions and providers to use in preparing their plans, in continuing to adapt in response to changes in public health advice and in ensuring that consistently high-quality standards can be achieved in an inclusive way. A tertiary education roadmap is also being developed which provides information on what can be expected from a tertiary education experience for programmes that will continue through summer 2020 and for the 2020-21 academic year. Before concluding, Chairman, I want to update the House on developments in the calculated grades process. Deputies will be aware that we had asked schools to return schools-level data, made up of school-aligned estimated marks by earlier this week. The calculated grades executive office in my Department will be examining the data submitted to first ensure that it is complete, and then to move on to the next steps in the process. The calculated grades on the student portal will reopen in a number of weeks, at which point students will be invited to opt in to receive calculated grades. The executive office will also issue guidance to out-of-school learners in the coming days. A great amount of work has gone into the process to ensure that every effort will be made to provide a grade. I urge all out-of-school learners to carefully study the guidance which will be issued in the coming days and to engage with the process outlined. In conclusion, this is my sixth time to be before this House since 23 April. Each time I have set out openly the work that is being done across the education sector. The sessions here in the House have focused on this year’s leaving certificate, the provision of a summer programme and the reopening of the sector. Deputies, in turn, have raised a number of issues of concern to them, students and their families. The education sector and in particular the local school is at the core of much that we as a country strive to achieve. We want the best for our young people and learners right across the board. We all want our learners to be given the best opportunity possible to reach their full potential. We have seen school communities, principals, teachers, SNAs, other staff and secretaries, as well as parents and pupils themselves standing up and facing the challenges brought about by the virus. We in government, officials in my Department, and the representative bodies that have engaged us, have all been working hard through these challenges as well. Great spirit, resilience and leadership have been shown and together we all have a role to play in getting our country and every sector back to normal. Children and young people need their education and all children need to be able to access their education.  I thank all of the teaching staff who have engaged and continue to reach out to their students over the past period. Much of the work has gone on behind the radar and behind the scenes and those teachers, principals and leaders who stayed connected to their students and the SNAs who also stayed connected with their students have all done a phenomenal service. Yes, there have been gaps and issues but as I re-emphasise and reiterate here today, computers will not replace our teachers. It is invaluable to have that resource, that backup and that technology as an additionality to the capacity we have within the system but I say thanks again to everybody, to the Chairman and to my colleagues in this House for their courtesy, as always.
