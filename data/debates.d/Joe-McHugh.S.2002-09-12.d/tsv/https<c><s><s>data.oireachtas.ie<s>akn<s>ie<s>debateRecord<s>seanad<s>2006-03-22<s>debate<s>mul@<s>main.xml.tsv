JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 11, line 27, after "fish" to insert the following:", but for the avoidance of doubt does not include a sea-fishing boat".I welcome the Minister to the House and look forward to his views on the amendment. There is some ambiguity here and the reference to a "sea-fishing boat" might clarify the matter.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is correct. However, there is ambiguity with regard to the two amendments.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I want them discussed and I would like to hear the Minister's reaction to them. There is a degree of ambiguity on which I would like the Minister to give an opinion.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 15, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following subsection:"(8) The master of an Irish sea-fishing boat may depart from the terms of any notice under subsection (7) where exceptional circumstances (such as force majeure, the safety of the crew or the safety of the vessel) so require.”.We are all familiar with the concept of force majeure as it relates to the Department of Agriculture and Food in the context of exceptional circumstances. The Minister might outline his opinion on the fact that much grant aid, specification and regulation pertains to safety procedures on large and small boats. While I accept I am deviating to address issues that have recently come to my attention, what is the Minister’s opinion on the regulations and stipulations that crews of small vessels and fishermen must obey with regard to safety procedures?Much outstanding grant aid, which can average €3,000 to €4,000, is not available to fishermen. Some fishermen in the north west are still awaiting grants for safety procedures despite having gone through the required process and complied with existing regulations. Will the Minister expedite the grant aid due to many fishermen with small vessels?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to clarify a point for Senator Kenneally. In doing so, I am not saying he is alleging anything or telling me or my colleagues how we think. Fine Gael is not looking for short-cuts or any route other than that of obeying the rules and regulations. We are certainly not looking for loopholes whereby in certain instances a boat owner or fisherman could break the law. That is not the case.I used the opportunity presented by moving the amendment, albeit in a roundabout away, to make my point. We are all agreed on grant aiding fishermen to improve vessel safety and other provisions in line with regulations on a specific instance basis and trying to ensure boats use the proper port or do the right thing, but when one speaks to fishermen on a daily basis there seems to be a complete lack of confidence in the overall monitoring of the marine sector. That is no disrespect to or a poor reflection on the work of the Department. I am not trying to undermine the role played by the king-pins in the Department and that played by the enforcement officers in enforcing the regulations. Fishing is not a black and white industry and that is where the problem lies. Many fishermen take issue with the fact that on the one hand they have to obey quotas within certain zones — Irish fishermen are obeying them — while the other hand, fishermen from other countries can disobey them. That is where a lack of confidence comes into the system. On a related matter, there is an awareness that there is very little monitoring and regulation of factory ships. I am not saying that is the de facto position, but there is an awareness and an appreciation that the same rules and regulations are not being enforced in terms of the operations of factory ships.We are not talking about a grey area where certain rules can be considered differently. What fishermen are seeking in the fishing sector is common sense. I know people who write legislation but how does one legislate for common sense? I was at a mass recently where a priest said from the altar that common sense is most uncommon. We have a job to do in terms of legislation, but we must appreciate that we have ambassadors within the fishing sector who want to obey the rules, have a sustainable industry in the long run and work with the Department and with legislators. We should be working closer with them in terms of seeking their advice and their guidance. There are many proactive people in the fishing lobby and in the fishing representative organisations.This legislation is bad news for the industry. There may be a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel with the early spring not having been as bad as previous years.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the Acting Chairman's field of health matters, she may find she digresses as well. This is not a single issue rather it concerns minor discretions and the punitive outcomes therefrom concern many fishermen. The Fine Gael Party is not willing or interested in going down the road of letting people off the hook or enabling them to slip through loopholes. I thank the Acting Chairman for her indulgence.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 15, subsection (8), line 27, after "the" to insert "seventh".I appreciate the sentiments expressed by the Minister. I will not digress as we are focusing on the same issue, which is discretions. I am a firm believer in listening to the views of the person on the street in respect of every industry. If one was to ask 1,000 people living in coastal areas what was their main concern, the general response would be that we sold out our fishing industry in 1973. A second group of people would reply that if we did not take the route we took in 1973, the structural investments in this country would not have come about. The debate between these two schools of thought will continue.Fishermen constantly tell other members of the public that Norwegian, Spanish and Danish boats fish in Irish waters. Last night, a man informed me that Czech boats can be found fishing in Irish waters, although I am not sure if this is true. What mechanisms are proposed at EU and national level to deal with foreign boats which are exceeding the quotas and working outside their territories and in zones where they have no right to be? I am aware that whistleblowing is a dangerous word to throw around, although it has been raised in respect of nursing homes. Could a whistleblowing mechanism, whereby people could inform on foreign boats committing indiscretions in Irish waters, be introduced to protect the Irish fishing industry?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 18, subsection (13)(a), line 48, to delete “it.” and substitute the following:"it:by sending such notification to—(i) the address at which the holder is ordinarily resident, and(ii) the address at which the holder carries on business, where the two are different."This is a straightforward amendment which seeks to ensure that notification of a fine or otherwise goes to both the business address and the home address.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 19, subsection (14)(b), line 17, to delete “or” where it secondly occurs and substitute “and”.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 19, lines 34 to 36, to delete subsection (18) and substitute the following new paragraph:"(18) The Minister may authorise in writing such officers of the Department as he or she considers necessary to grant authorisations on his or her behalf and to add to or alter authorisation conditions and terms.".This amendment goes back to the original point about resourcing enough officers to carry out certain instructions on behalf of the Department. In terms of recent high-profile activity, there is a whole issue around who authorises instructions and who carries them out. I am sure the Minister is aware of the high-profile case to which I am alluding, but I do not want to put it on the record of the House. There are anomalies attached to how a writ is issued in regard to an infringement or indiscretion. Should there be better mechanisms in place to ensure best practice when authorisations or instructions are being issued by the Department?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 21, subsection (3), lines 12 to 15, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following new paragraph:"(b) in relation to fish, the master and owner of the boat concerned commits an offence, and the buyer, handler, weigher, transporter, processor, person storing or documenting and seller of the fish, where he or she could reasonably have been aware that the fish in question contravened a regulation, each commits an offence.”.Given the history of the legislation and the fact that more than 200 amendments were tabled in the Dáil, the Bill has been debated at length among the fishing and non-fishing fraternity because of the concerns about criminality. There is a realisation among the fishing fraternity that if laws are broken, tough sanctions must be imposed.However, in regard to the grey area of the fishing industry, there may be legitimate force majeure reasons for certain indiscretions, and people are worried that serious criminal charges may be brought against fishermen. There is a major concern that gear will be confiscated. Comparisons were drawn with someone driving at 60 km/h in a 30 km/h zone in Trim and having his or her car confiscated. It is difficult to measure certain aspects, but the concern among fishermen is that their gear will be confiscated for minor indiscretions and the culpability will rest with boat owners. The whole area of criminality is a fear fishermen face and it has been debated at length in both Houses. There is confusion in this regard because the Attorney General seems to have a different view on the issue of administrative and criminals sanctions and Joe Borg, the EU Fisheries Commissioner, seems to be coming from a different school of thought.There is a danger that once the legislation is enacted, the horse may have bolted. I know the Minister has given a commitment to further debate the marine sector. The enactment of this legislation and the possibility fishermen may be faced with criminal charges is a worry we should acknowledge. We should consider the possibility of administrative sanctions as opposed to criminal ones for minor indiscretions.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 22, subsection (3), lines 40 to 43, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:"(b) in relation to fish, the master and owner of the boat concerned commits an offence, and the buyer, handler, weigher, transporter, processor, person storing or documenting and seller of the fish, where he or she could reasonably have been aware that the fish in question contravened a regulation, each commits an offence.”.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 25, lines 24 to 30, to delete subsection (3).The section provides, among other matters, that a sea-fisheries protection officer may confiscate fishing gear from a vessel. Subsection (3) states:Where a sea-fisheries protection officer detains in his or her custody under this section any sea-fish and the sea-fish is likely to become unfit for human food before the matter can conveniently be dealt with by any court, he or she may produce the sea-fish to a designated officer (where he or she is not a designated officer), and, if authorised so to do by the designated officer, shall sell or otherwise dispose properly of the sea-fish.While we all agree that the law must be enforced when it is being flouted, a level playing field is required. It is widely believed that this is not the case, particularly as regards large factory ships. Common sense practice must apply in the approach to confiscating fishing gear. We do not seek loopholes or ways to flout the law for those who commit offences.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 27, lines 22 to 28, to delete subsection (4).We seek the deletion of this subsection on the grounds that anomalies may arise in terms of the powers given to enforcement officers. Subsection (4) states:A sea-fisheries protection officer when exercising any powers under this section may be accompanied by other persons and may take with him or her, or those persons may take with them, any equipment or materials (including firearms or other weapons (where he or she or any of those other persons is a member of the Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána)) to assist the officer in the exercise of those powers.It is to be hoped that a case will not arise in which enforcement officers board vessels in an intimidating manner while carrying guns or other weapons. In other industries, are there cases where enforcement officers carry guns when addressing issues with which their Departments are unhappy?We are in danger of over legislating in the areas of fishing and farming. It could yet transpire that enforcement officers enter the lands of farmers who spread slurry outside a certain period or spread too much phosphorus. Fishermen who work within the law fear that they will be randomly boarded by officials accompanied by gardaí, even where there is no evidence of legal wrongdoing. I too have concerns on the prospect of armed gardaí boarding vessels and would like clarification on the nature of the weapons involved.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am fully appreciative of the Minister's points. If, for example, the Garda gets wind of a bank robbery, it will send special well-armed personnel into the bank with good preparation. I require clarification of whether armed officers will board boats without any indication of malpractice or illegal activity. Will law-abiding fishermen going about their business be subject to random raids by armed members of the forces? It is intimidating and there is a lack of equality over the broad plane of industry. Do armed gardaí go into a bank that is not being robbed when staff are working? I would like some clarification on whether such armed searches go on randomly or if they will take place on boats where there has been indication of malpractice or illegal activity.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 27, lines 29 to 40, to delete subsection (5).
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 28, subsection (3), line 13, to delete "will be" and substitute "has been".This section deals with the 48-hour period whereby a boat or trawler would be impounded pending a court order for a further time. If there has been malpractice or indiscretion this is not a problem. The section also stipulates that crewmen must be released after 48 hours. I have tabled this amendment with regard to the timeframe of the court order for further detention being made. The legislation states "will be made" after the 48 hours and I wish to substitute "has been", which indicates it is prior to the 48-hour period.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 28, subsection (1)(a), line 20, to delete “instituted” and substitute “instituted,”.I may seek clarification on this amendment as it could be redundant.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 15:
In page 28, subsection (1), line 47, to delete "detain the boat further" and substitute "release the boat".With regard to the right of appeal on the further detention of a boat, there is a fear among members of the fishing community that they could be embroiled in a legal logjam. It would be unfair on people working in the Department to use the term "procrastination", but there is bureaucracy within the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It is evident in every Department, including the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Health and Children. As a result of such bureaucracy, there is a fear of further detention of boats, and that this could be a problem in the long term.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 30, subsection (1)(c), lines 20 and 21, to delete “(including the capacity thereof)”.This amendment deals with fines not paid within the required time. The Bill reads "in the event of such fine and costs (if any) not being paid within the said time, such fine and costs (if any) may be recovered by distress and the sale of such boat". It is a worthwhile amendment because it observes the principles of force majeure. We seek a general provision, not one that includes the capacities of boats.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 17:
In page 30, subsection (4), line 46, to delete "€5,000" and substitute "€3,000".We want people who break the law to be penalised but a fine of €5,000 is harsh for many offences. We propose a reduction to €3,000. I am reminded of a man from Donegal, whom I met yesterday, who received the grant of planning permission yesterday from the Minister's previous Department, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. As politicians do — we enjoy advising people on their entitlements — I asked if he had received his grant. He said he had but that he had also been fined €5,000. That is a story for another day but €5,000 is a massive amount of money for somebody starting to build a house, especially for a minor indiscretion.Section 24 states that where a person commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction, he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding €5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months, or to both. Amendment No. 19 seeks to reduce this to one month.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Can the Minister clarify the words on page 30, lines 43-45: "Where the master of a boat fails or refuses to comply with a request made to him or her under subsection (3), he or she commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €5,000." Did the Minister say "may" or "is"?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thought the Minister put the word "may" on the record.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 31, subsection (1), line 43, to delete "€5,000" and substitute "€3,000".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 21:
In page 34, subsection (2), line 5, after "and" to insert "may be subject".This amendment relates to the table of fines in section 28, and specifically to the provision in subsection (5) which states:Where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence specified in a Table, in addition to any fine the court may impose under this section——(a) in the case of a conviction under section 8 or 9, it may order the forfeiture of all or any fish and fishing gear found on the boat to which the offence relates...The phrase "The forfeiture of all or any fish and fishing gear found on the boat" raises a concern about when do we know that an indiscretion has taken place, if at all, and what discretionary powers officials have to board boats and decide at a whim that all fishing gear and fish must be confiscated if they do not have significant evidence. While my amendment contains specifics, what are the Minister's thoughts regarding the section in general? Will we be able to put in place safety measures to protect fishermen if they are not breaking the law or working outside quotas or zones?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 22:
In page 34, lines 26 to 36, to delete subsection (5) and substitute the following:"(5) Where a person is convicted on indictment of an offence specified in a Table, in addition to any fine the court may impose under this section, it may order the forfeiture of all or any fish and fishing gear found on the boat to which the offence relates.".
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 23:
In page 35, lines 23 to 49, to delete Table 1 and substitute the following:Reference Number [1]Provision [2]Category* [3]Fine on conviction on indictment not exceeding amount specified below [4]1 (a)Section 11, 14 or 15 in so far as it relates to a contravention relating to capacity plans of a sea fishing boat,Category 1€5,000Category 2€10,000Category 3€20,000Category 4€40,000(b)Illegal nets or other equipment, orCategory 1€5,000Category 2€10,000Category 3€20,000Category 4€40,000(c)any other contravention or failure of compliance.Category 1€3,000Category 2€6,000Category 3€12,000Category 4€24,0002Section 8(2), 9(3) or 10(2)Category 1€3,000Category 2€6,000Category 3€12,000Category 4€24,0003Section 12 or 13Category 1€3,000Category 2€6,000Category 3€12,000Category 4€24,000*Category 1: fishing vessels with a waterline length <10 metres;Category 2: fishing vessels with a waterline length >10 metres and <18 metres;Category 3: fishing vessels with a waterline length >18 metres and <24 metres;Category 4: fishing vessels with a waterline length >24 metres.".It is difficult to imagine what it would be like for a fisherman and his crew to have someone board their boat on the grounds that there may have been an infringement of the law. That the fisherman may go through the ordeal of having his gear and boat confiscated and being arrested and held for a period of up to 48 hours is a genuine concern. We need to clarify how we can be seen to support an industry if we are prepared to take crewmen and confiscate their boat and gear on the grounds of suspicion.As the Minister said, these issues could be cleared up in the District Court, but a lot of time will be wasted by going through that process. For example, bluefish fishermen have already exceeded their quotas for this year. Time is important for fishermen. We need to deal with those who are flouting the law, but the men who are acting within best practice, guidelines and regulations may see officers with firearms boarding their vessels, have their gear and boats confiscated and be detained for a period of 48 hours when it may transpire that, due to some numerical mistake on a log book, they may not have broken the law.To put this matter in perspective, it seems that farmers may face six months in prison if they do not comply with the nitrates directive, a parallel I used previously. What process must the farmer go through? Must the farmer stop farming during the trial period, as it were, in which it will be determined whether he or she complied with the directive? The answer is "No" but fishermen who may be innocent must stop fishing.Senator Kenneally is wagging his head like a little pup and thinks this is nonsense but it is not. Fishermen who may be innocent could step off their boats, go to the District Court and find that six weeks of their time and effort has gone. This is my concern regarding the Bill.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 24:
In page 38, subsection (2), line 3, after "appealable" to insert the following:"save for an appeal to the High Court on a point of law".This section may lead to one being guilty until proven innocent. Many high-profile examples can be cited of people convicted despite their innocence. Section 32(2) states "The judge of the Circuit Court on an appeal under subsection (1) may vary, confirm or reverse the order and his or her decision is final and conclusive and not appealable.” A decision on a person’s innocence or guilt is made within a defined period of time. A 48-hour period is insufficient to determine a person’s guilt. We should include my amendment to cater for this fact.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 25:
In page 59, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following new subsection:"(4) If satisfied, after considering the objection and any submission received, the Minister shall issue directions, including policy directions, to the Registrar General so as to remedy any matters giving rise to, or likely to give rise to, anomalies.".From what the Minister has said it appears he will examine further avenues for progressing this debate and going back to a consultative stage with the fishing organisations. That is welcome. There is a belief that this process of deliberation was not exhausted as it should have been. On the policy directions that could remedy any matters that might give rise to anomalies in the future, this amendment is worth consideration on the grounds that there will be anomalies and submissions. We must progress collectively. The Department and all parties must work for the fishermen. It is important that the Minister consider this amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Report Stage was scheduled to be taken tomorrow. If it is in agreement for consideration to look at some amendments for Report Stage we would be prepared to take it at the time allocated, namely, 2 p.m. Would that give enough time to circulate the amendments?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We need time to submit amendments for Report Stage.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If the officials have the capacity to circulate the amendments——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have a few.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The amendments would be similar to those taken on Committee Stage.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank the Independent group for tabling this motion. It is important to be proactive rather than reactive in the debate on health services. It becomes clear that this is a live debate when one speaks to those directly or indirectly affected by cancer. Unfortunately, whether through family, friends or the local community, Senators will all know people who have experienced the ordeal of cancer or are undergoing cancer therapy.I seek clarification on an issue I have raised previously. I am pleased to note a slight change in the language used in respect of cancer, radiation and oncology treatment for patients from County Donegal. Cancer patients in my county have had to endure the long trek to Dublin for cancer care. Options will, however, become available in Galway. A recent announcement that it may be possible to treat cancer patients from County Donegal in Belfast was met with confusion and derision. I intend no disrespect to the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children or her counterpart in Northern Ireland but this response was justified shortly afterwards when Mr. Shaun Woodward MP, the Minister with responsibility for health in Northern Ireland, stated on a radio programme in County Donegal that cancer patients from County Donegal would be treated in Belfast provided beds were available. This was a legitimate point and it was clearly based on demographic factors.It is planned to establish four major radiation oncology units in the South, two in Dublin, one in Galway and one in Cork, as well as two outreach satellite centres, one in Limerick and one in Waterford. Six major centres will, therefore, cater for a population of 3.5 million. Viewed from a geographical perspective, service provision will follow an arc stretching from Galway in the west, south to Limerick, Cork and Waterford and north into Dublin. These units will cater for those living in the region extending from north County Louth southwards around the coast as far as south County Sligo. The people of the midlands will also have access to these services. When one subtracts from the population of the Twenty-six Counties the population of counties Donegal and Leitrim and north county Sligo — approximately 400,000 — one finds that the proposed plan will cater for 3.1 million people. The population of Northern Ireland, on the other hand, is more than 1.5 million. The reason Mr. Shaun Woodward MP made his remarks is that the new Belfast radiation oncology unit will cater for 1.5 million people and they will be given priority in terms of access to services. In contrast, we are establishing six centres to cater for a population of slightly more than 3 million. One does not need to be a rocket scientist to figure out that these figures present a mathematical and numerical anomaly. The reason Mr. Woodward stated that County Donegal patients would be accommodated in Belfast provided beds were available was because he looked at the mathematics.Not alone are people from north County Sligo, Donegal and Leitrim examining the complexities of the system, so too are the people of counties Tyrone, Fermanagh and Derry. This is the reason we must have ongoing cross-Border interaction and communication between Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry and Letterkenny General Hospital in County Donegal. While I am aware that negotiations and communications between the joint management teams at both hospitals are ongoing, we have not received much detail on progress.In terms of service provision, the people of the north west have been overlooked and find themselves facing a dangerous anomaly. People in the North who live west of the River Bann, an area which includes much of counties Fermanagh, Tyrone and Derry, have long held that central government in London has neglected them. The proposed provision of cancer services in the South is an example of the same type of neglect being shown to the people of the north west who have long believed they have been abandoned by central government in Dublin. Cancer service provision is the proof in the pudding. Peripherality and distance have been blamed but the truth is the north-western regions have been neglected.Why did the Scottish and Welsh want devolved government? The reason was that the centralisation of power does not work either in our democracy or in the United Kingdom. We must address the failure of central government in London and Dublin to meet the needs of the people of the north west and the forum for doing so is at joint ministerial level. We can talk about the Good Friday Agreement until the cows come home but we must start to act on it. We have cross-Border opportunities to accommodate and facilitate those whom we represent.The geographical arc between Galway and Dublin which I described extends beyond health into such areas as transport, industry and infrastructure. We have failed to provide infrastructural investment or adequate health services to the people of the north west.How can the radiation unit in Belfast accommodate cancer patients from County Donegal when it already covers a population of 1.5 million people? The figures do not add up. The north west was previously mentioned as a potential satellite centre and I want to know why reference was not made to that today.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Give us the roads. It takes seven hours to travel from Malin Head to Dublin.
