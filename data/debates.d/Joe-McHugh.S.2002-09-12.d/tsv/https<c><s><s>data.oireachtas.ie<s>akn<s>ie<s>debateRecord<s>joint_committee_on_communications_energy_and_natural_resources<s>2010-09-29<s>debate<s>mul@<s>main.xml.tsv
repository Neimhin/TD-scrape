JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why are prices still high?  The regulator went into it to some extent, and that was on foot of a press release on the differential between Northern Ireland prices and those in the Republic of Ireland.  What happens when the ESB hits 60% of market share?  Where sits the consumer then in terms of confidence and knowing the prices will come down?The regulator gave reasons prices are still high, whether level of usage and VAT, which is a function of Government.  His organisation is also a function of Government.  He touched on the 4.9% PSO.  People who live in the real world are frightened that prices will continue to go up.  We have evidence that this is happening already and I mentioned the 4.9% PSO.  The real fear is based on the model at which we are looking.  We have the regulator and the participants and it smacks of cartel-ism.  That is not just coming from me.  People on the street do not believe one can manufacture competition.  That is what the regulator is trying to do.  It is laudable in terms of two new entrants into the market and creating competition.  We do not want one dominant player or a monopoly.  What the regulator is trying to do is laudable but in terms of whether it will work in the long-term, there is a fear and lack of confidence in that model.Competition was mentioned once today by Mr. Ennis from Airtricity.  The call for competition in regard to the sharing of wider costs must be heard by the regulator.  We cannot have one dominant player having complete monopoly on the grid and then try to facilitate new entrants into the market which do not have that parity or equality when trying to deliver their product.How will the regulator ensure post the 60% market share tipping point that prices will come down?  Can he ensure prices will come down at that stage because I and the public are concerned when all the main participants sit around the table being very nice to the regulator that it smacks of cartel-ism.  We need to ensure that proper competition happens.  The regulator is trying to ensure it, which is laudable, but it is not working and we need to be very careful about it post the ESB being at the 60% tipping point.
