JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the representatives of the aquaculture sector.  It is important that we have this debate now.  The industry offers a significant economic opportunity and those who are interested in rural communities will be sympathetic to the idea of keeping our young people from boarding boats and aeroplanes once again.We must take cognisance of the bureaucratic blockage that has developed.  Politicians as well as those working in the industry are encountering difficulties in getting answers.  It is a frustrating situation which requires a remedy.  When the people who work in the industry and understand its value and potential have already done their own research on environmental best practice, the least they deserve are open lines of communication.There is significant potential for added value in wild and native oysters, mussels and scallops.  Mr. Feenstra referred to the salmon sector, which is adding value through processing.  However, we are not getting it right at the local level.  In my constituency, the Foyle under comes the auspices of the Loughs Agency, which is a bureaucratic maze.  In the Swilly area, issues arise in regard to licensing oyster and mussel farmers.  Over the past five years, houses were all that was grown in the fields of my county.  Against that backdrop, the aquaculture industry has found it difficult to survive.  It is important that we begin to take the industry seriously at a bureaucratic level.In regard to its potential, we signed up to the Common Fisheries Policy in 1983 and we are now commencing a new fisheries policy.  Inland fisheries, aquaculture and processing and marketing of fishery products are not eligible for support under this operational programme of €42 million.  That is where we need to start taking this issue seriously.  The EU has always claimed that we benefited greatly from membership and many of the mainstream parties rehearsed the same argument during the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  We received more than €40 billion since entering the EU.  However, anecdotal evidence indicates that we sacrificed €180 billion in potential earnings on foreign caught fish by joining the EU.Under the new CFP, which will now be subject to consultation, the danger is that Europe will come up with a plan for us, just as they did in respect of fisheries.  Where would that leave our local industries?  Will we once again sacrifice the potential for an EU master plan?  We have an opportunity to build on the growth we have already achieved.  I will be parochial by referring to Marine Harvest's operations in my neck of the woods.  In the Fanad Peninsula, people continue to farm small holdings and the only other industry keeping people in the area is Marine Harvest.  We must hold onto the jobs we already have while also creating new ones.  Will the jobs anticipated by Mr. Flynn give rise to additional charges on the Exchequer?
