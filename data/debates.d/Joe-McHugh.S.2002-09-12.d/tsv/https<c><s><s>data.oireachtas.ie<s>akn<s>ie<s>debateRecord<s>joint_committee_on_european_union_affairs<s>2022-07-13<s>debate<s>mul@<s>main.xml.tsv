JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Neale Richmond and Senator Regina Doherty. Cuirim fáilte roimh Mr. Michael Scannell, deputy director general at agriculture and rural development at the European Commission. We will engage with him on the topic of food security and safeguarding that food security in the EU, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine. Before we begin I must advise the committee on privilege and other housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are aware of the constitutional requirements and if they wish to speak or contribute at the meeting they must be within the confines of the Leinster House complex. I will not a permit a member who is not adhering to this constitutional requirement to participate. Members know the drill. We are a few minutes behind schedule so we will get straight into it and get Mr. Scannell to make an opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Scannell. It is good to get an account of where things are at at EU level and to hear about resilience in food security within the EU. No doubt, members will want to broaden that out to dfferent parts of the world and the EU's response.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Ó Murchú is next, followed by Deputy Brady.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Ó Murchú gets one more supplementary question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have 25 minutes and three contributors remaining. I call Deputy John Brady, who will be followed by Senator Chambers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Scannell. Deputy Marian Harkin is our final contributor.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr Scannell. We have been quite efficient today. We have one minute remaining. I am going to ask a question to look for a bit of direction more than anything else. This might not be in Mr. Scannell's area of competency or responsibility. Deputy Ó Murchú, Deputy Haughey and I were in Georgia recently. One of the things we were struck by was the proximity of Georgia to the Black Sea, the South Caucasus and the Caspian Sea. It is a strategic location in terms of food security and potential energy supply chains. Mr. Scannell might signpost who might be the best person to follow up on that issue with, if it is not himself. If it is him, he might put together a note on it for the committee outlining the co-operation between the EU and the eastern partnership countries, specifically Georgia. That is something that came up in a lot of our deliberations while we were there. It would be great to get either a signpost or a note on that, if possible. We are grateful for Mr. Scannell's time today. Go raibh míle maith agat. Bain sult as an samhradh. Beimid i dteagmháil arís, gan dabht. We will leave it at that unless Mr. Scannell wants to make a final closing statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Scannell for attending the meeting. We will now go into private session to discuss a number of housekeeping matters.
