JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Senator Quinn raised the issue of tourism. In the first week of February this year it was impossible to get a car parking space at the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim because of the number of British, European and American tourists. However, in Donegal, just 45 minutes away from the Giant's Causeway via the Magilligan ferry, there were only empty car parks throughout the month of July in tourist areas. We need serious debate on an all-Ireland strategy for tourism. We have FÃ¡ilte Ireland and in the north west we have North West Tourism, Donegal Tourism and Donegal Tourism Limited. We must have serious debate on the issue of tourism. Why are the car parks full in February at the Giant's Causeway, but empty in July in Donegal?
