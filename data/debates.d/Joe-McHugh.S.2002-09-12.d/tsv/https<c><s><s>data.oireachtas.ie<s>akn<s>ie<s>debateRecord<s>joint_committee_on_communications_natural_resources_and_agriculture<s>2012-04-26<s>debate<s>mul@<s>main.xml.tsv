JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegates and congratulate them on their work.  They have been very proactive in this area and in others.  Other works are ongoing.  The delegates have been showing the lead.  They are tapping into a sense of enthusiasm on the part of the Minister.  The Minister has a vision and an appetite to try something new.  There is no point underestimating the ambitious nature of the project in question.  It does not tick all the boxes from an industry perspective in regard to cost-benefit analysis because there will be extra transportation costs involved.  Extra costs will be incurred the farther out to sea one goes.  The project is very ambitious and the industry knows this.  I congratulate those involved on their work.The alarming figure that stands out regarding supply is that we are producing 12,000 tonnes of salmon per annum while Scotland produces 150,000 and Norway produces 1 million.  While we have trade missions to China and there is demand, supply presents the underlying challenge.  Today in Brussels, staff from the Irish salmon industry are offering their product, but the problem they encounter is supply.  I will receive a similar narrative from the industry this year stating demand was at its maximum level two or three hours into a trade show.  That is the real challenge.  If we are to put the best foot forward, we must consider how we can get an adequate supply within the environmental and sustainability structures that Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Department are taking into consideration.  This is against the backdrop of the marine harvest project, for example, waiting for more than 20 years to obtain approval for a licence.  The legacy on salmon farming is grim, to say the least.  We are not present to talk about legacy issues but it must be stated that waiting 20 years for a licence dampens enthusiasm and motivation within the industry.  The real challenge concerns how to move on from this.Let me refer to an interjection by Deputy Ó Cuív.  I am sorry I came in late but hope I am picking him up right in believing he is calling for a language impact study on the effect on the islands.  With regard to the consultation mentioned by Senator Ó Domhnaill, the first step taken was consultation.  The islands were included and this is very important.  It is correct that this must happen in Gola and off the coast of Mayo, and we must continue on that track.  With regard to how the project will affect the Irish language, a language impact study is a totally unnecessary exercise.  It is an exercise in holding up things and filibustering.  When one consults a community, it raises its concerns.  With all due respect to Deputy Ó Cuív, a language impact study into producing salmon off the west coast just holds up things.  The population along the west coast, from teenagers to people in their 40s, is heading to places such as Canada and Australia, and we are trying to bring jobs to the area.In the past, decisions were not made as we called for reports to examine this and that.  If there is one thing that gets under the skin of the people, it is bureaucracy, including red tape, passing the buck and not being able to make a decision.  I may sound a wee bit vexed when I raise this issue.  I acknowledge and feel strongly that we must work within the environmental constraints and bear in mind sustainability but producing a language impact study on the production of salmon, which would provide jobs off the west coast, is nothing short of a disgrace.
