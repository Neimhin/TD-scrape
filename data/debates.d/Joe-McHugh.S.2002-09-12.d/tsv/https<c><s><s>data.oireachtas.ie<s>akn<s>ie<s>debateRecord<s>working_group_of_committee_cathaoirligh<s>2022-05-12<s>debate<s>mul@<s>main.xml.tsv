JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Fuair muid leithscéalta ó na Teachtaí O'Dowd, Whitmore, Michael Moynihan, Martin Browne, McGuinness, Kehoe agus Matthews. Iarraim ar na comhaltaí agus ar gach duine i láthair a fóin póca a mhúchadh. Cuirim fáilte roimh an Taoiseach go dtí an cruinniú leis an Ghrúpa Oibre na gCathaoirleach Coiste. Cuirim fáilte fosta roimh chomhghleacaithe an Taoisigh, na hoifigigh ó Roinn an Taoisigh, John Callinan san áireamh. Déanaim comhghairdeas le John as a ceapachán ina phost úr mar Ard-Rúnaí. Cuirim fáilte roimh Pádraig Ó Conaill fosta agus déanaim comhghairdeas leis fosta. The purpose of today's meeting, in accordance with Standing Order 120, is to discuss matters of public policy and particularly those raised through our respective committees. As the Taoiseach will be aware, committees undertake detailed work that does not lend itself to consideration in plenary sessions. While our work is intensive, our collective remit is extensive and the approach taken enables Parliament to engage with the partners, public bodies, and the public in general, in a meaningful and direct manner. As for today's meeting, I look forward to a constructive engagement that will hopefully be of mutual benefit to the Taoiseach and to us as committee Cathaoirligh. We will now proceed directly to the substantive part of the meeting. I ask the Taoiseach to make his opening statement. You are very welcome Taoiseach.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Taoiseach. Before we move on to the next part of the meeting I will do a quick recap on the procedures that we have agreed. We will take questions from cathaoirligh in groups of three. They will be called upon in order of their appointment under the D'Hondt model, followed by non-D'Hondt committees. Members will be delighted to hear that the next information I will outline is an abbreviated version. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. A time limit of two and a half minutes was proposed, but in a spirit of generosity, and as a reflection of the generous nature of my own personality, we are going to up that to three minutes per Cathaoirleach. Cathaoirligh will put their questions in groups of three and the Taoiseach will be given four minutes to respond to the questions of each group. As our time is limited, we will be using the clock and adhering to the time limits. In the event that somebody is not present, I will move to the names in the group below. As a result, I might call people earlier than indicated. Without further ado, the first person up is Deputy Howlin, Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, but as we agreed in the Standing Orders, he is also the Leas-Chathaoirleach of this committee as well. He has a double function here today. He should lead the way. He will be followed by Deputy Quinlivan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I do not want interrupt.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Members will be happy for as much information as possible and the Taoiseach is imparting important information as well.An tarna dream ná na Teachtaí Funchion, Seán Crowe agus Leddin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Can I intervene?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have a limited time. We cannot have a back and forth.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I had intended to bring in Deputy Niamh Smyth at this point but I will have to leave her until the next round because there is a lot of content in those questions. I call the Taoiseach.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will move on to the next set of members, Teachtaí Niamh Smyth, Flanagan and O'Donnell.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his impressive double use of the word “finally”.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I know that the Taoiseach has a finite amount of time available to us today. We have one more block left after this. Is the Taoiseach okay with that?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is good.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Taoiseach. An dream deireanach ná an Teachta Bacik agus an beirt Seanadóirí, Carrigy agus Cassells.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for that final and important intervention and for his passion in this area. The Taoiseach's time is in his hands. It is out of my control now.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mick Lyons, I would say, would have had a few. I am putting his name on record here.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Taoiseach as a chuid ama linn inniu. Scrúdaíomar níos mó ábhar agus gabhaim buíochas dá chomhghleacaithe freisin: John Callinan agus Pádraig Ó Conaill. Tiocfaimid ar ais ag deireadh an lae fa choinne an chéad bhliain eile. Gabhaim buíochas agus bain sult as.
