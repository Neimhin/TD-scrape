JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome this opportunity to speak on the budget.  I wish to refer to the introductory remarks of the Fine Gael spokesperson in the Dáil, Deputy Bruton, in respect of people on trolleys.  The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, would have been there at the time and should agree with me that the reaction to what he said was, to say the least, juvenile and an insult.The juvenile reaction from members of the Government was insulting to relatives of the people on trolleys and to the 34 people on trolleys in Letterkenny General Hospital today.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am talking about people on trolleys.  Deputy Bruton referred to the people on trolleys and he was heckled and jeered as if the problem did not exist, while 34 people were on trolleys today in Letterkenny General Hospital.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Bruton was heckled and jeered and the Minister of State was part of it and he knows it.  That happened during his introductory remarks on the budget today.  The people——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State will have a chance to respond.  It is an insult——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was the Minister of State and his Government——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State and the Government control this House.  When Deputy Bruton made reference——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I urge the Chair to be balanced on this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I accused him and his Government.  He was one of them.  It was the Government collectively.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not withdraw it.  It was him and part of the Government.  It is a collective Government and today that group heckled and jeered Deputy Bruton when he mentioned the people on trolleys as if what he said was not true.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not withdraw a remark about people heckling and jeering about people on trolleys, with 34 of them on trolleys today in Letterkenny General Hospital.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If he puts it on the record that he did not heckle.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He has not put it on the record.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is rubbish.  The Minister of State should be a man.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will accept that because I want to continue and make my point.  I am not going to sit down.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Thank you.  To make my point clear, there were 34 people on trolleys in Letterkenny General Hospital today, the day of the budget.  The reference made by Deputy Bruton, the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance, to the fact that there are people on a continual basis on trolleys, should have been taken more seriously than it was.  The reaction was like that of a junior or senior infant primary school class in the Dáil today and was disgraceful.We need to ask deeper and more pertinent questions about the budget.  How come the Evening Herald could print most of the content of the budget prior to the Budget Statement?  How is it various media could print snippets of the budget all during the week?  How is it we have been drip fed the budget all week?  Has some of the budget been leaked?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am being interrupted, Chairman.  Some ten years ago a Minister of State resigned over a similar leak as a result of a simple mistake by a civil servant.  Many newspapers had access to much of the information on today's budget, which basically made a damp squib of it.  It was all much ado about nothing because the public in general knew exactly was coming up in it.Reference was made in the Budget Statement to a review of motor tax — only a review, after ten years in Government.  What is that about?  The Government has been ten successive years in office, yet it refers in the budget to a review.  That is an insult to the public.  We are dealing with the people's money.A budget is no more than the distribution of the people's hard-earned money.  I accept that there will be razzmatazz on budget day and a perception that people will be better off in the long run.  However, counties like that of the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, Kildare, and my county, Donegal, rely totally on the construction and services sectors to sustain employment, as is the case in nearly every county.  I make this point because of the information outlined in the budget document, which refers to the economic outlook, GNP growth of 5.7%, GDP growth of 5.4%, growth driven by domestic demand, the small contribution from net exports, a general deterioration in competitiveness, a relatively modest rate of export growth and a low rate of labour productivity.  When the razzmatazz and circus element of today's budget is finished, we will have to examine the real aspects of the economy and the long-term economic projections.It is the labour intensive sectors such as the construction and services sector which keep our economy alive although hanging by a dangling thread.  The sooner this Government wakes up and realises it has made mistakes, the better.  It should have introduced the tax incentives for innovation and research and development, which it finally introduced today, ten years ago.  This is ten years too late, as the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, knows.  I charge the Government with total neglect and irresponsible handling of this economy.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government can use all the razzmatazz and glamour it wants, and put whatever slant it wants on this.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The problem with this economy is that it is dangling by a thread, including the construction and services sectors.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a disgrace.  The razzmatazz and the insult of today will soon be over but the real lives and real people will remain, including hospital patients on trolleys, 34 of them in Letterkenny General Hospital.  The Minister of State should tell them and their relatives it was a good budget, as they sit in the coffee dock.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Elective surgery has been cancelled.  Patients have had procedures cancelled.  The Minister of State should tell them it was a good budget.  I will not.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Government ask the people?  Will it go to the country?  Will it hold an election?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ten years too late.  Tell that to the people of Roscommon.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about the farmers of north Leitrim?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He was not here to listen to the debate.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is because we are building houses. One would think someone as smart as Senator Ross would know that.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Of course it is.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The only party that is suggesting an increase in the rate of corporation tax is Sinn Féin.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The people will decide that.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He has nothing substantial to say.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State should get him a membership card.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator is blindfolded.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Transport 22 will be coming along shortly.
