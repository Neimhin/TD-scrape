JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I stand with my colleagues who have highlighted the serious situation caused by the outcome of a court case involving a 41 year old man who raped a 12 year old girl. The outcome of the case has sent shockwaves throughout the country, particularly among people who are personally involved in cases which are due to be brought to the High Court. We have to unite to face our collective responsibility on this issue.In respect of cancer services, yesterday the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, visited Letterkenny and elsewhere in County Donegal. I welcome her presence in the county, to which I have invited her numerous times. From a personal perspective, I acknowledge she was quite empathetic towards the needs and plight of people from County Donegal. She also provided a good listening service yesterday, of which the staff were appreciative.A Cabinet meeting will be held on 9 June. Although Members always pin ultimate responsibility on the Minister for Health and Children and at times can be quite critical because it is such an emotive and important issue, the Cabinet has collective responsibility. I urge the Leader, who has taken a great personal interest in the general provision of cancer services, to use her good offices to emphasise and highlight the importance and need for radiotherapy services for the north west.While radiotherapy services exist in Dublin, Cork and Galway and are due to be provided in Limerick and Waterford, the north west still awaits such services. This issue must be expedited. This matter is extremely important because I want to retain current levels of services, which will only be possible with a satellite radiation facility in the north west. Specifically, this should be located in Letterkenny, which is the pivotal point at which to work in collaboration with Sligo General Hospital and Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House. I will start on the point on which my colleague across the House, Senator Kitt, finished, the amount of money that has been blown on strategies, plans and visions for the west. We can discuss that all day, but I will highlight the only figure outstanding, the €3.65 billion underspend. That has already been put on the record by colleagues, and we are all aware of it through the media. People have been shouting that it has not been spent.It is not good enough for those of us with western and north-western accents to say that we did not get our lot, justifying it by shouting. We must examine the matter logically from a national perspective, since we must start in the east of the country before we find a solution to the problems of the west. The east has its own problems of congestion and the mass inward movement of people from the west who must seek work in the large urban centres around the Pale.I will provide an example, which is not anecdotal, since empirical evidence supports it. There is a mass movement of people from the Inishowen peninsula to counties Louth, Meath and Dublin between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. on a Monday. I was in a small place called Culdaff last night, where I spoke to the parents of a 19 year old. They told me that their son left at 4 a.m. on a Monday to head to the building sites of Meath for work. He is one of many in Inishowen, and across County Donegal and the west, who head off on a Monday morning to seek employment on the east coast.That is where the problem lies. There is an excessive pull factor on the east coast and in Dublin. There is a constant drain of people from the west and north west of the country. The east has its own problems of success based on investment. There are problems associated with success, but the west has problems associated with successive failures to invest. The east's problems are associated with overinvestment, since too many resources have been put into one area.My fundamental premise is that the solution to the west's problems lies in addressing the problems of the east coast. Let us formulate a plan to move people back. It would be apt to raise decentralisation, given the Minister of State's presence. We are all aware of the technical problems of moving public and civil servants. Why not consider a decentralisation plan for those who wish to move out of the Pale, including people from Culdaff in north Inishowen who do not want to drive to a building site in County Meath on a Monday morning? Let us start generating a haven of investment for peripheral areas. The only way that we can do so is by investing in access infrastructure such as the N2-A5 route from Dublin through Strabane and into the north west.We still do not have 100% roll-out of broadband in this country, something promised in 2002. In the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats programme for Government, it was promised that there would be 100% Internet access through proper and adequate broadband infrastructure. That has not yet happened, although I acknowledge that many companies are involved in the project. North West Electronics is rolling out wireless broadband, considering the needs of the various communities. It is a very good scheme, but it is not going to everyone on the west coast.If we do not have 100% roll-out of broadband, we are at a disadvantage compared with Northern Ireland, which has the maximum 100% roll-out. Derry, some 20 miles from Letterkenny, has a comparative advantage in attracting inward investment. The region has Derry City Airport, 100% broadband penetration and good access from the main port and international airport at Belfast. Donegal does not have those advantages, since there is no 100% roll-out of broadband, and there are technical, movement and communication difficulties from Dublin, along the N2 and up through the A5. One need only sit in traffic during the day to see that.I drove down today from Letterkenny, taking the guts of five and a half hours to travel 167 km. That sort of travelling time is not on if we wish to spread resources or attract companies into counties such as Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim and Sligo. If I leave Letterkenny at 11 p.m., it can take me just over three hours. That two-hour differential is not good enough and it does not give us a competitive edge or advantage when it comes to attracting inward investment.The national spatial strategy is like a football team. Some teams, such as England, look good on paper, but I would not wager too much on it winning the World Cup. Perhaps it will but that is neither here nor there. On paper, Ireland is a great country. We have spatial strategies, and Letterkenny has gateway status. We are examining linear paths and connections and considering Derry as a gateway city for the north west. On paper our plan is impressive, but there is no connectivity or coherent policy on how we move forward.Six years ago, the then Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, spoke of flagship tourism projects for the BMW region. It was said at the time that there would be three, four or perhaps five flagship tourism projects for the north west. Like other aspirations, that did not happen. There was also talk of a necklace of marinas along the west coast, up into Donegal and around Inishowen into the Foyle estuary. That did not happen either, and we have still received no Government funding for marinas in County Donegal.We have great plans, visions and aspirations on paper, but we will not realise them until we tackle the fundamentals. For Donegal and the north-west coast, that means proper access and bypasses rather than throughpasses. Two-in-one lanes suffice to an extent, but we must think bigger when it comes to access. If there are plans for motorways between Dublin and Galway, Limerick, Cork and Belfast with proper access, why is none planned from Dublin to the north-west coast?Those fundamentals must be addressed, and let us focus on them when deciding the 2007 to 2013 plan. We must consider the story of the chicken and the egg. Investment will not come to a place such as Donegal if we do not first focus on the fundamentals. We need proper access and broadband infrastructure. There is no reason in 2006, with a commitment given, that we should not have 100% broadband access in a county such as Donegal. There are wireless and ADSL solutions in urban centres, and there is no reason the Government cannot consider satellite options in areas where wireless is unsuitable. These are ideas suggested by communities. If the Minister of State visits Milford in Donegal he will find a community that developed a wireless broadband solution for their area known as "Broadband for the Hills" with Government support. However, there are other areas of Donegal that need intervention from the Department of Finance in order to bring solutions for broadband infrastructure in the west.I have a message for the Minister. The west can offer solutions to east coast problems. This is not about the west crying or seeking what it considers it deserves. That is not the argument. The west can help to draw in people with skills. Only last week a commercial photographer moved to a rural area of Donegal from Dublin because he has a wireless solution. His wife deals with Government contracts for Bord Bia and she has moved because she now has solutions in terms of infrastructure. Let us look at this issue pragmatically and logically and move people away from the east coast, thus providing a solution to the difficulties encountered in both the east and the west.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are not here to defend themselves, this is not appropriate.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What has it to do with investment in the BMW region?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He spoke the truth regarding his own constituency.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When will the announcement be made?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley to the House. I look forward to hearing his reply to this matter. He is fairly up to date on developments in this area and is knowledgeable on this matter.I have met a number of parents in my county in the past six months or so and as a result I have begun to learn what it is like to have Asperger's syndrome. A group of parents in County Donegal meet and are interested in developing support mechanisms for children and adults with Asperger's syndrome. This is a condition with which I have become familiar and about which I have learned a great deal in the past six months. One aspect I have learned is that people with Asperger's syndrome are talented, highly skilled and intelligent.One outlet for people with Asperger's syndrome to show their talents and their worth is a HSE sponsored project in Letterkenny, Create A Link, which uses art therapy. The Minister of State is probably familiar with this project in his constituency. It has been a phenomenal success. It has shown that people with Asperger's syndrome can progress in their career paths and personal development.Even though the HSE is involved in this project, it is my firm belief that people with Asperger's Syndrome should not be treated in a medical or health context, rather the focus should be on their educational needs and how they can develop a progressive career paths and work towards living independently in their own environments.From the contact I have had with many of the parents, they find there is limited support for young adults with Asperger's syndrome once they reach the age of 18 years. We should focus on that area, perhaps in terms of education support and in conjunction with working with the HSE. The parents highlighted the need for provision for independent living within a supported housing environment. We should also focus on that area. We should make provision to ensure that people with Asperger's syndrome can retain their independence and autonomy. Some people with Asperger's syndrome would require a personal assistant support system and others would like a provision whereby they would work together in a group fashion within a supported housing environment. This is an area that needs to be addressed.I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply. Provision for people with any condition, be it autism, Asperger's syndrome or dyslexia, can be addressed if the proper resources and facilities are put in place. People are different and all have different levels of intelligence and ability. A person with Asperger's syndrome is not necessarily any less or more intelligent than anybody else. They have their specific needs and it is important we invest the necessary resources to help them develop.The Create A Link project in Letterkeny explores art therapy and enables those participating in it to express themselves in a communal setting with their peers. We also need to examine the provision of supported housing to enable these people to retain their independence and pursue their career paths and personal development. We are all different and equal, and it is important we put the proper facilities and mechanisms in place to help people with Asperger's syndrome to pursue their personal development.What is required is probably the establishment of a pilot scheme involving the parents and working closely with the HSE. Good work is being done sporadically in pockets in different places. We need to examine best practice in regard to how we can move this model forward.
