JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Today we will hear from a number of groups on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. We will meet first with representatives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU. I welcome Mr. Eugene McGlone, president of the congress, Ms Patricia McKeown, past president and member of the executive council of the congress, and Mr. Jack O'Connor, general president of SIPTU and member of the executive council of ICTU. Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee. However, if they are directed by the committee to cease to make remarks on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks. They are directed that only comments and evidence related directly to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call on Mr. Eugene McGlone to proceed with his opening statement. We will have contributions from the three witnesses and then open the meeting to members for questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms McKeown.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I propose to call Mark Durkan, MP, Deputy Joe O'Reilly, Deputy Sean Crowe and Michelle Gildernew, MP.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Gildernew. We are under a bit of pressure because our members got carried away with their questions, so it is a bit rich of me to ask the witnesses to be brief. Could I ask them to be conscious of the time but not to cut short their answers?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. O'Connor and the other members of the delegation for their thought-provoking contributions. We understand their loud sense of frustration. Perhaps I would differ in so far as I would not share the sense that things have not progressed in the past 15 years. Although obvious challenges are being faced at the moment, a great deal of movement has been made in Northern Ireland in the last 15 years. The bill of rights issue is dominating our radar. The commission that was established by the UK Government could not reach consensus on a pan-British basis for Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland. There was a sense from the commission that a bill of rights for Northern Ireland needs to operate as a distinct entity. While I take Mr. O'Connor's point about the extent to which one can be committed to something, I emphasise that the Irish Government is committed to this. Obviously, there is a need to evaluate that commitment continually. I will use my office to ensure the Taoiseach knows we have had this meeting when he meets David Cameron on 11 March. Formal correspondence on this matter will be issued on foot of today's meeting. I have listened to various contributions. Paul Maskey made the point that there are other voices out there. This committee tries to act as an honest broker. When there are divergent views, as in this case, it might be helpful to hear them. Deputy Crowe mentioned that he is baffled about why this issue is not being resolved. We need to hear divergent views. Our committee will try to assist by pursuing this issue as an honest broker. We are committed to it. It is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement. We appreciate the contributions that have been made today.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegates again.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will continue our discussion on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. I welcome the following: Ms Adrienne Reilly, protection of rights co-ordinator at the Committee on the Administration of Justice; Ms Sara Boyce, policy co-ordinator on employability at Include Youth; and Ms Helen Flynn, campaigns and membership officer at the Human Rights Consortium. As they were in the Visitors Gallery during the previous session, with their agreement, I do not propose to read the note on privilege again. I call on Ms Flynn to make the opening presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	To clarify, Mr. Durkan was not expressing that sentiment.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That was certainly helpful.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does anyone else have any further comments?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There were a few invaluable proposals made today. The one that stands out is for us to spend time with the groups and if we can do that, we will. We are always delighted to go up North. Indeed, we just decided in private session today that we will go up North again shortly. We would be willing to do that and meet groups from within loyalism and nationalism. We are trying to be the honest broker here and to facilitate the debate. If there are divergent views, we need to hear them all and hopefully we can do that. Regarding where we are at, we are 15 years into the Good Friday Agreement and we are still asking the question as to how to move the process forward. We must start by finding out where we are at now. The UK Government, as recently as this year, said that it cannot achieve consensus on a pan-UK basis. We must find out where we are at now. The UK Government recognises the distinctive role for the Northern Ireland Government in looking at this issue in a distinctive fashion. We need to open the channels of conversation between Westminster and Dublin. As I said earlier, the Irish Government is committed to a Northern Ireland bill of rights and this committee can use its influence to help that conversation to progress. Deputy Crowe mentioned that we do not know if it will be on the agenda for the meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister but we can certainly request that it would be. Indeed, we would be delighted to do that.  We wish the witnesses well with their work. We will seek their counsel and advice on reaching out to different groups, given that they represent an umbrella group for more than 200 organisations. They have met them all and have worked tirelessly at a grassroots level and maybe the political needs to mix with the civil level more in Northern Ireland.
