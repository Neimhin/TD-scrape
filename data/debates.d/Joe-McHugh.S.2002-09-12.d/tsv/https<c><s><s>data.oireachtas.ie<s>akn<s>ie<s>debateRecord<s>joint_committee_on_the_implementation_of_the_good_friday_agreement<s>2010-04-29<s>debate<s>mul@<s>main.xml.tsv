JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to be associated with the warm welcome to the delegation from both organisations.  It is very appropriate and opportune to have them in attendance.Unfortunately, the significant contribution by the first speaker can be seen as negative in that our only cross-Border rail link predates the Good Friday Agreement.  That is not a good news story because although that agreement came into being 12 years ago, as yet we have nothing more symbolic than extra timetables, refurbishments and procurement.  I do not take away from the work in progress on the Belfast-Dublin link but this is an indictment of the lack of progress on cross-Border connectivity after 12 years.We owe more to people on both sides of the Border who, as a democratic majority, bought into the Good Friday Agreement.  They believed there would be proper integrated transport strategies because that is one of the elements underpinning the Good Friday Agreement.  Others included cross-Border measures in education and health.  It is happening and people are communicating, but in terms of transport, people need to see the tangibles.Opportunities have been missed.  I do not believe the argument of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, that such work is not part of policy or that we should not have a further vision or strategy, for example, by connecting the fourth largest city on the island, namely, Derry, to the national rail network.  It is a dereliction of democratic duty because the underpinning of the Good Friday Agreement is for integrated strategy.  This is where we, as democratically elected representatives, must rise to the mark and the challenge.  There are challenges.  There are policies in Northern Ireland where the glove does not necessarily fit the policies of southern Ireland.  We must rise to that challenge in terms of the Good Friday Agreement and try to tie up the ends.I offer the example of Midleton.  This summer will see the opening of the great train service from Midleton to Cork city.  Midleton has a population of 16,000 to 20,000, the same size as Letterkenny.  Derry is the fourth largest city on the island.  Cork is the second largest.  Why are we not looking at the possibility of linking the fourth largest city of the island to a population centre similar to Midleton?  There are question marks here and some sort of blockage.  Something is preventing joined-up thinking in transport, even though the Good Friday Agreement is on the table and which says we voted for such joined-up thinking.At the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, chaired by Deputy Blaney, Scottish, Welsh, English, Northern Irish and Republic of Ireland politicians of all parties passed a motion stating the necessity of looking at the feasibility of having all-island rail connectivity as a priority.  Where does that democratic voice tie into Northern and Southern policy?  That is another problem we have.There was mention of a population of 8 million in Ireland in 2030.  Nonsense is spoken by so-called educated people — lecturers — who say that all these people will live on the east coast.  All the people who live on the east coast will provide for all the infrastructure to be built there and will live there in consequence.  That will happen if we keep following the problems with the money and we say that, for 2030, the projection is that 8 million people will live on the east coast of this island.  Of course they will live on the east coast if we electrify the Belfast-Dublin line, continue to invest European money in the Belfast-Cork link and spend sums, such as the €10 million that came from the TEN-T project in Europe and was spent on the Inchicore feasibility study, under the heading of cross-Border funding.  It is the case that cross-Border funding was spent in Dublin on the pretence that it was linking Cork to Belfast.  I do not accept that and have raised the issue.Some 500,000 people live in the five counties not serviced by rail, as Deputy Ó Caoláin pointed out.  We have heard the argument of the Iarnród Éireann spokesperson, Barry Kenny, who says it is not economically feasible to link them.  That argument is nonsense and, as politicians, we should not accept it.  The two good people present today are voicing policy.  They are the messengers and I am not in the business of shooting messengers.My message is for the parliamentarians in power on both sides of the Border to see sense and do one thing.  They should not build rail infrastructure just because it is in their own back yard but should consider feasibility for once and see whether linkage is possible.  If it is not possible or proves to be a worthless exercise, I shall accept that but let us try first to put together a cost-benefit analysis.  There are 1.9 million people living in Northern Ireland and, without duplication, 500,000 people living in the five Southern counties not serviced by rail, yet linking that number of people is deemed not to be economically viable.  I do not accept that.The blockage exists and it is for us to challenge it, under the direction of the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  His was a strong voice on the motion I tabled at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly regarding tying in the western rail corridor.  Great work has been done by the campaigning group for the western rail corridor to bring rail to Athenry, where it now stands.  Those people want to bring the line first to Claremorris and then to Sligo.  They are now talking to their Northern counterparts.  There will be a consistent campaign and it will deliver rail.  We must also be realistic.  It will not happen today or tomorrow.  It might be a 20-year plan but let us get the homework done and let us not neglect the region west of the Bann which has been neglected on both sides of the Border for a great number of years and since long before I was born.
