JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In welcoming Senator Minihan to this side of the House, I confuse matters further by complimenting the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, on his proactive work in the area of mental health. We must engage in ongoing debate on mental health. There is a correlation between the high level of mental ill-health and the lack of consultants and psychologists. Many consultants and psychologists work in affluent areas. While I welcome the Leader's positive attitude to the organisation of a debate on suicide, there is a broad range of mental health issues it is important to discuss. I welcome the call for a debate on the Iraqi war, which is very serious. The visit of Tony Blair to Washington today proves that he is panicking because he is worried about the post-war plans of President Bush.
