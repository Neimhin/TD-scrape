JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As it is the height of the tourism season, it is too late to debate the current season but I ask for a general debate on tourism in advance of next year's season. The tourism season in County Donegal is not materialising and we are relying on the Northern Ireland market to keep us going. The hundreds of thousands of euro being pumped into marketing are not working.County Donegal has a quality tourism product on the ground with quality landscapes and scenery. While people speak with goodwill about how great and nice the county is, tourists are not coming. We need an all-Ireland marketing strategy. Fáilte Ireland is the all-Ireland marketing body. Why are tourism figures in Derry, just a few miles across the Border, at an all-time high, when nothing is happening on the Donegal side of the Border? We need a serious debate on the issue.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	County Donegal has an infrastructure deficit as regards marinas. There are quality marinas from Cahirciveen in County Kerry, to Kilrush in County Clare, the Aran Islands in County Galway and up to County Sligo. County Donegal, however, does not have a single marina or marina infrastructure or facilities. This is one aspect of the major debate we need in the House.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the basis that the existing board is an independent and transparent structure, and while I acknowledge that resources could be a problem if there was extra money to disburse, it could have been resourced fairly and squarely, even on a local or regional basis at ADM level. We would have had a more independent and transparent distribution of funding.The board should retain its role in sanctioning and directing the disbursement of funds. The Bill seeks to politicise the allocation of moneys. Nobody can counteract that argument because it will be discussed in the Minister's Department and among his ministerial colleagues and money will be channelled into various worthy ventures. It is likely that some of the money will end up in the disabilities and educational sectors and that it will duplicate mainstream funding. Under the original scheme, groups on the margins would have been given an opportunity to get the money. This is a missed opportunity.While putting in place a dummy board, a man of straw whose only role is to create a facade of independence and fairness, it is crucial that the board retain the right to disburse the funds. That is the reason I tabled the amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have tabled an amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is section 7.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	From what sheet is the Chair operating?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As a newcomer to the Seanad, which one——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is fine.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The board will be appointed by the Minister. Its members need not be involved in the community sector.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not say that but the Minister is not obliged to appoint people from the community and voluntary sector to the board.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 3:
In page 5, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:"(a) notwithstanding any other provision of this enactment, to provide final sanction for the disbursement of moneys if satisfied that such disbursement is within the policies and principles of this Act and the Principal Act,”.This amendment is in a similar vein. At the outset of the Minister's tenure in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, he talked a fine talk about maintaining and sustaining rural communities and services, ensuring that they remain vibrant and funding communities in CLÁR programme areas. He talked about broadband and other great ideas, but he missed a golden opportunity by failing to stick with the existing board which was working.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are talking about transparency. The Minister missed an opportunity to stick with the existing board and it is politicised now whether we like it or not. Senator Ryan is satisfied that the Minister is moving on his amendment but I am not because the €220 million will be gobbled up by Departments and will enter mainstream funding. Small community and voluntary groups working with people with disabilities will miss out. The board should retain its role in sanctioning and directing the disbursement of funds.This Bill politicises the allocation of moneys while putting in place a board of straw the only role of which is to create a facade of independence and fairness. It is crucial that the board retains the right to disburse the funds.The Minister said earlier that he is damned if he does and damned if he does not. Will he give the money to the Ministers who will take it from those involved in the community sector by asking people in the community to contribute towards their own projects? The Area Development Management Limited and Combat Poverty Agency did not do that, they had highly competent people distributing millions of euro through the peace and reconciliation programme without politicising allocation. That was the mechanism the Minister should have used. He missed a golden opportunity and that is why I have tabled this amendment.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for being open in his response. The issue of transparency is important in this matter. It is important to instil confidence in the process. I suggest the peace and reconciliation programme could be part of the template as it involved different measures and a process for application. The group which is not in a position to fill out a competent application should be given direction. There are county enterprise boards, Leader groups and county development boards which have people working in the bureaucratic machine. I suggest they could facilitate many of the groups.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 5, to delete lines 30 to 35 and substitute the following:"32.—(1) The Board shall consist of a chairperson and 10 ordinary members appointed by the Minister and shall include——(a) an officer of the Minister not below the rank of principal officer,(b) a person who, in the Minister’s opinion, represents the interests of the financial services industry,(c) 4 persons who——(i) in the Minister's opinion, have knowledge of, or experience in relation to, the purposes for which disbursements may be made, and(ii) are appointed by the Minister after consultation with the organisations that the Minister considers to be representative of the purposes so specified,and(d) 4 persons who, in the Minister’s opinion, have knowledge of, or experience relating to any other matters that appear to the Minister to be relevant to the Board’s functions.”.It must be a condition that at least four members of the community and voluntary sector are appointed to the board. This matter should not be discretionary but the question of how it is done is a matter for another day. It is essential that the community and voluntary sector is involved in the board because it is involved in the areas in which the money will be distributed and consists of competent people.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does the Minister accept the amendment?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State's comments and look forward to hearing the result of his deliberations.
