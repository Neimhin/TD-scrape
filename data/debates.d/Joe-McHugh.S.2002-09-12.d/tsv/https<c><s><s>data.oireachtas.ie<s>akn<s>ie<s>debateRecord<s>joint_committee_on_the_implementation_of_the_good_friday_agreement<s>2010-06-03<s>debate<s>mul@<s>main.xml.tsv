JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the members of the delegation.  I thank them for their ongoing positive and constructive work.  I would like to make a few observations.  It has been a difficult session this morning.  It has been a bit disparate, to say the least.  We do not know who said what, or when they said it.  I hope I am not going over old ground.  I will keep it brief.  I caught the tail end of Deputy Blaney's contribution on radiotherapy services.  Are we on time for 2015?In relation to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, there is an issue in a county like Donegal.  There has been a low take-up compared to other counties in Ireland.  The fund was a natural model, in terms of what CAWT is trying to do.  I refer to the provision of services in Ballykelly, for example.  Do the delegates have an opinion on the reason for the low take-up of the services provided by the National Treatment Purchase Fund?On the HSE model, a colleague from Culdaff, with whom Mr. Daly and Senator Keaveney will be familiar, is on the board of HSE west.  He has argued that driving to Galway, which is in the Chairman's constituency, to discuss the city's water quality does not make sense.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is the Chairman referring to Culdaff or Galway?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In that respect, the CAWT model is more relevant than the HSE model in terms of membership.  Is there a drive to have this model mainstreamed, North and South, rather than having a vast geographical spread?On citizenship for people with disability, is CAWT in a position to pressure the Administrations, North and South, to meet their quota requirement for work placement for people with disabilities?  I understand the quota in this jurisdiction is approximately 4%.Letterkenny General Hospital requires an endocrinologist.  CAWT is examining the issue of providing different acute services to serve the needs of the two jurisdictions.  Is it planned to employ an endocrinologist at Letterkenny General Hospital, perhaps through a shared relationship with Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry?  We hear a great deal about cross-Border plans.  This type of model will work and we must drive this agenda.  I hope it will meet our needs in the north-west.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Could we move into private session?
