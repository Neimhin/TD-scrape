JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Tá áthas orm bheith i gcomhluadar an Chathaoirligh agus baill an choiste chun Meastúcháin Breise teicniúla i gcóir Vóta 28 don Roinn Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála a phlé. I am pleased to be here this afternoon for the committee's consideration of a technical Supplementary Estimate in 2016 for Vote 28 for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. As members are aware, a technical or token Supplementary Estimate does not involve additional Exchequer funding for the Vote, other than a very small technical increase of €1,000. This is because corresponding savings or, in our case, corresponding additional fee income, fully covers the additional expenditure required. Earlier this week, on 22 November, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform moved a motion in the Dáil seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate of €1,000 for the Department and the approval to move excess income from appropriations-in-aid to fund increased expenditure on international contributions and on the Passport Service. The Department is seeking an increase of €5.001 million, which is offset by additional passport fee income of €5 million resulting, as already stated, in a net technical or token increase of €1,000. The increased expenditure is being sought for Ireland's increased mandatory contributions to several international organisations - mainly the United Nations, UN, but also to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD - and for increased operational costs relating to the Passport Service due to an exceptional increase in demand of 10% in 2016 compared to 2015. These increases are fully offset by additional passport fee income of €5 million. The international contributions in question are Ireland's contributions to the organisations outlined, not just those of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but across all Departments which interact daily with, and benefit from, Ireland's membership of these valuable organisations. The mandatory contributions of Ireland and all other member states of international organisations are based on scales of assessments and these can vary. The first purpose for which additional expenditure will be incurred this year relates to the Passport Service, which has experienced an exceptional increase in demand of an extra 10% applications this year compared with 2015. Last year, just over 680,000 passport applications were received and this is expected to grow to over 740,000 this year. There was a strong underlying increase in demand for passports in the first half of the year. Indications are that this will be further affected by the UK referendum on EU membership. From July to October this year, applications from Northern Ireland increased by approximately 70% compared to the same period last year, while applications from Great Britain have almost doubled. A significant proportion of the operational costs of the Passport Service are demand-driven and directly correlate to the level of applications. Consequently, the significant increase in demand has led to a proportionate increase in operational costs, particularly for passport books, postage, the printing of application forms as well as for additional temporary clerical officers and overtime. The relocation to Mount Street in the early part of the year resulted in increased challenges to maintain passport delivery within expected timeframes. I am proud that the Passport Service was recently, in the customer experience, CXi, survey, ranked number one in the Irish public sector. This survey confirms that the Passport Service delivers very strongly in facilitating travel for citizens, sometimes in urgent circumstances, and in ensuring that applicants are properly advised about their passport entitlements. I congratulate and thank the staff of the Passport Service for their commitment to delivering a friendly and efficient service. Gabhaim comhghairdeas agus buíochas le foireann Sheirbhís na bPasanna. The largest source of increased expenditure relates to Ireland's international contributions, accounting for some €4.2 million of the additional €5 million on which the Supplementary Estimate is based. The largest element of this, Ireland's payments to the UN, consists of mandatory contributions to the UN regular budget, UN peacekeeping budget and UN tribunals which accounts for some €3.3 million of the additional funding included in the Supplementary Estimate. UN member states' contributions are based on a formula, called the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals. In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for the 2016-2018 period, with Ireland's rate set at 0.335%. The challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is not easy. The budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity around the world. This is influenced both by the number of conflicts, as well as the size and complexity of the UN operations which the Security Council decides to put on the ground. It is difficult to estimate this in advance, as an existing peacekeeping operation might be increased or decreased, depending on the circumstances, or a new one might be established. Also, and this was the case for 2016, the timing of the bills for peacekeeping can cause problems in estimating costs. Normally, the majority of peacekeeping payments fall due in July at the beginning of the peacekeeping budget cycle. However, for technical reasons, every three years these bills are split between July and January. As a result, this year several payments that would ordinarily have been paid in full in July 2015 were split between July 2015 and January 2016. As a result assessments payable by all member states, including Ireland, in January 2016 were higher than usual. As regards the OSCE, we require an additional €450,000. The amount provided for in the Revised 2016 Estimates was €1.168 million. The amount spent in 2016 will be €1.619 million. The shortfall is due to the fact that the provision in the revised Estimates was insufficient. The amount spent in 2016 covers both Ireland's contribution to the OSCE unified budget, €1.070 million, and its contribution to the special monitoring mission in Ukraine, €550,000. Both these contributions are mandatory and arise from Ireland's participation in the OSCE, which is integral to long-standing Irish foreign policy goals of supporting human rights and the rule of law. The special monitoring mission in Ukraine plays a vital role in monitoring the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements. The final international contribution which was under-provided for in the 2016 Revised Estimates was a shortfall of €440,000 in Ireland's contribution to the OECD. The amount allocated in the Revised Estimates for 2016 was €2.26 million but the total amount to be paid to the OECD in 2016 will be €2.70 million. Member countries' contributions to the OECD are determined in part on the basis of the relative size of their economies and are thus affected by economic growth. The shortfall arises due to a combination of growth in the Irish economy and an underestimation of the likely final allocation. I trust that my remarks have clarified the purpose for which the Department is seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate but, of course, I will seek to answer any questions committee members may have. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gcoiste as ucht teacht isteach um thrathnóna agus an deis a thabhairt dom na ceisteanna seo a phlé.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Grealish for his remarks. I concur with him on the level of efficiency and professionalism among the staff of the Passport Office in cases where, for example, someone is under pressure to obtain a passport in order to travel to a job interview or to university or for more personal or challenging reasons relating to a bereavement. I agree with the Deputy not just on the level of efficiency of the staff but also in the context of the empathy they show. The Deputy will be aware that a major part of the passport process happens in his county at HID Global. I had the opportunity to visit that company's plant in the Gaeltacht community and it has been providing the physical product. Deputy Grealish was being very modest by not mentioning the company in question. I appreciate that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the increase in the number of applications for Irish passports and to tie-in with Deputy McLoughlin's point about the statistical impact of Brexit, there has been a 70% increase in the number of applications from people in Northern Ireland. However, I assure Deputy Grealish that all passport applications are carefully vetted. Deputy Grealish also mentioned the recent election in the United States. We do not have statistics which might indicate whether there is a trend in applications. However, there has been an increase in inquiries since the American election. I have some figures for New York. The figure for 2015 was 5,984 and that for 2016 was 6,209. On the west coast, the figure for San Francisco for 2015 was 3,660 and this rose to 3,849 to date in 2016. There is an increase but it does not coincide.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have visited the consulate office in Edinburgh, the embassy in London and the consulates in Boston and San Francisco. The staff there do great work. They have to give advice in respect of that to which people are entitled. It is a very good service. I agree that the Irish Army members serving in Lebanon are doing great work. One in three, more than 30% of the population in Lebanon, are people with refugee status. That says a great deal for Lebanon as a country
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are from all over. I do not want to be parochial either but I had the opportunity to meet young lads from Ramelton in my county at a ceremony. They are doing great work. In response to Deputy McLoughlin's question on Brexit, from my time spent in Edinburgh and Glasgow a few weeks ago, I am aware that business carries on and there was great positivity regarding Irish and Scottish business working together at that event. We are looking at increases in respect of inquires about passports and also passport applications. We have a very dedicated sub-committee at Cabinet level, headed by the Taoiseach which held its fourth meeting this morning. There are significant proactive actions we can take in light of the Brexit result. There are lots of positives such as, for example, the business-to-business engagement between the UK and Ireland. I know that at a symbolic political level, whether it was the Queen's visit or the President's visit to the United Kingdom, the language around relationships has never been stronger. On the ground, one can see the incredible synergies between businesses on an UK-Ireland basis and companies feeding into the supply chain in Scotland. There is an infrastructure of which we must be conscious. I acknowledge the work of Enterprise Ireland, which held a very successful trade mission in Edinburgh recently. At a political and a State agency level, we must be as proactive as possible, whether it is in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales or England.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To take Deputy Barrett first, I acknowledge the service and agree with him about it. The entitlement to a passport is based on citizenship in the first instance and determined by law. There are two automatic categories. If one is born in Ireland or one's parents were born here, that is automatic. Then, one has the grandparent facility, but that is after registration. As such, there is a registration process. Then, there is naturalisation and we have many new citizens in the State as a result of that process. The Deputy is right about having that information available on the Passport Office website. I am sure it is readily available. If there is anything specific that would be of benefit to the Deputy, we will organise its provision. One of the officials showed me a passport card today. It is useful and it prompted me to apply for one. I admit I do not have one. It will get one around Europe and is handy because it can be kept in one's wallet. Obviously, one needs a passport to get the passport card. If Deputy Barrett does not have one either, we could jointly apply. He talked about the role of our missions. He is absolutely right that, big or small, they are doing a phenomenal job internationally. I can see that the roles are changing and that they are adapting to new challenges and ways of communicating. The best example of a person using social media is Mr. Dan Mulhall in London who one sees tweeting most days. In the smaller embassies such as the one in Edinburgh, there is a greater capacity to engage with community. It is very bottom up and when one speaks to members of the Irish community or those who have an affinity for Ireland within the Scottish community itself, they talk about the great work that goes on at grassroots level. I mentioned empathy earlier. The high profile example was Mr. Philip Grant in San Francisco and the work he did during the Berkeley tragedy. At the time, it was a very personal thing for him in his role. I received feedback on that from meeting different people out there and he has had an ongoing engagement. It is the follow-through that is very significant. He is still doing work and different aspects of legislation in California are being looked at. He is still in touch with all the families. That empathy and investment in humanity that all our ambassadors and consuls general demonstrate all over the world is something into which I have been given a bit of an insight. I note the work of Mr. Dónal Cronin in Uganda and I will be meeting with Dr. Vincent O'Neill in Kenya next week where Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will be joining me. The work Mr. O'Neill's team has done in advance of our visit next week has been going on for months and then there will be the work of following that visit up. Where Government needs to raise the bar is in terms of our strategic approach internationally, whether sourcing investment or otherwise. That is a message for myself and our political colleagues. It is in the follow-through. Embassies and missions can only do so much as their resources are limited. A whole-of-Government approach to using our State agencies better, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, is needed. We have to look at a more strategic approach. The Department of Foreign Affairs is already initiating that. At the moment, it is working on an Asia strategy and last week it was working on an American strategy. It is not just about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; there has to be a whole-of-Government buy-in across Departments. That will bode well for the future. Deputy Barrett also mentioned Ukraine and our work there. Ireland makes an assessed contribution to the monitoring mission in Ukraine, which is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Minsk agreement. This is also a mandatory contribution arising from our participation in the OSCE. We are providing a monitoring role. I acknowledge Deputy Barrett's comments on the challenges out there. Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a series of questions. If I leave anything specific out or I fail to get back to her, the officials will follow up on some of her observations. She mentioned the reduction and asked what was missing in relation to the assessment and the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals. In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for 2016 to 2018 with Ireland's rate being set at 0.335%, which was down from 0.418%. The reduced rate is the result of Ireland's depressed economic performance over the preceding years. Deputy Chambers was correct to say it was measured against our economic performance. I acknowledge her point that, even during the years which were difficult economically and otherwise, we continued to face our international challenges in a proactive way in relation to our work with different organisations as well as financially. The taxpayer should be constantly reminded of the figure. When I set it out, people are often startled. From 2011 to this year's budget, the Irish taxpayer contributed €4.5 billion in contributions to overseas aid. Notwithstanding the fact that since 2008, some €28 billion came out of the economy and that a great many hard and difficult measures were taken, as the Deputy said herself, the Irish taxpayer still contributed €4.5 billion. It is a phenomenal contribution. While there are still challenges about getting to the 0.7% target, we can work better in terms of that strategic approach. We should not simply be waiting for the next budget to come along to see if there will be an increase or decrease and, if so, how much it will be. Rather, we should be a bit more ruthless in relation to the 0.7% target and set out a five-year plan. The committee has been working on and made proposals around this and it is important that we are clear about trying to provide a continuum towards the objective of reaching the 0.7% target. On the other hand, as the economy improves the percentage decreases, but that does not make up for the fact that we need to get up to a different place. I was asked about UN missions. We are in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Ivory Coast and Cyprus. Deputy Barrett asked if we were in Ukraine, but these are the ones we are in at the minute. A few issues were raised about scale and Deputy Chambers asked how we estimate our contributions. It is difficult. It is a best-guess scenario because everything changes so quickly. I mentioned in the Dáil yesterday some of the figures we got from the International Committee of the Red Cross this week. To take the example of Chad, 9 million people are displaced from that country at the moment, the majority of whom have refugee status in Somalia and Ethiopia. In the context of a total global displacement figure of 65 million, 9 million are from one country alone. In Italy, 25% of refugees are from Eritrea, from which country 5,000 people leave per month. One is looking at the scale of movement and displacement of people and everything is changing. The challenge is absolutely enormous. I would like to acknowledge all of those involved in peacekeeping missions as well as Irish Aid, whose personnel I have got to know very well and with which some of the Deputies here have worked very closely over the years.It is doing great work in terms of rising to the challenge. The responsibility on the EU and UN is massive. The world is changing by the day. We need to also focus on the positives, including the hosting by Uganda, despite its own challenges, of 500,000 people in temporary refugee status. We can draw inspiration from what is being done in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Uganda. While there are positives, the reality is that the challenges are enormous.  In regard to how we estimate our contributions, that is done on a best guess analysis.  My officials will communicate with Deputy Lisa Chambers on any of the questions to which I have not responded. On the OECD, the budget submission was based on the estimated balance of the 2016 contribution and advances on assessed contribution for 2017.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have no problem doing that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Additional staff have been recruited. While the current staff complement are managing, additional staff are always welcome. I acknowledge the Chairman's reference to the situation in Nigeria, in respect of which I put my views on record yesterday. We will have an opportunity next week to talk about it further.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the committee for this engagement. My officials are happy to be of assistance to it. I congratulate the committee on its work to date and if there are issues on which the Department can do better, we are happy to hear about them.
