JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh an ambasadóir, H.E Mr. Vincent Guérend, agus a chomhghleacaithe go dtí an cruinniú inniú. I welcome the ambassador and his colleagues to this meeting today and look forward to the engagement. Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I am looking at Deputy Harkin there. The train is not on the complex yet. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I would ask members partaking by MS teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the Leinster House campus. I call on the ambassador to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. We are close and many French live in Ireland. I think there are more than 11,500, and more than 8,000 Irish people live in France, so there are good connections there.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have plenty of time but many committee members have indicated a wish to contribute. I encourage members to be more specific and succinct in their contributions and it would be welcome if that were reciprocated.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Guérend can respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Time is running against us. I will ask members to be more specific.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On that specific point, Mr. Guérend might tie this into a general response rather than coming back to me because that might require a wee bit of time. President Macron has made commentary to the effect that a resolution needs to be found without humiliating Russia. Mr. Guérend might keep that in mind when answering, but I am-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay. I will tell you what-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Senator McDowell wish to add anything?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is it okay if the ambassador takes that question before Senator Chambers' slot?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Senator can give out to Senator McDowell afterwards for skipping the queue.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have gone over time but two more members are seeking to contribute. We will take them together after this reply.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an ambasadóir agus leis na finnéithe uilig as a gcuairt ar an gcruinniú inniu. Guím gach rath orthu. I wish the witnesses the very best. We will continue to keep our engagement up close and personal. I would reiterate Deputy Howlin's words. We are always grateful for solidarity, especially that shown during the Brexit situation from 2016 on. We are thankful for that. We will be in touch and will take His Excellency up on his offer of further engagement with our counterpart committee in France.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation and all those in the Gallery, with their different roles and representing various regional authorities and cities. It is great to have them all here. Cuirim fáilte ar son an choiste roimh an uachtarán, Mr. Apostolos Tzitzikostas. He is very welcome. I hope I am pronouncing his name correctly. It is very good to see the head of the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions, Councillor Michael Murphy, and his fellow delegate, Councillor Kate Feeney. They are all very welcome. The European Committee of the Regions has three political priorities: bringing Europe closer to the people; managing fundamental societal transformations; and cohesion, our fundamental value. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative that he or she comply with any such direction. I invite Mr. Tzitzikostas to make his presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank President Tzitzikostas for his presentation, insights and well thought out contribution. I now invite Councillor Michael Murphy, the head of the Irish delegation, to make his opening statement. He is a Tipperary man.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I now invite Ms Feeney to make her opening presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank both Councillor Feeney and Councillor Murphy for their strong message. There was certainly a lot of food for thought for us as a committee.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are a number of speakers. I ask all speakers to be more concise to allow as many people as possible to contribute.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The next speaker is Deputy Ó Murchú, followed by Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will bring in Deputy Haughey at this time.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will bring in Senator Keogan, to be followed by Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before I bring the delegation back in for their final words to sum up, I will break with protocol. I have an indication from the Gallery from Mayor and Councillor, Mr. Pip Breen, to say something. Against my better judgment, I will let him in. Having consulted with his county native here, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who is my Vice Chairman -----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	-----and on the basis that this is going to be the only word from the Gallery, the floor is Councillor Breen's. He is not to be getting us all into bother now.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate that intervention from Mr. Breen. We will now have final words from the three representative councillors
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Councillor Feeney.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee, I thank the president of the Committee of the Regions, Mr. Tzitzikostas, as well as Mr. Murphy and Ms Feeney. Today was much more than just a conversation. It was more than politicians telling one and other how great a job they are doing. A number of challenges came from both sides and that is healthy and refreshing. We will follow up on the matter raised about the sitting of the committee. We always meet in the committee rooms. Formally, we have to meet in the precincts of Leinster House but we may have a conversation in private session about visiting Tipperary, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown or Sligo. Maybe Councillor Blaney will have us in Donegal with his big connections up there. We will leave that decision to the delegates. Members of the committee would be happy to meet them formally or informally. That would be very refreshing. I acknowledge the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alison Gilliland, and all the councillors from the different regions in the Public Gallery, including Councillor Pip Breen for his intervention. There was no shyness from the Wexford man intervening from the Gallery. Ar son an choiste, guím gach rath ar na finnéithe leis an obair thábhachtach seo. Gabhaim buíochas leo as díospóireacht an lae inniu agus as an obair atá déanta acu fosta. Beidh an todhchaí níos difriúla ach beimid le chéile ag obair, agus táimid anseo fá choinne thacaíochta amach anseo fosta.
