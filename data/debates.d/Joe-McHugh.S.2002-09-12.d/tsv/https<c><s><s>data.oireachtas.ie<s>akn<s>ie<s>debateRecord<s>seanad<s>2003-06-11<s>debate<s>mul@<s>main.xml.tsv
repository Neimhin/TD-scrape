JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I want to add my weight to the call for an urgent debate on the open skies policy. I agree with the call by Senators Daly and O'Meara for the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to come to the House urgently because it is important that we discuss this. Regional aviation is an important issue for industrial, economic and social development.
