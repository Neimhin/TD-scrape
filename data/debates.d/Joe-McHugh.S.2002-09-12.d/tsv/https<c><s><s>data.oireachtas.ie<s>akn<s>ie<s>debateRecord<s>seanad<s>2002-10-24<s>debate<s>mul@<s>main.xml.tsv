JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps I am interfering with Seanad protocol, but will the Leader request the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to initiate a debate in the Chamber, which would include our international diaspora, by way of tele-conferencing? I am calling for such a debate in light of the fact that local authority members and Members of the Oireachtas regularly visit Irish communities in America, Australia and elsewhere. We should examine the possibility of economic opportunities, harnessing the Irish diaspora around the world by using electronic methods to link up the participants in such a debate. Tele-conferencing could bring together members of the diaspora from as far apart as Dubai, Australia, Thailand, America, London and other places where Irish communities exist. I am encouraged by the board mindedness of debates in the House and we should promote that as much as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of information, what is the protocol in the Chamber?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, I am referring to electronic link-up.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What about video and electronic link-up?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to the House and I am delighted to speak about the issue of crime. I appreciate the Minister's acknowledgement that the measures he proposes represent the tip of the iceberg in relation to targeted responses to crime. I welcome these reactive measures, however, as they are necessary. A long-term crime strategy should include an examination of the perpetrators of crime. Many criminals do not have a sense of belonging; they do not feel that they belong to a particular group. They do not share an ethos of responsibility and they have become disenfranchised from society through no fault of their own. The fact that they feel they do not belong to a structured group is related to changes in society over recent years.I worked on a youth project in Letterkenny for two years. I met the Minister in Ballybofey recently and I urge him to contact the Garda Síochána in Letterkenny the next time he is in County Donegal to ask for statistics about the Glenwood Park estate. A youth group, funded by a grant from the peace and reconciliation fund, was established to work with young people in the estate when it was known by a different name. I was employed as a youth worker there for two years from 1997. The people of the estate were labelled trouble makers and were seen as being constantly involved in crime. Young people on the estate were viewed as beyond the law and the rigours of society. My task was to establish homework clubs, to involve children in football and other sports, to get parents involved and, generally speaking, to engage the people of the estate in tasks to build up a team spirit. I was there for two years and another youth worker is employed there at present.Having worked with people between the ages of 12 and 15, I am of the opinion that children can become disenfranchised from society if we do not work with them in their early teens. When I was in Letterkenny two nights ago, I saw the group I worked with two years ago, when they were 14 years of age, playing football. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were still playing together. A garda told me at the referendum count last Sunday that crime levels in the estate have decreased. A girl from the estate now attends NUI Maynooth, although I do not claim that her success is as a result of the youth project. We have to look at long-term crime prevention measures. I appreciate that the Minister said that all his initiatives were not mentioned in his speech.The Youth Work Act, 2001, passed by the Oireachtas last year, gives more power to vocational education committees. Questions have to be asked, however, as many of the Act's provisions have yet to be implemented. I beseech the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to use his position of responsibility to ensure that the provisions are implemented without delay. Paid youth workers are needed on the ground as the day of voluntary input has passed, more or less. People will continue to offer their services voluntarily, but structures need to be established in non-formal environments, such as homework clubs and youth organisations. We need paid employees to work with young people on the ground in estates and other urban centres if we are to prevent crime.
