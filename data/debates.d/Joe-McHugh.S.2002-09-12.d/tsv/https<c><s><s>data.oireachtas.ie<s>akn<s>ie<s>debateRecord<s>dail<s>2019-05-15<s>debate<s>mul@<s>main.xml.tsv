JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I am aware of this issue. The issue of increasing insurance premiums is starting to emerge as a problem more frequently in respect of special schools. Regarding St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe, I have found out that it is not even in a position to make instalment payments. It has to be done in one fell swoop. This is a very serious matter. We are working with the State Claims Agency, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER, and with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education to seek a resolution. We are, therefore, taking this issue very seriously. Deputy Naughten met with me regarding insurance costs yesterday and Deputy Eugene Murphy has raised it today regarding St. Teresa's special needs school. As Deputy Durkan has pointed out, however, this is part of a wider issue. If there are ways we can intervene, we will do so. That may be in the manner proposed by Deputy Durkan. I think the timing of the European Commission intervention is significant as well. These rates of increase in insurance premiums, which I am being told about, are unaffordable and we have to do something about it.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A collective effort is being made at political and parental level. I thank Deputy McLoughlin for raising the matter and, noting that there is another Member from the constituency present, update the House to the effect that there will be a meeting tomorrow between officials of my Department and the ETB to ensure there is a firm focus on the long-term viability of the school.
