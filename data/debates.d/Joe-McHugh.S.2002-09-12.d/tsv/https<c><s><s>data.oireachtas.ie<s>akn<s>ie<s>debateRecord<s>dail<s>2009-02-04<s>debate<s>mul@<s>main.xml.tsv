JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On 25 November 2008, I received a reply to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in respect of the Government's commitment to ferry services between Greencastle and McGilligan's Point.  The opening of this ferry connection in 2002 was an important demonstration of the expanding nature of links between the Republic and the North and of the Government's commitment to the north west.  However, that was then and this is now.  The ferry service between McGilligan's Point and Greencastle and that between Buncrana and Rathmullan are in serious jeopardy as a result of funding issues at local authority level.Limavady Borough Council and Donegal County Council initially offered a subvention in respect of these services.  However, as the level of this subvention decreased, the operators were obliged to increase fares.  Consequently, passenger numbers dropped and the ferries may not operate this year.The north west has one opportunity in the summer months to help sustain small businesses in the services and tourism sector and bring money into the Exchequer.  Earlier today the House debated the public finances and from where we are going to obtain money.  A major opportunity exists to allow us to benefit from visits from UK tourists this summer.  Last year alone, 400,000 tourists visited the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim and surveys indicate that people tend to travel from there, through McGilligan's Point, on to Greencastle and then across to Rathmullan via Buncrana.  They visit tourism attractions such as Glenveagh National Park and Doe Castle and places such as Malin Head.  Essentially, they complete the entire historical and cultural tour.We need to retain this product.  This summer will be one of opportunity.  I am trying to be as positive and as constructive as possible because we need to considers ways in which potential might be created.  Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have indicated that tourists from the UK — the Welsh, the Scottish and the English — are going to visit Northern Ireland.  If they do so, we must try to benefit by encouraging them to travel across the Border.  The only way this will happen is via the ferry links to which I refer.This is a massive opportunity.  The UK is committed to providing £22 million in respect of the construction of a new visitor centre at the Giant's Causeway.  The figure of 400,000 tourists to which I referred earlier is approximate and may possibly be an underestimation.I am not seeking funding.  However, I am seeking that a meeting involving the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, the North-South Ministerial Council and the special EU programmes body in respect of funding opportunities should be facilitated.  Some €300,000 would be required to retain and maintain the two ferry services to which I refer.  The British authorities see the route at Lough Foyle as an international crossing.  In the context of the British-Irish Agreement, our Government does not perceive it as such.  However, it is a vital item of infrastructure for tourism in the north west.  It is a natural corridor that leads out onto the north Atlantic passage.As already stated, I am not seeking money.  All I want is the facilitation of a meeting involving the special EU programmes body and the Minister for Transport.  Limavady Borough Council and Donegal County Council do not have the money to pay for the ferry services.  However, the EU might potentially be in a position to provide it and this could assist us in raising revenue for the Exchequer.  In recent days the EU committed €100 million to an interconnector between Wales and Ireland so there is obviously funding available.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, to use his influence to facilitate a meeting between the Minister and the special EU programmes body.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to be helpful because I appreciate the Minister of State's position and the fact that the issue falls between numerous stools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Minister of State to facilitate a cross-party meeting to which Senator Keaveney should also be invited.
