JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On 3 July 2009, the Taoiseach said in this House that "nobody predicted what has happened globally or in Ireland".  The two preliminary reports into the banking crisis, which were presented to the Oireachtas earlier this month, suggest that the Government's economic policies were a major cause of the crisis.The Government's draft terms of reference for the investigation are designed to protect the Government from being held publicly accountable.  That is why Fine Gael, through this motion, wants to change these terms of reference.  We find that the Taoiseach's defence is unsustainable.  His only defence has been that these policies were based on the best available official advice at the time.  However, this argument has not been tested at length by either report.On 3 July 2009, the Taoiseach said: "[N]obody predicted what has happened globally or in Ireland."  That argument is negated by the fact that among those who warned of the risks of the Government's policies were Fine Gael — Deputies Kenny and Bruton warned time and again that the construction bubble was not sustainable — Professor Patrick Honohan, John FitzGerald and the ESRI, the National Competitiveness Council, the IMF, the OECD, The Economist, and, most importantly, the ordinary man in the street.  Ordinary people had been predicting the bursting of the property bubble for more than a decade, and the Government, which has been in power for so long, had a responsibility to listen to these people.Irish people are educated today.  There was a time when a politician's job was to form his or her own independent view; that time is gone.  Our job as parliamentarians in this democracy — messengers of the people — is to listen to our constituents and use their views to inform our political decisions and choices.  I challenge any politician who served in an Irish constituency between 2002 and 2007 to stand up in the House and say that the man in the street did not warn that the bubble was unsustainable.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Deputies Blaney and McDaid cannot say they were not warned on the streets of Letterkenny.  Either that, or they were not listening to our people.I will provide another quote for the Minister of State:[Y]oung men leave Inishowen at 4 a.m. on a Monday morning, travel to Dublin or its outskirts in a van, begin work at 8 a.m. or 8.30 a.m. and continue until 7.30 p.m. [. . .] In terms of a sustainable future for the construction industry [. . .] we are living on a knife edge.  We are self-deluded to believe this is sustainable in the long term.Without blowing my own trumpet, I will explain that this is a quote from a speech I gave in the Seanad on 23 November 2005.  I will provide another quote from the Upper House:There is a worry in Donegal that we are too reliant on the construction industry. [. . .]  [I]n Donegal, the construction and service industries have the monopoly on jobs.  We should think in the long term[.]These are also words spoken by me, on 5 July 2006.  The Government should have listened to the people.  We, as voices on the Opposition benches, tried to act as a conduit for the opinions of the people, but we were not listened to.  This led me to form my own reply to the question: "What is the difference between the Seanad and the Dáil?"  The difference is that in the Seanad one can say whatever one wants and nobody listens; in the Dáil one can say very little and everybody listens.  These are two quotes from 2005 and 2006 that were not listened to by the Government.The substance of the Fine Gael motion, which the Government wishes to amend, is a call on the Government to extend the terms of reference, as Deputy O'Donnell has already mentioned, to include the political and policy context for the decision to extend tax relief for property developers in 2006, including official advice given to the then Minister for Finance, who is now the Taoiseach, and the lessons to be learned.  The then Minister's failure in the final extension of the construction boom was the 2006 Act in which these reliefs were introduced.Those who do not know history are condemned to repeat it.  I am a practical politician; I am not interested in the prospect of punishing the Government for the sake of it.  However, there must be accountability.  These mistakes must not be made again.
