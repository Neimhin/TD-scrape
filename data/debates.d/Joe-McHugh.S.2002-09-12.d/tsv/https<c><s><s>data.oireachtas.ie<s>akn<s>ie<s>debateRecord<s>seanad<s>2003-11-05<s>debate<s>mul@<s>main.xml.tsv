JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. From the point of view of my constituency and its general hinterland, the BMW region, the ESRI report does not really affect us. The people in this region know there is wastage and that there are problems regarding value for money and general spending. General expenditure is tilted towards the east of the country. We did not need the ESRI report to prove that to us, nor did we need any consultancy review. We know there is an imbalance.One of the key priorities of the national development plan was balanced regional development. I remember that balanced regional development was a main issue for the Minister of State during his election campaign. However, as matters stand, the BMW region has lost out. We have lost in terms of infrastructural investment, be it broadband services or roads. I will highlight some of the figures later.The south-east of the country has gained considerably with regard to broadband and information technology investment. It has attracted high-value, high-tech companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, from America. An €18 million information technology project was launched quite recently in that part of the country. This can be compared to an investment in Donegal of €4 million. There is a considerable difference. I acknowledge and commend the €4 million spend in Donegal. It is important because it will be instrumental in attracting high-tech companies to the county –€3 million will be spent in Letterkenny and €1 million has been spent in Gweedore. The Tánaiste has been talking about change and transition from a manufacturing technology base in Donegal, from a low skill labour force towards a high skill information technology one. If she is to put the money where her mouth is, she must come on board and consider all the people who have lost their jobs in the Fruit of the Loom and other textile industries in Donegal. The Gweedore industrial estate is now barren. There is no point in expecting an investment of €4 million to address the infrastructural needs of that part of the country.The BMW region has the figures to prove that tourism is down in the region. Flagship projects have been touted over the past four or five years, since I joined Donegal County Council in 1999. According to the national development plan, the flagship projects for Donegal will not happen because an area must have in excess of 100,000 visitors annually in order to get one of these projects. There is a serious problem if we are restricted under this plan in terms of numbers. It is a case of the cart and the horse – we do not have the numbers at present and that means we do not get the project. That matter must be addressed also.The National Roads Authority payment in 2000 was €19 million, but the actual spend in 2002 was €9 million. That is a dramatic drop. We have one of the most modern design offices in Donegal town, which also serves parts of Leitrim and Sligo. Engineers have designs and plans and are ready to spend money on projects, such as by-passes in Donegal, but that has not happened. Payments to date in 2003 by the NRA to Donegal amount to €2.9 million compared to an actual spend of €19.8 million in 2000. One does not need to be a rocket scientist, have an ESRI report or employ an expensive consultancy company to tell the people in the north west that they are playing second fiddle in a country that is completely imbalanced. This must be addressed in the mid-term review of the national development plan.In 1999, some 85,500 jobs were created by small enterprise in the BMW region, which includes Donegal. That went down in 2002 to 36,000 jobs, which is less than half the amount of jobs created by small to medium enterprise. I take on board Senator Maurice Hayes's point. Perhaps we are becoming too reliant on university based education and are attempting to involve people too much in the literary side as pen pushers. There is an opening in the north west for tourism projects, based on crafts and skills. Opportunities exist and this was proved in 1999 when people set up businesses. However, these businesses are not sustainable because the infrastructure is not there to maintain them.I know the Minister hears this day in and day out and that Ministers throughout the country are fighting for their own regions. However, the BMW region has Objective One status. It is acknowledged as an Objective One area and, as Senator Higgins acknowledged in terms of the European Union, it has been discriminated against. It needs urgent funding for roads, broadband services and any other type of investment that will help to create jobs in the first place, never mind sustain them.Donegal is in a unique position because it has 144 km. of border between Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone, but we have been creating and sustaining our own funding on a cross-Border basis. We have received money under INTERREG as well as from the International Fund for Ireland, but we are not receiving our share of the national spend. The people of Donegal cannot rely solely on cross-Border funds. Those who want to create and sustain jobs cannot rely on Brussels. We want money collected in tax in the region returned and we are entitled to it. It is not too much to ask.Yesterday, the International Fund for Ireland invested €1 million in a broadband wireless project between Derry, Letterkenny and Strabane. This should be commended and I acknowledge the great funding provided. It will involve a community led approach with groups from Tullyarvan and Buncrana to Convoy. It will be cost-effective because the fibre optic broadband that is being installed in Letterkenny is not cost efficient. It is very disruptive to traffic flow. There are alternatives to putting fibre optics underground.The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, talks the talk on Donegal and mentions taskforce documents. She discusses what will be done and how we will manage the transition from a manufacturing base involving textiles to a more advanced highly technological base in terms of attracting high-tech, high value companies into the region. However, that will not happen unless it is addressed in the mid-term review.People in the BMW region want a review of broadband investment in 2004 because we are not happy with the €4 million provided. We acknowledge it and it will be spent wisely in Donegal. However, we want a second round of funding for more cost efficient broadband. The man in the street knows that putting fibre optics underground will be costly. The businesses involved in the chamber of commerce in Letterkenny will lose out coming up to Christmas. Wireless fibre optics are cost efficient, involve minimal disruption and can be put in place very quickly. Looking at alternative and cost efficient ways of introducing broadband will be key for the region in 2004. We have lost out in the past, but we do not intend to lose out in the future.
