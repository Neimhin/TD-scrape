JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome everybody.  Apologies have been received from Senator Martin McAleese, Deputies Joe O'Reilly and Michael Kitt, Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, and Ms Margaret Ritchie, MP.  Hopefully, this will be a fruitful meeting.  I ask everyone to turn off their mobile telephones because they interfere with the sound system.  Today, we will discuss the roads programme relating to the A5, N2, M1 and the N14 but I will allow members from Kerry, Cavan and so on to digress.  The purpose of the meeting is to examine how we can move access to the north west forward in a constructive way.  The more dialogue we have the better.  Notwithstanding the legal challenge lodged last Tuesday regarding the A5 project, it is important to continue with the dialogue and I look forward to a constructive meeting.  I am pleased to welcome political and administrative representatives of a number of councils, including the following: the Mayor of Monaghan County Council, Councillor Hugh McElvaney and the council's acting manager, Mr. David Fallon; the Mayor of Donegal County Council, Councillor Frank McBrearty, and the county manager, Mr. Seamus Neely; the chairman of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council, Councillor Phelim Gildernew, and acting chief executive officer of the council, Mr. Iain Frazer; the Mayor of Derry City Council, Councillor Kevin Campbell, and the strategic director, Mr. John Kelpie, representing the chief executive of the council, Ms Sharon O'Connor; Councillor Frankie Donnelly from Omagh District Council, who is representing the chairman; and the vice chairman of Strabane District Council, Councillor Dan Kelly, representing the chairman, and Mr. Danny McSorley, the interim chief executive of Omagh and Strabane district councils.  People representing the various councils have been proactive to date and I hope this forum will help to bring the debate forward and to examine the challenges that lie ahead.  Before I call the witnesses to make their presentations, I would like to advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call Councillor McBrearty to make his introductory remarks.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Councillor McBrearty for his brevity before we get down to the work.  I call Councillor Frankie Donnelly.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Donnelly.  I ask Councillor Hugh McElvaney to make a final political presentation, followed by Mr. Neely, the county manager from Donegal, after which we will invite questions from members and have an open session during which people will be free to contribute.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Councillor McElvaney, Mayor of Monaghan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Neely.  His history of working with Cavan County Council puts him in a position to give a good regional perspective and I appreciate it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will now revert to the witnesses.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The committee will hear first from Mr. Donnelly following which Deputy Conlon can come back in.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We can organise a private meeting if the Deputy wants to discuss the matter afterwards.  I will take the next six speakers together as I have brevity in mind.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator.  I will open the debate to the entire delegation after Deputy Wall and Mr. Maskey, MP, have spoken.  Those who wish to comment at that stage will be more than welcome to do so.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. McSorley has indicated that he would like to speak.  I thank all the members for their constructive contributions to this discussion.I will open up the discussion to give everyone an opportunity to speak. 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the work done by Mr. McSorley before the funding issue arose.  A great deal of lobbying was done at the time and I am aware that he was in close contact with the Donegal County Manager, Mr. Neely, on the role of Stormont and the need for a proactive approach in Dublin.  I invite the Mayor of Derry, Councillor Kevin Campbell, to comment.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I invite Councillor Phelim Gildernew, chairman of Fermanagh and South Tyrone Borough Council, to comment.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Members had an opportunity to-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If there are no further contributions, I propose that Mr. Neely conclude.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Frazer for his contribution.  Does anyone else wish to contribute before I ask the Donegal county manager to sum up?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the delegation for coming here today.  There is a lot to digest from today's meeting because we did not just hear about people's perspectives but also about their experiences, including the effect of bypassing towns in County Kildare, the employment statistics in Dungannon-south Tyrone and so forth.  There is a lot to take in.  As a committee, our primary focus is on the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and an integral part of that is integrated transport strategies on a North-South basis.  That is a cornerstone for the committee, as is the integration of health, education and so forth.  Members will take on board all of the suggestions, including drawing up a calendar of events.  We must work on an outcome of this meeting.  Perhaps we should consider inviting in the contractors - Balfour Beatty, BAM and FP McCann - to hear their perspective, as was suggested.  We must continue with the dialogue, not for the sake of it but to keep the project moving.  There is no doubt this is a complex issue.  MLAs are not represented here today and many MLAs who live along that route are very proactive in their political deliberations.  The inaugural meeting of the new North-South Interparliamentary Association takes place in October and that is another forum we can work on.  We must look at all avenues, including Westminster, Dublin, Stormont and at European level, including the European Investment Bank.  One of the reasons given as to why European Investment Bank money could not be spent on the A5 project was that it was not a public-private partnership.  I do not know whether that is accurate.  We must be creative and open to the possibility of private partnerships becoming involved in this project.    We will follow up on this meeting.  I am not entirely sure how that will happen because we must first digest all of the information presented today.  The first ports of call, as Deputy Crowe said earlier, are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and his counterparts in Northern Ireland and Westminster.  We will also have to keep the British-Irish Council informed.  In my position as co-chair of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly I will endeavour to keep the issue alive in that forum.    I thank the delegation and members for their contributions, as well as for their honesty, candour and constructive suggestions.  We will be in touch again and perhaps a smaller meeting at some point in the future will enable to us to update each other on progress.  On behalf of the committee, I look forward to working with the delegation again.
