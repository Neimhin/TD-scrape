JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Varadkar for tabling this motion.  To contradict Deputy Fleming it is not scraping the bottom of the barrel, but it is very relevant and pertinent motion.  From dealings in my constituency I believe it is the most important debate we need to have in this House.  While facts and figures might seem like scaremongering to some people, it is the reality with which we are faced.  The vacuum that has been created did not happen overnight, or as a result of the events of 11 September 2001 or other global factors.  In my county in the north west for many years the textile manufacturing industry was the bread and butter.  With the decline in the manufacturing sector in the mid to late 1990s we needed to move on and embrace new areas of employment and initiatives.In 1999 the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, launched a task force report as a result of the major job losses in Fruit of the Loom and in the textile manufacturing industry which set out an ambitious target, which was welcome at the time, of trying to create new jobs in new environments.  That task force was launched in 1999.  It was followed by another task force initiated by the Minister, Deputy Martin.  An interdepartmental report was published in 2002 covering problems that were not solved leading to high unemployment levels in County Donegal.  The construction industry filled the vacuum in County Donegal after the loss of the textile industry, through not just direct construction jobs but also in ancillary services associated with the construction sector.I will focus on my constituency because Deputy McGinley will focus on Donegal South-West, which has similar problems.  The live register figures in Buncrana in February 2008 show a marked increase over 2007 for the under 25 male category.  There was a 50% increase in unemployment between 2007 and 2008 for males under 25 in that area.  That is symptomatic of what is happening around the county and the country, and we need to deal with it.  It is not just a question of us on this side of the House raising the issue because there is a problem: we also have solutions to these problems.  It is important that we address them immediately internally.  I was somewhat disappointed by the Tánaiste blaming everything on international issues, including the exchange rate with the US dollar and saying that it was not our problem.  It is not just that.  Those working in small to medium enterprises and the representative bodies ISME and IBEC keep referring to competitiveness.  We are in charge of our own competitiveness regarding ESB costs, telecommunications costs and other costs that we can control internally.I sat on the National Economic Social Forum and there are solutions within that document.  There are barriers to entry.  Solutions were proposed for a more inclusive labour market, which need to be implemented.  That is something we can look towards.  Our peripherality is an issue and with an ever-expanding European Union the centre of Europe is moving further from us.  We need solutions in terms of advancing the infrastructure of our ports.  For the north west we need to consider the ports at Belfast and Lisahally in County Derry for integrated freight transport.Deputy Conlon said we should not be scaremongering in this House and sending out negative signals.  That is not our job.  Our job as Teachtaí Dála is to be messengers for the people.  As a messenger of the people, I spoke to a woman this morning whose son was forced to go to London to work.  That is the reality and the message we need to bring to the House.  It is not just about scaremongering.
