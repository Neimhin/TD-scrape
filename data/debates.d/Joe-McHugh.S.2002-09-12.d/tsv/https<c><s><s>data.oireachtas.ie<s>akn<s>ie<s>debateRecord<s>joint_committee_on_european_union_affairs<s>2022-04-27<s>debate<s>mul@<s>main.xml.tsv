JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss the ongoing humanitarian crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, as well as the committee's recent travel episode to Romania and Moldova. I acknowledge the members who participated in the recent visit to Moldova and Romania. Senator Regina Doherty and Deputies Brendan Howlin and John Brady travelled along with me. I also acknowledge Darren Kelly, the policy official to the committee, who travelled with us, our ambassador in Bucharest, H.E. Paul McGarry, who looked after logistics while we were there, and the clerk to the committee, Mr. Barry Kavanagh, who helped to pull the programme together. In particular, I thank the people of Moldova and Romania who gave us a great welcome and a privileged insight into all the good things taking place in both countries in response to the humanitarian crisis. The committee will have an opportunity today to hear the members who were part of that programme give their insights and observations. Unfortunately, many of the predictions and observations we heard in Moldova and Romania are coming to pass. Ireland also faces challenges regarding how we greet and welcome Ukrainian refugees and put together proper programmes for dealing with them. If there are learnings from Romania or Moldova, this meeting will be an opportunity to discuss them. We have produced a report on our visit, which will be published within the next week. We met many representatives of NGOs and government officials and ministers. Their key insights and observations will be helpful in the overall conversation. On behalf of the committee, I welcome H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet, ambassador of the Republic of Moldova to Ireland, and her colleagues. I also welcome H.E. Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan, ambassador of Romania to Ireland, and his colleagues. Before we begin, all witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction. For witnesses attending the meeting remotely from outside the Leinster House complex, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should be mindful of domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Before I call on H.E. Mrs. Miculet to make her opening statement, I acknowledge the presence of H.E. Mr. George Zurabashvili, the ambassador of Georgia, who is very welcome. It is good to see him again. We will now open the meeting with the opening statement of H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank H.E. Mrs. Miculet. I invite H.E. Dr. tefan to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank both ambassadors for their detailed and comprehensive presentations. We will open up the conversation now. Deputy Howlin will be followed by Deputy Brady.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. We will start with H.E. Dr. Laureniu-Mihai tefan followed by H.E. Mrs. Larisa Miculet. We can have a good, positive engagement and if we can keep the answers fairly short, we will accommodate more speakers. Many members wish to contribute.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take Senator Doherty first, followed by Deputy Duffy. I know the latter has indicated but I want to take members who went to Moldova and Romania first.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for her intervention. We will now move to more diplomatic channels. Any future role in diplomacy-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	It is difficult to beat the truth.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. Perhaps the committee will allow me to indulge in committing to that meeting on 18 May. We will make ourselves available. That is it said publicly now.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Dr. tefan want to come in on that or was it more specific to Moldova?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	While Deputy Ó Murchú was not on the trip, he expressed a strong desire to be on it and has a strong interest in this area. No doubt, given his involvement in the conversations around the future of Europe with Deputy Richmond, he knows that while we have been discussing the fallout of this absolute nightmare, at the same time, we are talking about the future of Europe. Therefore, there is no pressure on Deputy Ó Murchú in terms of presenting on the future.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassadors. Before we get to the final word from Senator Vincent P. Martin, Deputy Ó Murchú is going to have a very short intervention with a specific question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassadors and members. This was a very important meeting. There will also be an important public element to it when we publish the report on our findings and what we have learned. We are very grateful. I thank both ambassadors for being with us today. Our knowledge of Romania and Moldova has increased no end, including places such as Chiinu, Palanca, Iai and up as far as Siret. This has given deeper meaning to the relationship between Moldova and Romania but also, within the European Union context, the importance of solidarity and the words that were used today. I thank the members for their engagement this morning. We will continue these discussions. Follow-up is key. One point that we picked up in various meetings with politicians in Moldova and Romania was that they were talking about the future. Yes, there was an acknowledgement of the present difficulties and challenges but they were talking about the future. There was a considerable degree of hope in those deliberations around rebuilding and working together more closely, irrespective of geographical distances. One thing I learned at a personal level was that we have a lot more in common that we have differences. We will continue to work with H.E. Mrs. Miculet on EU involvement and the different signals and suggestions from politicians around bridging the gaps, which are certainly not insurmountable. We look forward to meeting the politicians when they come here, and with Mrs. Miculet and Mr. Zurabashvili. We will keep a close eye on the Ukrainian application as well. The suggestion to bring the Minister for Foreign Affairs before the committee would be a good next step.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We can go into private session shortly. That is no problem. Ní neart go cur le chéile; there is no strength without unity. We look forward to strengthening this partnership and we will work together more closely. The men, women and children of Ukraine are very much in focus at the moment. We are happy to do anything we can to learn. We are grateful to the Romanian and Moldovan Governments for their suggestions about what we can do. There is no magic formula here. This is wartime. We are dealing with a refugee crisis in developed countries which is not the norm. Even NGOs are having to reposition in order to help. We will remain vigilant and stay in touch.
