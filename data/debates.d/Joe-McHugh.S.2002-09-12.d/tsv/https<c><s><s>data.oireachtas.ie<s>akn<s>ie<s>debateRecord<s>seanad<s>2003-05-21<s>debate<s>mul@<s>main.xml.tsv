JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister to the House. I am delighted he indicated at the launch of this report that he was not handcuffed to it and that he reiterated that sentiment today.If one were a tourist from America looking at the initial map in the review, one would think no one lived in Donegal. One would think the county was a vastly depopulated area like the Sahara or the Kalahari desert.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not using this as a political football and this is not a political bashing session. The Minister knows that 140,000 people live in Donegal and he knows its hinterland. He has three ministerial colleagues from there and he will have heard from them on the subject. I assume I am not telling him anything new.We have an opportunity in Donegal. Under the spatial strategy, the route between Derry and Letterkenny is highlighted as a linear pathway with gateway status and a symbolic cross-Border project such as a rail service there must be included in the strategic rail review. It is imperative to adhere to the spirit of the Good Friday agreement and to break down every political and administrative barrier between Letterkenny and Derry.The Minister is open-minded enough to believe that consultants should not lead this country. As he said in his speech, this is about economic and social development. As my colleague, Senator Jim Walsh, knows from living in Cavan, we have been suffering along the Border from economic, political and social partition. Talk about cross-Border and inter-regional co-operation is aspirational thus far. That would change with something as symbolic as a rail service between Letterkenny and Derry, which is not a new idea. That railway track existed in the past. On behalf of the people of Donegal and Derry and of the north-west region I plead with the Minister today to replace it.People in that part of the country feel isolated. The citizens of Donegal are asking why they are not worthy of the same train service as people in the south. It is a case which deserves consideration. The European White Paper on transportation policy refers to the reopening of existing tracks, which is being done throughout Europe. It has also emphasised that there must be cross-border regional railway projects. Therefore, I am being parochial in this regard, but not without justification because I speak on behalf of some 140,000 Donegal citizens who ask why the report does not recommend that their area be tied into the existing network.Some four months ago, Donegal County Council unanimously passed a motion on reopening the existing track between Derry and Letterkenny. A project team has been set up under the guidance of Mr. John McLoughlin, director of roads in Donegal, and there is massive goodwill from county council engineers as well as Donegal people from as far away as Switzerland, England, Scotland and America who wish to be part of the project. May people contacted me when this motion appeared in The Irish Times.I plead with the Minister to follow his heart. He has indicated that he is willing to listen. This is not a party political issue, because the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Gallagher, and Deputy Cecilia Keaveney will all sing from the same hymn sheet. I am glad the Minister is leaving the door open and I will give him every credit in Donegal if he opens the door for this project.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is this a different debate?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What was the previous title? There is a different title this time.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, that is fair. It is protocol.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, I was unaware of the protocol in respect of this debate being resumed. It is such an important issue that the debate could have recommenced under a different heading. Planning and rural development are not static. Rather, they have changed to a large degree since February and our contributions and input are vital. Will the Minister revisit this issue before the end of this session, because many county development plan reviews are underway?
