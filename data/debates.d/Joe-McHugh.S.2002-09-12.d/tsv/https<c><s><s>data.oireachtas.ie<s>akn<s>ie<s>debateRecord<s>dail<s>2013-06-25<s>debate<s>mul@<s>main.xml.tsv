JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the Taoiseach's comprehensive response and the work that is taking place at institutional and political levels in both Dublin and Westminster. Great work is taking place in Stormont. Just yesterday, there were British–Irish Parliamentary Assembly committee meetings taking place in Dublin and Belfast, and there was a steering committee meeting in Belfast. I am aware that the Taoiseach was in Derry last Friday at the British-Irish Council meeting. I welcome the fact that there will be a focus at council level on youth unemployment. We all hold this matter close to our hearts. Against the backdrop of a broken country that we are trying to rebuild and the historic and economic ramifications of partition, which we all know about, it is important to point out that there is an appetite, both North and South, for pragmatic solutions in the form of all-Ireland services. An example is the €90 million that the Government is investing in Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Derry for radiotherapy services and the Narrow Water bridge project, which is to link Warrenpoint to County Louth. These are very pragmatic solutions and they must be welcomed. My question is related to the north west, however. There still needs to be a massive political drive, both North and South, in regard to the A5. I left Carrigart today at 10.30 a.m. and only arrived here in the past hour. This indicates the congestion on the route. We must keep this on the radar. We should also consider tangible projects that link people. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is present. When I arrived today, I picked up documentation on the new Luas interconnector that is to bring the north and south of the city together. This is very welcome, but we need to bring together the peoples on this island. We must find ways and means of doing so, be it through new telecommunications systems or transport infrastructure. I have no doubt the Taoiseach will be completely aware of the success of the greenway project in his native county, Mayo. We have a great opportunity to advance some type of greenway project on a North-South basis. I have spoken privately to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport about this, and he has put on record his opinion on rail. We can talk about that on another day, however. With regard to the old Victorian railway lines, from Derry through Church Hill and down through Barnes Halt, and the old viaducts into Burtonport, there is already a good drive for grassroots community activism. This would not be about competing with Mayo but would complement the project in that county. The area to which I refer is a region in itself. I am getting a lot of feedback from my constituents to the effect that there is a massive opportunity for a project such as the greenway. With the new round of INTERREG funding, and the enthusiasm at local and local partnership levels, partnership companies are already on record as saying they are interested. It would bring people together. Derry city is the fourth largest city on the island. The project would involve people working shoulder to shoulder and it would be excellent, not just symbolically but also practically, in bringing people closer together on this island.
