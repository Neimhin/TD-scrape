JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, just for you. First, to welcome the Minister and I want to acknowledge the very dedicated team in the Passport Office which is producing on average 20,000 passports per week and the Minister of State’s updated figures may indicate even more than that.I also wish to acknowledge the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and his team. They work exceptionally hard to try to put in systems that work for citizens. Before I get into the substance of my motivation in raising this issue, in the past five working days I have had 30 phone calls and six emails on this subject. Overall, my constituency office has received approximately 250 to 260 queries about passport applications in the past few months. This is not just a matter in my constituency. The good citizens of Tyrone and Derry have also been in touch with me through their public representatives. I put that context on the record before turning to the substance motivating my request.  I am arguing for a passport office in the north west. I obviously use this as an opportunity to push for it to be located in Letterkenny because of its city status and previous gateway status. I ask that the new office be located somewhere in the north west. It would not be for online applications, because that is going to be the normal process for the renewal of passports and it is working well. I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about this issue. People living in Britain or in the North have the opportunity of going to Glasgow, Durham, Liverpool, Peterborough, Birmingham or Belfast if they wish to apply for a British passport. In this jurisdiction, the options are Dublin and Cork. or London or any of our other embassies round the world. Therefore, citizens living in the north west seeking an emergency passport appointment, perhaps for tomorrow morning, may find there are no emergency passport appointments available tomorrow morning in Dublin. The only option available then to somebody living in the north west is to go to London or Cork. If somebody in the north west is to go to an appointment that may be available tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. in Cork, that means there will be a need to travel to that city and to stay overnight. There is something distinctly wrong about this scenario.  I want to put on record today the idea of opening a passport office in the north west. It is worth pursuing because there is a massive gap here in respect of providing equal services to everybody on this island. The emergency passport application costs €150. People from Finglas, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow will find that €150 is still a lot of money, but that is all it will cost them and they may be able to travel by public transport or perhaps be able to nip into the passport office for a few minutes. For people living anywhere up in the north west, however, we are talking about them having to travel the night before and stay in hotel accommodation in the city. This travel will be undertaken on roads that are not motorways and from a region that does not have a train service. Therefore, a massive gap exists in this regard. The answer from the Minister of State will say everything is working well with respect to the online passport renewal service, which it is. Some of the turnaround times achieved are unbelievable. What I am looking for, however, is for the Department to keep an open mind on this issue. I will talk a bit more about the details later.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response. That last paragraph is important, because it emphasises that "the Passport Service will continue to consider ways in which to enhance the customer experience for citizens". I reiterate and re-emphasise that someone in the north west will have to travel the night before an appointment and pay substantial costs for hotel accommodation. Those people will be out a lot of money in that regard, in addition to the €150 cost of the emergency passport itself. I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, this morning before I came in. I really do hope a meeting with officials and the Minister will happen quickly. Turning to some general points about the current system, communication is key. We need a better early warning system. I refer to situations where people might be applying for passports for their children in January or February, perhaps. This could be similar to the case of a gentleman who rang me yesterday. He has got back passports for three of his children, but he has not got any information on whether there is going to be a problem. The flights in question are on 6 June and the due date is 8 June. That man wishes to know if there is something he can be doing in this regard. Therefore, we need better communication. We need better messaging as well. I know the Department and the Passport Office are trying to get people to access the online system rather than the paper-based one. They are trying to get away from that latter approach, but we still advertise the availability of paper-based applications as "Passport Express". Using that label straightaway gives the message that the response will happen quickly, but that might not prove to be the case.  We talk about the peace dividend as well. Equally, we talk about the protocol and its benefits to citizens. Talk is talk, though, and action is action. People will have to start seeing more things happening on the ground. An example would be those people who have travelled down last week, this week and every week on the A5, which is still not a dual carriageway. If we are going to be saying to the citizens of Donegal, Tyrone, Derry, or even further afield into Fermanagh and Sligo and all these surrounding counties, that we are going to provide a service equal to the service that people in Kerry, Limerick, Cork or Dublin and its wider environs get, then they must see action on this dividend. Iarraim ar an Aire Stáit a shúile agus a intinn a choinneáil oscailte.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I used to be in the Minister of State's position and got in trouble all the time for giving my opinion, but what is the Minister of State's opinion on somebody from the north west having the same access?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not going to get into the intricacies of what the solutions are for Dublin. I just want to commend the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, on all of their efforts. One thing I know from the many contacts I have in the city is that demand for housing is savage. This is an effort to come up with novel ideas and new ways of doing things, as Deputy Bruton pointed out in regard to the State-led Land Development Agency, which has been in the making for a number of years. Any proposal to try to provide building solutions for the many people who are in desperate need to start their families, start the next phase of their lives and get independence from home, has to be commended. I want to acknowledge the Minister and the Minister of State for their work in this regard. Closer to home, I want to make a couple of points. I want to acknowledge the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, for his efforts to try to move forward as quickly as possible with the mica legislation. It is very important that we start to move on that. The frustration continues to build and, in the meantime, many councillors in Donegal are advocating very strongly for modular housing for mica families while they are waiting for their houses to be rebuilt or to get the outer leaf done. We have to really look at something within the mica legislation to allow modular build in the short term. If we go through the normal channels and planning processes, with third-party objections, that will not fit the timeline of what is needed in the short term. I believe we need to look at the all-encompassing demands on housing that we have at the moment. I led a delegation to Romania recently and we met with many politicians in Bucharest. Romania has a dedicated sectoral working group on housing to deal with the current demands in terms of local housing need but also the pressure of 100,000 Ukrainians coming into the country.They are looking at an all-encompassing solution for their home needs and that of Ukrainians in totality, rather than doing them in isolation because that creates its own social difficulties in terms of segregating people. We have a great opportunity in this country if we are considering modular solutions for Ukrainian families to consider an all-encompassing model. I used the example in my county of mica families who will need short-term housing.  The second point I would like to make is that many houses built 20 years ago had three or four bedrooms because families had three, four, five or six children. Many of these children have moved on and families will want to downsize. They may not want to build a house with the same footprint. The Minister of State will consider scenarios whereby when people build a house with the same footprint they will not have to apply for planning permission because that takes away the incentive for families to downsize.  I again reiterate that I do not think people who want to downsize should have to go through the planning process not only because it takes away the incentive, but because it also opens things up to third-party objections. People in a 2,500 sq. ft. house may want to downsize to a house of about 1,500 sq. ft. or 1,800 sq. ft. They would have to go through planning and there could potentially be third-party objections where somebody is trying to replace a home. We have to consider something within the legislation to provide incentives rather than the current disincentives in regard to downsizing.
