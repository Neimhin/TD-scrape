JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Many nurses who complete their training in the United States find it extremely difficult to obtain nursing positions in Ireland. Many of these nurses are Irish, they are aware that a demand for nurses exists in Ireland and they find it quite frustrating and distressing that An Bord Altranais states that the degree course at Villanova University does not contain adequate clinical hours. I wish to cite one example of a nurse who qualified from Villanova University. She has 16 years experience of accident and emergency departments in the United States and has dealt with gunshot wounds, stab wounds and amputations. That nurse wishes to return to Ireland to work and she has been informed that she does not have enough clinical experience from Villanova University. I ask the Leader of the House through the Cathaoirleach to directly intervene in this matter. I will give her the details of this particular case. From the point of view of the individual in question, it is frustrating and distressing, when such a demand for nurses exists, that 16 years of valuable experience is not taken into consideration. We need nurses and Irish nurses want to return home.
