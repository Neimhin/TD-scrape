Under the Adoption Bill 2009, is it possible for these parents to transfer their Garda vetting applications from Vietnam to Russia?  I know the Taoiseach will not be privy to the exact information but perhaps he will note the importance of this issue and get back to me on it.  Time is not on the side of these parents.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Unfortunately, the alternative means the Ceann Comhairle has offered, and we appreciate his guidance, are simply not working.  I am not accusing the Ceann Comhairle of being sexist when he intervenes but I hope he is not being ageist.  We have a serious problem; there is an information deficit.  This is a sensitive issue and time is against many parents.I appreciate the latitude displayed by the Ceann Comhairle; it is the first time I have been able to ask a question fully.  I might continue to speak for the sake of it because the Ceann Comhairle has given me so much time.
