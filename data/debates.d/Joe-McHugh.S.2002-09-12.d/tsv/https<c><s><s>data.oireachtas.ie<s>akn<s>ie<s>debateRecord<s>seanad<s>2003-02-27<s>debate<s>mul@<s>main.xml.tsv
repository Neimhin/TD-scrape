JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	About four years ago an employment task force strategy was set up in Donegal in light of the decline in the traditional manufacturing sector, that is, textiles. That strategy was set up to look at alternative industry for the region by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. It is imperative that we bring the Tánaiste into the House in light of recent job losses and the news today that 30 more jobs are being lost in Donegal, and also because the task force document has not worked.I make no apologies for being parochial on this issue because it has been on the back-burner. Even during the times when allegedly there was a Celtic tiger in Donegal there was always a decline in the manufacturing and textile industry. We need to delegate that brief to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. That is the brief which will sustain jobs in Donegal by creating small-scale localised indigenous industries. We have to change our stance and also our strategy on employment. I urge the Leader to invite the Tánaiste. It is relevant not only to Donegal but also to the rest of the country.
