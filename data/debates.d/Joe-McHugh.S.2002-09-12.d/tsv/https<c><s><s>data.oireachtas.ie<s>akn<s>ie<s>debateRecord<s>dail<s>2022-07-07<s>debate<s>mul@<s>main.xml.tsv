JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ar dtús báire, aithním mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó hUiginn, as a díograis agus as an sárobair atá déanta aici ar an ábhar seo chomh maith leis na comhairliúcháin agus an taighde fosta. The consultations Deputy Higgins has had on this issue and the research she has carried out are very important and dovetail with the right timing as well. Even though 2012 is a long time ago, when a proposal of this kind first originated, after getting approval from the European Parliament in 2013, we see that a measure has just been agreed by the Council during the recent French Presidency. This is to be welcomed. I acknowledge all the work Deputy Higgins has carried out on this legislation. I also acknowledge all the words of encouragement, positivity and assurance from the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. It is good to see the Minister of State, Deputy English, here as well. To have a Minister and a Minister of State here shows the importance of this issue and emphasises that while we need interventions like these, this is also about creating the feasachta, the awareness, in this regard. This applies in all walks of life. Deputy Carroll MacNeill talked about this aspect. I was in a position of responsibility in the Department of Education and Skills in Marlborough Street. Women were very much in the minority in respect of assistant secretaries. Three vacancies came up during my time as Minister and we positively discriminated to deliver a better gender ratio among assistant secretaries. We all need to have an awareness in this regard at all levels, not just those in the private and corporate sector but those of us in the public sector as well. We must use opportunities like these in Parliament, which is a public forum, and take advantage of them to put through legislation on Second Stage on a Thursday afternoon. It is important. I commend Deputy Higgins once again on bringing forward this important intervention. I also thank the Minister and the Minister of State, as well as Deputy Carroll MacNeill for sharing her time.
