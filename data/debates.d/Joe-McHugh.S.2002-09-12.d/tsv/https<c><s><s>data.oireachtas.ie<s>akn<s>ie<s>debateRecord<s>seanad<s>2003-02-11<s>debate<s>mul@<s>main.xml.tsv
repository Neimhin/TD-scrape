JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am delighted the other side of the House has finally acknowledged, albeit in a roundabout way, that rural Ireland is in a mess. Job losses, rural development and rural planning have created a nightmare.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Before Christmas, my colleague, Senator Paddy Burke, and I ploughed a lonely furrow in our efforts to have a debate on this issue attended by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív. Last week the Leader agreed to try to arrange for the Minister to come to the House. This is a matter of deep importance for people living in rural areas.Rural development and planning cannot be debated in isolation. There is no point living in a rural area if there are no jobs and for this reason the Tánaiste must also come to the House. We need a co-ordinated employment strategy for rural areas, not the Tánaiste's nonsensical plans and aspirations. Let us invest in indigenous rural industries and look after the people living in these areas.
