JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for his response and acknowledge the work and interaction that has taken place in the past several hours between his Department, the Department of Finance and the troika. It is important to highlight the challenges that lie ahead of us in regard to exiting the bailout. When we become masters of our own destiny, we will face different challenges. I wish the Minister well in that work. John Maynard Keynes's philosophy in 1929 was that governments should spend their way out of depression. He was originally a civil servant and I am sure he has fans in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who would argue that we should examine our capital programme in a positive and proactive way. There are shovel-ready projects in my constituency, such as the Cockhill bridge outside Buncrana and the link bridge in Letterkenny. Depending on progress and on a positive outcome for the A5 route, there will be opportunities for infrastructure projects in Lifford and Strabane and the Letterkenny link road. I acknowledge these projects cannot all be completed in one year, but the combination of the Minister's good work and the projects that are lined up could provide a positive outcome over a period of time.
