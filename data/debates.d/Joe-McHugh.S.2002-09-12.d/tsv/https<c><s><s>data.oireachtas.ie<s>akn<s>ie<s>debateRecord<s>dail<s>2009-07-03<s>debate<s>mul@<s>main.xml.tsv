JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Earlier the Taoiseach stated that no one predicted what would happen globally or in Ireland.  I do not accept his hypothesis, particularly if one compares Donegal's economic experiences ten years ago to this current economic crisis.  Donegal had put it eggs into one basket, the manufacturing sector.  By 1999, those manufacturing companies based in Donegal moved to low-cost economies.  In 1999 a task force was established with an interdepartmental group set up in 2002 to cope with the resulting economic problems.Since then there has been intellectual snobbery with how democracy works.  Today the Taoiseach did not show the necessary maturity in setting the tone for a proper debate.  In the past ten years, from Donegal to Cork, from east to west, the ordinary man on the street knew the construction bubble would burst, free money cannot be given out and that all one's eggs should not go into the one basket.  What we are left with is a "mediocracy" over a democracy.In Donegal, today 20,000 people are on the live register, 5,000 of whom are in the under 25s category.  The focus must be to get these people back working.  Yesterday morning, the UK exported 1,000 MW of electricity to France, due to summer peak demand.  France will need up to 8,000 MW throughout the summer, enough to light up Paris.  Meanwhile, Ireland has 8,000 MW outside of gate 3 waiting to be connected to the national grid which could be provided to France.  It has not been connected because the interconnector between Ireland and the UK, which would open up other markets, has not been built.  The Government must focus on the challenge of the future of green energy production.Over the coming months, up to 5,000 graduates in engineering, architecture and other disciplines will come out of our colleges without jobs and with gaps on their CVs.  The skills set of these graduates and those over the next four years must be examined for various employment schemes.Ireland has unaccountable governance.  In the past two years I have had 52 parliamentary questions ruled out of order or disallowed.  In the case of the Department of Transport, questions concerning the NRA's function were specifically ruled out.  Employers in Donegal wanting to set up businesses along national secondary routes are not allowed because of NRA policy, set in stone.  When I try to hold the Department or NRA accountable, I cannot even get a response.  The public knows this type of governance is unaccountable.  Reading between the lines of the IMF report, it is obvious the real missing piece of the jigsaw is in the democratic deficit.  The Government has not been listening to the people or to common sense.
