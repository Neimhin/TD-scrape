JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill, which I wish to put in an economic, political and social context because it is important to do so.  We are all very aware of the economics and we have already removed €20 billion from the economy.  We have removed €3.8 billion in the budget and we have a national target for our deficit of 3% of GDP by 2015.  Intertwined with this we have a European challenge.  In that context, in the next 48 hours it will be important to be aware of the very real challenges that lie ahead, as well as the concerns many people have.  The danger in being in the House for too long — we have been here since Monday — is that we may miss what is going on outside.  Nonetheless, we must be conscious of people's genuine fears.We have a massive majority in the House and there is a dangerous perception any legislative proposal could be railroaded through, but it has been proved this week that that is not the case.  It has been proved that there is a mechanism within government to allow various opinions to be heard, including those of parents of children with disabilities.  Those parents still have to look after their sons and daughters with extreme disabilities into their 20s, 30s and 40s.  As that was evident this week, we must indicate the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton's capacity to listen and her compassion on this subject.  She has started a conversation about people with disabilities that we must bring to the next level on both sides of the House.  We must create a socially inclusive environment to progress people with disabilities into the workforce.  That challenge also faced the previous Administration which created quotas for public sector bodies to employ people with disabilities, but that did not happen.  As we did not measure up, we must now lay that down as a marker in terms of it presenting a real challenge to everybody in the House.The social complexity of what we are trying to do must be outlined.  That broad outline involves categorisation.  While the Minister is seeking progression for people with mild learning difficulties, certain levels of autism or mild Down's syndrome into the workforce, there is also a challenge as to what we can do for those with extreme cerebral palsy.  People may be born unable to speak, walk or feed themselves.  The only way they can communicate is by blinking, which represents the other end of the spectrum.  That is why the issue of disabilities became complicated this week and was also very emotive for some.  I congratulate all the parents who took it upon themselves to campaign and make their voices heard on the matter.  It is an issue that does not rest easy with them.I commend the political mechanism within government which created a facility to allow Labour Party and Fine Gael Members to have an ongoing conversation to see how we could change this decision.  We came up with a proactive plan to deal with the matter by talking and listening to each other.  My own colleagues had an involved discussion with certain members of the Labour Party.  I spoke to Deputy Gerald Nash and the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Sherlock, and thank them for their help in achieving that victory.  It was ultimately a victory for parents of children with special needs and various disabilities.While our challenge is to get such persons into jobs as part of the workforce, we must also look at the broad spectrum.  We must examine the complex interrelationship we have with disabled people which can sometimes be over-exercised in a patronising way.  We may treat them differently because we feel they are different and need a leg up all the time.  However, people with disabilities are not looking for a leg up.  We are all different, but we are also all equal.  People with disabilities are seeking equal access, equality of opportunity and to be treated like human beings.  That is the debate we need to have.  If we begin to categorise people with disabilities, it will be a dangerous road to take.  We may say someone with mild Down's syndrome will eventually end up in the workplace.  On the other hand, we may say a person with extreme cerebral palsy should be treated differently because he or she will never get a job.  However, that is not so.  I know plenty of people with cerebral palsy who end up in the workplace, even those with extreme cerebral palsy.  It is a dangerous line to follow, therefore, in calling for categorisation.I know the Minister is to undertake a review, an examination and analysis of how we can create some pathway for a more understanding mechanism to deal with people with disabilities.  That is a challenge for us on the Government benches and the Opposition also has a role to play.  It would be remiss of us to treat this issue as one for the political optics and look on the decision made as a U-turn.  Those who wish to treat it as a U-turn can do so, but it is not so.  The debate on the role of representative organisations is necessary.  I received one communication from a group which represents people with disabilities, but the majority of telephone calls I received were from parents.  In undertaking the review the Minister should involve parents who are engaged in their own voluntary representative groups.  Parents have said to me that there is a vacuum and that their voices are not being heard.  I am not including all representative groups in that category but those who work in the sector must rise to the challenge.  They must analyse their work and the road they have taken.  The only way we will understand this issue is by talking to those who have spent their lives immersed in looking after loved ones.  I am thinking of one family with a 30 year old daughter.  Since the age of ten she has been unable to walk, feed or dress herself.  She communicates by opening and closing her eyes.  That is a real challenge; therefore, we must not just show empathy in the usual way.  We must involve every single aspect of the disability spectrum to find solutions.We are obviously facing complex challenges, but the Minister has shown compassion.  Yes, it was a mistake to include the measure in the budget, but there is a mechanism within government to change things.  Others may decide to vote against a particular measure and go outside the tent.  I have found out that there is a mechanism within government to deal with such matters.  It is a more worthwhile way of doing business, rather than taking the easy option, which I was asked to do.  An Opposition Member asked me to vote against it.  The easiest thing I could have done this week was to vote against it, but the hardest thing was to do something about it.  I am glad I did do something about it.  I am also glad the Minister dealt with the issue.
