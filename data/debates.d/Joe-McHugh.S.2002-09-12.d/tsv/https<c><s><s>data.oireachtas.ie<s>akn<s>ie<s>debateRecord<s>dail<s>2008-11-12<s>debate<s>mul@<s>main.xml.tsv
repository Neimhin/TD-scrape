JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When is it proposed to introduce legislation for a €200 levy on second homes?  Is it intended that this will be a replacement tax for the ever-dwindling local government fund of €25 million?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can be of some assistance to the Government in this respect.  I have received a response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, that this tax or levy will be introduced in January 2009.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Sorry?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will it be introduced before Christmas?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I know that but will the legislation?  The Minister stated in his reply to the parliamentary question that this levy will be lifted at the beginning of January.  Legislation is required before the levy is lifted so when before Christmas will this legislation be introduced?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	He did not really answer it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We could do it without the legislation.
