JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have received apologies from Senator McDowell.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	 Before we begin, I draw to the attention of witnesses that they are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence before committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on the extent to which evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime. If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter, they must respect that direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I call Lord Kinnoull to make his opening statement. It is good to see him again. We look forward to our conversation this morning.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The committee members have a script before them. There was some interruption on the sound. We do not know where the technical problems are, but I ask that everyone keep their microphones muted.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Lord Kinnoull, we have a difficulty with the line. I will take a second question and perhaps Lord Kinnoull can nominate one of his members or he can reply. I will take a second contribution. There seems to be a problem on the line here. Can Lord Kinnoull hear us?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Can I check that everybody is switched to mute? It should switch to mute automatically. I suggest we suspend for five minutes to try to sort out the technical issues.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are back in public session. If Lord Kinnoull can respond directly to Deputy Richmond we will ensure we are switched to mute and Deputy Howlin can come in after that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We appreciate that. We will now move to Deputy Howlin's questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Kinnoull. I am grappling with whether I am a former distinguished chairman or distinguished former chairman. I will ponder that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Kinnoull. Have we any other members indicating? As we wait for them, members who have contributed can ask questions a second time. Do members have outstanding questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is that okay Senator Chambers and Deputy Richmond? Yes. A one-way street is not our game and we are happy to respond. Go for it, Lord Kinnoull.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I ask the witness to park the answers to those questions until we have heard from Deputy Howlin, Senator Doherty and Senator Martin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Kinnoull. I will speak myself and if any members want to follow up afterwards, they can do so. To go back to the original question of what we can do to look at future relationships, the work has already started, including the work that the witnesses have carried out as a committee on the United Kingdom's Internal Market Bill. When one goes through it, it is obvious that front and centre of that work is protection of the Good Friday Agreement. Looking at the witnesses' conclusions about the pragmatic compromise and providing proportionate safeguards, they have really delved into that in the report. This interaction and engagement is all about building confidence and this meeting has helped things along. With regard to the Belfast Agreement, we continue to use the language about the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland. I think everybody knows what we are talking about. That has been reinforced repeatedly in negotiations between the EU and United Kingdom. One area where I feel we will have difficulty, as Deputy Haughey alluded to, is with fisheries. I know everybody raises the issue of fisheries and we are all with Lord Wood in saying we are not experts on fisheries. We are all experts on what fish tastes like but that is potentially as far as it goes. I live beside the sea and I am certainly not an expert. I know that once we get into the realm of sovereignty relating to fisheries, it is not just about fishermen. There is an emotive connection too. Great Britain is an island and Ireland is an island. There is a community connection. When one considers the pelagic sector, with mackerel spawning off the coast of Galway, spending time off the coast of Mayo and ending up in British waters off the coast of Scotland, we have issues relating to fishermen's rights and claims on the fish. Upwards of 45% of our fishing effort is in the pelagic sector, which is a multi-million euro industry, and it happens in British waters. It is a complex area. I know the witnesses' report did not go into sector-specific matters. It was a broad report. In future, if the witnesses are asking what we can do with regard to future engagement, we need to keep that on our radar, both with regard to the sensitivity of it and using language such as proportionate safeguards. An analysis of that has to be carried out. We have a few minutes left and will go back to Senators Chambers and Martin. Lord Oates asked a question about landing zones. I will be guided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. We will leave that in the realm of the deliberations between EU negotiators and the United Kingdom negotiators. We might park that matter for the important talks that we will have in the coming period.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will go back to Lord Kinnoull and we will conclude after his contributions if that is agreeable.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Kinnoull and his colleagues for this open and insightful conversation and analysis and for the work they carried out in advance.The one point that stands out is the committee's focus on the rule of the law, rebuilding reputation and trust. That is powerful language. This engagement has been helpful. We are going through a public divorce. I am not aware of any divorces that went smoothly, whether private or public. This has been a public divorce over the past several years. Key to the future is that relationship. I am reminded of a taxi driver in Armagh during a difficult period of the peace process more than 20 years ago who said that whatever one does, one must keep talking. Engagements like this and continued conversations are important whether it is through the British-Irish Council, the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly or future mechanisms. If bigger and more creative thinking is needed, this committee would certainly be open to that. Once again, we are grateful for the committee's time. Apologies for the technical hitches at the beginning. We got there in the end and this has been a productive and helpful session. Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir.
