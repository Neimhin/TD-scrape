JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Deputy Leader organise a debate on health matters as a matter of urgency? I acknowledge that every Member will have a parochial interest in this regard, similar to myself. How can the Minister for Health and Children justify the provision of only four beds in the accident and emergency ward of Letterkenny General Hospital to service a population of more than 136,000?In addition, County Donegal extends from Inishowen to Bundoran, a distance of 144 km. I would also like the Minister to outline when a permanent breast surgeon will be appointed to Letterkenny General Hospital, which is a major priority for the consultants, nursing staff and patients in the hospital. The Minister has not visited the hospital during her time in office. I would like her party colleague, the Deputy Leader, to use his influence, as she is more than welcome to visit. I invite her to visit on behalf of the Donegal Action for Cancer Care group, the consultants, nursing and administrative staff of the hospital and the people of Donegal. I beseech Senator Dardis to use his influence.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am inviting her there today.
