JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask for the Leader's positive and timely intervention regarding allegations of malpractice in the fishing industry in Donegal. There is a very credible fishing industry in Donegal which is the backbone of the fishing industry in this State. As its credibility is at stake, a speedy investigation is necessary. We do not want it dragged out. I ask the Leader to get in touch with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and Donegal's Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, and make a timely intervention. This investigation must not be allowed to be dragged out. There are good people involved in the industry and we do not want it damaged.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister. I am delighted he accepted a common sense amendment tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe last week. The 10 p.m. time restriction should not be set in stone for all time. Time will prove there is much off season tourism in remote places. The west and Donegal already have off-season tourism when people bring families on holiday. We need to keep an open mind on the legislation which prohibits under 18 year olds from being in pubs after 9 p.m. in the winter.Before any debate on alcohol, we must acknowledge that Irish people like to drink. It is part of what we are and we must be open, up front and frank about it. This afternoon Denis Bradley, who chairs the North West Alcohol Forum, will be in the House and will meet the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to address alcohol problems in the north west. It is important the Minister stays in close touch with that group which has many good ideas. It is not my opinion that Irish people like to drink; it was said by Denis Bradley. He was the first person to say that before we do anything, we should start from the premise that Irish people like to drink.It is accepted that unless a young person can show valid identification, he or she should not have access to alcohol. However, the next challenge is what happens to 15, 16 or 17 year olds. As far as I am concerned, a 15 or 16 year old is a young adult. I am not saying they should have access to, or be served, alcohol in a pub but they are young adults and the question is what do we do for them? The only places where young people can be with their peers — every young person wants to be in a group — is at a disco or in their own homes. Senator Bohan hit the nail on the head when he said young people are meeting before they go to the pub. They have no problem drinking on the street on a cold night as long as they are well wrapped up. That is a challenge we must face. How do we cater for that group?As I said, everybody wants to be part of a group just as Fianna Fáil wants to be part of that all-encompassing Sinn Féin-Fianna Fáil group even though the natural partners for Fianna Fáil at present are the Progressive Democrats. Young people want to be part of a group, to hang out or, to use their language, "to chill out" with their peers.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They do not want to be with adults. We do not want to go back to the days of youth clubs where young adults were under the supervision of parents, volunteers or the local parish priest. We must afford young adults the opportunity to be under supervision in a controlled environment but with young people, perhaps 18 to 21 year olds, working with them in a paid capacity.Pubs are seriously feeling the pinch. The Minister does not need me to tell him that. Day time drinking is on the way out as is week night drinking. The trend is changing. People will ask whether it is the smoking ban or the increase in the price of drink. It is a combination of a number of factors. Society is changing. I have sympathy for good publicans who operate good public houses and who would not serve people if they came in drunk at 11.30 p.m. There are ambassadors in terms of good practice in public houses.I believe Senator Bohan hinted at the massive economic implication. A considerable amount of employment is provided by public houses. In Letterkenny, staff are being laid off. I am not demeriting the smoking ban but maybe we should consider facilitating people in a room separate from the main public house.We received literature in our post today from Restaurant Express. It is tapping into the change in society in terms of people staying at home. Perhaps it is because the price of drink in pubs is becoming expensive. The literature refers to dining out at home. I am giving good publicity to Heineken if "Oireachtas Report" decides to broadcast this debate but the literature states that one can get 20% off one's bill if one orders six or more bottles of Heineken with one's Restaurant Express food after 8 p.m. This is a reality check. There is a complete change in social behaviour. The implications of this are very dangerous. If couples are meeting in each other's houses, what happens young people when they are not being supervised? This is uncontrolled drinking until perhaps 6 a.m.Despite serving restrictions, the smoking ban and trying to introduce a nanny state, Irish people like to drink. We are not talking about prohibition as in the United States in 1929. People will drink elsewhere in uncontrolled environments. It will damage the pub trade which proved a controlled environment in which people could drink. That is the danger.
