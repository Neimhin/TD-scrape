JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State. Second Stage of the Valuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill took place in the Seanad on 11 October last year, with the common opinion of the Members of the Upper House being that there is an urgent need to speed up valuations and revaluations as a matter of priority. There are a few initiatives that the Minister of State will doubtlessly outline as being within the Bill, with one being a pilot in a local authority in Galway to consider a self-assessment scheme. That should be welcomed. There is also a pilot scheme for considering different ways of facilitating an independent assessment system or an external service delivery scheme. That would be welcome and I hope the Minister of State can expand on the concept. Having spoken to owners of businesses in my constituency, it seems there are a number of urgent issues, with survival being paramount in 2013. The Minister of State would be well aware in his constituency that the common narrative among business people is if they will survive in 2013. We must be conscious of that worry and look to deal with it. With the valuation system, business owners are indicating it could take two to three years to get a valuation officer out to revalue a property, and there is a desire to speed up the process. Some businesses may be paying very high rates and may have downscaled, with a decrease in revenue and profit margins. We must be careful in assisting businesses when many are still struggling. I spoke to a constituent at the weekend who is in business along with a couple of his sons. He observed that the businesses which are doing well are working flat out but on the other side of things, the businesses trying to survive are slowly losing that battle. We must use every available resource to make the process easier. We must look to speed up resource deployment with this Bill. It has gone through Second Stage in the Seanad and the Minister might enlighten us today about the timeframe for getting through the legislative process. There should be a sense of urgency. From speaking to open-minded people in business, there is a realisation that competition is good and business is dependent on other businesses doing well in an area. Some but not all business people have mentioned a rates holiday for 12 months that could apply to new businesses. The idea was raised in the recent past and we must use every possible incentive to attract people to setting up a business. Not every business will survive, and the rate of survival is probably falling, but we should use whatever tools are available to consider the idea of a rates holiday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his reply, although I note it did not refer to his county, Louth, or my county, Donegal. I hope he will use his powers of persuasion and position to try to ensure greater haste in bringing counties not yet included in the revaluation programme up to speed. While I accept that 50% of the national valuation base has been revalued, businesses in my constituency are struggling and must be given hope that a valuation order will be signed for County Donegal as a matter of priority. The current valuation system is shrouded in secrecy. Businesses in small towns do not share information and there are curious differences in the valuation methods employed. Greater transparency is, therefore, required. One way of facilitating more transparency is to encourage businesses in small towns to come together. Buncrana and Letterkenny in my constituency have successful chambers of commerce, whereas smaller towns such as Ramelton, Milford and Carndonagh do not have a chamber of commerce. We must encourage smaller towns to establish chambers of commerce which could then act as a lobby group on issues of importance such as the revaluation programme. I call on businesses in smaller towns to come together and share information. I am not naive and accept, therefore, that some businesses are worried that the revaluation process will result in an increase in their rates. Businesses in smaller towns and their environs must engage in more effective lobbying. At a time when democracy is breaking down to some extent and the old party structures no longer work as effectively as in the past, we need more formal mechanisms and new conduits for allowing businesses to share and impart information. Businesses in the Border region, including counties Louth and Donegal, face specific competition issues, yet none of the Border counties is listed for revaluation. I ask the Minister of State and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure Border counties are considered for participation in the next phase of the revaluation programme.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the good work the national lottery has done in the past. A total of €12 billion has been invested in various areas over a 25-year period. Many areas have benefited, such as Carrigart, Clonmany, Carrickmacross and Castlecoote. Money was distributed to many areas that otherwise would not have got such benefits. According to the Minister, there is a need to tender for the outsourcing of the licence but it is important to ensure that we enshrine in the legislation that good causes will benefit. Some might argue that the model that was previously in operation was used by politicians to buy votes but the contrary was the case. It was an exercise in local democracy in action where local politicians were in touch with their constituency base and realised that there were small parishes and areas that would not otherwise have funding to build a new sports centre, an extension onto a sports club or to provide a community centre or service. Politicians are the ones who ensured that the €12 billion was spread out as evenly as possible in their constituencies and fought tooth and nail to ensure that would happen. We should not avoid the rationale behind the positive functioning of the lottery system. One could ask why such a mechanism was required. One could point to the centralising of Exchequer funding and the priority given to larger projects for worthy needs such as hospitals, the provision of bigger roads, sewerage schemes and water schemes. The bulk of funding goes to core areas where population centres are concentrated. There is a constant fight in rural areas for funding that would not otherwise be available to them. It is important in the context of a debate on the lottery to examine the reason rural, isolated areas are always fighting for the crumbs of its share of the pie. I could always argue the toss in my county which historically and traditionally had less investment than other parts of the country in terms of national distribution. One only has to look at the motorway systems between Dublin and Galway, Dublin and Limerick, Dublin and Belfast and Dublin and Cork. Each of those cities also has a rail service. There is a national psyche in terms of peripheral areas losing out to core areas. I use the example of my county, but when one brings it to a micro-level, in every county, including populated parts of Deputy Terence Flanagan’s constituency, areas are losing out on investment. Unfortunately, that is the world in which we are living. We must continue to ask why. We must examine the current banking system. I wish to allude to a report compiled by Dr. James Deeny a number of years ago when he worked as a locum doctor in the Fanad Peninsula. He argued that, in that geographical area, there was upwards of £1 million on deposit at that time in the 1970s. He asked how that money on deposit was working for the area and he argued that the banking system operating at the time was using that capital as collateral - as liquidity - to attract further investment into the bigger areas. We should use the opportunity of this debate to discuss the way our government system and banking system are working for the rural areas, as there is a constant drag on capital out of areas, and how we can make our money on deposit in rural areas work for the people and the communities. I have reservations about the awarding of this licence to an external source but I ask the Minister to examine all the suggestions from both sides of the House in terms of enshrining the good cause element in it. That is a priority.
