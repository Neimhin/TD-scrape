JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Over the past 15 years, 24 post offices have closed in County Donegal. This is a stark statistic. I call on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to intervene because this is the result of depopulation. We all have bases in rural areas and depopulation is a sickness in them. There is a way to address it. The intervention of the Minister could go a long way towards addressing this issue because a two part mechanism is available. Counties such as Donegal could be linked to the broadband grid in Northern Ireland and radio broadband solutions could be provided in rural areas. This has not happened. A seven year plan for rural areas close to gateway towns such as Letterkenny is under discussion. This plan is not good enough and the timeframe involved will not allow for a solution. The Minister should come to the House to debate a connection to the broadband grid in Northern Ireland and to provide radio broadband solutions in rural areas because the closure of post offices will continue and it is our responsibility to do something about it.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does the Senator blame the voters?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Blame the people.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, I am not fully conversant with protocol, but would Senator Ulick Burke need to be present to defend himself?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is this relevant to statements on the CLÁR programme?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, a Chathaoirligh, the item on the agenda is statements on the CLÁR programme.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I think Senator Ulick Burke should be here to defend himself.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When will we have the statements?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a specific one to one disagreement the Minister has with the Senator.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In fairness, I did not rudely interrupt the Minister. I just asked when we would have statements on CLÁR.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A Chathaoirligh, that is a serious allegation against a democratically elected Member of this House.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is that a vote of no confidence in the councillors?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I did not intend to come in here today to be caught in political crossfire but unfortunately that is what happened. If there are issues to be addressed it is best to address them on a one to one basis rather than use this House as a mechanism to do that because it does nothing but degrade the House. If any comment is to be retracted it should be the one made by the Minister about a gentleman who is elected to this House. He stated that a politician like Senator Burke does no service to politics. Politics is a tough game, and I know the Minister finds that also, but I do not understand the logic behind that statement. If anything needs to be retracted it is the Minister's comment about Senator Ulick Burke. Senator Burke does provide a service and he works very hard.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I tried to interrupt the Minister a few times as Senator Burke was not here to defend himself. He is here now, however, and he will defend himself when he gets an opportunity.The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has a big job because his ministerial portfolio has no teeth in terms of reversing the lack of investment in rural areas. His mindset in regard to depopulation is right and he wants to do something about it but as far as I am concerned, that is not happening.I wish to refer to a number of items, the first of which is the community groups and the partnerships. As the Minister is well aware, the community groups and the partnerships fought hard to be included in the CLÁR programme and to act as a conduit in regard to the draw-down of money but the Minister decided not to go down that road. He went down the local authority road and decided not to use the community and voluntary sector for reasons——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——involving the rationalisation of community groups and because he is trying to amalgamate services. A whole re-negotiation and restructuring process is going on in that sector.Second, the Minister said that €7,500 would be allocated to schools in rural areas but where was his Department last summer when a little school in Doaghbeg, Portsalon, Fanad was on the brink of being closed down? His Department was lobbied and every argument put on the table. He got various representations from his own party, cross-party and from different groups. The Doaghbeg school would have closed down last summer were it not for the fact that the Minister for Education and Science made an error in his call for its closure. That is the only reason. The closure of that school, which is in the CLÁR area, would have resulted in those children having to go to another school outside of the little community of Doaghbeg.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Doaghbeg is a microcosm of rural life. It is a rural area disaffected by depopulation, brain drain and the movement of people to urban centres. If the Department had any teeth it would have no problem keeping a school like that open and encouraging investment in the area. There are people living in continental Europe, America and even other parts of Ireland, from Letterkenny to Dublin, who would live in Doaghbeg if the services were provided. Donegal people would live in Doaghbeg and Fanad if broadband services were provided, to which the Minister referred earlier and which I will address shortly.My third point concerns the CLÁR area, of which the Minister will be aware. The CLÁR area was mapped out but there was political uproar when certain areas were not included. That political uproar continued until the Minister decided to include other areas in the CLÁR area, which he did in Donegal and for which he should be commended. However, the nub of the problem was that he increased the number of areas but reduced the funds. That is a fact. That is like having a birthday party and a big cake for 20 young people and then deciding to invite another 20 but have a smaller cake. That situation must be seriously addressed.I wish to be parochial now because the rural way of life is part of me, my social upbringing and my mindset and is something for which I have to fight the cause and bring problems to the Minister's attention. There is a small area in a place called Elly in Oughterlin in Donegal. A gentleman came to me last week and said that 50 years ago there were 45 smokes, as he called it, in that area. I do not need to define "smokes" for the Minister; he knows what I mean. The man was talking about smoke from chimneys. That number has been reduced to three. That is an area which lobbied strongly to be included in the CLÁR programme. I asked him what he would gain from being included and he said he wanted to set up a small business and wondered if he would get grant aid for it through the Minister's Department. I told him he would not because the Department lacks teeth.The Minister has talked here on many occasions about broadband roll-out. It is like the spatial strategy and every development plan and feasibility study we have in Donegal on which millions of euro were wasted. The Minister would also agree that money was wasted on consultancy fees. Broadband roll-out is a myth when we talk about rural areas. The only places gaining in terms of broadband roll-out from the Government are urban areas like Gweedore and Letterkenny. The rural areas are not being included. There has been no examination of radio broadband or satellite broadband for rural areas. If the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs had teeth, it would carry out pilot schemes in areas like Milford, from where Icome.A few weeks ago, my party leader, Deputy Kenny, tabled a parliamentary question on post offices in County Donegal. As I mentioned this morning, in the past 15 years, 24 post offices in Donegal have closed down because of insufficient people. Senator Glynn argued against me this morning. However, this is the effect of depopulation and the movement of people from rural to urban areas. The Letterkenny town plan cannot cope with the number of people from rural Donegal moving to the town. There is no reason for them to stay in rural areas, as there are no services, post offices, shops or schools.There is a small place in the north of County Donegal, which no longer has a post office or a school. All that is left is a little community that is disillusioned and disenfranchised from society. They have no confidence in the system and have no hope for their young ones to return in the future as they are either working in continental Europe, London, Dublin or Letterkenny. Does the Minister believe his Department can address the issue of depopulation under his remit? The people living in the small areas I have highlighted —  Elly, Oughterlin, Glenvar and Doaghbeg —  do not believe the Department has done anything to instil confidence that their communities have a future.The Minister spoke about water and sewerage schemes. We have group schemes, small water schemes and every type of scheme in County Donegal. The smaller the scheme, the more the people get hammered in terms of money. Those in a small scheme with 20 people have to pay €6,000 per household. These people are not in a position to pay that kind of money. The Minister might say that if they were in the CLÁR programme, they might be included. Where is the support from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs for them?The Minister is using the local authorities as a mechanism to bring money to rural areas and he says this is ultimately the responsibility of the councillors. I am still a member of my local authority and along with a Fianna Fáil and an Independent Fianna Fáil councillor, I had a part to play in getting CLÁR money to County Donegal for roads. I admit that money tarred three or four lanes that would not have been tarred under the local authority programme. However, what has that done to reverse the problem of depopulation? The Minister might think that tarring a road that has not been tarred in 20 years is the way forward. This may be a case the glass being half full and perhaps I should not be too critical.As regards water and sewerage schemes that come through the local authority, the Minister knows that each section of Donegal County Council is under pressure and constantly draws down money for major capital projects. The director of services in the environment and sanitary section of Donegal County Council is dealing with millions of euro annually. The total allocation for County Donegal from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is approximately €2 million. When this is broken down to water and sewerage schemes, sums of €50,000 to €80,000 are being allocated. Such amounts get lost in administration as the Minister knows and do not go directly to the rural area. The Minister should consider the community groups and not the local authorities as a mechanism for transferring this money.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is not true in my area of Milford in County Donegal. The water and sewerage schemes and the roads programme should not be managed through the local authority. Putting €38,000 or €40,000 through the local authority is a waste of time and gets lost in the pool.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why are the partnerships singing from the same hymn sheet as I am?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I gave the Minister credit for what has been done on the roads.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why not, Minister?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why should community groups not look after group water schemes? Ultimately the ordinary people promote the scheme. There is no mechanism for the delivery of the Minister's plans for radio broadband in rural areas. There is talk about a seven-year plan under the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to have a scheme similar to a group water scheme. What proposals does the Minister have to bring ISDN lines and broadband to the outermost places like Malin Head or Downings? The Minister has no plan. There is not a hope in hell of us getting radio broadband or satellite broadband into those areas. It is all chat; it is a seven-year plan; it is another programme; it is absolute bull.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While I have asked many questions of the Minister, no doubt he will respond by highlighting all the positive elements. Through what mechanism does the Minister propose to bring radio broadband into the rural hinterlands from Milford to Malin Head to the west of Donegal? The Minister told us nothing new today and merely attacked my good colleague here. Private companies are willing to get involved in this venture. I am aware of a group with various investors in northern Scotland that wants to come and set up small to medium enterprises in rural areas and is only prevented by the lack of broadband. Broadband will bring the people in. If the people come in, the post offices can be sustained. If the post offices can be sustained, we can sustain communities and schools and bring people back to rural areas. That is what will bring people back and not bullshit such as consultancy papers.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We want to bring the people back into the rural areas. The Minister should withdraw his comment that Senator Ulick Burke does no service to politics.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Did it cost €20,000?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Was there £2,000 under CLÁR funding?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was just seeking clarification.
