JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will commence the public session. Apologies have been received from Deputy Joe O’Reilly, Mark Durkan and Alasdair McDonnell. I remind members, guests and those in the public gallery please to ensure that their mobile phones, iPhones, Blackberries, etc., are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting. If people want to leave them in silent mode they can leave them on the floor, where allegedly they will not interfere with the sound system. I ask, however, that they respect this instruction and ensure that they are switched off completely. Today we will continue our consideration of cross-Border co-operation in education. I am delighted that Dr. Stephen Farry, Minister for Employment and Learning in the Northern Ireland Executive is here with us today. We hope to have a good engagement and conversation with him. This subject is not new to the committee. We have highlighted education as an area worthy of consideration and we would like to explore where there are synergies and integrated strategies in education with mutual benefits. This is a pragmatic committee which prefers practical and common-sense solutions. On behalf of the committee I welcome Dr. Stephen Farry. We are also joined by Mr. Chris Andrews and Ms Judith Shaw from the education division of the Northern Ireland Department for Employment and Learning. Our witnesses are all very welcome. The committee has held a series of meetings to consider cross-Border co-operation in education. We have already met with our Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the presidents of the institutes of technology in the Border region - Sligo, Letterkenny and Dundalk - and with St. Angela’s and the University of Ulster teacher training colleges. On our regular visits to Northern Ireland we have noted how educational attainment impacts on the progress of many communities, as we see in our constituencies here in the South. We look forward to Dr. Farry’s contribution and to exploring with him the potential for synergies to enhance co-operation in this very important area. Before Dr. Farry makes his presentation it is important to point out that we have one common political ground, North and South, which is the challenge of youth unemployment. We need a twenty-first century third level system to adapt to the changing needs, be it in industry or employment trends. That is an area in which researchers in all our universities North and South can work together. We look forward to hearing Dr. Farry’s contribution and no doubt committee members will make their own observations and suggestions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister. The level of student flow is such that 4.5% of students in the North are from the South. There is also a distortion within that figure because many of those students are from the Border counties, from Donegal in particular. Our national figures do not show the progression of Donegal leaving certificate students going to university because they do not include the Northern universities. However, that is a job for another day.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We can discuss that one over a cup of tea.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	If it is acceptable, I will also take questions from Deputy Smith and Mr. Paul Maskey, MP, then the Minister can conclude.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Paul Maskey will be our final contributor before the Minister replies.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We appreciate the Minister being here but we also value his insight and acknowledge his willingness to co-operate. As Deputy Smith said earlier, we should not get caught up on the number going from point A to point B, but at the same time we must be aware of the reality.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The new buzzword I came across that the Minister can use is "co-opetition", which is the new way of moving forward. It was interesting to hear the statistics given by the Minister. I would be eager to find out more and work with the Minister on the further education statistics indicating that 3,000 students are going to the North. I was struck by that figure. On the 4.5% flow, it would be interesting to get a breakdown of that. I assume that much of it is coming from the Border. The natural university for many secondary schools in Donegal is the University of Ulster, be it at Coleraine, Magee, Jordanstown or Belfast. I know Mr. Doherty wants to speak on this point also but it is important to acknowledge the role played by those colleges. Their doors were always open during the Troubles and other difficult periods, and they were a natural home for many students along the Border. The Minister might pass on our commendation to the colleges in gratitude for the excellent-quality training and education provided to students, be it in the IT sector, engineering or teaching in Coleraine. That is a huge resource base for our graduates. We will be very interested to hear the conclusions of the report of Mr. John O'Dowd, MLA, because the three third level colleges raised the issue of the A level equivalency. The nub of the issue seemed to be the disparity between A levels and the leaving certificate. It will be interesting to hear the outcome of that report and no doubt this committee will be eager to present the findings. I call Mr. Doherty, who wants to ask a question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister, Ms Shaw and Mr. Andrews. I propose we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters.
