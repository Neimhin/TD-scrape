JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Whelan for raising this issue. The value of honey produced in Ireland in 2014 was estimated at slightly over €3 million. The value fluctuates from year to year depending on the climatic conditions during the summer. There are almost 2,500 beekeepers in the country, over 56% of whom have three colonies or fewer while only 3% or approximately 70 beekeepers have more than 50 colonies. Only five beekeepers have over 150 colonies, which many would consider to be a commercial apiary. Notwithstanding this scale of activity, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine fully appreciates the importance of beekeeping in Ireland. The value of bees as pollinators far exceeds their value as honey producers. In 2008, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government estimated the value of pollinators, including honey bees, for Irish food crops was at least €53 million. This does not include the value of pollinators in terms of non-food crops and maintaining bio-diversity in the wild. One of the major issues facing beekeeping is that of bee health and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine recognises the importance of maintaining and further developing a healthy honey bee population and has devoted considerable effort to this. With this in mind, the signing into law of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 repealed the outdated Bee Pest Prevention Act 1908.  The Control of Animal Diseases Regulations 2014, SI 110 of 2014, lists six pests and diseases of bees of concern, including the small hive beetle. In response to the 2014 outbreak of small hive beetle in Italy, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine established a sentinel apiary programme earlier this year. Working with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, a similar programme has also been rolled out across Northern Ireland. This programme was established with the support of the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations and the Native Irish Honey Bee Society. Volunteer beekeepers in areas which are considered to represent greatest risk for the introduction of pests such as the small hive beetle, as well as other beekeepers are participating in this programme. Over 20 beekeepers providing a representative geographical spread across the country are involved. The sentinel apiary programme is designed with the objective of providing early notification in the event that any exotic pest or disease affecting honey bees arrives in Ireland. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine co-ordinates the programme and has provided equipment and guidelines to the beekeepers and also provides the diagnostic service to implement the programme. In addition, a bee diagnostic service is operated from the Teagasc laboratories at Oakpark in Carlow. Analysis of some 300 samples for foul brood, nosema and varroa which are submitted by beekeepers each year are carried out and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is informed where a case of a notifiable disease is detected. Officials in the Department follow up, where appropriate. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine co-funds Ireland's national apiculture programme with 50% co-funding from the European Commission. The 2013-16 programme is due to run until August 2016 and is being implemented by the University of Limerick in collaboration with Teagasc Oakpark and NUI Maynooth. Funding of €70,000 per annum is available for the programme. The objectives of the current programme are: to monitor Irish over-winter colony losses during the period from 2014 to 2016 in collaboration with the international COLOSS network; assess the efficacy and tolerability of alternative varroa treatments under Irish conditions; establish the prevalence of pests and pathogens in Irish honeybee colonies and assess if the dark native honeybee has inherent resistant characteristics; and provide technical assistance to beekeepers and groupings of beekeepers. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine intends to engage with the Irish beekeeping associations shortly with a view to preparing plans for submission to the European Commission in early 2016. These plans will seek co-funding for a new national apiculture programme to cover the period 2016 to 2019. Appointment of bee health inspectors under this programme will be one of the issues for consideration in deciding the priorities in terms of Ireland's application for funding. The Department also provides grant aid to beekeepers under the national horticultural grant scheme. The current scheme is advertised on the Department's website, with a closing date of 18 December 2015. In recognition of the smaller scale of beekeeping compared with other sectors of horticulture, a minimum investment of €2,000 is required compared to €10,000 for other areas of horticulture. Potential funding for beekeeping groups is also available from the Department under the scheme for conservation of genetic resources to develop breeding programmes and strategies to protect the dark native honeybee. The Department also provides an annual grant to the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations, FIBKA. The objective is to assist FIBKA to meet its operating costs, thereby allowing the association to promote the craft of beekeeping among its members, and to inform the general public of the role of bees in our environment. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is also active in ensuring that imported and domestically-produced honey marketed in Ireland meets all the various quality and labelling standards. More than 100 samples of honey are taken per annum under the national residue plan. A broad suite of tests are carried out in respect of contaminants such as antibiotics, pesticides, heavy metals, etc. In addition, a sampling programme is being organised across the European Union this year to ensure that the honey marketed is not being mislabelled with regard to its geographical or botanical origin and that products declared as honey do not contain externally added sugars or sugar products. The Department and Health Service Executive have taken upwards of 70 samples under this programme. The Department is also working with a number of stakeholders in producing a guide for beekeepers to ensure they fulfil all legal criteria pertaining to the production, marketing and labelling of their honey. Officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland to ensure that a common approach is taken, particularly in the area of bee health. They will continue to explore the opportunities for greater co-operation in ensuring the development of beekeeping across the island.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council take place on a regular basis. I do not know when the next sectoral meeting between representatives of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland will be held. I will raise the matter with the Minister as it should be added to the agenda. I will bring the Senator's message to the Minister.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht an t-ábhar seo a ardú inniu. Táim sasta an cheist a fhreagairt ar son an Aire, Teachta Heather Humphreys, agus ar son an Rialtais. I thank the Senator for raising the matter. I am well aware that there is a growing public awareness and concern about the impact of invasive species, including Japanese knotweed. Since it was introduced as an ornamental plant from Japan in the 19th century, it has spread across the country, particularly along watercourses, transport routes and waste ground where its movement is unrestricted. Japanese knotweed grows vigorously and out-competes native plants. It is recognised that once it becomes established in or around the built environment, it can become hard to control. In this regard, my Department is responsible for the Wildlife Acts and the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011, which prohibit the spreading of invasive species. In general, control of invasive species is a matter for landowners. My Department carries out considerable work to control such species in national parks and natural reserves. For example, work has been undertaken over many years to deal with the rhododendron threat in Killarney National Park. While my Department does not have the resources required to extend such work into the wider countryside or to provide dedicated funds for such work to other bodies, it is currently supporting the development of a Japanese knotweed protocol for Ireland. A number of agencies, including the National Biodiversity Data Centre, Inland Fisheries Ireland and the National Roads Authority, are involved in drafting the protocol which it is intended to have completed next year. The protocol should help us to manage the impact of Japanese knotweed more effectively around the country. I am aware that a number of local authorities are already carrying out control programmes for problem species, including knotweed. In addition, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011 include provisions to control the possession and dispersal of ecologically harmful and invasive species of animals and plants, including Japanese knotweed.For example, under regulation No. 49 of the 2011 regulations, a licence is required from my Department for any proposal to remove Japanese knotweed from a site and transport it to another site for disposal. Invasive species, by their nature, do not recognise political boundaries and I am pleased that a considerable level of co-operation already exists on the issue between Departments and agencies in both jurisdictions on this island. My Department works with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency to fund and manage the invasive species Ireland project, which provides substantial advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species that can negatively impact on the environment and property on the island of Ireland. We are also working on this issue with other member administrations in these islands through the British-Irish Council and we will host a workshop next year in Dublin on this theme. At a European level, my Department is actively participating in discussions with the Commission, member states and other Departments and agencies here on arrangements for the implementation of some key provisions, including border controls relating to the European Union regulation on invasive and alien species. That will come into force next January. One strong focus of that regulation is the prevention of the spread of new species. It seems unlikely, however, that Japanese knotweed will be included on the Union list as it is already widespread in the EU. Therefore, it will remain a matter for individual member states.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is not a problem. There is already engagement involving Inland Fisheries Ireland. I say that as much with my other hat on because I have responsibilities in the relevant Department as well. I will speak to my officials again to highlight the obvious sense of urgency. The protocol is being worked on. There will be a gathering or bringing together of minds on the matter next year in a formal setting, but I will certainly speak to my officials to raise Senator Landy's concerns.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, who is elsewhere on Government business. I want to reassure the House about the MRI scanner in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. I understand some concerns may have been raised last week about whether the machine is in working order. I am happy to advise the House that the MRI scanner was fully operational last week, other than on Friday, 13 November, when scans were postponed to allow for repairs to be carried out on the machine.The repair on Friday affected five patient slots and these scans have been rescheduled for this week. MRI scans recommenced fully on Saturday. Appropriate contingency plans were put in place by Crumlin hospital, with Temple Street hospital, for any emergency cases that might have arisen on the Friday while the machine was being repaired. On the broader issue of waiting times for MRI scans at Crumlin hospital, the capacity to provide these scans is, as the Senator pointed out, under pressure. Referral patterns reflect the tertiary paediatric nature of services provided in the hospital. The oncology specialty generates the largest portion of MRI activity. Crumlin hospital also provides the only paediatric cardiac MRI service in Ireland. The unit takes consultant referrals from local maternity hospitals and from hospitals nationally where paediatric MRI with general anaesthesia for younger patients is required. Demand for MRI services is steadily increasing from all specialties. In this context, particular attention has been paid to optimising existing capacity and managing demand through clinical triage. MRI capacity at Crumlin hospital has increased in recent years and is at almost 2,000 scans per annum. This compares with 1,600 scans in 2011. The MRI service now operates for 37 hours per week and staff are available to provide lunchtime cover as demand requires it. In addition, a service is provided from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturdays, which is suitable for those patients who do not require anaesthesia or sedation. This has improved access and decreased the waiting list. To maximise capacity there is a strong focus on active local management of appointments, with the result that did not attend, DNA, rates are extremely low. Triage is also a key element in managing demand and preventing inappropriate referrals. Under the triage process, between six and 14 referrals weekly are triaged as urgent and these are dealt with as soon as possible. Unfortunately, however, patients from specialties other than oncology and cardiology who require a general anaesthetic and who are categorised as routine experience long waiting times of between 15 and 27 months. I emphasise that the Government sees this as unacceptable and acknowledges the difficulties which delays cause for patients and their families. Crumlin developed a business case for resources to increase capacity and submitted it for consideration in the context of the current service planning process, which is still ongoing. The HSE and the Department of Health continue to work together to address waiting times for diagnostic services, including MRI, and to ensure appropriate collection and reporting of MRI waiting times.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Senator raising this extremely important matter. I do not doubt that her contact with the parent concerned will have highlighted to her the obvious distress the family went through. Statistics are statistics and, unfortunately, demand for the MRI scans increased from 1,600 in 2011 to 2,000 per annum at present. The Minister is not using statistics as an excuse. However, he will use them to try to improve the service and I have no doubt he will ensure that, where possible, resources will be directed to where they are needed. I will certainly convey the Senator's message to the Minister and I thank her for raising the issue.
