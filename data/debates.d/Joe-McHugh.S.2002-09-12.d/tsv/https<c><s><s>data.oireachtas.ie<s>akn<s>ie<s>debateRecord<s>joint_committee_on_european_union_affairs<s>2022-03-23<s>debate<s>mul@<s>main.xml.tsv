JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The purpose of today's meeting is to continue our discussion on the European Union's response to the humanitarian crisis that has been brought on by the war in Ukraine. Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh ambasadóir na Slóvaice chun na hÉireann, H.E. Mr. Igor Pokojný. No doubt the ambassador would have been interested in and listening to the contributions to last week's meeting. We had a marathon five-hour meeting and I thank the Vice Chairman, Deputy Howlin, for chairing it. We want to create a better understanding of what is happening in the ambassador's country and we are looking forward to this discussion today. Before we begin, I have a note on privilege to read and some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witness's statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue his remarks. It is imperative the witness complies with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside of the Leinster House campus, there are limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness physically present does. Witnesses participating in the committee session from a jurisdiction outside of the State are advised that they should be mindful of the domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside of the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I would ask members partaking by MS teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the grounds of the Leinster House campus. I call on the ambassador to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. This helps us in developing a deeper understanding as well. We will continue on this rich vein of thought as well in the time ahead and try to develop that understanding to see how we can help. I call Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. The Deputy can contribute again. We will have plenty of time. The Deputy is on his fifth supplementary at this stage. I call Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	A follow-up to that question - and I know the answer is going to be "Yes" - concerns whether diplomatic channels are good between all the small countries, and not just between Ireland and Slovakia. Is there a common understanding in this context that enables a support system for small countries of similar size in the EU?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador and apologise for piggybacking on Deputy Haughey's question. The Deputy looks like he wishes to come in again.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Haughey and the ambassador. I call Deputy Harkin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. We have a couple of minutes left so we have time for some final contributions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. On behalf of members, we are grateful for his contributions and helping us to develop a deeper understanding of the situation. We will leave him with the final word. He might attempt an answer on whether he sees a further escalation of the aggression in non-NATO aligned countries. It is a speculative question, but that is a genuine fear. Will the aggression grow or continue? As a committee, we would like to acknowledge the role of Slovakia in providing the solidarity that is so evident against the backdrop of courage and fortitude on behalf of the Ukrainian people and the nightmare they are enduring. I would like to acknowledge the solidarity of the ambassador's citizens in facing such adversity. There is hope in his contribution today, such as his call for equality, like mindedness and working with people. He made reference to the parameters of the European Union in terms of equality and a level playing field, which is what we are looking for.  We are thankful for his contribution and message of hope. However, as Deputy Harkin pointed out we have an immediate issue to deal with here and we are with the ambassador all of the way on that. I ask for an attempted answer, having acknowledged his message of hope. Is there a very real concern about a further escalation in non-NATO aligned countries?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the ambassador. Once again, we will stay in touch. We can learn from each other. If it is possible, I ask him to send on information on how his department of education is working towards identifying Ukrainian teachers. Marino College, in Deputy Haughey's constituency, has a very good migrant teacher programme which it has been working on for years. It is looking to expand that. Any information that the ambassador could give us in terms of identifying Ukrainian teachers might be of help to us. I again thank him. As a committee, we want to keep this issue very much on the agenda. History is repeating itself, unfortunately. I remember reading Dynamo, a football book set against the backdrop of 1942 when Operation Barbarossa was very much part of Kyiv. At the time I read it, I thought all of this was behind us and would never happen again. Reality bites, and it has bitten really hard this time.  It is important for us as a country that is part of the European Union to not just show solidarity but to keep this issue very live on the agenda. We will stay in touch with the ambassadors of individual countries along the eastern Baltic. We had a great five-hour meeting last week. We do not want to dip in and out of this issue; we want to have continuity because this is an important juncture in the history of the world. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainians. We look forward to further engagement.I thank the ambassador for his honesty and openness, and his diplomatic skills with some of the questions. We certainly cannot predict the future and we are grateful for his contribution today.
