JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Chairman and welcome the representatives from Bord Gáis. I also represent the north-west region. If one looks at the map and the proposed extensions of the grid from the Corrib, one will be obliged to ask why such an extensive area of the country is being discriminated against. I accept Bord Gáis must adhere to economic criteria but this is discrimination. There are other criteria which must be considered. For example, Bord Gáis is a semi-State body and the larger part of its accountability is to the State. People in County Donegal or County Mayo pay the same amount of tax as people in County Cork or County Kerry and we expect the same return from those taxes in service delivery.Rather than engaging in a process of recrimination with the representatives of the board, I would prefer to take a different approach. Mr. Walsh has indicated that he will follow-up on this matter in the form of a review. It is stated the board is keen to pursue extension opportunities. I, therefore, ask it to make contact with industry representatives in County Donegal because there are opportunities there.As regards the political dynamics, Deputy Keaveney — I am disappointed that she is not here at present — highlighted that County Donegal is far away. I agree with her. It is on the periphery of the periphery. However, it is surprising for a member of a Government party and for Senator MacSharry to make recriminatory remarks about a good and excellent semi-State company. Perhaps Bord Gáis is merely following Government policy. As the Chairman is aware, there has been a €600 million underspend of national development plan funds in the BMW region. That is taxpayer's money which has not been spent. It is, therefore, somewhat rich of Senator MacSharry and Deputy Keaveney to start shouting and roaring as if they were in opposition. They are members of a Government party which is accountable to the people for the distribution of funds and taxpayer's money.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will conclude——
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——by saying I do not blame Bord Gáis for pursuing its current policy because it is being led in that direction. It believes this is the way forward and that the north west should be excluded. We can renegotiate and reconsider the possibilities and opportunities for the north west. A schoolchild looking at the map to which I referred would ask why the region was being discriminated against and excluded. We are mature enough to have a working relationship and should follow up on this matter.I commend the two Fianna Fáil representatives to whom I referred on their excellent Opposition-like skills.
