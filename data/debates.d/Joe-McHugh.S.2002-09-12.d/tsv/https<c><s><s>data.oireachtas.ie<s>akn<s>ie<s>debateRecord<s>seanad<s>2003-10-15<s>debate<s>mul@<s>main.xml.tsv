JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Salmon fish farming has been an economic success story in County Donegal, specifically on the Fanad peninsula where the hydro fisheries have been developed under Norwegian influence. Fish farming has made the local community vibrant, as well as helping local people to remain in the region. The fish farming sector is concerned, however, that lice is a major problem. Only two products are currently available for the treatment of lice but neither is combating it. In fact, some lice are becoming immune to both products. The Minister should investigate whoever sanctioned the use of these products â€“ it may have been the Irish Medicines Board. A broader range of products is required to combat lice in the fish farming industry.While much media attention has been focused on the fish kills in County Donegal, there has been a lack of co-operation between the Departments involved. Ultimately, the Department of Agriculture and Food has responsibility for investigating fish kills, so there should be more communication between it and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in order to deal with fish kills, such as those that occurred in County Donegal recently.
