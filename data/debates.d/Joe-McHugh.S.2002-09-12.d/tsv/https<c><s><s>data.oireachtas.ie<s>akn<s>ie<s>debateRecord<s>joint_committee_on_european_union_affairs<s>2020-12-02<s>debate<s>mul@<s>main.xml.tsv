JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Howlin and Senators McDowell and Doherty. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Michael Shotter, director of migration and protection at the European Commission. Today's engagement will allow us to explore the migration and asylum pact in more detail. Before we begin, I must advise Mr. Shotter that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given. I ask him to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I wish to advise witnesses giving evidence from a location outside of the parliamentary precincts that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attending to give evidence to committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on whether, or the extent to which, evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime. If a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, he or she must respect that direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I now invite Mr. Shotter to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Shotter. With the agreement of the committee we will go into private session for a few minutes. The broadband connectivity drops out every little while. We were able to hear his presentation but it is not clear. We will go into private session for a few minutes. He might disconnect or move to a better location.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Shotter again for his contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Shotter. I have a few questions and I will try to be as brief as possible. With regard to the debate and conversations prior to those on the future of Europe, could Mr. Shotter indicate how the debate on migration should be factored in? Should it have the same prominence as the green transformation and the rule of law, for example, in upcoming deliberations before those on the future of Europe? I like Mr. Shotter's jigsaw apparatus. We sometimes get a little disillusioned with some of the EU's institutional jargon but, at the same time, jargon is important to get the conversation going. Community should be an integral part of any conversation on migration. The EU has a great track record and footprint in respect of supporting our peace process. In the early 1990s and mid-1990s, a lot of funding was channelled through the peace and reconciliation programme. There were various programs to build up capacity at community and local levels after the conflict. It was basically a question of empowering communities. On migration, are we doing enough to empower communities at local level and to allay genuine fears about the dignity of people looking for asylum and trying to integrate into communities? Are we doing enough to place community and community capacity-building at the heart of our deliberations on migration? My last point is a general one based on my insights from having been to Jordan and Lebanon. In both countries, around 25% of the people are seeking asylum or are in camps, to one degree or another. Countries such as Uganda facilitate large numbers coming from South Sudan. Are we doing enough to provide pathways for graduate teachers within the EU to work with the Red Cross or United Nations to provide assistance to people in their own countries? We should bear in mind the track record and patterns in this regard. I must put up my own hand in that, in 1995, I went to the Middle East as a teacher, not for the remuneration although an attraction of the Middle East is that teachers get well paid there.As a young teacher in 1995, had a pathway or opportunity been provided I would rather have had the opportunity to go to Africa to do some support work. Are we providing enough pathways for our European Union graduates to spend time in places like Africa or to help out in dealing with the enormous education needs of people who are seeking asylum and so on? I thank Mr. Shotter for attending this morning and for his insights and experience in this area, which will be extremely important in mapping out a comprehensive new pathway for the way we deal with migration. 
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Ó Murchú would like to come in again if that is okay with Mr. Shotter.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le Michael Shotter as ucht a theacht go dtí an coiste inniu. I thank him for coming to the committee today. Is léir go bhfuil na rudaí sa díospóireacht, solúbthacht agus dlúthpháirtíocht, iontach tábhachtach fosta. It is clear that flexibility and solidarity are part of the debate agus ag croí na díospóireachta, at the heart of the debate. Gabhaim buíochas le mo chomhghleacaithe uilig. I thank my own colleagues. Gabhaim buíochas arís le Michael Shotter fá choinne a chuid ama agus a dhíograis maidir leis an ábhar tábhachtach seo.  I again thank Mr. Shotter for participating in the discussion on this very important subject.
