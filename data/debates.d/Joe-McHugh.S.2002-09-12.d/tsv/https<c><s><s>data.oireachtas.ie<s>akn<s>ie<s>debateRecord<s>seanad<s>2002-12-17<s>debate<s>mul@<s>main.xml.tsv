JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with Senator McCarthy's comments about local government reform. I will not be supporting any dissolution of the dual mandate unless certain conditions are attached.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to raise the matter of the consultancy fees for feasibility studies that have been commissioned by the Government. Yesterday, following a meeting with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, in Donegal, it came to light that many projects will not be implemented over the next two or three years. As everyone is aware, new feasibility studies will have to be commissioned after that period. A debate is needed on the issues of value for money and the basis on which projects are selected. Government expenditure must become more efficient because a great deal of money is being wasted.The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has undertaken to contact the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his Department regarding the salvaging of the Downings Harbour development project in Donegal which has been halted. As it is imperative this project should go ahead, will the Leader also communicate to the Minister the support of this House for that project?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If I am satisfied with certain conditions.
