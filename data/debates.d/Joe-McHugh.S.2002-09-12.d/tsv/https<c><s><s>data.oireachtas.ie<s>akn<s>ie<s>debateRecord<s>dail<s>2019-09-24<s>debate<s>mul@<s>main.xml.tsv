JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the Department's position on primary school places in the Rathcoole area. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, the Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, the Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels. Where data indicates that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools, providing a new school or schools, or a combination of these. The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools. It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. Parents have the right to choose which school to apply to and where the school has places available, the pupil should be admitted. However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants. As the Deputy is aware, the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, which was signed into law by the President on 18 July 2018, is important legislation that will introduce a more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country and a fair and balanced school admission process for all pupils. As the Deputy is also aware, in April 2018, the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, including a new eight-classroom school to be established in September 2020 to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by the Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. I recently announced that five of the new primary schools being established between 2020 and 2022 are being designated for Irish-medium education, including the new eight-classroom primary school to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area. The new school will be located in the Saggart and Citywest area. It is adjacent to the Tallaght school planning area in which there is no Gaelscoil. The Department is conscious that Rathcoole is an area of growing demographic demand and additional residential development, and the Department is actively reviewing the potential need to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole. In respect of meeting current demand for primary school places, the Department approved additional temporary accommodation for Scoil Chrónáin primary school in 2018 and 2019.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the sense of urgency. I also appreciate the intensity of development in different parts of the country and obviously in the Newcastle, Saggart and Rathcoole area. That is a school planning area. I deliberately separated out Rathcoole in my second last paragraph.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The former Deputy, Frances Fitzgerald, MEP, and Deputy Curran have outlined very clearly that there is a distinct need in that particular area. We are reviewing the potential to establish a new primary school in Rathcoole. That means collecting as much data as possible from planning permissions for future developments as well as for ongoing developments. I know he is not talking about the future but about the here and now. He is saying there is a need today with children travelling to different places. The data from the principals of the two existing schools on the parents who tried unsuccessfully to get children into school in September will be very helpful. Those data will be collated. We will look at planning permissions. We will look at existing demographics. It is a very young population, as the Deputy outlined previously. When I said we are reviewing it, I do not mean we are looking at it as a way of letting him that things will be grand and we will get on with what is in place. We are serious about areas like this. If there is demand in a particular area, we will give it serious consideration. This is the second time I have discussed this issue in the House. I know I may have put on the record information I have given previously. It is important to disseminate that information publicly. A unit in the Department proactively examines future population projection and we will give it serious consideration.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to update the House on the position with respect to Holy Family national school in Mullingar. The House will recall that there have been significant delays in the delivery of this project. These delays arose initially because of unforeseen ground conditions and other similar issues that can arise on any building project. However, in recent months, I have been disappointed that progress on site has been extremely slow and we are still not entirely clear as to why this has been the case. The most recent programme provided by the contractor for this project indicated a completion date of late October. There was an initial acceleration of activity on site at the time this programme was provided. However, I regret having to report to the House that neither the Department nor Westmeath County Council, to which the project has been devolved for delivery, is satisfied with how these works have progressed in recent weeks. The House will be aware that a number of matters have been raised through the dispute resolution mechanisms of the public works contract in respect of this project, as would normally happen in major building projects. The resolution of these issues is now at a critical juncture. A meeting will take place later this week in that respect. This meeting will be attended by officials from Westmeath County Council, supported by its design team. Officials from my Department will also be in attendance. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the proactivity of Westmeath County Council and the design team in trying to move this forward. Given this, I cannot get into detail on the matters that are the subject of this conciliation process except to say, in broad terms, that they are technical issues and the issue of delays. A revised programme is also being sought in that context and we also expect to get greater clarity on why the project has been so significantly delayed. I hope that these and all outstanding matters can be addressed through this process. I also hope that it will provide an outcome that we can be satisfied with. Such an outcome will be confidential. However, I hope that in finding a resolution to all these matters, there can then be no reason for the project not to move forward at pace.It is of the greatest concern to me that the pupils, staff and school community of Holy Family national school are not yet in situ in a school which was initially scheduled for completion in September 2018. However, I am thankful to the patron and school management of both Holy Family national school and St. Etchen's in Kinnegad who have gone out of their way to arrange for the provision of temporary school accommodation for the special needs pupils impacted on by the delays. We are also thankful to St. Loman's GAA Club for its assistance in providing extra classroom space for the pupils of Holy Family national school. It is hugely disappointing that it has been necessary to activate these contingency arrangements, but we remain hopeful they will only be needed for a short while. Until then Westmeath County Council will continue to keep the school authority and patron body fully informed of progress on site. At the same time, officials from my Department will continue to liaise with the patron of Holy Family national school on contingency arrangements should the project be delayed further. I sincerely hope we will be in a position in the coming days to provide the Holy Family school authority with some further clarification on progress on site. More particularly, we hope progress from now on will be to everyone's satisfaction. I do enter a caveat because I have already stood in front of the Deputy when he raised this issue and outlined a timeframe. I understand the intensity of feeling in his community is palpable and has moved beyond frustration. I appeal to the contractor to meet the challenge head on. There are contractual obligations that I am not going to get into. I appeal at a human level to the people delivering the project to for one second feel the frustration and anger felt at so many false dawns in its delivery.  I again thank the Deputy for raising the issue. Not a week goes without him being on to me about it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy that the meeting on Friday is important. There should be a degree of honesty and cards should be put on the table because the community deserves nothing less than to find out whether it is happening. I will not say anything more about what may happen after the meeting. So many good groups and people are working on the project. I met them on site when the Deputy invited me to visit it. They all want the project to happen, but we live in the real world too and perhaps there are reasons it is not happening. However, honesty is required. I am making a personal appeal to the contractor to meet the community head-on for the first time and be as honest as possible. There have been too many false dawns and expectations have been heightened. It is an issue for the entire constituency and other Deputies have raised the issue here. I thank Deputy Burke for keeping it alive. Let us see what happens on Friday and I hope that, with a degree of honesty, we will make progress.
