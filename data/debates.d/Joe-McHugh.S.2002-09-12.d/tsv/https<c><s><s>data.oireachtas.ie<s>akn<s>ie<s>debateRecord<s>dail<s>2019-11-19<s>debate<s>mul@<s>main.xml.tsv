JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas as an cheist. Chuala mé an díospóireacht thar an choicís faoin chonspóid agus chuala mé an díospóireacht agus an comhrá faoi na deacrachtaí. Tá an scrúdú nua le teacht isteach den chéad uair in 2020. Beidh imní ar dhaoine faoin am atá ann chun é a chríochnú. Beidh cruinniú agam le mo chuid oifigeach agus leis an State Examinations Commission Déardaoin seo chugainn faoi na rudaí sin. The development of students’ oral language skills is to the fore in the new specifications for Irish at junior cycle. The previous oral examination was optional and was taken by approximately 40% of students. The new assessment arrangements, on the other hand, require all students to engage in an assessment of their oral skills through classroom-based assessment. This gives a greater opportunity for all students to develop and enhance their oral language proficiency skills over the three years of the junior cycle and to foster their ability to use the Irish language. The assessment of these skills forms an integral component of the overall language learning experience and occurs in a number of ways.  As well as the completion of tasks where students use and demonstrate their oral language skills to achieve specific learning outcomes, their oral language skills are also formally assessed through the two new classroom-based assessments. The second classroom-based assessment, in particular, is entirely based on students’ oral language competence. It is linked to ongoing classroom exchanges and represents a more authentic reflection of students’ interests and competence levels in Irish. Importantly, the oral skills of all students will now be assessed in classroom-based assessments and formally reported upon in each student’s junior cycle profile of achievement.  My Department remains committed to encouraging the use of spoken Irish. The development of the new curriculum specifications for Irish at junior cycle was informed by research and extensive consultation with the education partners, including practising teachers and students. Extensive continuing professional development is being provided to teachers and is complemented by a range of other supports. The new approach gives better recognition to the development of students’ oral competence, including their ability to speak Irish, over the three years of the junior cycle. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Deputy raising this issue because this is a subject area which requires deliberation. We have introduced interventions in the Gaeltacht area, including the tumoideachas, the Gaeltacht recognition scheme, which is working well. It is hard to believe that even in recent years some Gaeltacht schools taught through the medium of English. That has all changed and there is now 100% take-up at post-primary level and 80% take-up at primary level. We have to get to a position in our English medium schools whereby we can examine what is working. A lot of good stuff is working and many teachers have been very creative in bringing the love of the Irish language into the classroom. The motivation behind the new curriculum is to try to ensure more communication at junior certificate level and continuity in the transition from primary to secondary level. That is why I initiated the content and integrated language learning, CILL, pilot project which involves ensuring that young people are learning Irish through physical education, mathematics and other subject areas. I take on board the Deputy's comments on difficulties raised by teachers in respect of the sample paper. I will speak to my officials on Thursday to bring these issues to the fore if there is enough time available.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Aontaím leis na pointí deireanacha a rinne an Teachta maidir leis an bhean atá ag obair in RTÉ. Aontaím freisin faoin leanúnachas agus an díospóireacht faoin teanga. Sílim gur chóir do dhaoine tosú níos óige, roimh an scoil, agus go mbeadh leanúnachas ann tríd an bhunscoil agus an mheánscoil ina dhiaidh sin. Ba chóir do pháistí a bheith ag foghlaim na teanga go nádúrtha agus i mbealach sóisialta, ag labhairt lena gcairde agus iad ag súgradh, lena dtuismitheoirí sa siopa, nó lena gcomharsana trí Ghaeilge. Is iad sin rudaí nádúrtha. Tá athbheochan ag tarlú sa Ghaeilge, agus tá suim ag daoine, tuismitheoirí agus múinteoirí scoile, inti. Teastaíonn cuidiú ó mhúinteoirí maidir leis na scileanna a bheidh uathu. Beidh muid ag bogadh na n-ábhar le chéile maidir le CLIL agus beidh acmhainní breise faoina choinne sin thar trí bliana. Tá muid ag amharc freisin ar na scoileanna lán-Bhéarla agus ag iarraidh go mbeidh níos mó solúbthachta agus suntasachta acu amach anseo d’fhoghlaim na Gaeilge.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht a cheiste. A new model for allocating special education teachers was introduced for mainstream primary and post-primary schools from September 2017. It is designed to distribute special education teaching resources fairly to schools, taking into account the profiled needs of each school. The total number of special education teachers has increased by 38% since 2011, from 9,740 in 2011 to more than 13,500 now. The manner in which the updated profiles have been developed since September is set out in the Department of Education and Skills' circulars 007/2019 and 008/2019. The school profiles take account of a number of components, including a baseline component provided to every mainstream school to support inclusion and early intervention, and which is based on school enrolment numbers. Also taken into account is the number of pupils with complex needs enrolled into the school, the learning support needs of pupils in the school, as evidenced by standardised test results, and the social context of the school including disadvantage and gender. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, working group report, ‘ A New Model for Allocating Additional Teaching Resources for Students with Special Educational Needs’, published in 2014, recommended the new profiled allocation model. The report noted that international research has shown that there is a significantly higher incidence of the overall male-to-female ratio in special education. The report cites a range of research evidence which indicates that boys predominate in most disability categories. This is particularly the case with behavioural needs. For this reason, the NCSE recommended that schools' profiles should take some account of a school's gender breakdown. The percentage of the overall allocation for gender currently represents 4.35% of the profiled allocation for primary schools and 2.15% of the allocation for post primary schools. I am satisfied that the NCSE recommendation is valid.  Should new research on differentials prevalent between boys and girls be published in future, this can be taken into account for the next review of the allocations.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to ask my officials to look at this issue and identify what is the most recent and up-to-date research. This evidence is based on international research dating back to 2014. If we look at the trajectory here regarding special needs provision from 2011 to this year, there has been an increase in special needs assistants, SNAs, from 10,000 up to 17,000 next September. There has been an enormous impact in the context of meeting increased demand and dealing with those capacity issues as they arise. The NCSE constantly monitors international best practice as well. As I speak, a major conference at which practices in places such as New Brunswick in Canada and Portugal are being examined is under way. The NCSE is very open to exploring what is happening at international level. If new evidence shows more of an equilibrium between boys and girls, we will be open to taking it on board.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	All international evidence is pointing to this approach. I would be happy to forward supporting information to the joint committee. I have no problem doing that. I alluded to the report from 2014, which stated:Clear international evidence exists of a gender imbalance in the incidence of disabilities, special education enrolments and academic achievement (OECD, 2003, Mitchell, 2010, Banks & McCoy, 2011). Since the 1960s, the overall male to female ratio in special education has been 2:1 to 3:1. Reviews of US literature show boys predominating in every disability category except for deaf/blindness.Times change, things change and statistics change. However, I am happy to go back to the NCSE to see if there is any evidence pointing to changes in the incidence in the context of boys and girls. At the moment, it is definitely pointing towards more incidence among boys than girls.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I express again my sympathy for the victims of sexual abuse and acknowledge the trauma they suffered. As the Deputy will be aware, the ex gratia scheme was established on foot of the specific circumstances arising from and in response to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, ECHR, relating to Ms Louise O'Keeffe. Ireland submits biannual action plans to the relevant committee of ministers which is responsible for supervising the implementation of the judgment of the ECHR. The ex gratia scheme is not the sole vehicle through which compensation for sexual abuse in day schools has been paid out. Between 2005 and 2018, settlements involving the payment of compensation by the State to victims of day school child sexual abuse have been made to 22 claimants. Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill, acting as an independent assessor to the scheme, was asked to review the cases of 19 applicants who had not been successful in their application to the scheme. On foot of his determinations, payments are being made to a number of victims of child sexual abuse in day schools. The current position is that 16 offers of payment have been made and, to date, eight have been accepted. Further payments will be made upon acceptance of the remaining offers. In the aftermath of the independent assessor's determinations, my Department committed to reviewing the ex gratia scheme in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General. I am sure the Deputy will understand the complexity and sensitivity of the issues involved that require very careful deliberation before proposals can be finalised and brought to Government. However, I fully understand and appreciate the urgency involved in this matter, as noted by the Deputy. I expect my officials to present me with draft proposals in the coming weeks for my consideration.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am treating this matter with the most urgent attention and I will continue to do so. I met the Attorney General earlier today on this issue and he also appreciates the urgency involved. The Attorney General also articulated the complexity that surround this issue, which the Deputy will respect. We want to get this right. We had previous decisions by Government and there has been political interaction with the Judiciary. When the High Court and Supreme Court make a decision, we work from their interpretation. An independent assessor was commissioned to do a particular job. In advance of his determination, the Taoiseach and I both stated on the public record that we would abide by and follow through on the independent assessor's determination, whatever it was. We will continue to do that. I appreciate the urgency around this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is nothing more horrendous than to take away the innocence of young people. As a society, we have had a history of that and we have to be very vigilant in that regard. That is why we have been insistent and have focused on ensuring we have proper child protection measures in place through legislation. The Deputy stated that if he was Minister, he would implore the Attorney General to move on this matter as quickly as possible. I have been doing that and will continue to do so. I am confident we will have a report back within the next few weeks.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The decision making authority for any amalgamation belongs to the patron or trustees of the school, and this is subject to my Department's approval. The Department understands that the timing of the amalgamation is being considered in the context of the delivery of the building project. It awaits confirmation from the patron in this regard. A building project to provide a new 16-classroom primary school with special educational needs base to facilitate the amalgamation is currently progressing through the architectural planning process. Statutory approvals have been obtained and the project is currently at stage 3, which is the tender stage of the architectural planning process. Whether I am the tenth Minister, although I believe I am the fortieth Minister since the foundation of the State, I will be happy to keep progress and momentum on this to the fore.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The land was signed over on 9 October. Approvals have been obtained and the project is at the tender stage. Tenders are due for return by 22 November. The tender process has been extended on a number of occasions, and I appreciate the frustration that the boards of management, parents, students and teaching staff have gone through regarding the delays, but this was to allow for the resolution of some legalities relating to the site and no further extensions to the tender return date are anticipated. I do not expect any delays in the return of tenders on 22 November.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to separate the amalgamation from the tendering process. The amalgamation is being considered in the context of the delivery of the building project, but we await confirmation from the patron. It is on the amalgamation that we await confirmation from the patron.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I also wish to put on the record that the site was not gifted. I will not go into the details of that here today.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No, it was not.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the frustration involved in the delay of the building project and the competing demands at an educational level in this school. I will be vigilant and ensure that we keep moving forward on it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy will be aware, the provision of a stand-alone extension project for the school to which he refers has been devolved for delivery to Donegal Education and Training Board, DETB. As Minister for Education and Skills and a Deputy for Donegal, I am delighted to report that there has been significant progress on the revised design for the project, which has been developed by the new architect. I can inform the Deputy that the main aspects of this revised design have been examined by officials and they are satisfied that it will provide for improved new building layouts for the project. The architect is now working with the rest of the design team with a view to providing my Department with a revised stage 2A submission as soon as possible and is targeting this to be done by the end of the year. The timeline for the planning process will be a key factor for determining the overall delivery timeline for the project. The Deputy will also be aware that surveys to investigate issues with the school's main existing building were recently carried out. An initial report was provided to my Department, on foot of which further surveys were undertaken. A final report is being prepared and this will inform a decision on the best approach to addressing the issues raised in these reports. I am also pleased to say that refurbishment works on the existing temporary accommodation on site and access for all works on the existing main building were successfully completed over the summer. I thank the school community for its patience as we worked through the provision of this improved accommodation and the DETB officials for their hard work in delivering it. I understand the need for this project to progress and the efforts of the school and local parents to highlight this. I have met the school and parents about this project and I am fully committed to providing the funding necessary to complete the stand-alone extension and to resolve the issues with the existing building.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is deeply frustrating for me and the officials that there is a new building, built in 2005, on which we must go back and do a survey. That is the first frustration. The second, as the Deputy is aware, is that we had to replace the architect at the beginning of the summer. We had to go to a new architect and sit down with a new design for the building because other expressed wishes had come from the teachers and parents. We now have a new design. I expressly wanted to put the pressure on to ensure that we get it across the line as quickly as possible. There will be no stone unturned at Department level but we are waiting on the design team and architect. The matter is with them now. They have to make their observations, and as soon as they are ready, we are ready to go for approval to go for planning, so it is a question of how quickly we can get that across the line. The feedback from the Department is that the new team that is working on this has been more than diligent, co-operative, helpful and professional. It is a question of getting it right now. It is up to them to get the information back to the Department and we will move from there.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is no question about the commitment relating to this project. I met the principal, Mr. Anthony Doogan, in Moville on the Monday before last. He is satisfied with the level of progress and in his leadership position within the school he must manage expectations and frustrations along the way. Nevertheless, he is satisfied with the progress being made and the work of the design team and architect. It is full steam ahead and as soon as the report comes to the Department with the required information, there will be nothing standing in the way to move this to planning. We can keep the momentum after that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, is the main policy initiative of my Department to address educational disadvantage at school level. The DEIS programme provides for smaller class sizes and other supports, including additional teaching posts, home school community liaison co-ordinators, DEIS grants, enhanced book grants, curriculum supports, priority access to continuing professional development and the school excellence fund for DEIS. Evidence from the evaluation of the DEIS programme to date demonstrates that it is having a positive effect on tackling educational disadvantage. The rationale for allocating resources and supports based on a school's level of concentrated disadvantage is based on the existence of a multiplier effect whereby students attending a school with a high concentration of students from disadvantaged backgrounds have poorer academic outcomes, even taking account of individual social background. This approach is supported by national and international research. In the 2019 to 2020 school year there are 891 schools in the DEIS programme serving in excess of 185,000 pupils. This represents approximately 20% of the overall school population. My Department will spend in the region of €125 million in 2019 on the DEIS programme. That does not include school meals from a different Department. My Department is now in the final stages of further data analysis on the new identification model to allow for the development of a resource allocation model to match resources to identified need. In addition, there is a broad range of courses, programmes and supports available to increase transition to both further education and training and higher education for under-represented groups, including those from lower socioeconomic groups. These include initiatives under the programme for access to higher education, PATH, the student assistance fund and student grant schemes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	DEIS has been an outstanding success story and when it was introduced, there were fears around the stigma that would be associated with the programme. That was very quickly dispensed with because of the support mechanisms put in place and the progression by students, not just to third level but also to training and apprenticeships. The statistics bear that out. Disadvantage is no longer looked at on a geographical basis. Disadvantage can sometimes be very subtle or it can be acute. We are measuring it and taking this intensive analysis very seriously. As far as I am concerned, if we are to look at other school support systems, we must make a choice. It will be whether to put resources into this or not; I am certainly an advocate for DEIS and such a support system. I want us to continue moving towards a more meaningful and inclusive education system.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The planning areas are publicly available but I would be happy to forward the information to the Deputy. We sit on a cross-departmental group that takes homelessness as a very specific and important issue. If Deputy Thomas Byrne wishes to raise any specific matters with me in that regard, I would be happy to take that information. I will take the note he mentioned and his comments highlight the complexity of the challenges and pressures that schools feel in different areas. That is whether they are dealing with criminal gangs, homelessness, anxiety or different coping, familial or society issues for students. The people at the coalface are the teachers and I get feedback from them on a daily basis when I meet them. It is that the challenges are changing but are very complex and evolving. We must be very supportive in that process.I reiterate the DEIS programme is a targeted supportive system. There are other schools not in the DEIS programme that I strongly believe should be in it, and that is why we are considering a targeted intervention. It will come down to the question of resources, but I am certainly happy to support further expansion in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Forbraíodh na ciorcláin nua maidir leis an díolúine ó staidéar na Gaeilge mar fhreagra ar athbhreithniú a rinne cigireacht na Roinne ar an mbeartas agus ar an gcleachtas maidir le díolúintí a phróiseáil agus a dheonú i scoileanna. Leagtar amach sna ciorcláin sin, a bhfuil feidhm acu maidir le scoileanna Béarla amháin, na cúinsí eisceachtúla faoina bhféadfar díolúine a dheonú. Tá prionsabail an chuimsithe mar bhonn agus taca acu agus tá sé mar aidhm acu tacú le scoileanna chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar éagsúlacht leathan riachtanas trí eispéireas foghlama difreáilte a sholáthar do dhaltaí i dtimpeallacht uilechuimsitheach scoile. Mar atá leagtha amach sna ciorcláin, táthar ag súil le scoileanna a spreagadh chun deiseanna a thabhairt do na daltaí uile, a mhéad agus is féidir, páirt a ghlacadh i ngníomhaíochtaí Gaeilge agus cultúrtha ar leibhéal a oireann dá riachtanais foghlama, lena n-áirítear na leanaí sin ar deonaíodh díolúine dóibh. Maidir le cumarsáid a rinneadh, chuathas i gcomhairle leis na hAirí go léir, lena n-áirítear an Aire Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta, maidir le mo thograí trí mheabhrán don Rialtas. Bhí cumarsáid ar leibhéal oifigiúil idir mo Roinn agus an Roinn Cultúir, Oidhreachta agus Gaeltachta. Rinneadh é sin sa bhreis ar an gcomhairliúchán poiblí a reáchtáladh lenar tugadh deis do gach duine mo thograí a bhreithniú.  Sainaithnítear sna ciorcláin an stádas speisialta atá ag an nGaeilge, tacaíonn siad le múineadh agus foghlaim na Gaeilge ag leibhéal na bunscoile agus na hiarbhunscoile agus dearbhaíonn siad tacaíocht an Rialtais d'fhorbairt agus do chaomhnú na Gaeilge de réir na straitéise 20 bliain.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I dtús báire, tá sé soiléir go raibh comhairliúchán cuimsitheach i gceist. Ghlac níos mó ná 11,000 duine páirt sa chomhairliúchán cuimsitheach agus thug siad a dtuairimí dúinn. Ghlac a lán daoine páirt roimh Nollaig. Sin é an fáth gur chuir mé breis ama ar fáil don chomhairliúchán. Bhí níos mó daoine ag iarraidh páirt a ghlacadh. Bhí formhór na ndaoine ag an am sin ag rá go raibh athrú de dhíth maidir leis na díolúintí. Tháinig siad isteach sna 1990í agus bhí cinneadh nua de dhíth. Ó thaobh bealaí foirmiúla maidir leis an chomhrá idir na hAirí de, tá próiseas ann. Tá dualgas orainn próiseas reachtúil agus foirmiúil a reáchtáil tríd an Roinn Rialtais. Chuala mé smaointe an Teachta ó thaobh plé leis an choiste ach bhí cuid mhór díospóireachta ann ag achan leibhéal. Táim ag fanacht ar na sonraí. Níl sonraí agam maidir leis an athrú a tháinig isteach i mí Mheán Fómhair.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Nuair a thagann an crú ar an tairne, nó i ndeireadh an lae, táimse freagrach as an chinneadh maidir leis an churaclam úr atá ag teacht isteach. Roimhe seo, bhí comhrá idir na Ranna éagsúla. Maidir leis an straitéis 20 bliain, tá cumarsáid ar siúl i gcónaí idir an Roinn Cultúir, Gaeltachta agus Oileán, mo Roinn féin, an Roinn Leanaí agus Gnóthaí Óige, agus na Ranna ábhartha eile uilig maidir le hathruithe atá ag teacht. Mar shampla, bhí comhairliúchán cuimsitheach idir oifigigh maidir leis an scéim aitheantais. Tá na hoifigigh i gcónaí ag labhairt le chéile agus ag déanamh cumarsáide maidir leis na hathruithe polasaí atá le teacht. I ndeireadh an lae, táimse féin freagrach as an athrú agus as an chinneadh atá déanta. Bhí comhairliúchán cuimsitheach ann leis an phobal agus bhí rudaí foirmiúla ó thaobh teagmhála de idir oifigigh agus idir Ranna ann freisin.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le Teachta Burton as an cheist. The permanent project for the school referred to by the Deputy is being delivered under my Department's design and build programme.  Key factors that can impact on the timeline for any new school project are the availability of a site and the planning permission process for the new school building.  A site was identified and will be available for this new school.  This has enabled the design process for the new school building to be undertaken.  Pre-planning meetings have been held with the local authority. The latter has requested a further meeting to review the proposed drawings prior to submission of the planning application.  This meeting took place yesterday, 18 November, and it is envisaged that a planning application will be submitted shortly.  The planning permission process will be a key factor for determining the timeline for the delivery of this project. My Department's officials have kept the school authority fully briefed in relation to this project and the anticipated delivery timelines in respect of same. Along with the Taoiseach, my Department is working to have the first phase of the school's permanent accommodation handed over by September of 2021 with phase 2 to follow in a matter of months.The delivery date of September 2021 for phase 1 is dependent on no delays arising during the planning permission processes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are in the middle of a process to get to September 2021, but whatever availability or demand there is, we have an obligation to do that, and we do it. I have visited the different parts of the more pressured areas. I was in Lucan yesterday and I know there is a question tabled for today in respect of north Kildare. I am aware of the enormous pressures that exist. There are new planning permissions coming on stream and there is more and more demand for places. The best approach to all of this is to ensure that we get things right, that we are in the right place and that we identify where the demands are. With a very important project such as this the planning permission will determine the timeframe. Unfortunately, this is something over which I do not have any control but I assure Deputy Burton that once we get through this process and get through the planning process, nothing will be left behind in the context of the sense of urgency relating to this matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have a dedicated team in the forward planning section in Tullamore. They take into consideration existing pressures and existing levels of demand, along with future planning permissions. They work very closely with the different local authorities. That relationship is key for the forward planning and to make progress in order to ensure that we meet the demand in the future is very important. This school is important for the area and it is vital that we get it right. I hope there will be no delays with the planning process and that we will get out the other end in order to get this done on time.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy is aware that a building project for the school to which he refers is included in my Department's capital programme to be delivered as part of the national development plan. The project brief is being finalised and this is expected to be completed shortly. The patron, Cork Education and Training Board, recently provided additional information sought by my Department to facilitate this process. My Department will be in further contact with the patron when the project brief process has been completed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I assure the Deputy there will be no delay. The project brief is being finalised and it is expected to be completed shortly.
JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline the Department's position regarding secondary school places in Kildare North. I happened to speak to a principal of a primary school in Kilcock yesterday on another matter. There is a Donegal connection there. She clearly outlined the future pressures in the area, and it was good to hear that analysis. Deputy Durkan is seeking a forensic assessment. We have a diligent team working in every school planning area and much of the work has already been looked at. In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas - in north Kildare, there are six such areas, including Kilcock - and uses a geographical information system, which utilises data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary levels. Where data indicate that additional provision is required, its delivery is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may be provided through one, or a combination of, the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; and provision of a new school or schools. The question of enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of their managerial authorities. It is their responsibility to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act 1998 and the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018. My Department has other major projects ongoing at post-primary schools in north Kildare, including a new 1,000-pupil school for Celbridge community school. This school is currently in interim accommodation pending a new permanent school. The project is at site purchase phase. A new 1,000-pupil school for Maynooth community college is expected to be completed for the 2020-2021 school year. A new replacement school for Maynooth post-primary school is also expected to be completed for the 2020-21 school year. The project to expand St. Farnan's post-primary school in Prosperous to cater for 1,000 pupils was recently devolved to the Kildare and Wicklow ETB and a design team was recently appointed. To address the issue of a school raised by one of the Deputies, my Department has approved an additional school accommodation project for Scoil Dara in Kilcock. This will deliver five new mainstream classrooms to allow the school to expand to 1,000 pupils. This project also includes the provision of additional specialist rooms. My Department is assessing an application from Clane community school for new specialist rooms and the replacement of existing temporary accommodation.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I again thank the Deputies for raising this matter, since it gives me an opportunity to talk to my officials about long-term planning in particular areas. Without going over what has been said about additional accommodation for Scoil Dara, I wish to tell the Deputies and parents who are concerned about what will happen next September that there are solutions that we can, and will, put in place. If that means providing additional temporary accommodation at Scoil Dara long before next September, we are prepared to do that. The Deputies might use their communications and networking with the school authority to encourage it to submit an application to the Department for temporary accommodation in order to get us over the vacuum of uncertainty. That vacuum drives parents nuts because they do not know when something will happen. We need a temporary solution for next September. Let us get that sorted. There was a suggestion about Enfield's patronage. We will keep the process moving. The preliminary stage for acquiring additional accommodation at Scoil Dara has been devolved to the school. I am happy to provide assistance to the school, but let us keep this moving. Parents and the wider community attended the public meeting. Public meetings can be heated and become forums for expressing frustration, but whatever needs to be done to ensure that students are sitting at desks next September will be done.
