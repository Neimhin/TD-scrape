JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the calls for a debate on suicide. The issue is predominantly concerned with the mental health of young males. In view of this, perhaps the debate should be widened to cover other mental health issues involving young men, especially given their involvement in violent crime and drug and solvent abuse. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is very competent and open to considering intervention measures in this area. Society has a responsibility to address the issue because young men are dying.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The message coming through the media is that this is a predominantly urban problem affecting places such as Limerick, Cork and Dublin. Senators Brady and Brian Hayes may be in a better position to talk about this issue from first hand experience in their own areas. The closest town to my home is Letterkenny, a growing urban centre – people are beginning to speak about it attaining city status. There are already drugs in Letterkenny. I am concerned about social and infrastructural intervention and about the funding of the drugs strategy in regional centres.The Minister of State referred to community-based pilot projects. The Government now has an opportunity to consider seriously the needs of our young people, who are the future of the country. I am convinced that many of the problems of youth intervention arise from the interdepartmental approach. I have already called for the setting up of a Department of Youth Affairs. Young people's problems are discussed by adults, not by young people. By involving young people in community-based projects and ensuring that they are heard in democratically elected fora and through the implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001, we will be in a better position to address their concerns.Although the dissemination of information to schools is valuable, young people are more receptive to information gained in community-based education fora. This was demonstrated in Letterkenny in a community-based project run by youth leaders where there was not a formal school structure. Only through proper mechanisms, a Department of Youth Affairs, the full implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001 and the employment of hands-on youth workers in each area, whether urban or rural, will we be able to take a co-ordinated approach to long-term intervention. We are not listening to young people, we are not involving them and we are alienating them from society.As a long-term plan, the Government must seriously consider the establishment of a Department of Youth Affairs. Interdepartmental structures merely add further to the layers of bureaucracy. We have seen meetings, meetings about meetings, people not turning up to meetings and nothing being done. Reports, and reports about reports, are produced and consultants are hired to find out what the other consultants have said. Projects like those alluded to by the Minister of State and by Senator Brian Hayes, and which will probably be alluded to by Senator Brady, run by hands-on community workers and gardaí who can befriend young people, are the only form of successful intervention.I do not have first-hand experience of the major heroin-related problems that exist in the major cities but I am confident that my proposal is the only possible successful long-term strategy for dealing with the problems of young people. I have called on previous occasions for the establishment of a Department of Youth Affairs and on the adjournment of the House this evening I will call for the full implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001.Donegal County Council has set up the first democratically elected youth council. The council, which was elected through the schools, is a wheel which might inform the Minister of State's Department of some of the solutions proposed by young people. The only way forward is to use the mechanisms available to involve young people.I cannot speak about the problems of heroin because I do not have first-hand experience of it. I have never, to my knowledge, met a heroin addict. However, I can call for funding to be dispersed to the regions rather than focused in the larger centres. In a town like Letterkenny, which now has gateway status and may gain city status in the future, drugs may not be a problem today but they will be tomorrow.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Youth Work Bill came before this House as a result of effective lobbying by the youth work sector, including youth work providers throughout the country. The legislation represented an acknowledgement of the role of youth workers in rural and urban centres. It is now 2003, yet we are still awaiting the full implementation of the legislation through the VEC structures. It is imperative to establish those mechanisms now. I call on the Minister of State to use whatever resources are available to her to start the ball rolling.Neither the present Government nor its predecessors has recognised the usefulness of youth work, which involves intervention to help children who leave school early and have domestic problems. They may have been bullied, suffer from depression and may even have suicidal tendencies. Children who feel isolated and marginalised need to be helped through the holistic approach of youth work. Such intervention can prevent many problems, such as solvent and drug abuse, suicide, non-violent and violent crime, mental illness and apathy among young people. These are matters which we will continue to debate in the House. Sometimes we may be angry with young people's attitudes, but many of them feel they are unable to participate in a society which provides them with no useful role. If youth workers are provided with the proper mechanisms, they can begin to make progress in this regard.Preventative action is needed by the Legislature to avoid our taking a solely reactive stance to social difficulties, including violent crime and over indulgence in alcohol. We should become proactive by providing solutions, rather than wondering what has gone wrong.Voluntary work is on the decline, not because people are becoming more selfish, but because they have less time in modern society. We do not have sufficient voluntary groups because parents cannot give their free time to youth clubs due to work commitments, longer commuting periods and other factors. We will have to introduce an effective, professional youth structure within which youth workers will be paid for their services. We must take this matter seriously and demonstrate that we are willing to work with young people. In that way, society will reap the rewards and will be able to move forward.We should seek the creation of a department of youth affairs to concentrate on that large segment of the community below 25 years of age. Intervention during young people's formative years can help them to avoid taking the wrong road in life. I appreciate the Minister's presence in the House and I know her heart is in the right place concerning youth work. Hopefully, we will be able to make progress on this matter.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State. I know from listening to her that she has a passion for the subject and is genuine in her interest.
