JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I agree with Senator Daly that our confidence in the systems around us is not as advanced as one might wish.  As we live in a society with advanced telecommunications systems and information technology, we must embrace change and while so doing, we must embrace new technologies.  There are obvious benefits to the forthcoming new technologies.  For example, coastal areas that rely on coastguard emergency response units or Royal National Lifeboat Institution units cannot live without instantaneous telecommunications systems.However, the new telecommunications systems also have drawbacks.  For example, it has been noted recently that boy racers are able to use technology to anticipate the location of checkpoints.  Such challenges posed by the new systems must be considered.  Moreover, given the presence in the Chamber this evening of the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy John Browne, Members have a unique opportunity in respect of drift-net fishing.  While I do not wish to raise the entire debate again, I refer to poaching.  As the Minister of State is aware, advanced telecommunications systems contribute to an extremely healthy and fruitful poaching business.  One of the real issues with which Members must contend is that units of sub-aqua professionals are on stand-by, ready to enter rivers to poach and use telecommunication systems to so do.While I digress from the present debate, I am glad the Minister of State is present because in any debate regarding salmon, a sharp focus should be kept on this matter.  However, this aspect was lost in the past couple of weeks.  Anecdotal information I received last weekend suggests the operation of a slick, professional poaching outfit.  Such poachers do not enter rivers to take 50 or 60 salmon, but to take a couple of hundred salmon and can do so within a few hours.  This issue must be addressed.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Naturally there are fears regarding masts and structures if people live in urban areas in which a national school is near a Garda station with such telecommunications infrastructure.  One of the most significant reasons for such fears is that masts are erected without any form of communication with the local community.  There is no contact with the people before such masts arrive, which leads to a barrier straight away.I will cite another example regarding North West Electronics.  The Minister of State will be aware of the positive elements of the group broadband schemes.  An article in SiliconRepublic.com states that group broadband schemes have been an abject failure.  While that may be the case nationally, North West Electronics, an energetic private company in Donegal, has been rolling out an expansive group broadband scheme.  It uses masts and the telecommunications antennae required for such infrastructure.  They do so in two ways.  First, they locate such masts away from population centres.  Second, it has embraced the positive measure of consulting local communities.  It asks people what would be the prime locations for such masts from the perspectives of topography and sensitivity in respect of distance from population centres.  This is the kind of best practice on which Members should focus.  Moreover, when dealing with the public, other private companies could learn a lesson in this respect.When the past four or five years are considered, O2 and Vodafone may ask why there was such a revolt in rural areas.  County Donegal lacks widespread telecommunications or telephone cover because of people's objections.  However, the main reason for this is that the companies arrived without contacting the local communities.  The lesson to be learned regarding telecommunications infrastructural investment is to contact the local people first and get them involved from the outset.  I know of no one in a rural area who does not want advanced communications systems.Many difficult questions must be answered regarding an integrated approach on the part of State bodies.  On one hand, Donegal, Leitrim and Cork county councils may be working in one direction, while on the other, health boards may require their own telecommunications to provide for their emergency response units.  Although RTE possesses the prime locations, it charges local authorities and emergency response units.  In other words, one branch of the public service sector charges other sectors of the public service.  Difficult questions must be answered in terms of value for money and the integrated approach.  Lessons could be learned from the approach adopted by O2 and Vodafone, which share masts.  This also must be done at a State level and the subjects of value for money and integration must be examined.  A better managed system in terms of mast-sharing should also be examined.  Perhaps a more comprehensive roll-out in a more imaginative manner than obtains at present might follow.I thank the Cathaoirleach for permitting my digression in respect of salmon.  I appreciate it.
