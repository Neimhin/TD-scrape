JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What is the question?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend the all-party leadership shown in the recent Nice referendum. I congratulate in particular Deputy John Bruton and our Leader, Deputy Kenny, who had the vision and foresight to realise this was not a political mission. As it was in the interests of the people we decided to leave politics out of it.I would like to refer to the parochial element of Donegal in light of the recent referendum where 64% of the people decided not to vote. I pre-empted this when I spoke to the Minister about the issue prior to the referendum and I also mentioned it to the MEP, Pat Cox. Some 64% of people in Donegal, a regional peripheral location, probably one of the most peripheral regions of the European project, locked in between Northern Ireland and bordering just a seven mile stretch with the Republic, decided that the European project was meaningless. They felt completely disenfranchised as was shown in the democratic deficit in the recent referendum. Lessons must be learned from this. There will be other referenda when the same scaremongering will take place about the democratic deficit. Rather than being critical, we should be constructive. We should consider seriously proposals from the committee of regions and the assembly of European regions where there is serious talk about subsidiarity, regional autonomy and giving more power and responsibility to local authorities and local regions.Perhaps it was an oversight on the part of the Leader of this House but my colleague, Senator Burke, asked for an immediate debate on the Border, midland and western regions. The former Minister and Leader of the House failed to respond to this request, even though I know she did not mean it. However, it is indicative of what is happening in the country whereby a BMW region was set out. This was basically a paper region to apply for Objective One status which had no structures. The European Union still has the power and ability to set up structures, whether at regional or local authority level, particularly nowadays when the Minister for Finance is withdrawing funding from local authorities because of the state of the economy. We must begin to empower local authorities through the European Union.I have tabled a motion for the next Donegal County Council meeting seeking a pilot European Union office, a tangible office where people can come in off the street and get information on Europe. They could find out about their entitlements, what is happening and what will happen in Europe. That is the only way to instil confidence in the democratic process at European level. We have already done this at Donegal County Council level. We have opened two new decentralised offices, one in Millford and one in Carndonagh, where people can come in off the street, find out about the local authority, which was centralised in Lifford, and pay their car tax. If there was a European sub-office in one of the offices, it would help to instil confidence in the European process. This brings me to local government reform in general. This aspect could be tied in to local government reform if we are serious about the issue.I welcome the recent Nice referendum result which sends out a very positive message to the rest of Europe. If one were to survey the 64% of people who did not vote in the referendum, we would find that they did want enlargement. Basically it was a complicated project of which they did not feel part. They felt isolated from the process, which is a challenge we cannot ignore. However, if we ignore it, we will do so at our peril.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Hard on whom?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senators Coghlan and Feighan for sharing time. I echo their sentiments on behalf of my county council as well as talking on behalf of the rest of the people who have spent the past two to three years pre-planning the building of a house. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, may have no expertise in pre-planning, budgeting and putting money aside for a rainy day or a project. From 14 November, people who had not paid a deposit to a builder will not get the €3,810 grant. I am looking forward to an election in a year's time when people on the Government side will be canvassing houses in their areas where there might be no kitchen or fireplace or wooden floors because this €3,810 was part of their budget set aside to pay for a part of their house. These people have been betrayed by the Government because they were not consulted on this change. It is a disgrace. I speak on behalf of many young people and I call for the immediate reinstatement of the first-time buyer's grant.
