JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Last week, I welcomed the decision of the European Parliament to vote in favour of the preservation of the Irish Box. However, it transpires that the bureaucrats of the Commission in Brussels are working hard to further reduce the Irish Box north of Galway. This is a serious issue and it is important that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, keeps his eye on the ball in negotiations at the Council of Ministers. Greencastle and Killybegs fishermen already received a hammering in respect of the nine day rule. We certainly do not want further restrictions of the Irish box and an influx of Spanish fishermen.
