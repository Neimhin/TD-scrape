JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Cuirim fáilte roimh Mr. Tony Murphy, a chomhghleacaí Mr. Brian Murphy agus a chomhghleacaí Ms Niamh Mahon. They are very welcome to today's proceedings and on the behalf of the committee, I would like to particularly welcome back Mr. Tony Murphy who was with us last year. He will be representing the European Court of Auditors, ECA, today. Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege and address some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if a witness's statements are potentially defamatory to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue the remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment, on criticise and make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside of the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any member who is partaking via MS Teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting they confirm that they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. Without further ado, I call Mr. Tony Murphy to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation and the specifics as well. The members will want to make a few observations and will have a few questions as well. Senator Vincent P. Martin has his hand up, but that might an old hand-raise. If Senator Martin is not there, I will call Deputy Neale Richmond, followed by Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Murphy is on mute.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will move on to Deputy Ó Murchú followed by Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before Mr. Murphy answers that question, I suggest the Deputy asks any other questions he might have because there is a long line of people waiting to contribute. It would be better for the Deputy to ask all of this questions together rather than going back and forth.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Howlin is next, to be followed by Senator Keogan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Senator Keogan is next, to be followed by Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Haughey is next.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Murphy. We still have a bit of time in case anybody has a final supplementary question. While Mr. Murphy is thinking, I will go back to his point regarding the challenge around attracting expertise on the language front across the range. He mentioned that we can do more in the universities. Is there something we can be doing in the secondary schools as well in terms of people looking at their own career paths and potential jobs? I am specifically thinking on the Gaeilge requirements and competency as well. The standards are very high when we are talking about translation and the skill set required for that. Is there something we can be doing in the secondary schools? I am interested to hear Mr. Murphy's opinion on that.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Are there any extra supplementary questions?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le Mr. Tony Murphy agus lena gcomhghleacaithe, Ms Mahon agus Mr. Brian Murphy. Is léir go bhfuil an obair atá á baint amach ag Cúirt Iniúchóirí na hEorpa ríthábhachtach agus táimid iontach buíoch díot fá choinne an chuntais phoiblí trédhearcach agus fá choinne an eolais soiléir. I thank everybody, including Mr. Murphy and his colleagues.
