JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Tá fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. This issue is posing a number of problems on a number of fronts in that a licensed road haulier operator requires a designated qualified transport manager. The legitimate and hard-working hauliers have had such managers in situ and have done the necessary courses in order to fulfil the competencies required for this role. However, one of the potential issues now coming up is that there will be an obligation on these hauliers post Brexit to go through another rigorous process in acquiring an EU competency in transport, which is essentially a degree. I ask the Minister to use a little common sense and to try to get this sorted.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not know what to say. I am delighted. There is no doubt that the operators and hauliers who take their business really seriously and have many challenges ahead of them will be absolutely delighted with this news. I thank the Minister of State for the follow-up. Obviously, Deputy Ó Murchú and I value the fact that the message put across the table yesterday at the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, of which we are both members, reached the ears of people in the European Commission. I am absolutely delighted and very much look forward to how this will work out with the Department of Transport. That was a long-winded way of thanking the Minister of State.
