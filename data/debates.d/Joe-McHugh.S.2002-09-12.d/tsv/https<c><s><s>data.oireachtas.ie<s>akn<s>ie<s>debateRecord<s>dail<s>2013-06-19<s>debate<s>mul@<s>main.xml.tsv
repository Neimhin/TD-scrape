JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I take the opportunity to welcome the new Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, to the House. Comhghairdeas. Regarding a potential registration waiver, which I have raised with the Minister previously, I understand where Deputy Ó Cuív is coming from on that but the difficulty is that the registration sometimes costs more than the cost of the horse. A prohibitive cost issue arises in that horses are being dumped because the owners do not want to register them. I do not seek a response today but I ask that consideration be given to some form of waiver for registration because of the prohibitive cost of registering.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I have been in contact with numerous farmers in recent weeks regarding the farm assist scheme, which is becoming quite a problem for many farmers. The measures in the last budget relating to the farm assist scheme, which is effectively and technically farmers' dole, have resulted in quite a substantial cut to the earning capacity of many smaller farmers. I know of one case where the payment has been reduced from €280 per week to €80 per week, which is a completely unsustainable cut, especially in the context of the unviable nature of many smaller holdings. The farming industry in general has become a victim of its own success in public discourse. The general assumption is that farming is going well, and indeed it is in some respects. The price of cattle has increased quite substantially in recent years, but the reality for many farmers, as the Minister of State will appreciate, is that costs have risen greatly. That part of the story has not been factored into the public discourse in terms of the viability of many small farm holdings. The cost of fertiliser, meal and fodder has increased dramatically, placing a massive burden on smaller farm holdings and farmers. Farmers are having a very serious conversation among themselves about quitting farming because it is actually costing them money to stay in farming. While that is happening, we also have the situation where the farm assist scheme is being cut back, as in the case of the drop from €280 to €80 per week I just mentioned. That particular farmer has two young children and a partner who is not working and is in a very difficult financial situation. In the overall context of the farming model in Ireland, which has been the subject of much discussion in the context of the ongoing Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, negotiations, attempts are being made to define productive farming and non-productive farming. The question has arisen as to whether productive farms are small or larger, but the whole thing is interrelated. Agriculture in Ireland is connected together, whereby there are multiple small holdings supporting small suckler herds from Donegal to Kerry. These west of Ireland farms are very small but they feed into the bigger model. Smaller farmers are producing small numbers of cattle, which are then moved on to the bigger farms to be finished off. My main point is that the cuts to farm assist payments to small farmers must be reviewed in light of the recent fodder crisis, escalating costs and the severe difficulties being faced by many farmers. If multiple small farmers decide that small farm holdings are not viable anymore, they are faced with the stark choice of going on the dole and receiving €200 per week or staying on farm assist and losing money by staying in farming. We are at a dangerous juncture for farming in this country and face the prospect of numerous small farmers along the west coast deciding to get out of farming. That will damage our industry at a national level.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for the reply. I welcome the fact that the Minister has been engaging with the IFA. I also welcome the fact that there is an acknowledgment of the financial hardship being endured by farmers as a result of the fodder crisis. However, the difficulty is that the dole was protected in the last budget but farm assist, which is effectively farmers' dole, was not protected. It fell between two stools because it is both a farming and a social protection issue. I know from private conversations with the Minister that she understands that farmers are under constraints. I would like her to discuss this matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to see how we can protect unviable family farms, of which there are many. While there are many good news stories in the agrifood sector and money is being made in some sectors, it is costing many small farmers to keep going at the moment. Another issue is the fact that there are different interpretations of what can be included as farming expenses. For example, a farmer who pays for diesel for a trip to the vet cannot include this as an allowable expense for the purposes of the means test.Not all farmers are in the same situation but the danger is that farmers will be tempted away from farming as a result of this measure. There is a big debate about the definition of "productive farming". These farms are not productive, but the farmers work against massive constraints with regard to fodder, fertiliser and grain costs. They have massive financial pressures. If farmers decide to leave farming, it will be a bigger problem for our overall agriculture sector and is something on which we should focus. Will the Minister of State contact the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, on this matter with regard to next year's budget?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious that the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party is currently meeting and that my colleagues from the Upper House are watching Deputy Donohoe and I on their monitors as we discuss the future of the Seanad. It is a sensitive topic given that we are speaking about Members' jobs and the contributions they make. I acknowledge the contributions made by Members of the current Seanad and its predecessors. It is 11 years this month since I was elected to the Seanad with 53,000 first preference votes. It was, of course, a weighted system whereby one vote cast equated to 1,000 votes on the screen. I was in fact elected by 53 votes from my peers in county councils throughout the country, primarily Fine Gael councillors with a few stray Independents and second preferences by Fianna Fáil councillors. Did I give a representative voice to the administrative panel for those five years? I did not. I became a voice for County Donegal and my constituency of Donegal North-East, hence the argument that the Seanad is either a grooming ground for future Deputies or a retirement home for politicians.During the first sitting of the Seanad after my election, the then Senator Shane Ross spoke from the Chair. He stated that the biggest priority of the Seanad was reform. Everyone, including me, agreed with him because the issue had been discussed for years. Now, 11 years later and 75 years after the Seanad was established, it is too late for reform. It is up to the people to decide in a democratic vote whether they want to retain the Seanad. The first President of the Executive Council, W. T. Cosgrave, agreed to use his appointments to grant extra representation to the State's Protestant minority. The 60 Members of the first Senate included 20 Protestants, three Quakers, one Jew, seven peers, five baronets and several knights. Some of these appointees had previously been Members of the Senate of Southern Ireland, which was a 1920 creation of British law consisting of a mixture of Irish peers and Government appointees. Senate Members from Ulster included George Sigerson from Strabane, Sir William Hutcheson Poë from County Down, Sir Horace Plunkett, Sir Joseph Henry Greer from County Tyrone as well as Unionists from the co-operative movement in County Meath. The Senate, therefore, reflected vocational and other groups which would not otherwise have been represented. This was in line with the thinking behind the establishment of the Seanad. Since then, many people from Ulster have sat in the Seanad. They include Seamus Mallon in 1982, Gordon Wilson and Dr. Maurice Hayes who was a colleague of mine in the Seanad in 2002. These individuals made good contributions to debate, especially on Northern issues when Northern Ireland was very much on the radar. Since then, much progress has been made on the North. We now have the North-South Inter-Parliamentary Association, a cross-party group which, ironically, held its inaugural meeting in the Upper House and its second meeting in the former Senate Chamber in Stormont. The Good Friday Agreement has delivered progress on the Northern question and representation on Northern issues. On the issue of keeping the conversation going, sometimes politicians get carried away and believe they lead reform and effect change when in fact it is the people who do this. We need to make maximum use of opportunities for civic forums. We must progress the proposal for a North-South civic forum to consider the type of society we want and the constitutional challenges we will face in the coming years. In discussing reform, we must also discuss the issue of the permanent government. Members of the public are irked that despite the major change in political representation arising from the previous general election, the same permanent government remains in control. This issue should be included in the debate. Shortly after I became a Senator, a fellow from my parish related to me the following saying: "When all is said and done, much more is said than done." For 75 years, much more was said than done with regard to the Seanad. For the record, in 2005, I stated in the Seanad that the construction sector was unsustainable and would create problems that would affect thousands of people. Clearly, no one was listening.
