JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Minister's dedication to rail travel.  Let us consider the situation in the Minister's back yard and his support for the Navan railway line, which I welcome.  My colleagues, Deputies McEntee and English, are very supportive of that project.  I refer to the western rail corridor.  We are joined in the Gallery today by two former Deputies, Mr. Breen and Mr. McHugh, who would have been advocates of the western rail corridor along with members of my political party.This summer, I travelled on the Midleton to Cork railway line, which cost a total of €75 million.  One cannot question the Minister's dedication to rail travel but the problems lies in connectivity.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I remind the House that €10 million was allocated to the Inchicore to Pearse Street feasibility study which has been indicated as cross-border funding.  That is a story for another day, but it is a story my constituents in Donegal find very difficult to fathom because European money for a cross-border project——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The true missing link is the TEN-T project between Derry and Letterkenny.  All we seek is an appraisal or feasibility study and the examination of a cost benefit analysis.  That is all.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated that perhaps in 2013 it may be a possibility.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The strategic rail review 2003 needs to be thrown out because it is outdated and completely out of tune with what is happening.  This afternoon, the Government is going to load extra costs on private bus companies in County Donegal who are providing public services, and also on car travellers who do not have access to rail transport, as is the case in many urban areas.  One has to marry what is happening now with what will happen in the future.  One thing about Fianna Fáil-led Governments is that they only look to the long term in the context of the next election.  We need long-term thinking and connectivity.  Let us consider the possibility of getting on a train in County Kerry, going up through the western rail corridor, which the Minister has funded, and going to the fourth largest city in Ireland, Derry city, and on to Belfast.  An all-island rail link is long-term thinking and given that extra costs are coming down in that regard, it has potential for tourism generation.
