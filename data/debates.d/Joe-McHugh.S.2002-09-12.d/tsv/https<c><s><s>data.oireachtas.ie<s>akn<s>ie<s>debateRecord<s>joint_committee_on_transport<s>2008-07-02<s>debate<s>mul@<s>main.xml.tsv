JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Fearon and Mr. Reynolds to the joint committee.  Since Mr. Fearon's submission was released to the public domain, it has created much debate, opened feelings and stimulated those within the marine safety sector and the marine and coastal industries.  The debate has been a learning experience.  I have learned more about the co-operation within Ireland and, in my neck of the woods, between the Belfast coast guard station and Clyde, Scotland.  What seems obvious to me is that this is a unique, cross-Border, interregional, transnational project of a tangible nature.  Everything that is articulated in the Good Friday Agreement has to do with this interregional, transnational relationship.  Equally, there are relationships and interlinks in Kerry with Spain and France.I do not want to spend my time articulating a rebuttal of a document dated 5 October 2007.  Many groups have articulated the argument, from the Inishowen Development Partnership to Donegal and Kerry county councils.  Given that staff are not allowed to speak on record, retired employees of Malin and Valentia, people from the fishing and marine fraternity and politicians from Northern Ireland have articulated the strong argument for the retention of three centres, Valentia, Malin Head and a centre on the east coast.  That argument is not on parochial grounds but on the basis of reason, rationale and common sense.I welcome that Mr. Fearon, his team or civil servants and the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, have facilitated the debate in the past few months.  We now have more clarity on this document, even though the last paragraph is as clear as mud.  The content shows me where this debate is coming from.  On 5 December, there was an efficiency review of expenditure and a directive was sent by the then Minister, who is now the Taoiseach, to the Department responsible for transport and the marine to carry out a review of expenditure.  The document before us examines the parameters of the review and refers to management, travel, consumables and the sharing of services.  Did this review consider risk assessment in terms of safety at sea and saving lives?Having followed the directive, the then Minister put two ICS systems out to tender.  We can argue about reasons for or against but this occurred as a result of the directive.  Effectively, one will be prioritised on the east coast, as mentioned in this document, and there is no mention of prioritising one on the west coast.  Are we in limbo on the west coast?Where will the second ICS temporary location be?  The document does not specify if it will be in Malin or Valentia.  If there is to be a fourth location, where is it?  The idea of a fourth centre for a temporary location is completely contradictory to what we are trying to achieve.  Will this be implemented in the short to medium term?In fairness to the witnesses, they do not have the answer to this.  The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, is the person who should be before the committee with the information.  Will this fourth location, where the ICS system will be temporarily located, become the second station?  If this is the case, will there be a medium-term or long-term downgrading of Malin and Valentia?Committees are not to be used as a political forum and I will not use this to make a political point.  The Minister should be before the committee explaining this limbo situation in which we find ourselves.  He should also be here to make the decision.  It seems that no decision has been made.  If civil servants are trying to do their job working from a directive, they need leadership.  Perhaps Mr. Fearon can clarify this.  Will there be a fourth temporary location for the ICS system?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have just one question.  I beg the Chairman's indulgence as I have waited here all day.  Where will the ICS be located?
