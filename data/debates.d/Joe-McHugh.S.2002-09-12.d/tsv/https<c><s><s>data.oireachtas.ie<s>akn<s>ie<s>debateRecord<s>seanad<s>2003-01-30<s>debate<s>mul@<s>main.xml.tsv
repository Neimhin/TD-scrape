JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senators Finucane and Ryan on crime. We have an opportunity to bring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the House, not just for the purpose of his making a statement on the matter but to allow Members the opportunity to engage in a constructive debate.We should not take our eye off the ball in looking at crime on an all-island basis. Legislation will be coming before this House regarding the PSNI and the Garda Síochána and we should look at crime on an all-island basis in good time prior to the introduction of legislative changes. It is opportune and imperative that the Minister come before the House for a debate on the matter.
