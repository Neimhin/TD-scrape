JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Chathaoirleach Gníomhach as a cheapachán úr.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Níl an gown air go fóill.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas le Baill an Tí as ucht a dtiomantais maidir leis na rudaí a bhí ar chroílár na díospóireachta ó thaobh an oideachais thar na míonna agus na laethanta a chuaigh thart. Tá na rudaí sin iontach tábhachtach. Bhí stádas a dtodhchaí neamhchinnte ach ba é sin an bealach a bhí romhainn. Táim fíorbhuíoch do na páirtithe leasmhara san earnáil oideachais as an chuidiú a bhfuair mé uathu. Bhí siad ag obair go dian. Táim ag tagairt ach go háirithe d'fhoirne uilig na mbunscoileanna, na meánscoileanna agus na n-ollscoileanna. Tá tionchar mór ag cúrsaí ar na mic léinn agus na daoine óga. Is é sin an fáth go raibh an Rialtas tiomanta d'oscailt na scoileanna agus ag obair go dian dícheallach ar son daoine óga le riachtanais speisialta. Táim buíoch as a bheith ann do dhíospóireacht arís. Is é an ról agus an dualgas atá ormsa ná obair le moltaí na daoine uilig sa Dáil. Beimid in áit dhearfach an tseachtain seo chugainn de bharr na díospóireachta. I am happy to be here in the House again to provide Members with the latest updates on the significant issues in the education system, including reopening our schools, leaving certificate 2020, and the provision of the summer programme. I am conscious that the Business Committee has also scheduled a full session on the issue of the summer programme in the House next week. A lot has happened across the education and skills sector in the last 12 weeks since schools, colleges, universities and other settings closed on 12 March, which is 12 weeks ago today. In the 12 weeks between now and the end of August a lot more will be done. The pace at which issues have been identified and addressed over the past 12 weeks is a credit to those who work in the sector, the students and the parents. It exemplifies the spirit of being in this together and I want in particular to acknowledge the leadership of the officials in the Department of Education and Skills who have worked on all of these issues throughout. Since I was last in this House, the executive office working on the calculated grades process in my Department, which is working in close collaboration with stakeholders, has progressed a range of issues. These include the publication of the guide for schools in providing estimated percentage marks and class rank orderings on 21 May, with supplementary guidance issued on 28 May. Over 60,000 leaving certificate and leaving certificate applied students had registered on the student portal by the 12 p.m. extended deadline for registration last Friday. This is over 98% of the total of 61,029 who had been expected to sit the leaving certificate examination in 2020. I can also confirm that my Department will continue to engage with schools in the coming weeks in an effort to establish why some students may not have registered on the portal. I want to take this opportunity to thank the students who responded to my call last week to be proactive and engage in the online process and not to leave registration to the last minute. The executive office has established a special section to deal with students who are in atypical situations and supplementary guidance will issue on these aspects. This is an area that many Deputies had raised and every effort will be made to resolve these cases. The system through which schools will submit data to the executive office will shortly go live with accompanying guidance issuing to principals. I confirmed the appointment of Dr. Áine Lawlor as the chair of the independent monitoring committee of the calculated grades process when I was last in the House. I can now confirm the other members of the committee. They are Dr. Peter Archer, the former CEO of the Educational Research Centre; Ms Majella O'Shea, former Deputy CEO of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA; Mr. Joe Hamill, former Secretary General of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and chair of the New Schools Establishments Group; Mr. Justin Edwards, CEO of the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment, Northern Ireland, and Professor Michael O'Leary, Professor of Assessment at DCU. These are all eminent people whose experience crosses education, governance, assessment and research. I want to thank each of them for agreeing to be members of the committtee and I wish them well as they have their first formal meeting today. The initial feedback coming from school management bodies and teacher unions on the operation of calculated grades at school level has been positive, with teachers engaging in a professional manner with the process. I understand teachers and principals have found the guidance material prepared for them to be very helpful, including the provision of additional guidance and answers to queries, in addition to appreciating the speed at which these have been provided.Our focus now is very much on ensuring we are ready to receive the submissions from schools and to then reopen the student portal so students can choose to opt in to receive calculated grades. Everyone in this House appreciates the wider impacts of extended school closures on children and particularly on children already at risk of disadvantage or who have special educational needs. That is why I want to see the maximum return to school possible in late August and September that is consistent with the need to do it in a safe way. Managing the reopening of schools is a massive logistical operation and requires careful planning and management. My Department is engaging in a process of detailed planning and stakeholder engagement at primary and post-primary levels to achieve this objective in a way that is safe for students and staff. I brought an update to Cabinet last Friday on these issues and regarding delivery of the summer programme. I will be returning to Cabinet next week with a plan to achieve these dual objectives. I then expect to publish those plans. Among other things, we will look at a range of issues including: public health guidance on mitigation to build confidence within the school community of teachers, staff, parents and children; measures to ensure hygiene and infection prevention and control; training for staff in communication with families to promote those measures, including such measures as good hand hygiene and hand cleaning and good respiratory practices; attention to promoting children's well-being in returning to school; and engagement with stakeholders. I am paying very close attention to the experience of other countries which have reopened schools and to emerging scientific advice. I will continue to engage with my counterparts in the North, the UK and across Europe to learn from their experiences. The potential for running summer programmes for children with complex special educational needs and children at greatest risk of educational disadvantage is being developed. In 2019, students with autism and children with severe and profound general learning disabilities participated in the traditional July provision scheme over two strands, with approximately 70% of students accessing the home-based strand and 30% attending 232 schools, predominantly at primary level. My Department, the Department of Health and the HSE have linked up to consider a joined-up approach to the provision of a continuum of care and support during the summer period. A cross-departmental working group has been established to map this continuum. I want a summer education programme to run, recognising that students with special educational needs and those at greatest risk of educational disadvantage need to be prioritised. Regression in their learning and difficulties in transitioning to the next educational setting are real concerns for some of these students. It is generally acknowledged that disadvantaged pupils are more at risk of disengaging in a remote-learning environment relative to their peers and may fail to make a successful transition to a more senior level. The existing summer provisions aimed at students at risk of educational disadvantage are being examined, including the school completion programme, summer literacy and numeracy programmes for DEIS primary schools and summer camps run by or outsourced by boards of management. Planning for summer education programmes is difficult under the current circumstances with some of the issues examined including: the running of any school-based programme will need to be informed by public health advice; the availability and willingness of schools, teachers, SNAs and bus escorts to support the programme; a desire that key logistical arrangements will be worked out in advance of announcing the programme; availability of transport to and from schools; and willingness of parents to allow their children to attend such a programme, particularly children with significant health conditions. My officials are engaging closely with stakeholders in developing a summer programme with a further round of meetings happening today. This work will help inform different aspects of such a programme. School principals, teachers and SNAs have already done so much since schools closed to help support their students, particularly those with special educational needs and children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Schools have ensured regular communication, devised individual support plans with the agreement of parents, provided familiar resources, hosted live online classes and provided a new structure and routine. Schools have done this out of a desire to support their students to the best of their ability in very challenging times. For teachers and SNAs who can do so, I urge them to think seriously about supporting a summer programme which will make a meaningful difference to their most vulnerable students. The length of school closure has been much longer than we might have hoped. Providing an opportunity for children to participate in a summer provision would provide a really important opportunity to reconnect with schooling and offer an important structure which may help towards a fuller return to school in the autumn. I will be returning to Cabinet next week in relation to the provision of a summer programme. I know the positive impact such a programme would have and I want to see it happen but we must do it in a safe way for all concerned. The various challenges that have emerged since the closure of the schools 12 weeks ago on 12 March have been faced and addressed in a systematic way that has taken into account what is best for students at various levels and through collaboration with all stakeholders.I repeat that as we move forward in our planning to reopen schools and to provide a summer programme, we must do so safely and with the confidence of all concerned, whether that is the confidence of students, their parents, or the staff in the sector. I want to see children back in classrooms, with their friends, and being supported in school by their teachers, special needs assistants, SNA, and other school staff. Achieving this objective will be guided by public health advice and wider decisions concerning the roadmap for reopening our society. Mar fhocal scoir, we are working towards those goals and will be communicating with students, teachers, school staff and management bodies in the coming weeks on how we return to school in the new academic year.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Regarding Deputy Lahart's question about Scoil Naomh Pádraig, the system in place has not changed because of Covid-19 because it was based on attendance on 30 September of the previous year. The school has an opportunity to appeal in June with regard to progression and potential around progression in terms of numbers for next year to see whether it meets the criteria. If it meets the criteria by a particular date at the start of the school year in the first term, we will take that into consideration. It does come across as a fairly ruthless and rigid system but we need a system because there will also be schools with vacancies. It also tries to provide certainty for that teacher because the teacher in that class will also look at other schools and other vacancies and go for other jobs. This is the system we have. We have a particular cut-off point every year but I will certainly ask the inspectorate to look at Scoil Naomh Pádraig. As the Deputy is aware, it is an independent group.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for making direct contact with me on these issues as well. There is momentum now with the technological university process for the south east. There will be no question mark around the momentum in terms of the response at official level and at a financial level as well. We want to get the south east on the same plane as Technology University Dublin, Munster Technological University, the Connacht-Ulster alliance and the Limerick-Athlone alliance. There is funding already provided for those processes. I spoke to my officials on the issue last week and the issue will remain on the radar. I have also raised the HR issues with my officials, who will report back to the Deputy in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To be clear in regard to the public commentary around schools reopening, if the current health guidelines remain as they are we will be facing a partial reopening. If the Deputy had listened carefully to what I said in my public commentary, he would have noted that I said I am working with my officials and the public health officials in the Department of Health, who are learning all the time from the European and international experience, and I am looking at the different advice and monitoring it.I will state publicly that I am confident that advice will change. We will be in a better position before I make the announcement at Cabinet on what that advice will be. What I said was very clear. The modelling we conducted around current health advice would mean a partial return, but we engaged with health officials and are constantly getting new evidence. We are learning from the likes of Denmark, which has primary school children back, and Greece and France which have 15 students in each classroom. I am learning from the likes of England, as I spoke to Gavin Williamson two weeks ago, and from Peter Weir in Northern Ireland, to whom I spoke yesterday. We are going to learn from those experiences and I reassure people that it is our intention in the Department of Education to maximise the return of students at the end of August and into September. There is no ambiguity around that. That is our intention, but obviously we are going to be guided completely by the health advice. At the same time, the health advice has been very clear and when Dr. Tony Holohan briefed us recently he said that while it is his job to give advice and guidance, it is not his job to do a risk assessment. That is a job we are doing now. The Deputy said schools have not been notified, but the reason for that is that we are waiting on this advice. I will bring a memorandum to Cabinet next week and at that time I will publish the advice. That is when the principals and the leadership in the schools will find out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That is not true. There is ongoing communication.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would like to respond to that. If we do not have the advice, the guidelines or the instruction, I am not going to go back to principals with a half story. Next week we will have the full guidance and the publication.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are, and it is wrong to say that there is no communication with schools. The schools and school representative bodies are in constant engagement. What the Deputy said is not true because there is engagement. What I am saying here very clearly is that we will not be in a position to say what the end of August and start of September will look like until next Friday.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am glad to hear the Deputy and others are meeting collectively with both presidents. I take this opportunity to acknowledge their individual roles in bringing it to this stage. They are in the process of preparing an application this year even amid all the uncertainty, difficulties and challenges we have at the moment. As the Deputy knows, there have been roadblocks and challenges with the process in the south east. The Deputy lives in the south east and he knows about the desire for a university among the community there. We have heard that, and we know about it. I wish to reassure the Deputy, and he will find out tomorrow from the presidents if he is meeting them, that not alone are the momentum and commitment there, there is no issue over the funding that will be needed to bring that process along. The Deputy mentioned Munster Technological University. I have formally written to that consortium. Certain issues needed to be addressed and they were addressed. It has a planned start date of 1 January 2021. We want to make progress with all the different consortiums: the Connacht-Ulster alliance; Athlone and Limerick; and in the south east between Carlow and Waterford. They are in a very strong position. They are in the middle of preparing their application and there will be progress.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can certainly ask my officials.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Beidh mé sásta é sin a dhéanamh.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Congratulations to Deputy Dillon on his election and on his maiden speech today. In his last point, he referenced clarity concerning the leaving certificate. The school alignment process has started and we have set up the portal, which will be going live between the executive office and the Department and the schools. We are looking to trigger that on Monday so the schools can start feeding back information. There has been, therefore, a great degree of momentum at the school alignment level, although there is still much work to be done. My ambition has always been, and it still is, that we will have results coming out as close to the traditional date as possible. I refer to the normal date for the issuing of leaving certificate results. That is the ambition and I will work intensely with my officials to make sure that happens. It is important on several fronts, including the transition to third level. I am also conscious, however, of the transition involving those applying to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, UCAS, whether that concerns Northern Ireland, England, Scotland or Wales. I refer also to those applying to go to Europe, where the majority of students last year went to the Netherlands, and we have ongoing engagement with our European counterparts. I turn now to part of Deputy Feighan's question regarding my engagement with the Minister of Education in Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Weir. I spoke to him just yesterday and raised the issue of UCAS to ensure we have those deadlines.One of the things I have picked up from engaging with my officials, officials from the UK Department for Education and the Secretary of State for Education, Mr. Gavin Williamson, is that there is a flexibility there. We will continue to work with them on that. The Deputy referred to the Mayo campus and its importance. He has raised that issue several times with me, as well as the integral connection between Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal in the context of the new Connacht-Ulster alliance. He requested an update on that alliance. He is correct that Dr. Seán Duffy has been appointed and has been working closely with the three colleges to ensure the preparatory work needed for an application to be submitted is on track. The plan is that an application will be submitted for a Connacht-Ulster alliance in quarter 4 of this year. There has been quite a degree of momentum there. I referred earlier to the south east. There is also quite a degree of momentum with regard to the proposed Limerick-Athlone alliance. Those three applications are in a very positive place. The Deputy referred to hygiene standards in schools. He is correct that the reopening guidelines, plans and roadmap that the Cabinet will sign off on and publish tomorrow week will include instruction, guidelines and advice for schools. Going back to Deputy Ó Laoghaire's point on the additional cost involved, I am conscious that it will cost a great deal of extra money and that schools are already under pressure as a result of the reduction in capitation moneys from 2011. We have restored 7.5% of that but we need to go further for the schools. I will discuss the construction project raised by the Deputy with the officials.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht a cheiste. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis as a bheith tofa. Guím ádh mór air sa ról úr atá aige. Is dualgas agus onóir mhór é a bheith tofa mar Theachta Dála. I want to take the Deputy back to his first point around the €750 billion fund. We are now working in that world of billions. One of the things I believe is central to any deliberation around funding and that collective response from Europe is to ensure that, at its heart, is how we tackle educational disadvantage and how we ensure that the most vulnerable are protected. When I think back to the last recession, I think of all the young Donegal people who had to leave and go to Australia, Canada and the United States. In that recession, I could see on my own doorstep that they were the hardest hit. We only had to look at the rest of the country, as well as at countries like Italy and Spain, to see that massive negative impact on the younger generation. I believe any conversation around funding streams has to look at what we can do to empower young people, while obviously focusing on the skill level and how we ensure that education continues and that there are jobs at the end of that education. As to my contribution, at a recent round of ministerial meetings at European Commission level, I discussed with all of my counterparts the issues of Covid, school reopening, third level and all the challenges that go with that. My point was to ensure that, whatever funding and support Europe can give, we put education at the heart of it. That brings me to the last question on funding. My proposition and that of my Department is to continue those conversations with my European counterparts. We are due to meet again towards the end of June, in some two weeks time. The Deputy also talked about the digital agenda being to the forefront. The German minister very clearly outlined that the upcoming German Presidency is going to have a very sharp focus on the digital agenda, not just in terms of education but also the world of work. One thing has been quite clear in the last three months. At the tertiary level, universities were very quick to adapt, to continue with online lecturing and to do their exams online. Post-primary was quite well-equipped in terms of having the experience of Google Classroom and had already started using the investment available, given we invest a considerable amount of money every year - more than €60 million at this stage - in digital support for schools.On the primary school system, the information coming back from our inspectorate indicates really creative and innovative ways to use technology but that, whether it is a generational thing or for different reasons, online teaching was not as interactive compared to a post-primary setting. There are very valid reasons for this such as gaps around broadband and other obstacles. One of the clear indicators coming from the teaching profession is that while digital communication technology filled some gaps, it is not the solution. We want and need to continue to ensure that our students are in a classroom setting but digital communication and new technology can add value to that process and can simplify some things. One of the simple learnings from teachers during this period was that they did not have to photocopy. Consider the amount of money that goes into photocopying. The expectation, however, was put onto some parents to copy, especially at primary school level, and I can attest to that. There were some massive learnings and one of the great insights into it, from parents and teachers, is that a house with home schooling is a very tense environment at times. Parents are trying to mix work and home schooling at the same time and it is a very stressed environment. We need to get our students back into the classroom and it is my ambition to continue to work closely with health officials to ensure we are provided with a roadmap so at the end of August and the beginning of September we have a maximum number of students back in primary and second level classrooms. I am interested to stay in touch with Deputy Leddin on his specific suggestions on where this fund could be used in education. I am very open to that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will work my way backwards. The good news is that over the past few weeks with what has happened between Department of Education and Skills officials and the Department of Health there has been a sea change on a summer programme. We are looking at the school inclusion model which we all want to work towards for children who need physiotherapy, occupational therapy or speech and language therapy. The Deputy is right there are two different Departments working separately. There has, however, been a sea change. We are working together to get a summer programme for the 600 children with complex medical needs, along with disadvantaged kids and special educational needs kids. I acknowledge the work of the officials on that. The Department is not unbending in respect of the safe pass. Rules to meet different needs have to change. I am actively considering the safe pass issue. The Teaching Council is also actively considering the probation issue too. I hope we will have news on those two fronts in the not too distant future. The Deputy's first point was really interesting. I would be interested in the St. Seachnall's project if the Deputy would send me the information. On the rules for the end of September, as the Deputy said, the pupil-teacher ratio is a budgetary consideration. There is a budget coming up in three months' time, at the end of September. There, I have announced it even before the Minister for Finance gets to do it, whoever will be in charge then. I take the Deputy's point and have asked the inspectorate to look into the issue in Darndale which the Deputy has raised previously. I am waiting for it to get back to me on that. The Deputy is 100% right about creating pathways to reflect our society. That is why I ensured funding for a migrant project in Marino which is considering an induction into the Irish education system for mature students from different countries who live here now, Irish citizens. Some might be former French or mathematics teachers in Spain or wherever. It was formerly funded by the Department of Justice and Equality. I took over the funding of it, only €50,000, because it identified exactly what we need to do. The Deputy might like to familiarise himself with that project. It has been showing great leadership in Marino on this.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I reassure the Deputy that bus transportation is a key factor in our deliberations as to what the end of August and September will look like. We are looking at the practicalities of that for the summer programme as well. The feedback from the teachers and the teacher representative bodies is that they are looking at everything. They are looking at the set-up in the morning and what will be needed in terms of hygiene and sanitisers, and all sorts of criteria and instructions for training and guidance for teachers. I accept there is a sense of urgency and that teachers, principals and boards of management need to know what August and September will look like as soon as possible. That is why I committed at last Friday's Cabinet meeting to set out a timeframe. The timeframe is very specific. Towards the end of next week we will have guidelines published for schools for a roadmap as to what the end of August and September will look like. It is really important that schools plan because there will be a lot of planning. The issue the Deputy raised with the Covid payment is a good and valid point. Many students, even leaving certificate students now, including from my county and my parish, rely on tourism. They are getting no payment. However, not all students got the Covid payment, so there was an inequality there. It was only the students who were in part-time jobs who got it. There is therefore an annoyance among other students who may have been in part-time employment, perhaps a couple of months previously or whatever. There is an inequity there among all students.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The answer to the question is "Yes". There most definitely will be. It will be different from previous July provisions because it will not only be exclusive to autism. We are widening it out. We have upwards of 8,000 students in our autism spectrum disorder classes. We have 8,000 students in special schools. That is 16,000 straight away. We want to add to that number. We want to look at disadvantage and school completion programmes. We talked about that two weeks ago when we engaged on this issue. The answer is clearly "Yes" but I want to have it right. That is why we are going to continue to engage with public health officials because we need to comply with the guidelines. I want to give certainty to parents too. I want parents to be confident that this is the right thing for their children. For some children it may be in the home. That option has to be there for parents. Last year, believe it or not, of the 10,000 students who participated in July provision a total of 70% were in the home. That requires buy-in from special needs assistants, tutors and teachers. My plea today is to the school leadership. At the outset the feedback has been incredibly positive. School leaders are really keen to make this happen. Out of 4,000 schools in our country only 232 opened up for July provision last year. It is not all about opening up schools en masse. It is about seeing what has worked in previous years and seeing what we can build on as well. I want to make one point about special needs assistants. SNAs never gave up contact when the schools closed on 12 March. Deputies will know that from evidence of the schools. They have stayed in touch with students. I asked my officials for examples of good practice. I have a list as long as my arm of what some schools are doing. They are ringing parents. Some are ringing parents every day. They are in touch with the son or daughter every day. They are keeping that connectivity going. SNAs have participated in the redeployment scheme. There is a percentage of SNAs working under programmes of the HSE. There has been extraordinary and incredible interlocking between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills. That bodes well for the future. I am sorry for going on. Deputy Kenny's question required a simply "Yes" or "No" response. The answer is "Yes".
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will be looking next week at contacting the schools and we are looking to start at the beginning of July.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am reluctant to give a picture of what this is going to look like because we are not announcing it formally until next week. I am going to bring a memorandum to Cabinet and we are going to publish the guidelines. I will offer two examples in terms of disadvantage. We are looking at school completion. This will involve targeted disadvantage to try to get some form of school completion continued. We are also looking at literacy and numeracy in DEIS schools. At the moment only 70 schools do the summer programme in literacy and numeracy. I am looking to build upon that and extend it. They are two examples. Next week we will have more clarification.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Less than one minute. Let me be clear - we have an inclusive educational model. It is not just an urban issue or a rural issue. In my town of Letterkenny, I believe that one of the primary schools has 38 nationalities. It has all ethnicities from around the world. It is a global school. When I attended an event, one of the students summarised the school by saying that it was an international school steeped in the history of Letterkenny. We have something really good going on in this country in terms of inclusiveness and ensuring that we embrace all ethnicities, the new Irish and new citizens. The students I have met over the past 19 months in this job know that they are safe in that environment. It is important to point out the positives in what is going on in this country in terms of education. Yes, we can do more and improve, but there are many good aspects and the inclusive nature has been transformative. The Deputy referred to speculation in a weekend newspaper about the curriculum being tapered. What I will confirm now is that there are discussions ongoing between the NCCA and my officials regarding the curriculum. I am conscious of the fifth years, who have been mentioned by a number of Deputies.Deputy Barry has been consistent in raising the same issue over and over again. Fair play to him for raising it because by doing so, it keeps it on my radar and that of my officials and keeps it on the agenda. In terms of the fifth years, we are looking at the benefits of "Home School Hub" for primary schools and are having discussions with RTÉ to see if there is a space there for fifth years in terms of what they have lost out on this year. There are discussions going on between the NCCA and my officials on this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy is correct in saying that the alignment process has started in terms of estimating grades. There is daily interaction between teachers, teaching colleagues, deputy principals and principals so that work will continue. The executive office that has been set up in the Department is up and running. We have an independent monitoring group chaired by Dr. Áine Lawlor. There are a lot of checks and balances in there. I know we will hear different examples and anecdotes but the general feedback I am getting is one where teachers are working collaboratively with the whole school community. Words like "conscientious", "committed" and "dedicated" are used. They want to get it right. It is a difficult space to be in. Think if someone was to walk down the main street in Navan 12 weeks ago and say the leaving certificate was not going ahead this year and that we were going to introduce a whole new calculated grades model in 12 weeks. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the dedication of departmental staff and officials for all their work and their ability to adapt. I assure the Deputy that there are checks and balances. I agree with the Deputy that it is not the perfect system. It is not the one I wanted - I wanted the written exam - but it is the fairest system in the circumstances. Next Friday, I will bring a memorandum to Cabinet around the criteria and guidelines about schools reopening. We will provide parents and school communities with that certainty. On special educational needs, what will be provided will not be the normal July provision. I propose to widen it such that it will not be exclusive to autism but will include educational disadvantage and other students as well. The Department of Health will have a role in regard to 600 children with complex medical needs. The memorandum, which I will bring to Cabinet next Friday, will include information in this regard as well. I will be in this House next Wednesday, but as it will be the end of next week before I bring the memorandum to Government, I will be reiterating the point next week that a memorandum will be produced in two days' time. I encourage the Deputy to take the opportunity of the debate next Wednesday to put his proposals in regard to what he believes should be incorporated in the provision.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The cost of the State indemnification will be dealt with by the Office of the Attorney General. Teachers are indemnified. That has been guaranteed. A Cabinet decision provides for indemnification to protect teachers in this process. Whatever costs arise will be borne by the State.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the Sherkin Island community. I have visited the island twice. I commend the community on its creative and innovative approach to issues, including its involvement with DCU on an art project.A great example is Glenroe national school in Limerick which is looking to open up in September. There is nothing to say a school cannot open again in the future. I have confidence from looking around my own county at places like Arranmore where there are two primary schools and a secondary school and nearly 50 students come from the mainland daily to go to the island school. They have set up a new digital hub which will attract people back to the island. While it is only a prediction, my prediction for the future of islands is a positive one because of broadband being available on the islands, whether those in Kerry, Donegal or west Cork. I think we will be looking at positive changes in the movement of people because Facebook and Google in Dublin have announced that people can work from home and there is no reason they cannot work from the southern or northern parts of the country. The Sherkin Island community is already seeing a progression from four students to six over a few years. There is a school in Donegal that had 11 students in 1999 and now has 85. Momentum happens once it gets started. I would never discount the idea of a primary school on Sherkin Island, and if we can give help or advice on that process, I would be happy to get my officials-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry. I thought I had the whole time for myself.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will do that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is like closing time. I have a short window here. The Deputy is right. Schools need to know the picture. That is why I will bring a memo to Cabinet next Friday with that picture, not just for schools reopening in late August and early September but in regard to children with special educational needs and disadvantage. I know there is a big debate about the 2 m and 1 m restrictions and all of that. We all live in the real world in terms of what a junior or senior infants class looks like. If we expect children in junior or senior infants or first or second class to look at the societal parameters we have laid down, we need to look at the science around students. We already know that those aged under 13 do not have to wear PPE gear. I do not want to see PPE gear in secondary schools, but I am not a public health official. That is my personal opinion and what I would like to see. I have seen photographs from South Korea, where there are pods in canteens and so on. I will not say what it was like, but it was a very difficult thing to process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On Down's syndrome, services will not be exclusive to autism. We will widen the programme out. The most important word for parents is choice. If they want education provided at home, it is possible to explore whether we can get a tutor or teacher to do that. We can also consider whether it is possible to open a school. The most important word from the point of view of a tutor, SNA and teacher is voluntary. One of the positive aspects of the July provision was that it was always voluntary and that is why it worked.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will make formal contact with schools next week. The memo I will bring to Government at the end of next week will be a comprehensive guideline for schools and parents to let them know what options are available to them. I want to acknowledge the INTO, which has been very proactive on this. I have spoken to Mr. John Boyle a number of times. It is reaching out to its schools and is doing great work.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Regarding the Connacht-Ulster alliance, we now have GMIT, Sligo and Letterkenny in agreement on where they want to be, which is to have an application ready for quarter 4. I will not give a timeline after that because there is toing and froing in that process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If we are getting applications in towards the end of 2020, we are looking at 2021. I will not give a time, but that is not being overly ambitious because 2021 is 12 months to run then and we will keep the momentum going there. I feel the Deputy's pain on the retention of teachers. It is such a difficult time. Principals and boards of management put in so much energy in trying to-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Deputy to send me the detail on Termon national school and I will be happy to follow up.
