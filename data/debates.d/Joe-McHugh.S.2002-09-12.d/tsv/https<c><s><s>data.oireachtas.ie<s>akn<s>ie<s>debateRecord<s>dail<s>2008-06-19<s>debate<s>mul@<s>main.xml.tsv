JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome both Ministers and the Department officials.  This discussion and its timing are  of critical importance as the industry continues to fight against the tide, if I may be excused the pun, of negativity and disillusionment throughout the industry.The e-mail to which Deputies Creed and Sherlock referred encapsulated a plethora of issues within the industry.  If there is one element which stabs at the heart of the fishing industry, it is the criminalisation of the industry.  If the Minister has sat in a room for nine hours with fishermen, this issue would have been at the forefront of discussion.  People in the industry do not want to be condoning the fact they want to break laws but they want addressed the simple matter of a fisherman who fails to register a catch by making a telephone call upon entering a port who can be taken to court the following morning.  That is an example of how extreme and disastrous is the scheme.  Criminalisation stabs the industry in the heart.  This issue must be addressed and it can be addressed in national legislation.Ireland has 25% of EU waters.  We have got consistently bad deals from Europe.  I will not take this opportunity to make recriminations, apportion blame or remember when mistakes were made.  Despite Ireland having 25% of EU waters, when I go to restaurants in Donegal proprietors tell me they do not know if fish will be available to them in the long term.  In coastal areas restaurateurs are fearful of being unable to maintain fish on their menus.  That is a disgrace.We must expedite the â‚¬20 million tie-up scheme.  We must also be very cautious regarding the mistakes we made with regard to the decommissioning scheme.  Deckhands, skippers and mates were not included in the decommissioning scheme.  If there is to be a tie-up scheme we must ensure that they are included in the package.A sea fisheries Bill is proposed for 2008.  We have an opportunity to retrain fishermen, deckhands, skippers and first mates and make them officers of the merchant navy.  I accept that this does not come within the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and crosses to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  Nevertheless, some interdepartmental initiative must deal with the retraining of fishermen who are currently idle.I welcome the fact that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Minister of State are taking this matter seriously and that the Minister, Deputy Smith, is in the House for this debate on a Thursday afternoon with the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  Deputies on the Government side have referred to the good work the Minister and Minister of State are doing.  However, we have made a fundamental mistake with regard to the fishing community.  The lack of political leadership has allowed a vacuum to develop.  While I do not propose to take a swipe at departmental officials, fishermen have felt that the Department has been running the fishing industry for the past decade.  This is not good enough.  The fishing industry requires political leadership and accountability to fishermen.  A single person must take charge of the industry, which has been rocked to the core for a decade.  I ask the Minister to continue with what he is doing.  Coastal communities need guidance and they need someone to take charge.  This has been missing for many years.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to the House.  As usual, he will have a standard response.It is important to outline the seriousness of the withdrawal of special educational needs services in County Donegal.  I am trying, with great difficulty, to get to the bottom of it.  A major barrier is that neither the Department of Education and Science nor the Department of Health and Children is willing to take responsibility.  The Opposition has spoken at length about its objection to quangos.  The National Council for Special Education is a quango and is not taking responsibility for the withdrawal of services for children with special educational needs.The children to whom I refer, whose needs might arise from having asthma, ADHD, Down's syndrome, spina bifida, Asperger's syndrome or autism, require the services in question.  They are the most vulnerable people in society, but they are being ignored and neglected.  Let me give an example.  Carndonagh secondary school, formerly the largest secondary school in the country, had six special needs assistants last year but that number is to be reduced to three this year.  The children who need the assistants are still at school and, moreover, three extra children are now enrolled there.Over 300 parents and teachers and other concerned individuals met publicly in Ballyliffin in north Inishowen last Monday night to articulate the serious need for services for the children with special educational needs.  The services were put in place last year but are to be withdrawn in September.  I am talking parochially but the quango that is the NCSE, the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Health and Children need to state why the children are being discriminated against and why parents are being left in limbo regarding whether their children will be able go to school in September.Yesterday, a parent drove from Letterkenny to Dublin.  I told her I would meet her tonight or that I would meet her in Letterkenny on Friday.  However, she replied that her ten year old daughter, who has spina bifida and is in a wheelchair, has had her hours slashed and the situation was so serious that she will not be sending her child to school in September.  It is ironic that the Minister of State with responsibility for integration is present.  While that is a completely different portfolio, this pertains to the integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream classrooms.  However, funding is being slashed and special needs assistants are being withdrawn from such schools.I have great difficulty in getting to the bottom of this issue and together with parents in my constituency, I need to know the reason such services are being withdrawn.  More specifically, why is no one answerable or accountable for such decisions?  I raised this matter this evening to ascertain the terms of reference of the special education needs organiser and the identity of whoever drew them up.  Moreover, where do accountability and responsibility lie?  I would welcome a deviation on the part of the Minister of State from his prepared departmental script and would appreciate it, were he in a position to indicate to the House a way forward for the most vulnerable.
