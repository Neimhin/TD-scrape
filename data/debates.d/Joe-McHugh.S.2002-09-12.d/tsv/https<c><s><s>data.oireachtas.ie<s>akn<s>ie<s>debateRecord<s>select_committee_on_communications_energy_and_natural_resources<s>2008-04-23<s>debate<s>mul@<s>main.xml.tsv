JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Forty projects have been identified in the context of funding for IT training programmes for disadvantaged youth.  This involves a substantial amount of money totalling €1.1 million.  Is there any scope for additional funding for other applicants in 2008?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister might not have the specifics to hand, but how many salmon licences were decommissioned under the salmon licence decommissioning scheme?  Is the €30 million allocation to the regional fisheries boards specifically related to current and salaries expenditure?  How does the Minister envisage his process of protecting, conserving, managing and developing inland fisheries proceeding if there is a very limited amount of money set aside for it?  Will he indicate how much money has been set aside for the rehabilitation of salmon stocks?  Spawning grounds in many rivers have not been upgraded or rehabilitated since 1929.  Has money been set aside for this and, if so, how much?Does the Minister believe the central and regional fisheries boards are the proper mechanism for doing this work or is there a possibility of bringing in the fishing clubs which work at ground level as a vehicle for distributing the funds to do some of the work involved?  Many personnel in those clubs would work proactively on the rehabilitation of rivers if they were given an acknowledgement and some responsibility.  Does the Central Fisheries Board have the ultimate responsibility for the disbursement of funding and the management of rivers or is there a potential role for clubs?The salmon community support scheme has a budget of €5 million.  The Inishowen Peninsula is bigger than County Louth and has a population bigger than County Leitrim.  Does he believe the allocation of €300,000 is enough for the rehabilitation of the fishing community there?What is the Minister's position on the tagging system for draftnet fishermen on the Foyle for the coming season?  Last year the distribution of tags was left until very late.  What will they cost?
