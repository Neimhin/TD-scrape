JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I may be pre-empting the Chair's response by pointing out at the outset that I have no alternative means of raising the issue I wish to highlight.  I have submitted parliamentary questions on the subject but because of the work to rule in the public service, I have not received an answer.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was permitted to raise a matter on the Adjournment debate last week, for which I was grateful, but that means I will probably be down the list for several weeks.  My question relates to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare degenerative disease.  Ireland is the only country in Europe that does not have a clinical trial site.  I spoke to a man earlier this week whose nine year old son——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is appropriate to raise this matter.  Let me explain.  I asked the man how his nine year old son is doing and he told me the boy is playing football these days.  However, while the other young lads are getting stronger week by week, this man's son is getting weaker.  It is a very serious issue.  I acknowledge the work done in this area by the Taoiseach's constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, but there has been a vacuum for the last nine months.  This issue must be kept on the agenda and we must, like every other European country, have a clinical trial site.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Commitments were given.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to share my time with Deputies Breen, Deasy, McGinley, Terence Flanagan, Ring and Sheehan.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It will be very difficult to articulate a counter-argument after the impressive contribution from the maritime county of Longford by Deputy Peter Kelly.  It is a sign of the quality of this debate that people are being rolled out to defend the indefensible.  I was remiss not to mention Dublin North also.  I congratulate Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Creed for working on this issue over a long time and their work is the result of much time and research.The Minister will be aware of the work involved in fishing.  A fisherman must know how to navigate, he endures intermittent sleep patterns while searching for fish and he must also manage a business.  If his catch is four or five kilos overweight, he could end up with a criminal prosecution.  That is the weight of pressure on these men.  A psychological issue arises whereby the fishing community feels discriminated against.  Its members do not believe there is a level playing pitch.  They look at our neighbours in the European Union, across the water in the United Kingdom and at the administrative sanctions in force in Northern Ireland.We must consider our role within the North-South Ministerial Council.  Northern Ireland has an administrative and judicial system under devolved government and led by Mr. Ford of the Alliance Party.  I suggest we should consider an integrated marine policy under the mechanism of the Good Friday Agreement.  Integrated marine policy is one of the aspects of the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement.This is a maritime country, an island nation.  Every day, fishermen are throwing perfectly good fish overboard, as a result of the nonsense rules introduced for small fishermen.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Perfectly good hake, monkfish and white fish are being thrown overboard.  This is an issue of morality.  Members of the House and the Government should consider the type of sanctions we have introduced.  Our fishermen who gather fish in their nets inadvertently would prefer to take that fish home and give them away for free.  It is a national disgrace.  It is also a disgrace for Deputies from County Longford and those who come into this House with no knowledge of the maritime coastal communities and no knowledge of what is happening on a daily basis.The Government should put its hands up and accept there is an issue being highlighted on this side of the House.  We must bring the maritime community on-side.  We must look at all aspects of the industry and try to bring the fishermen back.  We have lost our fishing community through sanctions that are not workable.  The common-sense argument being articulated on this side of the House is that administrative sanctions are preferable to giving fishermen a criminal record.
