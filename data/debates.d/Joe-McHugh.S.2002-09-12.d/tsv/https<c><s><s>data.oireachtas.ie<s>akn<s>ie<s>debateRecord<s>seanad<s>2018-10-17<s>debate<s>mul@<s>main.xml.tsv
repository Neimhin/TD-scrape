JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	It is good to be back in the Seanad, of which I was previously a Member for almost five years. During my time in the Seanad I was afforded many opportunities to discuss various issues and it was always a pleasure to be here. I am particularly delighted to be here today on this issue.  I thank Senator Kelleher for bringing forward the Bill. I will support its passage through Committee Stage, mindful that following receipt of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, report further amendments may be necessary. Having listened to the contributions made today, I think there is something more powerful going on in terms of what this Bill seeks to achieve. Senator Gallagher spoke about the precedent and mechanics of introducing primary legislation to bring about curriculum change. This Bill is more a statement of intent. The timing of it is excellent in terms of the day that it is in it. When listening to the radio this morning I heard of the statements made by Mr. Peter Casey, with which I disagree, and it brought me back to 1989 when I was studying sociology in Maynooth University, my alma mater and Senator Ruane's current place of work and to the work of Mícheál Mac Gréil's, Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland. He was the champion at a time when prejudice was rife within this country. He conducted analytical research in this area, which I am sure many people have taken the opportunity to read. On listening to the discussion on radio this morning, Mícheál Mac Gréil came to mind and I reflected on just how far we have come. As a glass half full politician, I am of the opinion that we have come a long way. During my time as a member of Donegal County Council I participated in the Traveller Consultative Forum and as a youth I worked with settled Travellers. At the time, we were acting as leaders for the Traveller community. There are now many within the Traveller community who have obtained bachelor's and masters degrees and are now leading their own communities. As I said, much progress has been made. I believe what Senator Kelleher is trying to do by way of this Bill is an acknowledgement of Traveller ethnicity since 2017. I am happy to work with her and this House in this regard. Following receipt of the NCCA report in four months' time I will work with Senator Kelleher on it. I note the Senator has also met the NCCA and as such she will be aware that it is conducting research on the place of Traveller culture and history in existing curriculum, the current intercultural education guidelines and other resources for schools in regard to the Traveller community and the opportunities to teach Traveller history and culture and how it is incorporated into existing curricular subjects. As pointed out by Senator Byrne, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is also doing work in this area. There is a broad spectrum of work under way. All the contributions made today were interesting. One of the most beautiful Irish words which I learned in the last couple of years is "oidreacht", which means both heritage and legacy. We are duty bound to promote all of our heritage and I will supportive of that endeavour. Senator Ruane spoke about the cultural aspects of the Traveller community. Senator Mac Lochlainn will be aware of the wonderful piece of art at Letterkenny fire station, which was commissioned and delivered by members of the Traveller community in a workshop. If Senators are ever in Letterkenny they should go to the fire station to see it. I acknowledge that Senator Mac Lochlainn is also a strong advocate of the rights of the Traveller community and that he too spoke about the leadership issue. He will be aware of the great work that is ongoing in our county. The powerful leadership being provided by women was referenced in the context of the resilience of the Traveller community. Senator Gallagher spoke about equality of opportunity. Following my engagement with the Taoiseach on Friday night I expected the first question from the media would be what is my vision for education, which I knew I would have only approximately six seconds to answer. My vision for education was articulated by a number of Senators today, including Senator Dolan. I want to create an environment where everybody can realise their potential in the education system, including members of the Traveller community. I will work to ensure every person has the opportunity to realise his or her full potential.  Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke about the link between legacy and heritage and what we needed to do in real time to support communities, of which I am conscious. The Department of Education and Skills has a role in the Creative Ireland programme, in which the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is also involved. There may be provisions relative to this area within that programme on which both Departments can work together. Senator Dolan spoke about dignity. He is correct that if one strips people of their dignity one strips them of their freedom. St. Columbanus, who he left Bangor, County Down, to go to Rome once said, "If you take away liberty, you take away dignity." He never made it to Rome but he did get to Bobbio in Italy. When I get to visit Rome, I will definitely go to St. Peter's Basilica to see the mosaic on which his quotation is inscribed. The dignity aspect is important and I am very conscious of it. Earlier I was at the Department of Education and Skills in Marlborough Street, where I met my officials and staff for the first time. My new brief is a fairly wide one. My head is about to explode with all of the information I was given this morning. By way of background, I am a former secondary school teacher and I previously worked in the community with members of the Traveller community. I am happy to come to the Seanad on aspects of education, time permitting. As we all know, education is what is left when everything else is forgotten. I am happy to work with Senators on education matters.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	That was helpful. I thank Senator Kelleher for it. She can be assured that we will work with her on this issue. We are waiting in a vacuum, but four months will take us to the end of March.
