JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for raising this issue and I am also conscious of the fact that she said she has heard it all before-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	-----but I am also conscious that the Minister for Finance gave me a job to do. It is important to read the reply into the record from a formality point of view. To give a brief description of the scheme as it currently stands, it provides relief from vehicle registration tax and VAT on the purchase of a specially adapted vehicle, repayment of excise duty on fuel and an exemption from motor tax to drivers and passengers with disabilities who fulfil the medical criteria required to qualify for the scheme. The primary legislation authorising the Minister for Finance to make regulations providing for tax concessions to disabled drivers and passengers is contained in section 92 of the Finance Act 1989, and the regulations introduced subsequently to govern the scheme, including the eligibility criteria, are contained in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Currently, to qualify for the scheme, an applicant must have a permanent and severe physical disability within the terms of the regulations and satisfy one of the six qualifying criteria outlined in the regulations. The senior medical officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a primary medical certificate, which is required under the regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the regulations. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the senior medical officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The regulations mandate that the medical board of appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition. The six qualifying criteria, of which the Senator will no doubt be aware, are both strict and precise, and relate only to very specific physical disabilities. They are to be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; be without both hands or without both arms; be without one or both legs; be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. The scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities. The Minister for Finance frequently receives correspondence from applicants who do not meet the qualifying criteria but feel that they could benefit from the scheme. Those also include citizens advocating for the addition of intellectual disabilities to the qualifying criteria. While the Minister very much sympathises with those who do not qualify for the scheme, he cannot, given the scale and scope of the scheme, expand it further within the current context of constrained resources. The Senator will appreciate that the scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the vehicle registration tax and VAT forgone and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the scheme, the scheme represented a cost of €43.5 million to the Exchequer in 2013. This figure does not include the revenue forgone to the local government fund in respect of the relief from motor tax provided to members of the scheme. In terms of the numbers of beneficiaries of the scheme in 2013, 4,355 citizens availed of the vehicle registration tax and VAT relief, and 11,436 availed of the repayment of excise on the fuel element of the scheme. The Minister for Finance recognises that the scheme plays an important role in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities, and he has managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis and despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. While recognising the Senator's position, in the still challenging fiscal environment, the Minister has no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for the welcome back to my alma mater; we had many a good debate over a five-year period. It brings back nice memories indeed. I also thank the Senator for raising this matter. While I have outlined the Government's position on the issue of hydraulic fracturing on a number of occasions in Dáil Éireann, this is my first opportunity to discuss the matter in the Upper House. Three onshore licensing options were granted in the term of the previous Government for the two-year period from 1 March 2011 to 28 February 2013, over parts of the north west carboniferous Lough Allen Basin and the Clare Basin. The licensing options were granted to Tamboran Resources, covering parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim, Roscommon and Sligo; Lough Allen Natural Gas Company Limited, covering parts of counties Cavan, Leitrim, north Roscommon and east Sligo; and Energi Oil plc, covering part of County Clare. The licensing options awarded were preliminary authorisations designed to allow the companies assess the shale gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data. Exploration drilling, including drilling that would involve hydraulic fracturing, was not permitted under these licensing options. The licensing options gave the holder the first right, exercisable at any time during the period of the licensing option, to apply for the grant of an exploration licence over all or part of the area covered by the licensing option. Tamboran Resources and Energi Oil plc have exercised that right and have submitted applications for follow-on exploration licences. Successive Ministers and Ministers of State at the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources, including me, have confirmed that no decision will be made on these applications pending the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency's research programme into the use of hydraulic fracturing. The key questions that the EPA research programme, which is to be carried out over a minimum of two years, needs to answer are as follows. Can unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations be carried out in the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health? What is the best environmental practice for such projects and operations? The research will consider baseline characterisation with regard to water, seismic and air quality, potential impacts and mitigations and best practice regulatory frameworks. Detailed information on the regulatory approaches of other countries that have extensive experience with this activity will also be considered. The research programme is also expected to consider a minimum of five countries including at least one country where a moratorium on unconventional gas exploration has been introduced. Any application proposing the use of this technology would be subject to the existing statutory framework which includes environmental impact assessment. Such an assessment entails consideration of the potential impacts of a project on population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between these factors. It is not considered feasible to conduct such an assessment in Ireland until the EPA research programme has concluded and there has been time to consider its findings.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Prior to the start of the EPA research project, I had a number of meetings even during the summer. I met representatives of groups from Sligo. The Minister, Deputy White, and I had a meeting in Dublin with a group from Cavan County Council and Leitrim County Council. There are obvious concerns and I take them very seriously.While they exercised their right to make an application, the fundamental factor is that an EPA study has been initiated. I will list a few of the stakeholders to show that this is not just a tokenistic exercise. It is not simply a case of a group compiling a report and setting out a series of recommendations, but not being listened to. I will give the Senator an idea of the composition of this group, which operates on a North-South basis. It includes representatives of Queen's University Belfast, the British Geological Survey, the University College Dublin geophysics group, the University of Ulster geophysics research group and the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies seismology and geodynamics group. My confidence in the research is borne out of the time that has gone into the preparation of the survey initiated by the Environmental Protection Agency. I have asked my officials to examine the possibility of providing for something, perhaps next summer, that would give the Members of both Houses an update on the research findings in areas like health and the environment. I do not want to call it a mid-term review. I have asked my officials to consider that. They will set about a process in that regard. The important thing is that I have asked the people who are leading this survey, which will last for a minimum of two years and possibly for longer, to take the time to look at it properly. We are talking about what could hypothetically happen down the line. I am not going to presuppose what will come out of this survey. The important thing is for us to continue the debate and the dialogue. We need to feed into this process. I know it is happening at a community level. I will continue to engage in dialogue with people at local council and community levels who may have fears and concerns. We have to look at the cross-Border institutional mechanism that is in place. I refer to the North-South Ministerial Council. This is as much a North-South issue as it is an issue for Leitrim, south Donegal, Cavan or Sligo. Inbuilt political mechanisms have been available since 1998. It would be important to get this issue on the agenda of the North-South Ministerial Council as soon as possible. Given that we have a mechanism involving the universities in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland equivalent of the Environmental Protection Agency, there is no point in having different narratives coming out from political parties in Northern Ireland and from political parties in Southern Ireland. A natural North-South dialogue is going on here. I encourage Senator Mooney, who has experience in the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly and has built relationships with his colleagues in Northern Ireland, to continue this conversation on a North-South level. The Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which I have experience of as a former Chairman, is another mechanism that would enable this conversation to continue. I reiterate that the two companies that have been mentioned had the right to submit applications for exploration licences. Those applications will not be looked at by me or by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy White, while the Environmental Protection Agency study is ongoing. No decision will be made and no licences will be looked at.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Nothing will happen for the next two years, at least.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Burke for raising this issue. It is close to my heart, if Members will pardon the pun, because I have haemochromatosis. It is important for me to declare that conflict of interest before we move on. I am delighted that the Senator has raised it. I have worked closely with Margaret Mullett, who is the chairperson of the Irish Haemochromatosis Association. Her husband passed away because too much iron had built up in his blood. Obviously, that was before she became aware of this issue. That is how she ended up getting involved in the association. Her objective is to raise awareness. I hope the raising of this issue by Senator Burke this evening will help Ms Mullett on her journey as she tries to create awareness. I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar. Haemochromatosis is a relatively common condition in Ireland. If a person has haemochromatosis, his or her body absorbs too much iron from his or her diet. After it has been diagnosed, it is treated by removing blood regularly to get rid of excess iron. This process is referred to as venesection. Patients with haemochromatosis in Ireland were traditionally treated through their general practitioners or as outpatients in a hospital environment. Under a framework agreement that was signed on 4 June last, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation have commenced substantive talks on a new General Medical Services GP contract. The inclusion of chronic disease management for patients and the provision of mechanisms to ensure patients are treated in the community, where possible, will be prioritised in these discussions. I expect that haemochromatosis services will be considered in this context. As the treatment for haemochromatosis involves blood removal, and because patients are often well and eligible to be blood donors, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service has developed a haemochromatosis service in recent years.It has resulted in the cost effective treatment of people with this common disorder. It is provided free of charge to those with haemochromatosis and, in turn, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, can use the blood for transfusion. The IBTS started a programme of treating haemochromatosis patients at its Stillorgan centre in 2007. The centre operates a full care model where the IBTS manages the ongoing care of the haemochromatosis patient while performing the necessary venesections. The patient must attend his or her referring clinician for annual review. A total of 600 patients are now being treated at the Stillorgan centre, which is at full capacity. In August 2013, the IBTS commenced a second haemochromatosis service at its D'Olier Street blood donation clinic in Dublin. A further service commenced at its Cork centre in January 2014. At both locations, clinical responsibility for the patient remains with the referring clinician, but the IBTS provides an option of a maximum of four venesections per year. In many cases, where these patients meet all of the normal blood donation criteria, they can then become blood donors. I am delighted to inform the Seanad that the IBTS plans to expand its haemochromatosis service further at its Limerick centre. A planning application in this regard is being finalised by the IBTS. The haemochromatosis service provided by the IBTS is positive for the overall health service. Eligible haemochromatosis patients are provided with a free service and the maintenance of the national blood supply for patients in our health care system is enhanced. Many haemochromatosis patients also have the satisfaction of becoming regular blood donors to the benefit of others. Services for haemochromatosis patients have improved significantly in recent years and I look forward to their further enhancement as current plans come to fruition.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the drive of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and his officials in working with the IMO on a new contract. I hope that progress can be made on that front. If there are areas of research and sums of money are required, it is important to be as inclusive of the stakeholders as possible. I am aware that there will shortly be a meeting between the Irish Haemochromatosis Association, IHA, and the Minister. The Senator has shown an interest, so it would be important were he at that meeting. I can give him the details. Many people have haemochromatosis. I have it. As I do not know the technical details, I will not go into them. Basically, I must give blood every now and again due to my ferritin levels. Previously, the blood I gave was not used and was instead dumped, so I am delighted that, in recent years, people with haemochromatosis have been able to donate their blood. It is important that their blood can be used. Solutions may be possible at ground level in communities, primary care centres or GPs' surgeries. It is just a question of giving blood. It is not rocket science. It is done to monitor ferritin levels. Science is improving and more companies are getting involved on the monitoring end of things. I will name drop and refer to Randox Teoranta in Dungloe, County Donegal, which is involved in this business and introducing new technologies and sciences to ensure that people with haemochromatosis are diagnosed at an earlier stage. My only anecdotal advice is this - if people are feeling fatigued, they should go to their doctors to get their blood checked for ferritin levels. They may have haemochromatosis. Since I started giving blood, my fatigue levels have improved immensely. I do not get any sleep anymore in my new job.
