JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I was at that meeting. I wish to inform the House that we are in discussions, as you are aware, a Cheann Comhairle. We are due to meet again on this issue. It is important that we find a pathway that has all-party consent, but we do not have that yet. We agreed today that we would further examine the matter. I believe we need a solution on this issue. One of the things that will be available is resourcing if we can get all-party consent.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Moltar, d'ainneoin aon ní i rún na Dála inné, más rud é go dtiocfaidh an dara chéim den Bhille Oidhreachta 2016 chun críche um thráthnóna, ní tosóidh an Dáil ag 10 a.m. ach go gcasfaimid le chéile ag 12 meánlae. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in the resolution of the Dáil of yesterday, that, in the event of Second Stage of the Heritage Bill 2016 being brought to a conclusion this evening, the Dáil shall not meet at 10 a.m. tomorrow but shall meet at 12 noon.
