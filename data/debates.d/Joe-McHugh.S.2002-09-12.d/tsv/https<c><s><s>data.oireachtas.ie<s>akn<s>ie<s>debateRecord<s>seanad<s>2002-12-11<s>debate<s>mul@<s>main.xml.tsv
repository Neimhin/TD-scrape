JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. To know where we are going, but we must find out where we are at. We must start by being honest. As a society, we must say we are a nation which likes to drink. At any festivity or occasion, whether a World Cup in Germany or Florida, we are all flat out on the beer and that is socially acceptable.I was in Orlando during the 1994 World Cup and people from Holland and Ireland drank massive amounts. The recent World Cup was a disaster for people in this country. Those in Japan enjoyed it but people here were drinking from 7 a.m. They were in pubs and were drunk by 2 p.m. Marriages were on the brink by 6 p.m.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Publicans threatened to leave the business because they had such a hard time as people were out of control.Young people are not to blame. We can use them as scapegoats and blame them for drinking, but they do not have facilities to which they can go to meet their friends. All young people want to be with their friends or to be in groups where they gain a sense of independence.I passed through Carrickmacross one day and went into Supermacs. I happened to eavesdrop on ten young people who around 14 to 16 years of age. Approximately six of them were smoking – all female. One guy, who seemed to be the leader, was mouthing off, cursing, hitting young lads across the head and making derogatory comments to the girls. Two other girls sitting quite close to me were talking about the different concoctions they could make to get "pissed" more quickly – let us use the language they use. They were not talking about WKDs or alcopops – they mix their own concoctions.At a recent school prom, young people of 15 and 16 years of age spent €21 on a pint which included two shots of vodka, two shots of Bacardi and cider. One person spent €150 that night. That is the problem.I welcome these statements because alcohol abuse is a serious problem. However, we are faced with the question of how we should move forward. Young people must become involved in the debate through programmes in school, for example. Advertising campaigns could be directed at them to encourage them to participate in the debate. Donegal County Council established the first democratically elected youth council in the State. This was done through the schools. There is a shadow youth council in four of the county's electoral areas and there are plans to establish similar councils in the remaining electoral areas.Youths represent their peers on the councils and are able to discuss issues relevant to them. Young people will always say their parents do not know what they are talking about, what their issues are or what they need. The Minister should consider involving our four youth councils in the debate. He should fly to Carrickfin or Derry and request a meeting with the young people concerned who will tell him the reason they drink so much to enjoy themselves and there are so many alcohol related problems.I refer to the different fora at which young people can meet. The GAA must be commended in this regard. If one is good at hurling or football, one will get on the gaelic team and young people can meet their friends in a structured environment where they have role models such as the team managers or older players. However, there is an issue regarding where young people who are not good at various sports or not interested in sport can meet.Youth clubs were successful in rural Ireland in this regard in the past. I was a member of a youth club and it was great. I worked on a farm all day and was able to meet my peers at the club. I was not subjected to advertising campaigns for various products and so on and became involved in the local youth club where my father, the local priest and a few volunteers worked as supervisors. However, nowadays, young people have no interest in youth clubs because they want independence and to be treated as adults when they turn 14 or 15 years.An area should be set aside in every parish and town where young people can meet their friends and feel safe. They could be supervised by youth workers who will know whether they are behaving responsibly. Young people use places like Supermacs in Carrickmacross to congregate and they are not supervised. However, while many of them want to participate in society and enjoy themselves, they do not have a forum in which to do so.Bullying and suicide are also significant issues among young people. I mentioned the guy who was hitting another guy around the head while hurling abuse at some girls in Carrickmacross recently. Suicide is discussed regularly, but there is no place for a young male to go to talk about his problems. A young person who is in trouble or in dire straits will not go to his or her parents all the time and if he or she feels trapped, he or she may express himself or herself in a pub or at a disco where he or she experiences peer pressure to drink.That is the reason new outlets must be created for young people to express themselves. The Minister should travel to County Donegal to meet the representatives of the youth councils who will discuss the issues which are important to them such as transportation and bullying. They do not mention drink as a problem and say they are reacting to the lack of trust and confidence in them on the part of adults and the lack of responsibility they feel. The issue should be turned on its head and we should stop looking for scapegoats.I disagree with my colleague, Senator Higgins, who blamed parents for these problems. While I do not have a child, I would find it difficult to be a parent in this day and age. I do not blame parents because their children are out and about. It is not possible to know where they are all the time because they have a little independence. I agree, however, that drinks companies must take responsibility and legislation must be enforced.We are reacting to the problem in this debate. Young people seek space and want to be trusted, but we do not respect them. When I was speaking to a Portuguese man earlier, I asked him about drinking patterns in his country. He said the Portuguese were not like the Irish and that we were all drunkards. While he was joking, he pointed out there were outlets for young people in Portugal. There are societies and sports clubs in the United States, for example, in which young people can participate, but we do not provide for young people in Ireland.Any Government worth its salt would appoint a Minister for youth and separate the office from the formal education system. A Minister for youth could examine all the non-formal aspects of a young person's development and address issues such as bullying, date rape, depression and suicide. This proposal must be taken seriously.
