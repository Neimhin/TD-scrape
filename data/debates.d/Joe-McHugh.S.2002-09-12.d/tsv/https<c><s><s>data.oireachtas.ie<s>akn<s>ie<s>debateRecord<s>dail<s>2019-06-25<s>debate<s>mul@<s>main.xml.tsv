JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills	2002-09-12	None	The work carried out by the 124 special schools is invaluable.  Since my appointment as Minister, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of the schools to see at first hand the work they do. My Department is aware of issues related to very significant increases in insurance costs in some special schools through correspondence received from some special schools, discussions with the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, and media reports. The increases appear to be due, in some instances, to an annual increase in insurance costs generally and, in some cases, an increase in claims against special schools. Securing and maintaining adequate and appropriate insurance cover is a matter for the managerial authority of each school. My Department is working as a matter of urgency with the NABMSE and relevant Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the State Claims Agency to seek a resolution of the issue of increased insurance costs in special schools. A number of options have been identified to address the issue.  They include the development of a group insurance scheme for special schools.  The NABMSE met boards and patrons on 6 June to discuss the matter and the options available.  An official from my Department attended the meeting.   At this stage, the group scheme proposal appears to be the most viable.  The importance of all schools signing up to such a scheme was emphasised at the recent meeting and all school representatives who were in attendance were in favour of exploring the group scheme option. Fifteen special schools that are experiencing difficulty in paying insurance premiums have contacted my Department directly. They report increases in the cost of insurance of between 30% and over 700% in the past two years. To date, my Department has advanced school capitation payments on an exceptional basis to two special schools, amounting to €36,860.  My Department is engaging with the other schools in that regard. However, it is not sustainable for my Department to continue to advance capitation payments as a way of meeting vastly increased insurance premiums. I know that this is a cause of concern for schools also and it is my hope a speedy and cost effective resolution can be secured for special schools which have been impacted on.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The issue of insurance costs for special schools has been raised with me by a number of Deputies. St. Teresa's special school in Ballinasloe was faced with an increased bill. It was not being facilitated by being able to make staged payments and had to pay the bill in one go. It did not have the money to pay it. This is an issue we are taking very seriously. There is a potential option that all of the special schools are prepared to buy into, namely, having one group scheme, rather than individual schools having to deal with insurance costs in isolation. Of the 124 schools, seven are hospital schools. I visited one of them recently in Crumlin. It is very clear that the expenses associated with special schools are over and above those of an average school. I agree with the Deputy that the issue of capitation payments is outstanding. I am committed to doing something about it, obviously within the parameters of the budget to be announced on 8 October. I have no doubt that there will be a discussion between the Deputy's party and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in that regard, but as far as I am concerned, the issue of capitation payments is critical, not just for special schools but also mainstream schools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy knows the figures for the levels of investment in special education. One euro out of every five goes into special education. I refer to a sum of €1.9 billion out of a budget of €11 billion. The sum invested in school transport is more than €207 million, of which 50% is in the area of special education. We have moved into a new era in the past ten years in special education. There are things we are getting right and others that we are getting wrong, but there are ways by which we can improve. The Deputy is correct to say there is special provision in respect of powers I can invoke as Minister. I will talk about that issue when we come to deal with a later question in the context of my frustration and disappointment that some schools are not taking up the option of providing extra classes.  As regards where we are going in special education, the people who provide the inclusion model in schools are enriched by it. The students also come out enriched by it in terms of the experiences they share. A question was asked about the HSE in the context of the general indemnity scheme. A number of special schools under the patronage of organisations that are funded by the HSE to provide health and personal social services on its behalf under section 38 of the Health Act experienced increased insurance quotes when the funded bodies were delegated bodies in the context of the general indemnity scheme under the State Claims Agency. The effect of the delegation was that the special schools under the patronage of the organisations concerned needed to seek separate insurance cover. There is a discussion ongoing in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. In April 2018 the Government announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools in the next four years, from 2019 to 2022, inclusive. The announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department to assess future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. While the announcement did not include a new post-primary school for Kilkenny city, although it does include a new 16 classroom primary school for Kilkenny to be established in September 2021, the requirement for new schools is being kept under ongoing review and, in particular, will have regard to the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. Officials from my Department recently met personnel from Kilkenny County Council when the council’s plans for housing in the Kilkenny area in the coming years were outlined. Further engagement is planned in that regard. Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case and may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one or a combination of the following: utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools; extending the capacity of a school or schools; or the provision of a new school or schools. In that context, as the Deputy will be aware, building projects for five post-primary schools located in Kilkenny are included in my Department's school building programme.  Building projects for Kilkenny will provide additional capacity in the order of 600 additional places above September 2017 levels: Kilkenny CBS - 73 places; St. Kieran's College - 35 places; Pobail Scoil Osraí - 166 places; and Kilkenny city post-primary chool - 334 places. Significant works to improve and expand facilities at Presentation secondary school are also planned.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important that we continue to keep this under review and that, as new planning applications come in, there is communication between the Department and Kilkenny County Council officials. As we plan for the future, it is not about annual or two-year plans, but a ten-year investment of more than €8.4 billion in capital expenditure. We must consider whether capacity exists where schools have the opportunity to put in applications under the additional school accommodation scheme; whether there are solutions within existing infrastructure; and whether we are looking at a future where additional capacity will be required through new schools. Circumstances change, and do so quickly. This happened recently in the Ashbourne area, as Deputy Thomas Byrne knows well. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We can have all the long-term planning forecasting but it is important that Deputies, Senators and councillors have their ears close to the ground to keep us informed. I appreciate the Deputy raising it today.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Considerable investment has gone into the existing stock. On transport, we cannot have a conversation on a different plan for transport and then consider where schools are to be located. We are in the same position with secondary schools now as we were when primary schools saw their demographics increase. Unfortunately, while we managed to maintain the capital budget in education as best we could during the difficult years, there are always legacy issues. The Deputy mentioned Kilkenny CBS, which sought an additional 73 places in its 2017 enrolment. The appointment of consultants to progress the new building project will commence this week. There is movement on several of these matters and I will be happy to share this information with her. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Circular 38/2018, which issued to schools last year, requires all schools to consult with teachers, students and parents in developing policy for the use of smartphones and personal devices in school. This requirement to consult will be underpinned in law once the student and parents charter Bill is enacted. I will publish this Bill in the autumn. Schools are not required to report to my Department on the implementation of circulars and my Department is not aware of any issues in the implementation of this circular in ETB schools. Decisions on the use of smartphones and other such devices in schools are taken at local level by the board of management, which have responsibility for the direct governance of a school under the provisions of the Education Act 1998. My Department recognises the requirement to safeguard children from the negative impact of using digital devices. It is also important that we continue to work together to raise awareness to the benefits of new technologies and to recognise the value of digital technology to enhance teaching and learning for all students while also safeguarding our children online.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a circular; it is not underpinned by legislation. That is why I continue to push ahead with the student and parent charter. It is important. The main reason for introducing this legislation is to give both parents and students a voice on their participation in the education system. I am aware of the public meeting which took place last night in Ratoath and was briefed by my colleague, Deputy Regina Doherty.I have asked my officials to contact and engage with the ETB to see whether we can make progress on this very difficult issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be happy to speak to the Deputy afterwards about last night's meeting to see how we can deal with the issue. The student and parent charter is something on which I have been working very intensively since I was appointed. We will publish it in the coming months. It is important that parents and students have a voice with regard to the circular that was sent. It is not subject to law; it is just a circular. I will contact the ETB about the school that was discussed by the Deputy and that was the subject of the meeting last night. The Deputy referenced my predecessor, Deputy Bruton, who will head an all-Government approach to the use of mobile phone technology and smartphones to try to introduce proper safeguards and safety measures to protect young people. There is a responsibility on the Government, citizens and parents, as well as on the companies to act responsibly. They are the ones with the algorithms, data and information to spot online bullying. We have to ensure this will happen. The world in which we live is different from the one in which the Deputy and I went to school. He went to school a few years after me. Everything in life is about balance. Technology is part of the new world, but it is about balance. I am a traditionalist when it comes to getting back to basics and books will continue to be a fundamental part of children's education. Old teaching techniques will remain a fundamental part, but the world is changing. In the work we do in this House we have embraced technology in the past decade.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. Ensuring every child has access to an appropriate school placement is a priority for me and the Government. Considerable progress has been made in recent years in growing additional provision for children with special educational needs through increased enrolment in mainstream and special classes and special schools. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, plays a central role in advising on the nature and mix of provision required, co-ordinating and supporting the establishment of the necessary number of places to meet local need, including in the area referred to by the Deputy. It is open to any school, including special schools, to make an application to the NCSE for the establishment of a specialised provision and, where sanctioned, a range of supports, including capital funding, is available to the school. My Department works closely with the NCSE in that regard. While progress has been made in recent weeks, further work is required to ensure every child has a suitable school placement for September. Every school has a duty to open special classes and other specialist provision sufficient to meet the needs of the local community. Following the commencement of the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018, a power has been created to allow me to compel a school to make additional provision for special education. As the Deputy is aware, the power has yet to be invoked, but if we meet challenges, we will have to keep a very close eye on this issue. The NCSE has advised my officials that there is a need for some additional specialist education provision in the Dublin 12 area for the upcoming school year and that it is continuing to work with parents and local schools to ensure there will be sufficient special school and special class places for pupils who will require them in the Dublin 12 area in September.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I again thank the Deputy. This type of information on the ground is invaluable to the officials who work on the issue. The Deputy is correct that there are nine autism classes, one early intervention class, eight primary autism classes and five post-primary classes. Out of a budget of €1.9 billion, €300 million goes directly to support services for young autistic children in primary and secondary schools. I encourage the Deputy to continue doing what she is doing and give us information. She has personal contacts and knowledge at local level and may believe schools need more information. Every special school and school with special classes are further enriched by providing for inclusion. If more information is needed for these schools to let them know how invaluable it could be in a local area, I will be happy to do it with my officials.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The NCSE, through its special education needs officers, SENOs, and its network of resources on the ground, constantly engages with principals and different school patrons to identify and determine needs. We have to examine existing capacity. Are some schools willing to invest more and put in additional classes? That is an ongoing challenge. We have 124 special schools nationally and seven hospital schools. We have choices to make all of the time regarding where investment will go. I reiterate that the NCSE is the agency on the ground identifying needs. There will be a constructive response if a need is identified. Regarding a national breakdown of students attending mainstream schools, 63% of young children on the autism spectrum attended mainstream schools, 26% attended special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools and 11% attended special schools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Supporting and caring for a child with special needs can bring worries and concerns that not everyone experiences. It is our job to try and alleviate some of the additional difficulties and stresses and to not add to them. The NCSE, wrote to me on 18 April pursuant to provisions now contained in the Education Act 1998 through which ultimately a ministerial direction can be made requiring a school to make additional special education provision available. The NCSE identified that provision is required for 40 special school places for students with complex needs, including ASD in Dublin 15. As existing special schools could not provide the necessary number of places within the timescale, it is necessary to establish a start-up special school in the area. Given the timing issues, it was essential to appoint a patron of scale with the experience necessary to immediately action and progress the necessary arrangements. Dublin and Dun Laoghaire ETB has agreed to act as patron for this start-up special school and it is progressing recruitment and other arrangements with a view to ensuring the school opens in September. Temporary accommodation has been secured to facilitate the school's start up then.  The advertisement for the role of principal was issued in the first week of June and interviews are to take place shortly. I am anxious that the principal, teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs, in the new school be appropriately supported. My Department, through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, the NCSE and with input from the Middletown Centre for Autism, will develop a programme of professional learning for school staff. This will include upskilling, before the students commence school, on a phased basis and ongoing mentoring, coaching and in-school support during the challenging start-up terms. The NCSE is keeping in regular contact with the parents of the children concerned and will continue to advise them of progress.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is no question about it. We need to keep this issue live on the agenda and we need to continue to debate it in this House. We are putting a great deal of resources into special education. It is now one out of every five euro. We also need, however, to look at how we can provide a more holistic education to people who would not have been getting that in the past. That is why I have set up a social inclusion pilot which will cover west Dublin, Kildare and parts of Wicklow. We have chosen 75 schools. If complex special needs are involved, we will examine the need for a specialist nurse and incorporating the HSE into the pilot as well. That could involve speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or behavioural therapy and having that therapy delivered in a school setting. We have a duty to ensure that follow a totally inclusive approach with every single young person, no matter what disadvantage he or she might be experiencing, whether a physical or otherwise. That is why I have used the word "cumasú", which means "empowerment", at the heart of my education policy to ensure that every single young person is subject to that inclusive approach. We, however, have to continue this debate in this House and it is important we do that because this is a changing world.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is an important issue, which is close to my heart. I visit many primary and post-primary schools and I see the value of that focus on inclusion and the value of SNAs. That is why I am going to work hard regarding the recommendations on behalf of SNAs. I met with the Fórsa trade union last week to discuss the status of SNAs, their training and ongoing professional development. That is because SNAs have led the way. They were in those classrooms before we started talking about the social inclusion pilot and an all-inclusive classroom setting with behavioural therapists and speech and language occupational therapists. I went into a small primary school in Donegal on Monday and I came across a young child named Paul. His mother was able to tell me that there is an additional need beyond speech and language occupational therapy. She was referring to physiotherapy. We are, therefore, learning all of the time and picking up new things. Deputy Paul Murphy is correct in stating that we have to continue to listen to the voices of parents. They are the people who have this lived experience. There is no doubt that the student and parent charter, when it becomes law, will be another vehicle to ensure that those voices are heard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. It relates to my recent education trade mission to the UAE. While there, I engaged with 450 Irish teachers at two meetings in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. I thank all the teachers who turned out on both nights. These meetings gave me the opportunity to hear the challenges facing these teachers and gave them a chance to offer practical solutions to some issues. The meetings allowed me in my role as Minister to meet with these teachers and discuss first hand with them the challenges they face in returning to Ireland, and to consider ways that we can work together to support them when they decide to return to work in Ireland. To facilitate this, teachers volunteered to form a group to liaise on the identified issues with the embassy and my Department. Arrangements are being made for the first meeting of this group in the autumn. During my visit, I also had a number of productive meetings that will further develop and enhance the co-operation that currently exists between Ireland and the UAE in the higher education area.Today I had a follow-up meeting as a result of that engagement in the UAE. The education system plays a key role in forging crucial global relationships and building an international outlook and awareness. One of the core ambitions of my Government’s international education strategy, Irish Educated, Globally Connected, is to support the development of internationally-oriented and globally competitive institutions. The visit has assisted us in delivering on this ambition. I met my counterpart, the Emirati Minister for Education, H.E. Hussain Ibrahim Al Hammadi. We discussed some of the common challenges we faced in our respective education systems and agreed that we would work together to address these challenges through the exchange of information and collaboration. I also visited a number of Emirati higher education Institutions such as Khalifa University and the City University College of Ajman, where I had the opportunity to promote the Irish higher education sector and very fruitful discussions on how to increase the number of academic, research, staff and student exchanges between higher education institutions in both countries. While in Dubai I attended a business breakfast of the Irish Business Network to highlight possibilities for partnerships between Irish and Emirati educational institutions and to meet key Irish business community members. 
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
I also visited RCSI and Mohamed Bin Rashid University in the Mohamed Bin Rashid Academic Medical Centre. The RCSI has been present in Dubai since 2005 offering postgraduate education, training and consultancy in leadership, management, patient safety and quality. There is already a strong connection through the RCSI alumni network and my visit as Minister for Education and Skills aimed to strengthen that relationship. I thank the Irish ambassador and his staff in the Irish Embassy, the local Irish groups, including the GAA, and the Irish living in the UAE for the work they did to make the visit a success.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There was a question of whether I should even have been there because I knew what the issues were before I went. I knew a lot of them - the pay equality issue, problems in teacher supply, the price of accommodation in Dublin and the uncertainty facing substitute teachers when they came back. It was an opportunity for me to highlight what we had done in the past few months to set up teacher supply panels for substitute teachers in counties Dublin, Galway, Meath, Kildare and Cork. The most important part - believe it or not - was the engagement that took place after the meeting during the one-to-one discussions. It was an opportunity to acknowledge the work the teachers were doing internationally. They are acting as Irish ambassadors and doing so well in terms of career progression. They are heads of departments, principals and deputy principals. They have a skill set and there was a conversation about how we could value it when they returned. If someone has been a head of a department for four years in the UAE, how can we inform boards of management of how beneficial that experience would be to their schools? In a nutshell, I felt there would be a positive outcome. I got a sense that we needed to have a better communication system between the Department and all of our teachers abroad, not just in the UAE but also in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and all over the world. I see them as a tremendous asset. Like most Irish people who go away, they want to come back home at some stage.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are several issues. I do not think I met any principal. There were teachers on a career break and a lot of young teachers who had gone out in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. I was aware of this before, but the pay equality issue is big. Those teachers have advocates all around them, not just those who were recruited from 2011 to 2014. People have different motivations for going abroad. We will never be able to compete with the UAE where teachers do not pay tax and their accommodation is paid for. We will not compete as people understand when they go away. The question is how we can make things easier. I acknowledge the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD, the Joint Managerial Body, Education and Training Boards Ireland and the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools. They have produced a one stop shop portal. If a vacancy to teach a subject is available in certain schools, teachers can apply online and interview by Skype. That is happening. We have to think about how we can make things easier and communicate with teachers. I also acknowledge the strong input they are making on the international scene. I met a lot of former teachers who had moved into the UAE's ministry of education. That is a very important link for us. Several other issues were mentioned, but I do not have time to address them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The school building projects referred to by the Deputy are included in my Department's construction programme which is being delivered under the national development plan. Stage 2(b) - detailed design - is arguably the most complex and detailed of all the stages of architectural planning. In addition to securing the necessary statutory approvals, it includes preparation of complex and detailed tender documents.In completing stage 2b, design teams are now required to upgrade design details to ensure that new school buildings are near zero energy buildings, or NZEBs, in compliance with the 2017 amendment of Part L of the current building regulations. In many cases, this has involved a second planning application to allow for the installation of photovoltaic, PV, panels on the roof following receipt of the initial planning permission. The Deputy will appreciate that all major school building projects under the Department's construction programme are progressed through the various stages of architectural planning in accordance with the Department's design team procedures, building control regulations and public works contract requirements. He will also accept that as the funding is Exchequer funding, the process and costs associated with any major project must be fully accounted for. Design teams must therefore be diligent in their preparation of the stage 2b tender documentation to satisfy all regulatory bodies and my Department's design team procedures. This results in minimising delays during further stages of the project.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are a number of reasons for delays. For example, the NZEB regulations were introduced in 2017, which meant many school projects in the 2016-2021 capital programme had to be revised. A number in my own constituency had to go back through the process to ensure the designs met the NZEB provisions. The major question among schools and students themselves relates to environmental standards. When I go to schools that are more than 100 years old, the students ask me how they can be made more environmentally sound and habitable. They ask why they do not have solar panels and why we are not retrofitting them. These are legitimate questions and young people are challenging us on them. It is difficult for students in older schools to watch new schools coming down the line. It raises questions of fairness. There are many competing pressures on the budget and investing to make schools sustainable. There is also the ongoing demographic challenge of increases in population. One can list the reasons. It was not just NZEB. Schools might not have received fire compliance certificates or other issues may have arisen along the way. If the Deputy feels there are schools that are not being progressed properly, I would be very interested to hear about it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy mentioned Lucan Community College. A major building project was authorised to proceed to stage 2b on 14 March 2017. A brief-change report was submitted to the Department in October 2017 to seek approval for a full replacement of or repairs to the existing roof. The Department required a further breakdown of the costs and scope from the design team and that was received in July 2018. The Department approved the full replacement of the existing roof in October 2018. The design team quantity surveyor withdrew from the project in late October 2018 and a replacement tender process was carried out by Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB, the client for the project. The replacement quantity surveyor appointment was ratified in April 2019. The design team is completing stage 2b, including by ensuring the submission is NZEB compliant. That is just one example of the issues we cannot control. If that was one of the schools that has been waiting ten years, I appreciate the deep frustration on the part of the board of management, principal, teachers, students and wider community. We are in the right place now and, hopefully, we can make progress.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue of these schools, as he has done on a number of occasions previously. It keeps them on the radar, which does no harm at all. I will outline the position on the projects referred to by the Deputy. The major building project for St. Eunan's College, Letterkenny, is included on my Department's ADAPT programme. My Department is currently in the process of finalising the appointment of a project manager for this programme. The process to appoint a design team for this project has also recently commenced and is under way. The major building project for Gaelscoil na gCeithre Maistrí is at stage 2a, developed design. At this stage the preferred option design is developed to a stage where the project is fully cost planned and can be prepared to lodge for statutory approvals. The major building project for Little Angels special school is at an advanced stage of architectural planning, stage 2b, detailed design. The stage 2b submission has been reviewed by my Department and comments have issued to the school and its design team. The design team is currently working on a submission to my Department outlining the steps required to achieve compliance with Part L of the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2017 on NZEB. The major building project for Scoil Mhuire, Stranorlar, is also at stage 2b. The pre-qualification process to select a shortlist of contractors for tender stage has been completed and the design team is currently completing work on its NZEB submission. When the design team's revised NZEB submission has been considered, my Department will be in contact with the board of management with regard to the further progression of the project as it then goes to tender.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with what the Deputy has said about the timing of the Scoil Mhuire project. My ambition is ensure this goes to tender as soon as the NZEB requirements are satisfied. Parents will not be satisfied until they see diggers on site. It is important for us to keep the timing on the radar here. I acknowledge that the board of management at Scoil Mhuire in Stranorlar has had a long battle. The safety of the children has been at the heart of the board's concerns when it has been dealing with flooding issues and the school's proximity to the church car park. I know the Deputy will join me in wishing the outgoing principal of Scoil Mhuire, Fintan Keating, well on his retirement. He kept the shoulder to the wheel as well. The least we can do is ensure we get the timing right. The design team process at St. Eunan's College in Letterkenny has started. I agree that a project manager needs to be appointed as soon as possible.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not want to repeat myself. I agree with the Deputy that these projects are important. Tá Gaelscoil na gCeithre Máistrí i mbaile Dhún na nGall iontach tábhachtach ar son na teanga. Tá an sár-obair dhíograiseach atá déanta ar son na scoile thar na blianta le feiceáil. Nuair a bhí mé ann roimh an Nollaig, bhí na páistí uilig ag labhairt Gaeilge agus bhí na tuismitheoirí uilig ag déanamh fíor-iarrachta fosta. Aontaím leis an Teachta go bhfuil an-tábhacht ag baint leis an scoil sin. Little Angels special school is a really important school for County Donegal. I hope progress can be made in respect of the NZEB submission. The progress in relation to that needs to continue. I have mentioned a principal who is retiring. I should also mention Chris Darby of St. Eunan's College. I know Deputy Gallagher will join me in wishing him well.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Budget 2019 marks the third year of a major reinvestment in education. In 2019, the budget for the Department of Education and Skills will increase by €674 million, which represents a 6.7% increase on last year's budget. In total, the education budget will have increased by €1.7 billion compared with 2016. I am holding a symposium tomorrow to engage with people and organisations who work in and with small schools. I am interested to listen to the views of the experts, but more importantly to engage with ideas and proposals on how to support and sustain small schools as a key component of the primary education system. I know my colleagues around the House will be very interested in that. I am working on the assumption that they have been notified about the symposium by email. If they have not been notified, I would like to let them know publicly now that the symposium is taking place in the Hugh Lane Gallery. If they need any information about times etc. they can contact my office. The purpose of the symposium is to focus on how to strengthen and sustain our small primary schools that have one, two, three or four teachers. With regard to class sizes, it is important to point out that over 1,300 additional posts in schools will be funded, including more than 370 teaching posts to cater for growth in student population and additional special classes. The numbers employed in our schools will reach the highest ever level in the coming school year. This builds on the budget 2018 measure which provided a one-point improvement in the staffing schedule in primary schools, which brings the position to the most favourable ever seen at primary level. I am aware of the workload burdens placed on schools. The primary education forum was established in September 2018 to support the planning and sequencing of change in the primary school sector and to exchange information on the intentions and impacts of the actions in the action plan for education to look for synergies and opportunities to streamline implementation and address workload issues. In adopting this approach, my Department and its partners have agreed to make several changes to the pace and sequence of the planned reforms, including the implementation of the primary mathematics curriculum and, second, to sequence the commencement the Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
In addition to managing the sequence of change, the leadership framework introduced in 2017 allows for flexibility in identifying and prioritising the evolving leadership and management needs of schools and in assigning and reassigning post holders to specific roles and responsibilities to meet the evolving needs of schools. Some €2.75 million was allocated in budget 2017 to restore middle management positions. Today, more than one in three primary school teachers holds a management position. In addition, schools with teaching principals saw an increase in the number of principal release days in each of the last two budgets. I am pleased to have been able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools. This will apply from the start of the 2019-20 school year. Over the course of the 2019-20 school year, an additional €10 million will be allocated to primary and post-primary schools, of which €4 million will be allocated in 2019. I fully acknowledge that the issues raised by the Deputy in her question are important for future investment. I will take account of the budgetary submissions from all the relevant education stakeholders.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are making progress with the pupil-teacher ratio. The Deputy is correct when she says we have a long way to go. I am reminded of the seanfhocal, mol an lá um thráthnóna, we praise the day in the evening. We will not ease off on this important issue at EU and OECD levels. There was a reduction of 11% in capitation funding in 2011. This massive reduction was introduced as part of the wider reductions that were being made right across the Government at the time. It was a very difficult one for communities. School communities are always on hand to help to support local primary and secondary schools. Putting fuel in the tank and ensuring the school carries on each day are bread and butter issues. There has been an increase of 5% this year. I am conscious that there is some way to go when it comes to capitation, which will be at the heart of the conversation when I sit down with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree entirely with the Deputy's final point. The issues that present themselves in our primary schools are much more complex than they used to be. Teachers are aware of that.Continuous professional development training is important, as is equipping them with the skills and capacity to deal with these emerging issues. I see a lot of schools acting as support for one another, which involves schools principals meeting informally. More than ever, teachers and principals are rising to the challenge.  The Deputy mentioned island schools, which are really important. We introduced a policy measure that will retain the two-teacher provision for island schools irrespective of a decrease in the numbers. There are 26 one-teacher schools, 537 two-teacher schools, and 376 three-teacher schools in the country. In 2018 and 2019, the number of schools in the one, two, three and four-teacher category is 1,367, which is 44% of the total number of schools, which is 3,100. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I fully recognise the need to improve capitation funding for schools and in the Action Plan for Education, I have committed to the restoration of capitation. I am pleased to have been able to provide for a 5% increase in capitation funding for primary and post-primary schools that will apply from the start of the 2019-20 school year this autumn. Over the course of the school year 2019-20, an additional €10 million will be allocated to primary and post-primary schools, of which €4 million will be allocated in 2019. I must be prudent. In the context of ongoing budgetary pressures, it is not possible to do everything that I would like to do in the education sector in any one year. It is my intention to seek funding in the next budget for further capitation increases for schools.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The phrase, "modest demands", constitutes new vocabulary for me. There are many demands on this Department. When one considers a budget of €11 billion, the first question one asks is about how surely there is enough money in there to do everything we seek to do but the basics are really important. The Deputy is correct in pointing out that capitation is the bread and butter that keeps schools moving. The fact that there is a bit of flexibility around using ancillary and capitation funding together for expenditure is really important. Boards of management and parents' associations always go back cap in hand to the community and parents and the water eventually runs dry but I know that schools are such a fundamental part of the community. The day of the school gate being a dividing line between the school and the community is gone. I see the role now played by the private sector, for example, in secondary schools where it is looking to help out with computers. The community will always want to be part of the contributory process but we must also get the balance right and if capitation funding is needed, it is something on which I will focus.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We are taking the deep retrofitting of schools very seriously. This is why we have launched an initial pilot between my Department and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment in conjunction with the SEAI. One cannot use the word "modest" when one is talking about €30 million, which is a lot of money, but in the bigger scheme of things where one has 4,000 schools, €30 million will only do X number of those schools but we are looking at ways of ensuring that we do the proper deep retrofitting of schools because as I said earlier, students are demanding. Young people in these older schools are asking questions around climate change, are looking to their immediate environment and are asking why they are sitting in an environment like it. It goes back to choices. It goes back to the choices we must all make as politicians and the Deputy will recall the difficult years from 2011 through to 2016. Trying to deep retrofit all these schools in one go cannot happen but we must provide a pathway and instil confidence in young people that we are committed to it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am unsure whether the Deputy was scolding me for smiling. Perhaps I need to cut back a wee bit on that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As part of a series of reviews of further education and training programmes, SOLAS commissioned an independent review of the national Youthreach programme, which was conducted by the ESRI. The report, which was launched on 17 June, provides a comprehensive evaluation of the national Youthreach programme and demonstrates the positive impact of Youthreach for learners. The evaluation noted that demand for Youthreach across both Youthreach centres and community training centres has fallen by 11% in the period 2015 to 2017, with a further fall in demand in 2018. Some of this decline is related to the improved economic circumstances and availability of jobs. In addition, the school retention rate continues to improve with 91% of students completing their leaving certificate examinations.The evaluation also found there is uneven geographical distribution of Youthreach places. SOLAS has considered the key review findings and has developed a response document that sets out 17 recommendations to further improve and develop the Youthreach programme. These recommendations are framed in the context of the broader reform and integration of further education and training, FET, provision in general and the evolving strategy for the FET system. The recommendations include considering the issues of uneven geographical distribution in annual local and national system planning, as well as ETBs, reviewing the sustainability of all centres. In doing so, SOLAS and ETBs will be ensuring there is an appropriate balance of provision across levels one to six of the national framework of qualifications in providing both employment and progression opportunities to learners.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The good news is that my officials have started the engagement. There will be a mechanism to consider all the recommendations and see how we can progress these. We will not single out one or another. Youthreach is an invaluable pathway for young people who are struggling with mainstream education. I recognise the benefit of the relationship between the principal of the mainstream school and the Youthreach team. When there is a good relationship, it works well. It is about creating the awareness of the benefit. At the launch in Dublin in the past week, I met a wonderful young woman who had been in her sixth year in mainstream education but it was not working for her. She subsequently went into the Youthreach programme and received the support and education she needed. It was transformative and she is now in third level studying art and design. We have to continue to channel that awareness but also to accentuate career progression. While that sounds a bit mechanical, we also need, through the programme, to help young people prepare for life and give them the skills to equip them for life.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The participation rate in Youthreach centres has reduced for several reasons, including full employment. There are still, however, gaps among young Travellers and migrants. Are we equipping them with the proper education to given them the skills to advance to third level or apprenticeship programmes? SOLAS has a key role to play in all of this. It is working with the third level sector and mainstream secondary school sector. It will have a key role in these recommendations. Practising politicians have an idea that the solution is to send everybody to third level. That is one part of the solution. We have to create positive awareness of apprenticeships. I recently visited the Combilift company in County Monaghan. It was like being in a university complex, seeing young women doing apprenticeships there and their feeling of satisfaction with them. We will have to continue with the engagement by industry with the second level sector and Youthreach.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas and uses a geographical information system, using data from a range of sources, to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise. With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. Where demographic data indicate that additional provision is required, the delivery of such additional provision is dependent on the particular circumstances of each case. It may, depending on the circumstances, be provided through either one, or a combination of utilising existing unused capacity within a school or schools, extending the capacity of a school or schools and the provision of a new school or schools. The Government recently announced plans for the establishment of 42 new schools over the next four years, 2019 to 2022, including a new eight-classroom primary school to be established in 2020 to serve the Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart school planning area. This announcement follows nationwide demographic exercises carried out by my Department into the future need for primary and post-primary schools across the country. The four-year horizon will enable increased lead-in times for planning and delivery of the necessary infrastructure. My Department approved two temporary classrooms and a special education teaching room for Scoil Chrónáin national school, Rathcoole, in 2018. The additional classes approved in 2018 are currently accommodated in Rathcoole community centre pending installation of the temporary classrooms at the school.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Deputy’s analysis on this and on the previous occasion he raised this matter. My Department continues to engage with officials at local authority level on housing data and population growth. My Department has recently approved two further mainstream classrooms for Scoil Chrónáin to cater for additional primary school places in Rathcoole for September 2019. The responsibility for the installation of these classrooms has also been devolved to the board of management. The requirement for new schools will be kept under ongoing review and, in particular, would have regard to the impact of the increased roll-out of housing provision as outlined in Project Ireland 2040. My Department will also continue to monitor areas where the accommodation of existing schools may need to be expanded to meet the needs of the local population.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will keep it under review.
