JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, to the House and congratulate him on his well-deserved appointment. Even while he was in Europe local issues always had a place in his heart and he never left Donegal out of the picture, which is much appreciated. A good decision was made in appointing him Minister of State.From his European experience, the Minister of State will understand that calls have been made to consider models of regionalism under which power is brought back to the people of a region. He should carry that through in his current post. The north-west is a natural region. When I refer to this region, I do not mean only Donegal but the area that encompasses Tyrone, Derry, Fermanagh, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim. I have never considered that this area is divided by the Border. When we talk about the Border, we sometimes overlook the co-operation that has been exercised in that region. In order for a small county like Donegal to survive on the periphery, it must co-operate with places such as Derry.There is a committee in the area called the European Regional Network for the Application of Communications Technology, ERNACT, with which the Minister of State will be familiar. Derry and Donegal co-operate closely in terms of IT and former Senator Paddy McGowan used to sit on the committee. Since 1990, this innovative committee, which has come up with some great ideas, has drawn down about 13 million ECU for cross-Border co-operation and programmes.Senator O'Toole referred to a company that was trying to get into Letterkenny and Derry and which finally established its operations in Derry because no ISDN or broadband facilities were available in Letterkenny. ERNACT has always proposed that we set up a digital hub that would straddle the Border. Rather than thinking in terms of having to choose between Derry and Letterkenny, we should look to the expertise and opinions of this committee.I have sat on the ERNACT committee for the past three years along with Sinn Féin's Mr. Mitchell McLoughlin. That is where the real cross-Border discussion takes place. It is not the sort of rubbish Sinn Féin comes out with on the national airwaves about wanting the Six Counties back and other such propaganda. Mr. McLoughlin sat on the committee with me and we co-operated for the good of the north-west region. I sometimes criticise party politicians for using the Border to gain votes. We should use it to benefit our communities in an economic and social way.The BMW region is an Objective One region and was established simply because it needed investment and funding from Europe. We do not give it enough autonomy. I appeal to the Minister of State to consider giving it more autonomy because, otherwise, the spatial strategy will not work. It is a mechanism for filtering money and we must give the region the respect it deserves in keeping with the European model of regional autonomy.The Western Development Commission was hoping to obtain €8 million this year, but it only received €2 million. Its remit includes counties such as Clare and it covers the entire western seaboard from Donegal. This group is trying to come up with innovative ideas in the areas of agri-tourism and organic farming in order to help in setting up local industries. However, its funding has been reduced. We should make sure we keep our eye on the ball in terms of funding groups of this nature.I welcome the designation of Letterkenny as a gateway town in this aspirational spatial strategy. However, it is not just a matter of writing it down on paper. The Minister of State knows that as one travels to west Donegal it is virtually impossible for one to get through when one passes over the mountain top on the N56. It can take one up to 20 minutes to travel nearly 2 km into Letterkenny in the morning. There is no point having a gateway if the necessary infrastructure is not in place.I appreciated the debate we had at a meeting of Donegal County Council during which the Minister of State said that money for the roads programme was being increased. However, I am concerned about National Roads Authority funding. Donegal would be glad to receive €22 million this year and could survive on €9 million. Instead, it looks as though we will only get €5 million. We must also keep our eyes on the ball when dealing with the NRA.Carrickfinn Airport must be included in the national spatial strategy. Even though I live in Donegal, I only visited the airport for the first time on Monday morning. Although there were no flights going out, I was impressed with what I saw. We should consider the Carrickfinn and City of Derry airports as two ways of promoting the region through regional aviation. In Sweden, tireless work has been done to promote regional aviation. The Swedes have removed cars from their roads by subsidising internal flights. We should engage in further promotion of internal flights. If Letterkenny is to be a gateway, this must happen in tandem with its development.There is no point in having planning laws which encourage people to live in the country if they have to travel into Letterkenny each day. There is no reason that we cannot have small businesses in Kincasslagh, Milford or Fanad. I have always promoted cottage-type industries. People think these involve basket-weaving, but cottage industries can also involve, for example, information technology. People in rural areas can operate their own businesses. This is something we must consider in relation to the spatial strategy.In the past I publicly criticised IDA Ireland, which has failed the peripheral regions of Donegal on the basis that it is following a model of trying to attract large-scale industry to places such as Milford. It is still trying to attract large-scale industry to the former Fruit of the Loom plant. If IDA Ireland is successful in that regard, I will welcome its achievement. However, we should be concentrating on small units of indigenous industry and working from the bottom up, rather than waiting for investment from the USA for peripheral regions.I welcome the aspirational aspects of the report, but it will come to nothing unless we put in place the necessary resources. I am confident about following the model described. It is parochial to welcome the designation of Letterkenny as a gateway town, but it has always been a gateway in terms of the Derry-Letterkenny link.I welcome Senator Mansergh's assertion that the Border should become more permeable and I am sure Senator Wilson, who comes from the region, also agrees with it. Let us use the Border for everyone's benefit by incorporating it into the spatial strategy.
