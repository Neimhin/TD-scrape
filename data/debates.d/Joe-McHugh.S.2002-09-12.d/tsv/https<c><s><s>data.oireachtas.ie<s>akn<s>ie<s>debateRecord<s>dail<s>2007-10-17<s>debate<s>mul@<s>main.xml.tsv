JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On No. 40, the electoral amendment Bill, when will the report by the Constituency Commission on constituencies for DÃ¡il and European Parliament be published?  A new constituency commission is to be established in advance of the next local elections.  What will be its composition?  Will adjustments be made to local electoral boundaries prior to the 2009 local elections to address over and under representation in some electoral areas?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am a new Deputy, wet behind the ears and naive to the process, but the electoral Bill referred to other electoral matters to be dealt with.  It is in black and white.  On behalf of Deputy Varadkar and myself, what are the other matters?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In deference to and respect for local councillors, they should be given advance notice if their areas are to be carved up.
