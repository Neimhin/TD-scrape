JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	While I was not present for the first debate, I am glad to contribute.We must keep things in perspective when we examine Ireland's performance at the Olympic Games. The main factor is that Ireland has a population of 4 million as against a population of 380 million in the United States. For the two weeks of the Olympic Games I was on holiday in France which has a population of approximately 70 million and there appeared to be national celebrations whenever someone won a bronze medal in fencing or some other event. We must keep things in proportion because Ireland's population is smaller than that of many other participating countries. Moreover, as Deputy Deenihan mentioned on a previous occasion, our main sports are hurling, Gaelic football, rugby and soccer. As the Chairman knows, in County Donegal fencing means keeping in the sheep or keeping out the cows. I do not wish to be flippant but we must keep things in perspective.Deputy O'Malley stated she was willing to offer suggestions or advice to the Olympic Council of Ireland. Perhaps the Progressive Democrats are her ideal model of democracy where everything is transparent.
JoeMcHugh	Seanator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with Deputy Wall on the issue of gender balance. I assume that the representatives from the Olympic Council of Ireland work in a voluntary capacity. Although I do not want to criticise Deputy O'Malley, we should commend anyone who has given 20 years service to an organisation in a voluntary capacity, particularly as we have ackowledged that it is difficult to find volunteers.Deputy Deenihan has produced a report on the participation of women in sport which shows an imbalance. However, these are the challenges which lie ahead. What percentage of coaches are women?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This illustrates that there is an imbalance. What challenges does the Olympic Council of Ireland anticipate and how will it ensure organisations increase the level of participation of women as coaches and in sport generally?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Pardon my ignorance but is jujitsu an Olympic sport?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is there talk about making it one?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I mention it because there was a jujitsu champion in Letterkenny who won the silver medal in the world championships.
