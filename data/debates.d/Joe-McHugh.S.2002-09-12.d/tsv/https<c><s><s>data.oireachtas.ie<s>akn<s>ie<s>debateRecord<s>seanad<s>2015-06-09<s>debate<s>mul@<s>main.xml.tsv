JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank all of the Senators who contributed to the debate. I am pleased that the Bill has attracted a significant degree of consensus, in particular on the establishment of the new policing authority. As the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, mentioned in her introductory remarks, the Government's overall objective is to maintain public confidence in An Garda Síochána and ensure the service it provides is of the highest quality. Significant progress has been made in implementing the Government's comprehensive justice reform programme. This is an area to which it attaches the highest priority. The establishment of an independent policing authority is at the core of its reform programme and it is designed to substantially improve the accountability of An Garda Síochána. In addition to strengthening Garda accountability, the new authority will provide an independent forum for the public oversight of policing services in Ireland and a new engine to drive reforms of the policing system and practices. This will contribute significantly to ensuring An Garda Síochána will be fit to meet ongoing and emerging challenges in 21st century policing. The Bill reflects many of the relevant recommendations contained in the Oireachtas joint committee's review of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 published in October 2014. In particular, provision is made for the policing authority to initially operate in shadow format. Further recommendations of the Oireachtas joint committee are being considered, including the establishment of an overarching criminal justice inspectorate along the lines of the model adopted in Northern Ireland. The authority will be independent in carrying out its functions and will have extensive powers in key areas such as the appointment and removal of senior Garda personnel. As the Minister explained, arising from the requirements of the Constitution, a number of the functions of the authority will be exercised on the basis of co-agreement with the Minister. In addition, as indicated by her, a large body of reforms have been undertaken within An Garda Síochána and there will be a central role for the policing authority in supervising their implementation. The Minister is grateful for the support expressed for the Bill in this House. I hope, given the level of consensus demonstrated, that it will be possible to have it enacted quickly. I appreciate that there may be certain aspects of it that Senators will wish to discuss in more detail. Certainly, the Minister will be happy to address specific issues that may be raised today or in the future. She intends to introduce on Committee Stage a limited number of amendments, principally related to governance and other matters of a technical nature, to sections 37, 43, 44 and 46. She is also looking at the introduction of amendments with regard to the informal resolution of less serious complaints made against members of An Garda Síochána. In addition, it is possible that, for technical reasons, there may be some further amendments brought forward. I extend my personal condolences to the family of the late Sergeant Michael Galvin and his colleagues in An Garda Síochána on their recent tragic loss. As the Acting Chairman is aware, it is a very difficult time for the family and the force in County Donegal and the wider Sligo-Leitrim area. I am keen to express my gratitude to the Senators who have supported the Bill and look forward to its passage through the House. Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le achan Seanadóir a thug tacaíocht i dtreo an Bhille. Tá mé ag súil go mór leis an turas reachtaíochta fríd an Teach seo.
