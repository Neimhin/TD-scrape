JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister. This is a very sensitive issue which I find great difficulty in debating. If any heroes emerge from the affair, it is the Irish Haemophilia Society for its trojan work and endeavours. The group deserves to be commended and I appreciate the Minister's decision to allocate €300,000 to it last week. Is it, however, enough? Although I accept the IHS is an ad hoc group, has provision been made to mainstream it?We have all encountered people who were affected by this issue, no more so than in County Donegal. Mrs. Brigid McCole, who passed away in October 1996 at 54 years of age, was such a person. I will not dwell on the details of her case, except to highlight the letter she received from the Blood Transfusion Services Board 12 days before she died in which it was stated that while the BTSB accepted responsibility for her condition, Mrs. McCole would face legal bills if she failed to win her legal case.Mistakes have been, but today we are not in the business of apportioning blame. While I welcome the Minister's public apology on behalf of the Government as an important step, did we go far enough, particularly with regard to the terms of reference of the Lindsay tribunal?Senator Terry referred to culpability. As the Irish Haemophilia Society has pointed out, we are nowhere near identifying who is culpable. Like Senator Maurice Hayes and Senator Ryan, I welcome the decision to forward the report to the DPP. I also welcome the initiatives and controls to be introduced in the Department for Health and Children to prevent a future tragedy. The kernel of the problem, however, is that we must consider the feelings of the people who are enduring pain today. This is where the Lindsay tribunal did not go far enough. Not alone should the report be given to the DPP, but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should also be involved in the matter. The 79 people who were murdered, albeit inadvertently, have relatives who have to live with this for the rest of their lives yet, according to the report, nobody is culpable.The reason this is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the families are seeking justice. Despite the tribunal and the possibility of compensation, they require justice. As this is a matter for criminal investigation – perhaps that sounds a little radical for the Minister – the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should have been included in the terms of reference of the tribunal.The Lindsay report deals with a very sensitive area and is not a matter for party political debate. I concur with Senator Feeney's remarks on the emotional nature of the issue given that people have lost their lives and other lives will be lost. I offer my sympathy to those affected. As I wish to avoid concluding on a negative note, I reiterate my welcome for the measures announced by the Minister.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Hear, hear.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I congratulate Senator Coghlan on bringing forward this timely and apt motion on behalf of Fine Gael. Let us talk with a degree of reality. I met with 16 supervisors in Donegal yesterday and they were not talking about cutbacks. They were talking about redundancies. That is the feeling on the ground in Donegal. These supervisors, whom we have failed to mention in the debate, have been downtrodden for the past ten years. They are on one year contracts and they are now talking about redundancies. That is a disgrace.Senator Feighan used the word "folly". It was folly for the Government not to have given a commitment to such schemes during the past five years. Has it forgotten what they involve? Community employment schemes are not about taking people off the live register, but about giving confidence to people with low levels of self-esteem, thus empowering them to work part-time or full-time.Senator White hit the nail on the head and, although she said her party was not part of this ideal, will be more than welcome if she wants to follow our ideals. Members on the Fianna Fáil benches should leave politics out of it, follow their consciences and vote for Senator Coghlan's motion.I do not mind being parochial when talking about County Donegal because it has a higher than average unemployment rate. It should, therefore, be an exception. I am talking passionately about this subject because six years ago I was a FÁS supervisor. For a year 15 people participated in the scheme for which I was responsible, of which eight are now in full-time employment and one is a FÁS supervisor.Community employment is about allowing those whose self-esteem has been damaged by our school system, by the community or in their family lives to make progress. By introducing reductions, however, the Government has not taken into consideration the role of such schemes. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say he is not talking about reductions. We should be discussing increases in the schemes whose value is immeasurable. This is not a question of getting people off the dole to reduce the unemployment statistics, but about giving them a second chance at life through training. Such people may have been damaged through bullying at school or in their own families and deserve another chance. I beseech Fianna Fáil Senators to follow their consciences and vote with us.
