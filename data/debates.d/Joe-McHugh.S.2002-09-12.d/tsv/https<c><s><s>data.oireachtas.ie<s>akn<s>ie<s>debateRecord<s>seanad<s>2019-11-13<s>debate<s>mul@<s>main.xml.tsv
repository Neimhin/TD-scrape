JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	It was a very welcome intervention that I could not forget. It was an important intervention as well because the Senator was specifically talking about the voice of the student. That is something I am extremely interested in and I was part of the formation of Donegal Youth Council a long time ago back in 2000. It is really important to get the voice of the student right. I did a wee bit of background checking on this and I do not have any evidence that even over the last two decades there has been any significant issue of boards being dissolved by schools or anything like that. I am confident the specific reference in the Bill to a "student council (where one has been established)" is simply reflecting the fact that primary schools may not have a student council. When no student council has been established the Bill still provides for consultation with the student body. I specifically refer to section 27B(1) of the Bill, which deals with the process where a school should prepare its student and parent charter. The key focus of this legislation is on schools informing students, consulting with students and responding to feedback from student and school plans, policies and activities. This is specifically reflected in the large number of provisions in the Bill. I am confident the provisions in the Bill will allow that student voice to be heard. The big part of it is the fact the students will be working with the boards of management. Where schools do not have a student council, they will work along the guidelines. As somebody who shares the Senator's strong opinions on advocacy of the student's voice, I am confident the provisions in the Bill would do enough in themselves. It is not necessary to put anything further in there to strengthen it. That is why I will unfortunately not be accepting amendment No. 15.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate where the Senator is coming from. One of the things we are trying to avoid here is uniformity. Senator Ruane, other Senators in the House and I know that no two schools are the same in ethos and philosophy. I reassure the Senator that there is provision for this within the guidelines. The education partners will include student representative bodies as well and I know we are living in a period where the voice of the student is becoming stronger and louder and there is a sense of urgency in that voice as well. When the education partners meet at the consultative stage of the development of this Bill, there will be a lot of suggestions for the guidelines. I reiterate I am confident they will get it right. I know what the Senator is saying about whether there should be a prescription around how many meetings a year the student councils should have but that gets the Bill into-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	-----disrupting schools. In some schools they meet on a very regular basis and different schools have different ways of doing things. We will look at this again before Report Stage. If there is anything we can do to build reassurances around that, I will get my officials to look at it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The amendment provides for the explanation of the role and complaints procedure of the Ombudsman for Children to be included in section 28. I accept that the Bill does not currently make it an explicit requirement that the grievance procedures would require that schools inform students or parents of their right to make a complaint to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children following the exhaustion of those procedures. However, it is my intention that this requirement will be included in the guidelines on the grievance procedures. Nonetheless, I understand and agree with the intention of the Senator in respect of her amendment. However, I consider the wording that refers to grievance procedures including "an explanation of the role of the Ombudsman for Children" is too broad. It is preferable and more practicable to ensure that the grievance procedures make clear that students and parents should be informed, that they can make a complaint to the Ombudsman for Children's Office, and that they must be provided with the relevant information or contact details in order to do so. I do not think it appropriate for the grievance procedures to set out in detail an explanation of the ombudsman's role. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment in its current form. I am happy to have my officials consider this issue further with the legislative drafters, with a view to bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage, if required. I agree with the intention of the Senator in respect of her amendment. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for his amendment. The amendment requires a school that decides not to deal with a grievance on the basis that it is vexatious or frivolous to notify the student, parent or parents as to why the school has deemed the grievance to be vexatious or frivolous and to keep a record of the decision. Section 8 of the Bill replaces the existing section 28 of the Education Act 1998 and provides for new standardised grievance procedures in all schools. The charter guidelines will set out the details of the new grievance procedures and these will focus on dealing with complaints efficiently, effectively, fairly and, as far as possible, informally. The grievance procedures will be developed in consultation with the stakeholders, including parents and student representatives, which will help to ensure the procedures are straightforward, fair and accessible to parents and students. The new section 28(1)(d) provides that the new grievance procedures shall include a requirement on schools to give reasons for decisions in relation to grievances. It is intended that this would also include schools giving reasons when they decide not to deal with a grievance when the grievance is, in the opinion of the school, vexatious or frivolous. Therefore, I consider that the Bill already provides for schools to provide reasons where they decide not to deal with a vexatious or frivolous grievance and that the amendment proposed is not required. However, I am happy to have this matter further considered. If it is considered necessary to include an explicit amendment to provide for this, I will be happy to bring an amendment forward on Report Stage. I note that there appears to be an error in the wording of the amendment which uses the term "notify the complaint". The Senator has pointed out that this should read "notify the complainant". While I will not accept the amendment in its current form, I am more than happy to consider the matter to try to provide more clarity on Report Stage. I will also consider making an explicit reference to the matter in the Bill. I will be happy to do that if the Senator is happy to work with me. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for tabling this amendment. It would provide for the repeal of subsection (2) thereby deleting subsection (9)(2) of the Ombudsman Children Act 2002, which prevents the Ombudsman from investigating a complaint until a local school compliant process has been exhausted. I understand the concerns raised by the Senator and my Department is actively considering this provision in conjunction with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children. There is ongoing engagement on that. That engagement will involve the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General and a decision will be made when it has concluded. As part of this work, further, more detailed consideration must be given as to how best to balance factors such as the valid issues raised by the Senator, the current legal framework under which the Ombudsman for Children's office operates, the autonomy of schools and the general desirability that grievance procedures at school level should be followed before the Ombudsman for Children's office would become involved in a complaint. While I cannot accept the amendment at this time, I assure the Senator that this issue remains under active consideration by my officials. I hope to bring forward an amendment for Report Stage. In layman's terms, it is not giving the Ombudsman the full rein but there are examples where schools may in the future frustrate or delay proceedings. That is the space we are in. I am happy to consider the issue again but, because a conversation is ongoing between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Ombudsman for Children, I am not in a position to accept this amendment today.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I briefly wish to thank the Senators. Amendment No. 5 was discussed during the debate on the Bill last week. Its content now forms part of the Bill, having been voted through last week. I wish to advise the House that both my officials and I need to examine the provision in more detail in conjunction with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to consider how it will work with the other provisions of the Bill. In particular, I need to reflect on the additional administrative burden the amendment places on schools. From a technical drafting point of view, I also need to consider whether the amendment is inserted in the most appropriate section of the Bill and whether it may need to included in a separate section. There is a bit of housekeeping to be done in that regard. As a courtesy, I want to advise the House that I may need to bring forward an amendment to this provision on Report Stage. I want to be courteous and nice about it rather than demanding.
