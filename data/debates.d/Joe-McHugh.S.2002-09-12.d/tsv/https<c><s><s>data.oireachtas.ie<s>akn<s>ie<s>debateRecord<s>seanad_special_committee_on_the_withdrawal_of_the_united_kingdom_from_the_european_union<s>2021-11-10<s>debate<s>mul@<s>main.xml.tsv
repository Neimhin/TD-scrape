JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy O'Dowd. In accordance with current guidelines, all documentation for the meeting has been circulated to members using the Microsoft Teams platform. Today's meeting is a joint meeting involving the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU. I am delighted to be joined today by Deputy Lawless, Vice Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement; Senator Lisa Chambers, Chair of the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU; and other members of these committees. Unfortunately, due to restrictions on numbers permitted in committee rooms, the other members are joining the meeting online. Due the cross-sectoral nature of the Northern Ireland protocol, we are delighted to have the opportunity to meet with Members of the House of Lords in joint session and discuss areas of particular concern to our respective committees. On behalf of the committees, I welcome from the House of Lords Sub-committee on the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland, Lord Jay of Ewelme, Chair; Lord Empey; Baroness Goudie; Baroness O’Loan; Baroness Ritchie of Downpatrick; Lord Thomas of Gresford; and Lord Hain. Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege. However, before we do that, perhaps the other Co-Chairmen, Deputy Lawless and Senator Chambers, can introduce themselves. I know that Deputy Lawless wants to say a few words on the sad passing of former Deputy Austin Currie, who many members met and knew over the years. We are all thinking of Austin Currie's family. His daughter, Senator Emer Currie, is a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I invite Deputy Lawless to say a few words. 
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I will move onto the note on privilege. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or to engage otherwise in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative to comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege and, as such, they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as a witness who is physically present does. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised that they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make that person identifiable. For anyone watching the meeting, Members of the Oireachtas and witnesses now have the option of being physically present in the committee room or of joining the meeting remotely via Microsoft Teams. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lord Jay for that presentation. We will try to be as systematic and as organised as possible with three committee chairs. We will start with the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. I will call members of this committee, which I chair. We will move to Deputy Lawless's committee and Senator Chambers will facilitate the members of her committee. We will be quite ruthless and rigid about this. Members will have four minutes and I will call two members at a time. Members can decide whether they want to direct their questions to Lord Jay or to specific Members of the House of Lords. We will leave it up to Lord Jay to decide if it is a general question. I call Deputy Haughey who will be followed by Deputy Howlin.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thought by saying I would be ruthless, I would get compliance. Lord Jay has 14 seconds to answer Deputy Haughey but I will allow a bit latitude out of respect to the Deputy. I remind members that many people wish to speak today, so they should be specific in their questions.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank Lords Hain and Jay for their contributions. That certainly gives a sense of the immediacy and the significance of today's statement and the role that we will have to play as parliamentarians. I call Deputy Howlin who will be followed by Deputy Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Howlin. I will hand over to Deputy James Lawless after this. My next two contributors are Deputies Richmond and Ó Murchú. Deputy Lawless will be first. I call Lord Jay.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	We will move to the next couple, Deputy Richmond followed by Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I hand over to Lord Jay.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	 I thank Lord Jay. We will go straight over to Deputy Ó Murchú.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Now that the Deputy's time is up, I am faced with the dilemma of deciding whether to let someone in to answer or to move on. I will make an exception to the rule because the Deputy is a nice guy, and I will hand back to Lord Jay.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	He has left.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	That message to never stop talking is strong. I am reminded of a taxi driver in Armagh during a particularly difficult time in the peace process who made the exact same point. He said it was a difficult time but we should keep the conversations going and keep talking. We hear that message. The discussion is a bit of a one-way street, with members here firing the questions at the witnesses. We want to try that in reverse now. Senator Chambers and I will try to direct the witnesses' questions to members who are interested in taking them.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	It is a real concern. When Brexit started to dominate the conversation back in 2016, people were saying it would be the preserve of the politicians, the media and the chattering classes and it dominated those three categories. People and businesses got on with things. The message coming from industry and business in Northern Ireland today is that the protocol presents a real opportunity for business in the North. I am a Deputy from a Border constituency and many of our businesses have adapted and sought out new markets. They have been positive and just got on with it. Triggering Article 16 would be difficult, not just from the point of view of the relationship between Ireland and the UK but also from the point of view of the relationship between the UK and the European Union. Our big fear is that the gains of the Good Friday Agreement, which has facilitated and allowed people to get on with each other on a cross-Border basis and within Northern Ireland, will be lost. People want to move on with their lives.The strong message coming from today's meeting is that we have a strong duty and sense we have to stand up to the challenge and deal with whatever is coming down the track. Certainly, if triggering Article 16 will be the position and happen, we will be faced with a difficult conundrum. To answer Lord Jay's question on how constituents on the ground feel about this, sometimes or maybe all the time, our constituents are way ahead of us legislators. However, the sense I have from my constituency is that once Brexit became a reality, the reality is that with it comes trade difficulties. However, the work and effort that went into the protocol was a way of facilitating a real opportunity and it is hoped sense will prevail. I will hand over to Senator Chambers and then Lord Jay can open it up to his colleagues for questions from our side.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Howlin will have a unique insight, representing the constituency in which Rosslare Europort is located.
JoeMcHugh	Co-Chairman (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I do not think Deputy Ó Murchú was filibustering so that we would miss the Lord Frost presentation at a 11.45 a.m. The tone of today's meeting was serious, as we all know the significance of what lies ahead. I know Lord Thomas put a lot of thought and time into what he believes can be solutions. Ultimately, however, there are very solid EU proposals there at the moment, and we hope the UK will take them on board and avoid a situation which we, as politicians, and particularly our constituents do not want to face.  I would like to thank Deputy Lawless, Vice Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and Senator Lisa Chambers for trying to do a trilateral chairmanship. Senator Chambers proposed widening this out further to include local Northern representatives, and Baroness Ritchie agreed with her. I also think that would be a very good idea, so we will try to pursue that. I thank Lord Jay and his team for their time. This is a serious matter but politics is about the art of finding solutions. We face many obstacles and challenges in the days ahead but we all know what we have gained through politics, seeing the likes of Senator Blaney and Lord Hain here today, both of whom I believe co-chaired the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, as it was 20 years ago. This is not about relationship building among ourselves, but about what we will do to make things work. Go raibh míle maith agaibh uilig. Beimid ar ais arís. We will be back again. Guím gach rath oraibh. I wish you all well. Let us keep the conversation going.
