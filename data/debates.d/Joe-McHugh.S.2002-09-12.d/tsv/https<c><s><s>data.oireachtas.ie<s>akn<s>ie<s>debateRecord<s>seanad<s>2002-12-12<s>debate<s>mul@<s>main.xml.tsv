JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will the Leader give serious consideration to moving No. 11, motion 7, on the Order Paper from non-Government business to Government business in light of the recent budget, the cutbacks in rural and western areas and the lone furrow Senator Paddy Burke has been ploughing in regard to the Border, midland and western region? Like Senator White, I am a newcomer to the House and I do not know whether it would be possible to hear the comments of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this matter as well. When I tabled the motion, it related to the Gaeltacht region but, three months later, the situation has changed. There is a feeling of neglect in rural areas and we need a debate as a matter of urgency. Will the Leader consider my request?
