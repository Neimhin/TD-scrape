JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, and, somewhat belatedly, congratulate him on his new post. The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, and himself must have been contemplating and working behind the scenes around this time last year.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I wish to make a few points on sports capital projects in County Donegal. When Deputy McDaid was Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation he delivered, which I acknowledge. The people of County Donegal will always acknowledge that during his tenure as Minister, they did well in getting a substantial amount of funding for voluntary organisations at grassroots level ranging from snooker clubs to Gaelic clubs to soccer clubs to boxing clubs. It is much appreciated in that part of the country.A sports complex was sanctioned in Letterkenny and funding is pending. I hope the project will not become a white elephant because it is an ambitious one which will require a substantial amount of money. It is not at the tentative, early stages. Much of the work has been done by Letterkenny Urban District Council and a lot of the negotiations have taken place. However, we await money, which is a problem.I am being parochial when I refer to another ambitious project which tried to get off the ground a few years ago. Paul McGinley, an ambassador for this country and a member of the recent and previous Ryder Cup team, and a group of his colleagues tried to develop a golf course not too far from my home town. The syndicate involved came up against a number of obstacles which were blamed on the EU. There is still the possibility of negotiation and if there was a golf course with Paul McGinley's name attached to it, it would do well and would generate tourism.Senator O'Toole referred to sports on the school curriculum. While we could dwell too much on the physical infrastructure — the sports complexes — which are needed for sports such as football, soccer and swimming, it is important we do not miss out on opportunities for adventure sports. We are surrounded by water. I was born two miles from the sea but I do not surf, sail, canoe or participate in any water sport. That is due to the fact they are not done in schools because the resources are not available. It is embarrassing to find people from Belfast coming down every weekend to participate in these sports. The facilities are available in the North for people to engage in and to develop these skills. Adventure sports include not only water sports but hill walking, mountain climbing and abseiling. We have the natural physical infrastructure. We should develop a whole range of facilities and services to engage young people in these sports.My colleague, Senator John Paul Phelan, has referred to obesity as the new buzz word. We could talk about it until the cows come home. The solution is to engage people in natural, cost-efficient outdoor activity in their own backyard. The only obstacle young people in Letterkenny find is that they do not have youth leaders, workers or bus services to take them five miles out the road to the outdoor pursuit centre. It is an excellent centre that works within limited budgets. In the past two summers it has been trying to develop sailing for local people in rural areas of Donegal. The centre is about drive and capacity and working to get resources to encourage young people to engage in natural activity outdoors that will get them out of the house and away from the Nintendo. I know we do not have many facilities for white water rafting or such like, but this is something that is great craic, good fun, with a good buzz, a natural and healthy pursuit. There is no reason we should not encourage young people to follow the example of the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, who is with us at the moment.On a final note, I agree wholeheartedly with the debate on the GAA. Mr. Seán Kelly, that organisation's president, attended a committee meeting of the Houses last week. He was upfront and completely honest about what the GAA is doing. It is the backbone of voluntary activity in this country, in terms of getting young people out of doors and involved in sport. The debate should not degenerate into a discussion about whether Croke Park should or should not be opened up. The GAA has traditionally been among the top three organisations in this country, along with the church and another body whose name I will not put on record here, but which might be relegated——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The GAA is quite capable of looking after its own shop and should not be interfered with. In time, matters will evolve. Mr. Kelly even put it on record that in time we will be looking at a situation in which Croke Park will be open to other sports.I asked the GAA president about the proposed stadium in Northern Ireland currently being mooted. It is important that we remain closely involved in that project. If we are talking about an all-Ireland strategy, cross-Border ministerial councils, etc., we should have an input into that sports stadium in Northern Ireland; we should be part of that as well as the United Kingdom.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I have been approached by relatives of cancer patients in Letterkenny and relatives of people who have since passed away. The oncology unit in Letterkenny General Hospital is second to none. There is a dedicated, professional team in place there under the stewardship of Dr. Karen Duffy and Mr. Chris Lyons. However, there is a problem with regard to the fast-tracking of cancer patients for emergency services. For example, a patient with breathing difficulties as a result of lung cancer would have to go through casualty, queuing along with other patients there.As a qualified pharmacist, the Minister of State will be aware that on a Saturday night every type of patient can appear in hospital, as a result of car accidents, drink-induced injuries and even minor domestic injuries. I am calling for a separate channelling system for cancer patients who constitute a very vulnerable group. They are most susceptible to infection, including the winter vomiting bug. They and their relatives believe it is not appropriate for them to have to sit in casualty for up to three or four hours. It is not humane and is not in line with best practice for the treatment of cancer patients.The kernel of the problem, which was acknowledged by staff at the oncology unit in Letterkenny yesterday, is bed capacity. That is a problem throughout the country, not just in Letterkenny. Nationally, bed capacity is operating at approximately 105%. Ideally it should be at 90% with a 10% bed space available for emergency cases, whether cancer patients or others.This is a sensitive area as the Minister of State knows due to his medical expertise, which is much greater than mine. I wish to convey the sentiments and feelings of the people who have been affected by this situation. Their relatives have spent time waiting in casualty, sometimes for up to four or five hours, although they are only awaiting consultancy services for breathing difficulties or minor bowel surgery.Time is precious enough for cancer patients. I have received repeated representations from a daughter who had to sit with her father for five hours in casualty two weeks before he passed away. That is not good enough and I know the Minister of State also does not believe it to be good enough. Bed capacity is the problem so I am seeking some form of intervention to allow cancer patients to be treated as a separate group. Hopefully, in the short to medium term they will not have to wait in casualty for emergency services.
