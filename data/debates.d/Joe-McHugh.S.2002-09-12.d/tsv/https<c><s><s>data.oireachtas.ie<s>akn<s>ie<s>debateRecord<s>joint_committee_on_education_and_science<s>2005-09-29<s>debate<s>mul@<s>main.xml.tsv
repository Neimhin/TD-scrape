JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be brief because the delegates have been here a long time. I wish to inform the Minister of State about an issue, with which she is very familiar, concerning Stramore national school in Donegal. The Minister of State has been involved with it, directly and indirectly, for a period of two and a half years. The campaign has been ongoing during that time. The parents have been lobbying and fighting the case. As the Minister of State is aware, the school principal has also been proactively involved. This week, however, the fight is over. They have given up the ghost. The parents have decided that two and a half years is too long to fight a campaign. They believe they came up against a brick wall and that no progress was made. The principal has also given up the fight. We do not know what the consequences of that will be but this is a two-teacher school and next June, as a result of the parents taking their children out of the school this week, we will have a one-teacher school. I cannot speak on behalf of the remaining teacher, whoever that will be, but I am aware that when there is only one person in the workplace, it is not the most favourable environment and we may be facing a school closure next June.Stramore national school is located in a very rural area. It is a Gaeltacht school that has been in situ for 104 years. The community is outraged about this issue. Its members believe they fought a lonely battle against bureaucracy and a closed school amalgamation rule that was established over 40 years ago. Has the Department given up the ghost on this issue because I am fearful of the outcome in that, one way or another, it is not willing to budge. The Department suggested that if the three schools affected — Glenswilly national school, Termon national school and Stramore national school — got together and came up with a signed agreement that they did not have a problem with the parents who were getting transport when they should not have been, so to speak, the Department would consider this favourably. Agreement was reached among the three schools. The boards of management agreed. That is in writing with the Department but it does not want to move on the issue. It is using the closed school amalgamation rule. The fight is over as far as the parents and the principal are concerned but the Department can play a pivotal role. I appreciate the Minister of State’s work on this issue. I am aware that she stayed in touch with them but this is a decision made by the Department. It is a bureaucratic decision that will lead to a breakdown in major historical, traditional and cultural connections to the area in question. I am fearful that this school will close and that is an issue which should be examined sympathetically and sensitively.
