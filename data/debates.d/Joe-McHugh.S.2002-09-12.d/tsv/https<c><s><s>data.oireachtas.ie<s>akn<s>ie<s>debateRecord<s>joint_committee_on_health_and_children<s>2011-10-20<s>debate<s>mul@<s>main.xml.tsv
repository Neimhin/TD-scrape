JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I apologise for being late.  I had to speak on another issue.  I had one question that I intended to ask relating to the challenges - to be nice about it - of the centralised system but I came in during the course of Dr. Murphy's contribution and I heard of a doctor in Cork and another in Donegal who were husband and wife.  It beggars belief.  This is a public forum and this stuff maddens the public.  It maddens people that such incompetence and lack of leadership is in place and that we cannot sort out a simple problem.  Such incompetence leads to waste drives the people crazy throughout the country.  I apologise for the preamble.We have a new Chairman and a new Minister for Health and one thing these gentlemen do not lack is common sense.  It is important to work with both of them to try to sort out the simple problems.  This can be done but it requires leadership from within.  From various conversations I am aware that there are issues of trust and the usual challenges that arise within any organisation.  My contact with various HSE officials and people in the medical organisations in my constituency and region indicate that good people are in place.  There is general feedback to the effect that these people cannot thrive within the organisation or do the simple things and this whole challenge must be addressed.  I am sorry for going on somewhat.  There seems to be an issue with regard to attracting people for the specific registrar grade.  I am sorry if this has been raised already.  Perhaps Dr. Murphy or one of the other guests will answer my question.  What plan is being put in place to attract more registrars from within the junior doctor grade?  This seems to be something of a challenge in Letterkenny General Hospital.  It may not be a national challenge but in my hospital they are finding it difficult to get registrars.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am aware of the problem.  My question was whether there is a plan in place to address it.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To clarify, I am not asking whether the IMO has a plan but whether there is a plan in place.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What does Professor Plunkett mean by "refugee accommodation"?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	What is the condition of the accommodation for Irish doctors in Australia and what is the system for allocating it?  Is it refugee-style accommodation?
