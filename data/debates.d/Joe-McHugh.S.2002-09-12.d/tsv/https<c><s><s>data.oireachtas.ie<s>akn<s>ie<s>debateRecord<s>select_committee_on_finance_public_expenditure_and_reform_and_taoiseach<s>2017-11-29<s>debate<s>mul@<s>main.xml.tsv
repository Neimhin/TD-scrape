JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage & the Gaeltacht and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an gCathaoirleach fá choinne an cuireadh go dtí an coiste agus gabhaim leithscéal ar son an Taoisigh. I apologise on behalf of the Taoiseach who is unable to be here. The net Estimate for Vote 5 - Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for 2017 is €40,676,000. The moneys provide for the salaries and expenses of the director and her staff, the cost of the local State solicitor service, fees to counsel engaged by the director to prosecute cases in the various courts and legal costs awarded against the State arising from judicial review and other legal proceedings. A Supplementary Estimate of €418,000 is being sought for 2017 which represents a 1% increase in the net allocation. The need for the Supplementary Estimate arises from greater than budgeted expenditure on input A2 administration – non-pay and input A3 – fees to counsel, together with receipts in input B – appropriations-in-aid falling below the level budgeted for. Savings elsewhere in the Vote are insufficient to offset the need for a Supplementary Estimate. There are a range of factors that give rise to the need for the Supplementary Estimate. I will address them in the order in which they are listed in the Vote. In terms of the input A2 administration – non-pay, two main factors give rise to the projected overspend of €616,000 under the subhead. The first is a requirement to spend approximately €261,000 on the office's IT case-management system to meet costs that arise from a major upgrade of software. The fact that the costs of this upgrade would fall in the calendar year 2017 only became apparent after the 2017 Estimates had been finalised. The second aspect of administration – non-pay expenditure which is projected to run significantly ahead of the amount provided for 2017, has to do with the completion of a range of refurbishment projects that the Office of Public Works has undertaken in the context of moving all staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to one site on the Infirmary Road, Dublin. After 16 years of being split across different sites, the Office of Public Works completed works during 2017 that enabled all staff of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to be accommodated on the one site. Managing expenditure on a significant-sized capital project from annual voted expenditure is inherently difficult because of the uncertainty as to in which year costs will fall to be paid. The additional spending of approximately €355,000 projected under this heading in 2017 arises from the timing of the expenditure rather than an underestimation of refurbishment costs. In terms of input A3 – fees to counsel, two main
factors give rise to the projected overspend of €1.377 million under this subhead. The first is a general increase in activity in the courts and, in particular, the Central Criminal Court with the assignment of additional judges leading to an increase in the number of sittings. The Central Criminal Court is the court that deals with the prosecution of murder and rape cases. The second factor that gave rise to the overspend under the subhead is the cost of a series of complex financial trials. Fees to prosecution counsel in excess of €1 million have been paid in these cases in 2017. As the factors that gave rise to the overspend in 2017 are likely to continue into 2018, I inform the committee that to ensure the underlying level of activity on fees to counsel does not give rise to a Supplementary Estimate again in 2018, an additional allocation of €1.54 million has been added to the subhead for 2018. In terms of input B – appropriations-in-aid, there is a projected shortfall of €158,000. This arises from difficulties in estimating the amount of costs that will be awarded by the courts to the director in any one year and also from an over-estimation of the amount that would be realised from pension-related deductions from salaries. The additional expenditure, of which I have advised the committee, amounts to a total of €2.151 million. However, a range of savings made elsewhere in the Vote have reduced the amount required by way of Supplementary Estimate to €418,000.  I recommend the Supplementary Estimate of €418,000 to the committee.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The questions are technical in nature, but I shall try to answer them as best as I can. The officials are present, if the Deputy wants to receive more specific answers. In the vast majority of cases the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions pays set standard fees to prosecution counsel. The brief fee in the Circuit Court is €1,144, with a daily refresher fee of €572. In the Central Criminal Court, in cases of murder, a brief fee of €7,127 is paid to senior counsel, while, in rape cases, a brief fee of €5,704 is paid. A daily refresher fee of €1,562 is paid to senior counsel. Junior counsel are paid two thirds of the senior counsel rate. I know that the Deputy specifically asked about counsel, but I highlight the fact that the number of judges has increased in the past year. The number in the Central Criminal Court has increased from between three and four judges to five and six judges. The increase has led to rape and murder cases being dealt with on a more frequent and quicker basis.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. The daily refresher fee for senior counsel is €1,562. Junior counsel are paid two thirds of the senior counsel rate.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. It was explained to me that the shortfall was due to there being more complex financial trials. For example, financial trials alone cost €1.6 million last year. There have been a lot more complex cases in that regard.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In the vast majority of cases the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions pays set standard fees to prosecution counsel. It has delegated sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to pay fees in excess of these amounts where it is considered to be warranted. The upper limit of delegated sanction for a brief fee is €8,316 and €2,315 for refresher or daily fees. In appropriate cases non-standard fees up to the delegated limits are sanctioned and paid by the office.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The workload is greater and while I have not met the DPP, Claire Loftus, in person, from the information I have there are adequate resources. As a result of the appointment of extra judges to the Central Criminal Court, which deals specifically with murder and rape cases, even with the extra workload, there is no question mark over resources.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, there has been an extra workload. I will break it up into two parts. We talked about the complex financial cases in recent years. There have been high-profile cases and less high-profile ones. As a result of the appointment of extra judges to the Central Criminal Court, which went from three to four in the past few years to up to six, rape cases are being taken more quickly, which is a good thing. Murder cases are also being taken more quickly as a result of the extra resources. The workload is increasing. There seem to be more efficiencies as a result of the extra judges. In addition, the office has been streamlined. It used to be at two separate venues so there is a focus on that. There were seven extra staff sanctioned in 2017, which was reflective of the extra workload.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They were sanctioned as part of the budgetary process.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	All I have is the information to the effect that it was part of the budgetary process. If, however, there is a reason why there was a delay, I can find out for the Deputy and get back to him.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On the reasons, if there was a roadblock, I will get back to the Deputy on it. The officials can do that. If one looks at the sanctioning of positions across a range of Departments, if there are roadblocks, difficulties or the possibility of moving more quickly, we have to find out the reason why. I will certainly do that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is to make up the full amount.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. There are other reasons as well but it includes the Central Criminal Court, which deals with murder and rape cases.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The logical reason for the extra workload is that there are extra judges and extra sittings so we are in the very fortunate position that, in the context of very sensitive rape cases, we are getting justice at an earlier stage. I welcome that but with it comes an extra workload. I am putting a big proportion of that down to the fact we have extra judges. We have gone from having three to four judges in the Central Criminal Court to having five to six.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We have a rough breakdown. I am told by my official that about €500,000 or €600,000 is probably attributable to the Central Criminal Court with the balance driven by the complex financial trials.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The target is the number of new court proceedings to deal with. In 2016, we had a figure of 3,554. The projected-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was the output target for 2016. The projected 2017 output target is 3,740.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is due to a small number of cases in the Central Criminal Court leading to greater expenditure.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	To give the Deputy some additional information, the 2018 output target-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The 2018 output target is projected to be between 3,500 and 4,000.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I just wanted to give the Deputy an idea of the projections.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will send on the information I have.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is there a rationale for the figures not being included in the documentation provided to the committee?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I can certainly ensure that the committee gets the full information.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The total number of staff throughout the whole organisational structure of the DPP is 194. The Public Appointments Service is working to fill vacancies for solicitors and administrative support. The DPP has three main divisions including a directing division consisting of barristers and solicitors who examine criminal investigation files and decide whether prosecutions should be taken. The solicitors' division consists of solicitors who prepare and conduct cases on behalf of the director in all courts sitting in Dublin. The administration division consists of general Civil Service grades. It provides support and other services to both the directing division and the solicitors' division in order to enable the office to fulfil its statutory function.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Based on the information I have, there has been no external review or any work done on an external basis. There has been an internal review.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. It was requested by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I certainly do not see why not.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes. I have a combination of information here. It is obvious that Deputy Doherty has part of it. I will give the committee all of the information I have here in respect of the projected output. Obviously there is a difference between the target and the output. I will give the committee-----
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Absolutely, yes.
