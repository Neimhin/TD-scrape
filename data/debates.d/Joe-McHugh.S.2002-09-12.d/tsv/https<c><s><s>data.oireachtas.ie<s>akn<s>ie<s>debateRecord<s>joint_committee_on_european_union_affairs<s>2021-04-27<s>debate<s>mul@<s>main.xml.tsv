JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Fuair mé leithscéal ón Seanadóir Vincent P. Martin. Ar son an choiste, ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire, Teachta Coveney, agus a chomhghleacaithe go dtí an cruinniú inniu. I welcome the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and his colleagues from the Department of Foreign Affairs. We are looking forward to this exchange this evening regarding the protocol and where things are at. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. For witnesses attending remotely from outside the Leinster House campus, there are some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and as such they may not benefit from the same level of immunity against legal proceedings as witnesses who are physically present in the building. Witnesses participating in this committee session from a jurisdiction outside the State are advised they should also be mindful of their domestic law and how it may apply to the evidence they give. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit, namely, Leinster House or the Convention Centre Dublin or both, in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making their contribution to the meeting. I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are trying to keep it to five-minute blocks but the Deputy has used a lot of the time. It is like "The Krypton Factor" as the Minister has about a minute and a half to answer five questions, but we will show a wee bit of latitude.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Minister covered a lot of ground as he had a lot of questions. I might recommend that members narrow their contributions down to one or two questions. We will try to get a little bit more engagement between the members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Richmond is next, followed by Deputy Calleary.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answers. There are still a number of members who wish to speak. We are good for time, so we should not be under too much pressure. I call Deputy Calleary, followed by Deputy Brady.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious of my previous intervention. We are okay for time.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Some members might want to come in with more questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Haughey may ask one final question.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister on behalf of the committee. We appreciate him being here this evening. In light of his officials being with him, I want to raise a matter but I do not want an answer on it at this time. I refer to the issue of the 40-day residence rule for live exports. The new bureaucracy is causing difficulty for Northern farmers, Donegal farmers and those in the Lagan Valley importing Scottish Blackface rams or even Scottish Galloway bulls. It is upsetting at a very practical level. There is an upset in the commerce that has traditionally and historically always been carried out between Ulster and Scotland. I want the Minister's officials to be aware of that when they are looking at the agricultural sector during the deliberations and talks. There are issues that are annoying and upsetting people at a practical level and we should try to reassure farmers that, through these talks and deliberations, things will be positive in the end. Go raibh maith agaibh uilig agus beidh muid ar ais arís gan dabht.
