JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh achan duine do dtí an cruinniú. On behalf of the committee I welcome: Professor Katy Hayward and Professor David Phinnemore, Queens University Belfast; Professor Peter Shirlow, University of Liverpool; and Dr. Christy Ann Petit and Dr. Ian Cooper, Dublin City University. They are all very welcome. We will discuss the state of play regarding EU-UK relations as well as the implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol. Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members all know the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement.There are a few more lines there but I think we are all covered. Before calling on Professor Hayward to make her opening statement, I want to make an appeal. I am conscious of the presence a fellow Ulsterman, although there may be other people who were born in Ulster here as well. Professor Shirlow and I were talking about that common ground in an Ulster context. One things we do not do in Ulster is tell people what to do, so I am encouraging the witnesses to stay within the confines of the five minute opening statement because this is a proactive committee. Members like engagement and asking questions. They like getting involved and they like conversation. We have a wide array of talent and expertise here today and a lot of ground to cover, so I am appealing to, and encouraging, witnesses to try to stay as close as possible to five minutes in their opening statements. I am not telling them to do so but I am appealing to them. I call Professor Hayward. There is no pressure on her, but she could certainly set a very good and positive precedent here. She is very welcome and we look forward to her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Hayward and call Professor Phinnemore.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the witnesses. We will move to the members. First up is Deputy Ruairi Ó Murchú who is under some time pressure, and he will be followed by Deputy Neale Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Okay folks. Crystal ball time. Who is up?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will not bring in everybody. I see Professor Hayward has her hand up and I think Professor Phinnemore wants to come in as well.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will just come back in on the first part of Professor Phinnemore's last contribution regarding the research he did on the responsibility of political parties in the North to sell a deal. What question did he put to his audience in the polling?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Phinnemore for that. We will come to Dr. Petit and Dr. Cooper after the next contribution, if that is okay.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am conscious, in light of the Deputy's worthy, worldly and wordy contribution, that we have a great deal of ground to cover. In that context, and in the interests of moving matters forward, perhaps we will take responses from one spokesperson from each of the institutions
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Phinnemore. I am conscious that a question was asked directly of Professor Hayward. Perhaps when she next contributes she can include the matter in her overall response. We will move to Deputy Howlin's slot. We have 40 minutes left, so I ask that everyone be a little more succinct to allow us to move through everything.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Hayward. Would Dr. Petit like to respond?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Dr. Petit and call on Professor Shirlow to respond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As Professor Hayward is the only person to be excluded in this round, I want to give her the opportunity to come in on some of the points made by Deputy Haughey.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Senator Chambers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Who wants to go first? We will have an all inclusive response here, starting with Professor Phinnemore.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Senator will be the second person to have left during Professor Shirlow's presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Professor Hayward.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator. I will go to Professor Hayward because she must be away in five minutes. No pressure. It is to be a non-highbrow response from our esteemed academic guests.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Hayward for her contribution there and for attending today’s meeting. We really appreciate and are grateful for her time and value her contribution. The committee may be doing some further work in this area and we hope to reach out to her again.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call now Professor Phinnemore to speak, please.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Phinnemore and call Professor Shirlow to speak now, please.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Shirlow. I call Dr. Petit now, please.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank our contributors there and the Senator is more than welcome. We are going to break with precedent here and are going to allow a member to come in for a second time. Do I have the agreement of our esteemed members for that? Will we allow Deputy Ó Murchú-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising that. I know the Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement will visit London shortly. We are going in a few weeks' time as well, so we will put that on the agenda.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy. Does Dr. Petit wish to kick off?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does Dr. Petit or Dr. Cooper wish to come back in?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Professor Phinnemore.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Coming back to Professor Phinnemore's statistic - and I hope I am quoting him correctly - about the 70% reliance on political parties for reliable information, if one couples that or measures that against Professor Shirlow's study, which says civic society is out of sync with the political process, invariably this happens in most societies whereby in civic society the people are ahead of the political process with regard to their thought processes, which I have always believed. I will just throw this out to the witnesses. We are here today discussing the problem with the protocol and trade, an issue that exercises a lot of business people, North and South. Is now the time to have a formal mechanism in place to enable or assist that conversation to bring the citizens' voice to the fore? This could be through a formal mechanism. By "formal mechanism" I mean what was done down here with some difficult issues through deliberative participation and through citizens' assemblies. Is there a need for formal mechanism or is it to be a rolling up the sleeves exercise where people just need to be with each other and talk to each other, be that politicians down South heading up North? I recall when I chaired the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, one of the asks - especially in Newtownards and the east Belfast area - was for a visible presence of politicians from Dublin to be there to listen, hear, find out, learn and understand. Is an informal requirement needed or a more formal mechanism around this? I do not throw out the citizens' assembly dialogue as a red rag to the bull on the constitutional question but just specifically on the trade issue.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Maybe people just need a forum. Straight after Brexit in 2016, in county Louth we had plenty of meetings there, as in Letterkenny, where people came together to discuss it and raise issues. Would anybody else like to comment or are we all talked out at this stage? There is an old Irish saying: "Má theastaíonn uait aithne a chur orainn, mair inár dteannta: if we want to get to know each other, live with us." I hear a very strong sentiment on that coming from Professor Shirlow, and from that understanding. I have enormous concerns around the social media stuff that is flying around in relation to the process. I will use the professor's term, if he has not patented it, of "sectarian entrepreneurs". Some of the memes and stuff on social media tries to reinforce those stereotypes that are out there, on sectarian grounds, and there is a responsibility on the part of social media entities to address this because it is not helping. We are very grateful as a committee to our guests for participating here today and for giving us their impartial, evidence-based research and statistics. It is important. It also allows room for the political conversation to go into a space where, invariably, we do not go to, and backed up by facts and statistics. We are very grateful to our guests for being here. I have no doubt we will be in touch with them again. Gabhaim buíochas leo.
