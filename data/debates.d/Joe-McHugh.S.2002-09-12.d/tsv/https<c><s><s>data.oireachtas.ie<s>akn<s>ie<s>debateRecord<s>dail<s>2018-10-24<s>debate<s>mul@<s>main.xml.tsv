JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as ucht an t-ábhar seo a ardú. I thank the Deputy for raising this and for his kind words at the beginning. I am familiar with the two counties - King's county and Queen's county.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will obviously take a very special interest in the issue raised. These are important matters in terms of educational inclusion. I thank the Deputy for raising them. Kolbe Special School, which is under the patronage of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary Services, caters for students with severe to profound general learning disabilities. The school provides education for children aged between four years and 18 years. The school's most recent enrolment data indicate that there are 39 pupils enrolled for the 2017-2018 school year. The staffing allocation for the current school year includes a principal, seven teaching posts and 16 special needs assistants. As the Deputy is aware, a building project, which involves the construction of a replacement school building for Kolbe Special School, is included in my Department's six-year construction programme. This school building project, which will comprise a single-storey building of 2,265 sq. m will provide a schedule of accommodation to include eight classrooms, a general purpose room, a library and resource area, a woodwork and art room, an exercise-therapy room and various ancillary spaces. The schedule of accommodation for the new school was developed in consultation with the National Council for Special Education. The schedule has been issued to the school authorities and has been favourably received. To facilitate the development of the proposed new school, my Department has acquired a 1.433 ha site from the Health Service Executive at St. Fintan's, Portlaoise, County Laois, for the project. My Department is currently finalising the development of the project brief with a view to progressing the project into architectural planning at an early stage. As an interim arrangement, my Department gave approval to Kolbe Special School in late February 2018 for the provision of a temporary classroom to meet the growing current needs at the school.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Deputy's conviction on this. He has been to the school and met the students and the teachers individually. The most vulnerable people one will meet are people who cannot communicate or speak so I understand the seriousness of this issue. The project is at architectural planning stage and is in the six year bundle for 2016 to 2021. Obviously there are many pressures coming down the track with regard to which schools fit into the ten year capital plan, but the school is in the six year bundle and there is a commitment to it. However, I accept that there is anxiety on the part of parents and teachers to provide the infrastructure and a proper learning environment. Having read about the different elements of the new school it is clear they are looking forward to it. I will take the Deputy's comments on board and speak to my officials about the current position and the next stage. It is at the design stage at present but given that the Deputy has highlighted the vulnerability of this group I will convey that to my officials.
