JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the Deputy for tabling this matter. I listened to the radio the morning after the public meeting, and a figure of 1,500 people at a meeting shows it is causing grave concern. I am speaking today on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and will read his reply into the record for the purposes of laying out where the situation is at and who has responsibility in the matter. I am happy to update the House on the matter and clarify a few points on the Minister's behalf. As Members are aware, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, announced the establishment of statutory committees to review local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford on 19 June last. In the case of Athlone, the committee has been asked to carry out a review of the boundary between Counties Westmeath and Roscommon and to make recommendations with respect to that boundary that it considers to be necessary in the interests of effective local government. The main rationale for undertaking the review in Athlone is that the 2011 census shows there is a significant Athlone environs population in County Roscommon. The question that arises is the appropriate relationship between administrative jurisdictions and the current settlement and development position. Bringing an entire town within a single local authority area can eliminate or prevent any possible anomalies or distortions of divided administration, service provision, regulatory and enforcement responsibility and electoral representation that might arise. Potential problems can also be addressed, including differing policies and practices between authorities in respect of matters such as planning, rating and charges, which can impact negatively on town centres. The Athlone boundary committee has been established under section 28 of the Local Government Act 1991 and, in accordance with subsection (3) of that section, it is independent in the performance of its functions. While it would be inappropriate, therefore, for me to comment on the substantive matter under examination, I would like to take the opportunity to address briefly some misconceptions that have been reported recently regarding this issue. First, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government is not proposing that the boundary be changed; the task of examining and analysing the issue has been entrusted to the independent boundary committee and it is that group which will consider and report on the matter. At that stage, it will be open to the Minister of the day to suggest the alteration of a boundary by order, having regard to the boundary committee report. In this context, I would like to point out that the matter will not be decided finally by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, but by the Oireachtas. In accordance with the 1991 Act, a draft of any order made by the Minister providing for a boundary alteration must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order cannot be made until a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House. This would normally follow a submission to Government. Feedback thus far suggests that the revised structures and measures implemented by this Government are generally operating well and I am sure the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will look forward to studying the various reports, including on counties Westmeath and Roscommon, to assess whether further adjustments are required.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This discussion is going into the record of the House and will be landing on the desks it needs to land on. The message is loud and clear and is coming from the people, including a public meeting of 1,500. I have spoken in depth with the Acting Chairman, Deputy Feighan, and he has explained the practical realities on the ground, which have to be reflected. I reiterate and emphasise that, as of now, there are no proposed boundary changes. There is a fear of the report recommending the proposed changes and the Minister of the day having a decision to make to bring it to both Houses. However, at this stage, nothing is proposed. While the responsible people are independently evaluating the general geographical area, I am sure they are listening attentively to the public, and the loud voice coming from the House and from across the political divide in Roscommon.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. I acknowledge the suffering and hardship many families have endured in recent weeks. To an extent, we had our own issues in Donegal before Christmas, particularly in the Finn valley area, but the situation was more acute in the midlands. I acknowledge the considerable hardship many people have gone through. With regard to the three examples, it is important we know the details, whether that is through myself or the Minister, and we are happy to follow them up. In the immediate aftermath of Storm Desmond at the beginning of December 2015, the Government approved the allocation of €5 million to be distributed as emergency humanitarian support to small businesses which, through no fault of their own, have been unable to secure flood insurance and had been flooded during the period of 4 December 2015 to 17 December 2015. Subsequent to the storms which continued into late December and early January, the Government decided to expand the scheme to cover the period of December 2015 to January 2016. It was also decided to allow community, voluntary and sporting organisations which could not obtain flood insurance and had suffered flood damage to their premises to apply for assistance. The scheme, which is being administered by the Irish Red Cross Society, provides a once-off ex gratia contribution towards the costs of returning business premises to their pre-flood condition, including the replacement of flooring, fixtures and fittings and damaged stock. It does not cover repairs to football pitches, race tracks or golf courses affected by the floods. The scheme does not provide a contribution to loss of earnings or loss of business goodwill. The scheme is not intended to act as a compensation for loss, nor is it intended to provide an alternative to insurance cover. The emergency nature of the flooding incident required an urgent response to try to make payments to small businesses for business continuity purposes in the run-up to Christmas. A two-stage approach was agreed by Government. The first stage provides a contribution of up to €5,000 per property, depending on the scale of damage incurred. Applications under the €5,000 threshold are being paid following a quick verification process between the Irish Red Cross and the local authority responsible for the area in which the business was flooded. The second stage of the scheme provides a means to seek further support of up to €20,000 per property. This involves a lengthier process requiring a detailed assessment of the damage by loss assessors appointed for this purpose by the Irish Red Cross. The total level of support available for both stages combined is capped at €20,000 per property. Application forms for the scheme are available on the Irish Red Cross website. I thank the Irish Red Cross for the work it is doing in ensuring applications are processed and payments are disbursed in a speedy manner. While the Irish Red Cross is an independent charitable organisation, the allocation of the funds is provided by the Exchequer. As with any funding provided by the Exchequer, there is a requirement for governance and accountability. There has to be prudent management and financial controls. While controls must be in place, the emergency nature of the response requires a system which is not cumbersome or overly bureaucratic. In the case of small businesses, the controls that have been put in place for payment under the scheme include that the business must have been trading at the time of the flooding incident and that the business must have been operating in a rateable premises. This allows for the speedy turnaround in the processing of payments as once these details are verified by the relevant local authority and subject to the application form containing full details, the Irish Red Cross can then make a payment to the applicant for an amount up to €5,000. The Irish Red Cross continues to receive application forms and payments are processed daily. The charity advises that 122 payments have been made to date. The Minister for Defence has visited a number of sites affected by flooding in recent weeks and has seen at first hand the difficulties many small businesses have experienced. In cases of particular hardship, I understand the Minister is open to having the criteria reviewed where exceptional circumstances arise.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not going to get into the bear pit with the Deputy today. I think that may be what he wants me to do. The Deputy's question relates to the need for the Minister for Defence to amend the eligibility criteria. The Minister has indicated that he is open to having the criteria reviewed. Therefore, he is answering the question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Deputy asked the question and the Minister has responded. As I said at the outset, the examples the Deputy gave are important and it is equally important to give them to the Minister. He is open to amending the criteria.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am not going to jump into a bear pit on a Thursday evening. This is a serious issue. It is not just the Red Cross that is involved. The Deputy is aware of the great work his local authority did and the great work done by the local authority in Roscommon. I was speaking to Deputy Fitzmaurice about the work done at the height of the devastation by the emergency services and the community. A massive effort was made. The Government is responding to that emergency and it had to respond quickly. The Deputy has highlighted issues that need to be dealt with and has cited specific examples relating to businesses. The Minister is open to reviewing these and I will speak to him privately on the matter. He will have this record and his officials are listening to this debate. Circumstances change. This is about addressing issues at this difficult time for so many people. I take the point raised by the Deputy and accept he has raised a serious issue. The Minister is serious about the issue also.
