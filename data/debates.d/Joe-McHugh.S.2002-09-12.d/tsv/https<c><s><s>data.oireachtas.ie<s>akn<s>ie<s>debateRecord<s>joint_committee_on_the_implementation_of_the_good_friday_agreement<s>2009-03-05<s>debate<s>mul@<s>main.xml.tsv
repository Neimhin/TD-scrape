JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I also welcome the two witnesses.  It is a privilege and an education to have them here because this is a complex and ongoing issue.  The important aspect is that we continue to deliberate and engage on the issue.It is educational just to be here today.  I think back to the last time I was in the company of Dr. Eames.  He would not have been aware of me as he was preaching from the pulpit.  To borrow a quotation that he borrowed on the day, "education is what is left when everything else if forgotten".  That stayed with me and it is relevant to the discussion today.  While we use words or jargon such as truth commission and legacy, this is a process of education.  As a former school teacher, I believe education must be inclusive, transparent and rational.On the issue of inclusivity, as both witnesses have mentioned, we cannot have geographical constructs in regard to this human story; that is the bottom line.  We are not looking for an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  This is a British-Irish problem as has been acknowledged here today.  In terms of transparency we have to be truthful and honest and all of us, including politicians and different groups, have to take responsibility.The third element to any educated process is that it has to be rational to the public and wider society but more importantly to the victims.  It has to be rational to them and it has to make sense.  They have put forward their suggestions to the witnesses in the 18-month period that we as politicians have to take on board and we have to follow up, not with words, but with action.  The action needed here is financial.  While not everything boils down to money, we have to take action in terms of our contribution to the education process and take responsibility in that area.A neighbour of mine, in fact he would be a closer neighbour of Pat Doherty, said to me a few years ago when there was an almighty row in a pub over politics, "When all is said and done there is a hell of a lot more said than done".  That struck a chord with me.  We owe it to the people who lost their lives and those who lost loved ones to not just take the platitude route and do the talking, we have a responsibility to take action.I again welcome the witnesses.  As a Border Deputy I acknowledge that Mr. Bradley referred to the cross-Border construct which is rational.
