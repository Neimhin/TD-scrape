JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee I am very pleased to welcome representatives of the Centre for Cross Border Studies.  It is good to see Ms Taillon again.  I met her informally a while back and shortly afterwards she was appointed to her new position as director of the centre.  We appreciated her meeting us at that time and look forward to her presentation today.  Dr. Anthony Soares, not the other one-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Dr. Soares is the centre's research and policy manager.  It is good to see him again.  I welcome Ms Annmarie O'Kane who is the information officer and Border People project manager.  She is in charge of the Border People website which has been an invaluable tool for people accessing information on entitlements on a cross-Border basis.  The initiative has proved quite helpful since we last met the delegation.  I also welcome Mr. Thomas Haverty who is research assistant.  The Centre for Cross Border Studies is an advocate for cross-Border co-operation and a valued source of research information and support for collaboration across borders on the island of Ireland, Europe and beyond.  It is dedicated to contributing to social cohesion, economic development and environmental sustainability through cross-Border co-operation on the island of Ireland and beyond.  We look forward to hearing from the delegation on opportunities to further develop North-South co-operation.    Before I invite the delegation to make its presentations, I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments related to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Did the delegation catch all that?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I invite Ms Ruth Taillon to make her opening presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Senator White can raise that issue now.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The Secretary of State is not here to defend herself.  I do not know whether there is a definitive measurement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will try to keep to the point.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Hold on.  Let us-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I know it is important.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Senator White has got her point across.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The members have ranged over a number of areas, but if the delegates wish to respond specifically to other areas, they may do that.  They may also, if they wish, flag a matter for the public record.  I am not going to open up the discussion again to members as time does not permit.  The delegation will have the final word.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is the Deputy asking whether they are for or against it?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the group very much for its contributions.  It has made a series of recommendations and we will forward these to the  current Minister, but there may be a change in that regard in a couple of weeks.  Whatever is the case, we will pass them on to whomever will be in the position of responsibility with regard to North-South responsibility for evaluation.  It is important to recognise the work the group is doing, not just today and yesterday, but for quite a while, including much of the preparatory work prior to institutional set-up.  We do not have an institutional set-up currently, but we have a North-South interparliamentary association.  Issues have been raised here in regard to education, and at the next plenary session education will be on the agenda.  I understand the session will not be in public, but perhaps we should see more information come from those meetings.  The report from those meetings goes to the First and Deputy First Ministers and to the Taoiseach, but perhaps groups like that here could work more closely with these institutions.  The North-South Ministerial Council will have a plenary session on 4 July and the group has said it has a close working relationship with it.  The council has moved into a different space, where it is getting into the nitty-gritty and the nuts and bolts of the issues.  Our Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, will meet with Michelle O'Neill, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland, and they will discuss animal welfare and issues relevant to farmers North and South, such as labelling.  We will work closely with the witnesses.  They have a series of recommendations, which we will pass on.  When we talk about the Border, everybody still has the mindset of a border on a map.  It is a fiscal border that people see.  The Border itself - the physical border - is seen by people, but the perception is more of a fiscal border that is changing and is very fluid.  We must be conscious of that.  I thank the witnesses for their time.  We will now suspend the meeting for a vote in the Dáil.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee I warmly welcome a cross-party, cross-jurisdiction and cross-competency grouping of people, the A5 working group.  I welcome Daniel McSorley, chief executive of Omagh District Council and Strabane District Council.  I wish to acknowledge his role in putting the project together and initiating the process.  I welcome Alderman Michael Coyle, chairman, and Ms Anne McNaught, project officer, of the north west region cross-Border group, and Mr. John McLaughlin, director of services at Donegal County Council.  I welcome the newly elected cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Councillor John Campbell.  It is nice to have the first citizen of Donegal in Dublin today.  I welcome Eugene Cummins, chief executive of Monaghan County Council.  I understand he is new in the job and I wish him well in his new role.  I welcome Councillor Dan Kelly, chairman of Strabane District Council, and congratulate him on his elevation to the position of chairman.  I also welcome Councillor Seán Conlon from Monaghan County Council.  To avoid confusion, Deputy Sean Conlan sends his apologies.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Anyway, he sends apologies.  Obviously he would prefer to be here, but he cannot be.  I welcome Elizabeth Harkin, public relations officer at Omagh District Council, and I wish to acknowledge her work and her role behind the scenes in her day-to-day job as well as her day-to-day facilitation of this process.  Regional development in the Border areas is vital to ensuring long-term economic benefits for the island as a whole.  Today we will be discussing in particular the A5 road project and the potential avenues to progress the project and keep it live and on the minds of the people who are in a position to move it forward.  Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege.  They are directed that only comments in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either Houses of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Without further ado, I call on the cathaoirleach of Donegal County Council, Councillor John Campbell, to proceed with his opening remarks.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Both contributions were fairly comprehensive.  I will open up the debate for the members now, starting with Deputy Brendan Smith.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Deputy Pringle to the joint committee.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are digressing slightly from the matter under discussion.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will ensure the Taoiseach receives a copy of the Senator's contribution.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No, that is okay.  A number of issues have been raised.  Perhaps our guests can decide among themselves how they wish to deal with them.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That is not a problem.  Perhaps Mr. McSorley or Mr. McLoughlin will comment in the context of the timeline.  Much has happened since the end of April and there has been progress.  Reading between the lines, there appears to be momentum.  Will our guests reassure members that it is moving in the right direction?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Crowe referred to the Monaghan aspect.  Would someone like to comment on that?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Is there a figure envisaged?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Does the amount include the bridge?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There is a good working relationship between the Roads Service Northern Ireland and the NRA as well as the local authorities.  Are officials in the Roads Service Northern Ireland sitting around a table deciding on a route?  The question is where the A5 links up with the N2 or is it too early to say?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The message is loud and clear.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That contribution is helpful.  I thank the members of the delegation for that discussion.  This does not end today.  The witnesses have highlighted the challenges that lie ahead.  I thank Mr. McSorley for speaking about the review.  The capital expenditure review is critical.  Coming from Monaghan County Council and Donegal County Council the know what they need, and the important point Mr. Cummins made was that decisions can be made on foot of a level of investment by the Government.  We will ensure that the transcripts of the contributions made here will get onto the right desks, be it the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, or whomever, and we can also send it on to the regional Minister in Northern Ireland.  We will use the opportunity to raise the issue on 10 July when this committee will go to the North-South Ministerial Council in Armagh and no doubt we will have the agreement of the committee on the priority agendas at that meeting.    We will continue to keep the issue live, which is the message given today.  In terms of the perception, people have felt let down in the past in that the project was to go ahead but in the end did not proceed.  Financial commitments were given.  Without making excuses, issues arose about the state of the economy, the financial crash and so but that is what did happen.  We must keep it going, however, and that is the purpose of this meeting.  We must be conscious of the timeframe.  The Irish Government has committed Stg£25 million in 2015, as Mr. McSorley outlined, and Stg£25 million in 2016.  We heard today that if it cannot be spent in 2015, the commitment is Stg£50 million for 2016.  We have to ensure that happens and if there are capacity issues, looking at the capital expenditure of Northern Ireland, Greece and so on, we have to keep the pressure on also.  I thank the witnesses.  Mr. Doherty will agree it is great to hear Killybegs men advocating road infrastructure up as far as Carrigart and Gortnabrade.  I can see where Mr. McLaughlin is coming from in terms of potential.  It is not just about the A5 or the M2.  It is about Dublin, Derry and Donegal, and linking into the new Wild Atlantic Way.  We are seeing an increased number of camper vans heading to Malin Head, across the bridge from Fanad to Carrigart, down to Sliabh League and Killybegs.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	And Mountcharles.  It is not just about a road from points A to B.  It is about opening up a region.  We all know the historical reasons it has not been opened up but we have so much to offer, and Mr. Kelly outlined the history, scenery and landscape.  We thank the witnesses for attending.  We will keep the conversation going and do whatever we can at our end.
