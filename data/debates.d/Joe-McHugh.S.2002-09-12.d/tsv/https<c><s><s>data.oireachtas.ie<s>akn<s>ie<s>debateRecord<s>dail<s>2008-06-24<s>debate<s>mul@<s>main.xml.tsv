JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	When is it envisaged to introduce a pro-active job creation element in the merchant shipping Bill?  It would provide an opportunity to retrain redundant fishermen, namely, deck hands, skippers and first mates, as officers of the watch.  I am offering advice on how to retrain fishermen who are lying about their houses to work for oil companies or merchant cargo ships or to become officers of the watch.
