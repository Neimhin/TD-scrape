JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	From Mr. Fitzsimons's reply, I suspect that the industry would work out the economics of the process and decide that it is much cheaper to settle a claim even though it strongly suspects it is a false one. It will settle such a claim because it will cost less. However, the industry, by its very actions, is creating a bigger problem. It is ironic that if a fraudulent claim is settled in that way, the fraudster is represented by a legal professional who gets paid on the back of a fraudulent claim. Such expenses increase the legal fees about which insurance companies complain. In a sense that is a joke. Is it not the case that everybody pays lip service to the way in which this issue should be dealt, they put forward reasons this is the position and so on, but they then revert to their old ways?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Is it true that Mr.Fitzsimons's company insists on a potential client having a property insurance policy with the company before it will give such a client a quote for motor insurance? Is that a general requirement? That requirement certainly applies in certain companies. Is it a general requirement in Mr. Fitzsimons's company or does it apply only to certain categories of persons? If it does apply, how can the company justify such a stringent policy and does it not consider it is a restrictive one?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Would Mr. Fitzsimons like specific examples?
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Yes, I have personal ones.
