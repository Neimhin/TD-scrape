JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	A licensing option confers upon the option holder the first right, exercisable at any time during the period of the option, to an exploration licence or licences over all or part of the area covered by the option. I can confirm that in accordance with the rules governing the two-year licensing option granted to Tamboran Resources in March 2011, the company exercised the right conferred upon it by the option and submitted an application for a follow-on exploration licence prior to the expiry of the licensing option in February 2013. In summary, the period of the licensing option ended almost 20 months ago and the right to apply for an exploration licence has been exercised. Successive Ministers and Ministers of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have confirmed that they will make no decision on such an application pending the outcome of the Environmental Protection Agency's research programme into the use of hydraulic fracturing. This research, which commenced recently, is expected to conclude in 2016. It has been made clear to the company that no decision will be taken on any application that proposes the use of hydraulic fracking in exploration drilling until the EPA research programme has been completed and the Government and other interested parties have had time to consider its findings. The appropriate time for making decisions on the issue of hydraulic fracturing will be after there has been an adequate opportunity to reflect on the findings of the EPA research.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy knows, and as the previous Minister of State confirmed, the situation at the moment is that no decision on an application of this nature will be made in advance of the outcome of the EPA research. It is important to point out that there were many meetings during the summer. When I was in the Deputy's part of the world, which is quite close to the Border, I met some of those who have concerns. This is also an issue in Northern Ireland. It is important to mention that there is a Northern Ireland element to the EPA study, which will take at least two years. The Northern Ireland Department of the Environment and Queen's University are involved in it. My own opinion is that it is possible that the study will take longer than two years. It is important for us to be kept up to speed at each step of the research programme. I have asked my officials in the Department to ensure we do not close the door and let the EPA carry on with its study for a period of two years or more. We have to build an information-sharing exercise and a review option into this process. It is important to point out that this is a North-South study, in real terms. It affects places on the other side of the Border that are quite close to Deputy Colreavy's home area. There are concerns on both sides of the Border. It is important to reiterate that no decision will be made for at least two years until the study of this sector is completed.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The option was built into the first licence. An application was made for a follow-on licence. That was 24 months ago. Nothing has happened. The timeframe of the EPA study will decide whether a licence or follow-on licence application will be considered. I will state categorically again that such an application will not be considered. Previous Ministers and Ministers of State have emphasised this. I am reiterating it again today. The EPA study began in August of this year. It will last a minimum of two years. It will probably take longer. I have said on the public record that I have my own concerns about the whole area of hydraulic fracturing. We have to use the political mechanisms that are in place, such as the North-South Ministerial Council. The partnership model that is in place is headed up by the EPA and involves its counterparts in Northern Ireland as well as Queen's University and the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment. We should use this opportunity to exhaust all avenues of research and opinion on the impact of this activity on the two pillars of environment and health. That needs to be done comprehensively.Let us also build in a review option during the study instead of handing it over for a period of two or more years. In that way, the House or the joint committee would have an opportunity to make an input or give feedback.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for tabling the question on this exciting project that will be most helpful in terms of the information provided to many sectors and key stakeholders. The Estimates for my Department published as part of budget 2015 include provision of €3 million next year for the Tellus project, which is a comprehensive environmental and resource mapping project being undertaken by the Geological Survey of Ireland. The project has already completed one phase of geological data collection of the rocks, soils and waters in the Border counties, funded by European Regional Development Funds. It is currently undertaking a second phase of geophysical data acquisition and soil sampling across counties Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath. The allocation in 2015 will allow for a further phase of geophysical surveying and soil sampling and analysis to be undertaken. The areas for surveying under this next phase will be based on progress on the existing three midland counties this year, assessment of logistics of terrain to be flown in contiguous areas and consideration of the priorities of other sectoral stakeholders' interests, such as agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency's, EPA, Office of Radiological Protection. The long-term objective is to complete eventually national coverage of geophysical and geochemical surveying. I understand a cost-benefit analysis by University College Dublin, UCD, demonstrated a 5:1 return on investment to the State for such a comprehensive survey, which of course has to be managed within available resources. Information from this project is freely and openly available to all citizens. I encourage everyone to access the information, including primary schools and secondary schools. It is collected to assist environmental management and support sustainable development of natural resources across Ireland. I am advised that the data collected to date has already proven to have application across many sectors including informing agricultural productivity, radon mapping, mineral exploration and environmental management.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The previous survey was funded through INTERREG in conjunction with the Department. The allocation of €3 million this year is solely from the Department. A broad range of benefactors exist. The organisations that have already been using the information include local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and Teagasc. Deputy Colreavy mentioned groundwater. The information is invaluable in terms of providing up-to-date information on potential water contamination. Anybody can access the information, including companies, as it is widely and publicly available. The project includes a partnership approach involving organisations such as Teagasc. I am impressed with the consultative nature of the project. The public was informed about it even before the low-flying aircraft appeared in the skies over Westmeath, Longford and Roscommon. You will be pleased to hear, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that an information booklet was disseminated in both Irish and English. The consultation has been helpful. If anybody sees an aircraft flying at a height of approximately 90 m with an apparatus suspended approximately 45 m below the aeroplane, that is part of the survey. The information is critical. Information is in the public domain and it is important to work together on the project. The direction in which the project is going has not yet been identified but we will use the information from the current survey on the three counties outlined. Ultimately, the project will form part of a national mapping analysis.
