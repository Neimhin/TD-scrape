JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to seek approval for 2,000 extra gardaí to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. He needs to be aware of some reality checks, however. I recently raised the issue of morale within the Garda. The Morris tribunal in Donegal is doing a job that has to be done, but it is inadvertently having a negative effect on morale within the force, which has a knock-on effect on public confidence in the force. An increasing number of gardaí are seeking early retirement as a result of the lack of morale. Questions have to be asked about the lack of Garda resources. Just three or four gardaí may have to patrol 30,000 or 40,000 people on the streets of the Temple Bar area of Dublin on a weekend night. Gardaí are under pressure. They fear imminent assault because they are conscious of the ever-increasing level of violent assaults in this country. A new garda, or a young cub as we would call him in County Donegal, was shot this morning.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am making a very serious point.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	A young garda was shot in the hand in the early hours of this morning. Senators would have been up in arms and calling for debates if he had been more seriously maimed. I call on the Minister, Deputy McDowell, to introduce clear and unambiguous protection for Garda personnel.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Such protection would be timely because the need for it is imminent. This is the start of something very serious within the force. As legislators, we have a duty to stand behind the Garda Síochána, rather than going up against it, and it is time we did so.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	People are being wrongly accused.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. This is the first public opportunity I have had to congratulate him on his new post. It is nice to have a fellow County Donegal man in Government. I am also delighted with my party leader's stance on the marine on which he has provided a full brief on the Front Bench to Deputy Perry.The Fine Gael Party supports the Bill. It is sensible, logical, uncontentious and appropriate to many businesses involved in the aquaculture industry. The Minister of State is aware that County Donegal, more than other areas, faces challenges in terms of the multifaceted fishing industry, which extends from mussels and scallops to fish farming. We have a plethora of fishing interests in the county.That public consultation involving all parties will take place on dumping at sea is a welcome development. I also welcome the move to enable the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to have the same control over archaeological heritage at sea as it currently has on land. We have many special interest groups, including deep sea divers who are interested in archaeological heritage off the coast.I will be parochial and raise a minor issue involving dredging in Buncrana. Donegal County Council undertook a major lobbying effort on behalf of the RNLI, which was seeking a berth for a larger boat, and a new ferry which was about to come on stream. The matter went through a public consultation forum. Several errors were made in the beginning — hindsight is great — but the project was successful. What contribution does the Department make as regards the type of dredging used? According to local hearsay, a large amount of money has been invested in dredging. Re-silting will continue to be a problem and focus for the public. What will be the Department's input, in consultation with local authorities, as regards the type of dredging?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator. The Fine Gael Party welcomes the Bill; it is non-contentious. We are discussing dumping at sea but we should put down a marker with regard to Sellafield. It is not related to this legislation but we should keep an eye on what is being dumped in Irish waters from Sellafield. We should be stronger on that issue. There are many concerned families in County Louth who have serious health problems due to the dumping at sea from Sellafield.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It could be south-west Donegal.
