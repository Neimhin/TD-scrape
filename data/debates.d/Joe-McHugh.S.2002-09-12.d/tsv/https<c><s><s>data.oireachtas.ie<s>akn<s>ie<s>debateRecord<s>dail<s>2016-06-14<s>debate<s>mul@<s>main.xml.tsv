JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh, as ucht seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar an ábhar tábhachtach seo. The report by the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland on the Loughinisland murders in 1994 is a source of deep concern to the Government and all parties in this House. Our thoughts are first and foremost with the families of the six murder victims of the terrible attack at Loughinisland, Adrian Rogan, Daniel McCreanor, Eamon Byrne, Patrick O'Hare, Barney Green and Malcolm Jenkinson. As we approach the 22nd anniversary of these sectarian murders, the report is a traumatic reminder of the loss and pain endured by their families and loved ones. The findings of the ombudsman are deeply disturbing, in particular his determination that collusion is a significant feature of the Loughinisland murders. The report also evidences shocking failures on the part of the RUC in tackling loyalist groups active in County Down at the time, dealing with informants and conducting the original investigation into the Loughinisland killings. The ombudsman report vindicates the concerns the families have raised over many years and their continuing search for justice. The hurt caused by their loved ones being murdered in such vicious circumstances is compounded by the knowledge that elements of the British security forces colluded with such callous crimes. The ombudsman's findings must now be carefully examined with a view to the question of further investigations and possible prosecutions. The PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, has made clear the PSNI commitment to apprehending those responsible for these appalling sectarian murders. It is vital that the PSNI investigation and the work of the service is given full support by all relevant authorities in order that all possible efforts can be made to bring to justice those who ordered and carried out the Loughinisland murders and those implicated by the ombudsman's finding of collusion. The Government will be unstinting in ensuring that the Loughinisland case remains a priority on the political agenda in our engagement with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. Therefore, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will be raising the cause at his next meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Despite its disturbing findings, the report is an important reminder of the central importance of the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman in supporting public confidence in the new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland, as envisaged in the Patten report. It is important that the achievement of substantial progress on the Patten vision of a transformed policing service in Northern Ireland is recognised and continues to be supported by all sides. The Police ombudsman's report on the Loughinisland attacks is also a stark reminder of the need to agree dedicated mechanisms for dealing with the painful legacy of the past in Northern Ireland, as is the current inquest into the Kingsmill massacre of 1976 and the establishment of a new policing investigation into the so-called Stakeknife allegations. All of these controversial cases are manifestations of the toxic legacy of the past which, if not addressed in a comprehensive way, has the capacity to destabilise the politics of the present and overwhelm the policing and justice system. The establishment of such dedicated mechanisms is a priority for the Government and is reflected in the programme for Government. The need to maintain victims and their survivors is at the core of our approach. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is actively engaged to seek and support an agreement on the establishment of the legacy institutions envisaged under the Stormont House Agreement. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and I believe that substantial progress can and must be achieved on this crucial issue over the coming months. Making progress on this issue would, in some measure at least, help to honour the memory of those six men who were indiscriminately murdered while watching a World Cup match in Loughinisland on 18 June 1994.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the three Deputies for raising this matter. I know from our engagement on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which included Deputies Crowe and Smith, we tackled all legacy issues and I think we all know the complexities involved. I am certainly aware that time skips by and time is not a commodity that is of any use to people seeking justice. As Deputy Smith pointed out, they have the truth but they do not have the justice. We have to keep focus on that. The fresh start agreement and the Stormont House agreement make a commitment to include an historical investigations unit. Independence has to be paramount to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths and we need an independent commission on information retrieval to enable victims and survivors to seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths. During our work on the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement we met all the groups. Different groups seek different things but, ultimately, it is the quest for justice and to find out as much truth as possible. It will not change things for them in terms of bringing loved ones back but with the Saville inquiry, we saw the very positive impact that truth recovery can bring. Deputy Adams asked if the Minister would meet the Secretary for State for Northern Ireland, Ms Theresa Villiers. He will do that in the short term. Obviously, this will be a priority. The Deputies asked if this would be debated in the Dáil. I think there is a need to debate wider legacy issues and I will certainly ask my Whip to raise it at the Whips' meeting. It is important to provide an opportunity to debate the wider issues of the past and legacy issues that so critically need to be the focus. Different parts of the world from Afghanistan to the Knesset look to the Northern Ireland peace model, including the east-west and North-South elements. However, as legislators, we are all aware that the process is not finished. As a Donegal man and a politician, I work very closely with my colleagues across the Border. It is a process and the truth and legacy issues of the past are very much part of that. I will certainly do my best to try to convey the need for having an open and wider debate. There may be things we could look at differently. This may be an important juncture. It is 40 years since the Kingsmills massacre and we are also discussing the Loughinisland tragedy, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the Pat Finucane murder. So many relatives are affected and we have to do justice to them.
JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Rinne an tAire, an Teachta Coveney, cur síos níos luaithe ar cé chomh tiomanta is atá an Rialtas chun ár ngéarchéim tithíochta a shárú. Téann an ghéarchéim sin i bhfeidhm ar gach cuid den earnáil tithíochta, an earnáil chíosa ina measc. Ní foláir mar sin de go mbeadh ár gcur chuige iomlánaíoch agus bunaithe ar an tuiscint go bhfuil gach cuid den earnáil tithíochta idirspleách agus fite fuaite ina chéile. Tá costas teach a thógáil ar chíos in Éirinn méadaithe go suntasach ó thosú na hathbheochana thart ar ceithre bhliain ó shin. Níl na leibhéil cíosa fós tagtha ar ais go dtí na leibhéil a bhí ann roimh thobchliseadh an gheilleagair, ach i mBaile Atha Cliath tá na leibhéil anois blúire níos airde ná an buaicphointe a bhí ann ag deireadh 2007. It was precisely because of continuing rent increases that the Government introduced a package of rent stability and additional housing supply measures in November. The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015, enacted on 4 December 2015, introduced a number of measures to address rent stability and housing supply.Regarding rent stability, the Act provides, inter alia, that the minimum period between rent reviews for tenancies will be increased from 12 to 24 months and this new provision will apply for a four-year period. In addition, the minimum period of notice of new rent is increased from 28 days to 90 days and longer notice periods for the termination of long-term tenancies have been introduced. Each of these new provisions commenced on enactment. Further provisions to support rent stability in the 2015 Act include that notice of new rent sent must be in a prescribed form, include details of dispute resolution procedures available through the Residential Tenancies Board and be accompanied by details of rent in respect of three comparable dwellings in the area, and that notification of a rent increase to the RTB will include, among other things, a signed statement by tenants that they are aware of their rights in relation to rent and rent reviews. The extension of the period between rent reviews from 12 to 24 months takes effect from the date of the last review, so if a tenant had a rent review in July 2015, the next rent review will not be until July 2017. The RTB quarterly rent index, which is compiled by the Economic and Social Research Institute for the Residential Tenancies Board, is the most accurate and authoritative rent report of its kind on the private accommodation sector in Ireland. It is based on new tenancies commenced each quarter and on the actual rents being paid, as distinct from the asking or advertised rent. The most recent RTB rent index for the first quarter of 2016 shows that the rate of rent inflation is cooling, with rents up nationally by 0.5% over the fourth quarter of 2015 and by 0.2% in Dublin. This compares to a national growth rate of 1.6% in the first quarter of 2015, almost 4% in the third quarter and over 2.5% in the second quarter. The data also show that the supply challenge remains acute. The trend in new tenancy registrations is downward, with annual tenancy registrations peaking in 2013 - with nearly 112,000 tenancies registered in that year - but dipping consecutively in 2014 and 2015. Overall numbers of registered tenancies have increased though suggesting that tenants are staying longer in their properties, thereby reducing the normal supply churn. It is still early days, of course, but there is reasonable cause to believe that these rent data represent the first stage in a welcome stabilisation of the rental market as the new provisions begin to take proper effect. Fundamentally, the increases in rent have been driven by a combination of economic recovery and a lack of supply. The rent stability measures are one side of the equation. Measures to support accelerated supply across all tenures are also critical. In addition to measures already under way under Construction 2020 and the social housing strategy to tackle this issue, the November package included the following measures to further address supply: a targeted development contribution rebate initiative in Dublin and Cork and changes to planning guidelines on apartment standards. There is no on-off button for the delivery of additional rental accommodation. It will take time for the supply measures in particular to take effect and alleviate some of the pressures. I welcome the motion and the opportunity for debate. The Minister's bona fides in seeking an adjournment should still stand, and I ask Sinn Féin to consider this and a longer period of time to consider this issue after the recess. I would also like to point out that we have a serious supply problem. We all know this and we all know where the population is going globally - 9 billion by 2030, 65% of whom will be living in urban centres. We will be part of that challenge, and this is the House to debate it. I welcome the announcement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, today. Every little bit helps. His was a big intervention today. I also acknowledge the passion, commitment and drive of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, to try to find a solution, but he will not be doing it on his own. It will be done together with all the stakeholders, and that is not just the people in this House.
