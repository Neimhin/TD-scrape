JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  I have three brief questions.  Mr. Byrne mentioned EU funding.  What percentage of EU funding will be available for this project in either monetary terms or the percentage of cost?  With 8,000 MW hours waiting outside gate two, will there be priority for the existing developers?  On instilling confidence in new onshore entrants, what timeframe will be involved in their getting access to the grid in light of this new interconnection?  They are developing business plans and want to know the timeframes realistically involved.  Mr. Cooke has mentioned the North-South interconnector and I will be a little parochial.  In terms of wind turbines in County Donegal, where will the interconnector go?  Would the realistic option look at an interconnector across the Border or an upgraded 110 kV connector coming from south Donegal into the Ireland-Wales interconnector?  Perhaps Mr. Cooke could answer that.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Given that 8,000 MW is available to Gate 3 at the moment, will there be an opportunity for those who are preparing at present to go into the development of wind turbine energy?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The interconnection will help that.
