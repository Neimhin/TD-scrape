JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the growing number of burglaries of houses and the ongoing inability of Inishowen Garda Síochána to prevent their occurrence which illustrates there are insufficient Garda Síochána resources on the peninsula and that the distribution of Garda Síochána resources does not consider the fact that Inishowen circles Derry city which is the fourth largest city in Ireland.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I refer to No. 61 on Tuesday's Order Paper regarding Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  I wish to acknowledge the Tánaiste's own personal attention to this matter.  I request Government time to take this debate.  Since my colleagues and I tabled this motion four months ago, circumstances have changed.  Time is now running out for boys nearing the age of 18 and it is a life and death situation.  We need a debate on whether we are going to ring-fence money and follow up on commitments made two years ago.  I ask the Tánaiste to allow Government time on this very pertinent and important issue.
