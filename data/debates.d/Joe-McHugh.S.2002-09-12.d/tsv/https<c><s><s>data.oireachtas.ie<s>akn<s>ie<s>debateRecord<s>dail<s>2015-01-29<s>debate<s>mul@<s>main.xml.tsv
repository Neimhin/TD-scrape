JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for the question. To assist Government bodies in making informed decisions about future licensing and management of any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of an unconventional gas exploration or extraction project, comprehensive knowledge of the potential impacts of this process on the environment and human health is required. On behalf of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the EPA appointed CDM Smith consultants last year to undertake this programme of scientific research, which is to be carried out over a minimum period of two years. The key questions that this research programme must answer are whether unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects and operations can be carried out in the island of Ireland while also protecting the environment and human health; and what constitutes best environmental practice in relation to such projects and operations. To this end, the scientific research programme is based on a consideration of existing baseline data with respect to ground water, air and seismicity and the potential implications and mitigations that are required to be considered in order to understand the possible environmental impacts of using this technology. While it is not anticipated that any interim reports will be made available before the final report is published, I have sought a progress update report on the research programme from the EPA, which I expect to receive shortly. I confirm again that no decision will be made on any proposal for the use of hydraulic fracturing as part of any unconventional gas exploration or extraction programme until there has been time to consider the outcome of the EPA research.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with the Deputy's sentiments and am at one with him on his concern, having met with a number of groups, including during the summer with Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn and Senator Michael Comiskey. I note that Deputy Michael Colreavy has a very strong interest in the area also. There are concerns. In fact, more than 1,000 submissions came from the community during the consultation period prior to the EPA report. That was not just in relation to the environment, but predominantly on health and health impacts. That is why we have built a very strong health pillar into the EPA report. It is also why there is a representative from the health sector on this particular body. I was very concerned that the EPA would do a two-year report and let someone deal with it then. I sought and built in, not necessarily a mid-term review, but an appraisal of where matters stand at this juncture. The process only commenced last August, but the appraisal will happen shortly. We must look at a mechanism to distribute the resulting information. If there are ideas from the other side of the House, I will move that forward. I am certainly open to them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will relay the Deputy's concerns. We will look at a mechanism to disseminate that information. On Deputy Wallace's concerns on health, I note that there is a licensing round in the Atlantic margins currently. If one looks at the acreage available to Ireland in that context, Ireland is the fourth largest country in Europe in geographical terms. There is a momentum offshore and within the industry on the potential within the new round of licensing in the Atlantic margin. I am on record regarding my personal opinion as to whether there is enough acreage out there to focus on that sector and oil and gas drilling offshore. I think there is. Is Ireland too small a country with so unique an architectural and archaeological heritage to have fracking here? Without pre-empting any of the information in the report to which I have no access, I note that I have my own reservations given the size of Ireland and the architectural and archaeological uniqueness of the island on going to a stage for hydraulic fracturing. We know of reports in other countries of environmental and health concerns. That is my personal view and I am on record as having said that in the past. I have my concerns. While I am certainly not pre-empting what will come out of the report, I wish to record that again. 
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for tabling this question. Policy on the development of the aquaculture sector is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The consistent position of Ministers and Ministers of State in my Department and Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, the State agency with responsibility for the inland fisheries resource, has been to support aquaculture development which is environmentally sustainable and which meets the obligations of domestic, EU and international legislation, particularly the EU habitats directive and other environmental requirements. I understand that a significant number of land-based salmon farms have been introduced in Norway and Denmark. Land-based salmon farming is also being developed in North America and in Europe with plans to initiate Europe’s largest such installation in Scotland. I am advised, however, that the development of closed containment systems in fish production internationally is at a relatively early stage. I am also advised that analysis of land-based salmon farming demonstrates advantages of closed containment system land-based salmon aquaculture. From the perspective of IFI’s statutory responsibilities for the conservation and protection of wild salmonids, that is salmon and trout, the use of these systems would mean that segregation of farmed fish from wild species is assured and longstanding issues concerned with interaction are less likely to arise. Other advantages identified include controls on water quality and temperature. In addition, bio-security, diseases, parasites and the delivery of daily husbandry are much easier to manage in closed systems. The elimination of threats of escapes of farmed fish into the wild environment is also cited. All of these expected benefits would be of assistance in protecting wild stocks. As I indicated at the outset, policy on the development of aquaculture is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The State’s seafood development body, an Bord Iascaigh Mhara, may be in a position to advise on other aspects of developments and trials of closed containment aquaculture systems in Ireland and internationally.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We must always be vigilant. Any opportunity for my officials and those of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, to collaborate on an interdepartmental level is welcome. The experience in Canada and Scotland in respect of closed containment systems indicates that major upfront capital investment is required. This approach is at the development stage. Opportunities relating to it will obviously present themselves in the future as both the science and the technology move forward. It should be noted that closed containment systems are not necessarily located in coastal areas. Such systems merely need to be situated close to a readily-available freshwater supply. The Deputy suggested that we continue to engage in dialogue. If any collaborative opportunities arise for my Department and that of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, in the context of developing sustainable aquaculture, which is central to my portfolio, while ensuring environmental sustainability in the first instance, then we will consider them.
