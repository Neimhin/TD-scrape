JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I also welcome the delegation.  It is a good opportunity to discuss these relevant matters.  In light of the Government's decision to keep the radio stations in Valentia and Malin Head, a commitment was made before Christmas that there would be investment in them and that they would be upgraded.  ComReg has a role to play in terms of monitoring that situation.  It is important that the required equipment is provided in accordance with the commitment that has been made.  The people involved in both those stations are providing an excellent service not alone at a national level but an international level.Perhaps I missed it in the presentation, but does the information include an OECD comparison for mobile telephone prices internationally?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important that we would have access to that information.  According to the OECD chart figures we are proving to be competitive for fixed land line, residential and business.To put things in perspective, I will use a practical example.  I am pleased that two of the three gentlemen from ComReg emphasised that they would de-jargonise the jargon today.  "De-jargonise" is a word for 2009.  I note that they continue to use phrases such as "moving forward", which is absolutely cringeworthy at this stage.  Everybody, including George Lee, is talking about moving forward.  That piece of jargon needs to be thrown in the dustbin pretty soon.I pay on average €400 per month for my mobile telephone usage.  Some months it is €700 and other months it can be below €400.  That is not even an average amount.  I am bringing the figure down low.  When multiplied over a ten-year period, which is the period in which I have been using a mobile telephone, one is talking about €48,000.  As a politician I also have two land lines in two constituency offices and a home land line.  Using a rough estimate I pay approximately €600 per month.  When one works out communications costs over a ten-year period, not including broadband, I have paid approximately €120,000 over that period.  That is the average.  I accept that we get remunerated for the expenses.If I owned a business in 1999 and was drawing up a business plan, would I have factored in mobile phone and land usage to the tune of €120,000?  Is that a justifiable figure for a business when setting aside phone costs?  I know businesses that use many more minutes and hours on the phone than I would as a politician.  Are these prices justified when taking the interests of consumers into account?  We should look at the thing in a European context and make international comparisons.  Businesses in my neck of the woods are going to the wall and the main reasons are competitive costs.Peers of mine working for top businesses abroad would be prepared to come back to Ireland if the proper broadband infrastructure was there.  It is not there in places like Donegal.  Efforts are being made to unbundle the loops around the exchanges, and there is adequate radio coverage through the group schemes introduced by the Government.  However, there are still areas in which people are outside the radius of the exchanges and outside radio broadband.  People involved in the international financial sector would be prepared to come home if the proper broadband was there.  The new contract has been tendered, so will ComReg liaise closely with the contractor that has been provided?  Are the witnesses confident that ComReg will be able to fill in these gaps in the broadband market?
