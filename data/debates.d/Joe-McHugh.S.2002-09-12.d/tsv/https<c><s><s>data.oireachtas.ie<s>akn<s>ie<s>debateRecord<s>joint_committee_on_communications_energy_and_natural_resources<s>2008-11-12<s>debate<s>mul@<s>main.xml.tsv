JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation to this meeting.  The tone has been set, as Deputy D'Arcy said.  The tone from the politicians on this side of the room is quite negative.  If we peel back the layers, perhaps we will find that other things are going on.  As politicians, we use telephones very often.  We get high telephone bills every month.  Perhaps that is having a subconscious effect on us.  A few weeks ago, I came up with a mathematical formula to show that over the past ten years, I have paid various mobile phone companies â‚¬50,000 for the privilege of having a mobile phone.  I will not mention the companies in question.  That amount of money would have bought me a house in Letterkenny ten years ago.  This is probably the first opportunity we have had, as politicians, to address the mobile phone operators.  It would be unfortunate if we were to fail to use that chance constructively.  It may be the case that something is going on, subconsciously or otherwise.  We are concerned about whether we are getting value for money.  Are we paying too much money for mobile phones?  I will park those issues for the time being.  We may be able to explore them at a later date.As a representative of a Border area, I am often welcomed to the United Kingdom by a mobile phone operator as I drive around places like Quigley's Point and Muff.  I have to pay roaming charges to companies like Orange UK as I move through the various bands.  There is a serious issue in that regard.  The Good Friday Agreement provides for an integrated communications strategy to be drawn up.  It is something of which we should be cognisant.We have to be responsible during the debate on mobile phone bullying.  I welcome the opportunity to meet the representatives of the various companies.  I welcome their critique of the specifics of the Kidsafe product.  Teachers and principals within the secondary school sector are stretched.  They have tried everything, such as confiscating phones each morning.  They cannot do that.  They do not have the ability, time or resources to do this because it is an impossible task.  Children will simply hand in a different, broken mobile telephone.  Confiscation is not the way forward.Responsible ownership and a change in culture in mobile phone usage are needed.  The ICIA has a role to play in this regard, as do legislators and Departments, particularly the Department of Education and Science.  One school principal has proposed including in the curriculum a focus on the communications sector.  Mobile telephones have become part of our lives.  We take them to bed with us and check them first thing in the morning.  They are over-used, invade our personal space and we do not know when to switch them off.  The working day used to be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for good reason.  Nowadays, we receive text messages at 3 a.m. and send e-mails or do work on our Blackberry devices at all hours.  Everyone has a responsibility to take ownership of this issue and change how mobile phones are used.On the issue of bullying, we all attended school and know that bullying takes different forms, for example, verbal abuse or through graffiti on desks and toilet walls.  Should we attack the manufacturers of markers because people use them for graffiti?  It is an easy option to beat the people who provide the medium and mobile telephony is a new medium which young people use.  There is an onus on legislators and operators in the industry to come together to seek responsible behavioural change.We treat young people as if they do not have minds of their own.  Teenagers aged 12, 13, 14 and 15 will act responsibly if they are shown leadership and guidance.  Deputy D'Arcy and I had to be told by the Chairman, our teacher as it were, to switch off our mobile phones when we arrived at this meeting.

Adults will not switch off their mobile phones but expect young people to leave them at home or switch them off when they enter the classroom.  We need equity between adults and young people.  This also applies in the case of alcohol where adults who expect young people to drink moderately and behave properly get drunk at weekends at rugby matches, christenings and weddings.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am speaking on behalf of a few of us.  Adults are supposed to show leadership but fail to do so.There are many opportunities to use this new technology for the benefit of the disability sector.  Under current legislation, drivers may use hands-free kits in their cars.  Why does every wheelchair not have a hands-free kit to assist people with disabilities?  The reason is that disabled people are at the margins of society.  We need to introduce legislation on this issue.  While I do not wish to single out companies, I commend O2 for showing leadership in this area.  A few of the company's employees financed and furnished a person whom I know well with a hands-free kit for his wheelchair.This returns me to the responsibility on policymakers and industry.  The role of the latter is in research and development, whereas the role of legislators is in cross-subsidisation.  We need to get serious about how to improve lives, combat bullying and assist those with disabilities to secure access to modern technology.  As I noted, the tone of the meeting has been a little negative.  Perhaps we need to start at the beginning, engage in more debate, show joint leadership and take joint ownership of all the problems.
