JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In Deputy Burton's second contribution on this amendment, she opened up the analysis to include economic and social aspects, even to the social versus the economic.  The special purpose vehicle, SPV, has thrown me today.  The Minister might argue it is only a bureaucratic consideration but the entire philosophy of NAMA, as portrayed by the Minister's partners in government, the Green Party, was that there would be a social dividend to the Bill.The language used today by the Minister reminds me of the time Charlie McCreevy came into the House and began to talk about decentralisation, a matter which at this stage we all know was made up on the back of a matchbox.  The Minister states that NAMA "could" do this or that it "might" introduce a social aspect with regard to schools or playgrounds.  NAMA "may" do this or that.  We should be looking more specifically at the legislation with regard to what it will do.If it is the case there will be an economic dividend from the commercial element of NAMA, and based on the Minister's conservative assumption of a €4.8 million dividend over a ten year period, should we not be building in a short to medium to long-term contract concerning where those funds will go?  Within section 12(u) there is the provision for NAMA to “invest its funds as the Board determines”.  At this stage the Minister should be determining this point.  There should be a plan but obviously there is none at the moment and it is very much a case of making it up as we go along.I for one know where we might put some of the funds within the next 12 months.  If we get economic consideration built into the legislation obviously we will get social consideration and social outcomes.  The one key focus in the minds of every citizen in the State at present relates to jobs.  We should tie NAMA into an economic contract.  I shall give one example, without being parochial.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Through the Chair, I shall give the Minister one example.  In my county, we have gone through the predesigned and design stage of three major road projects.  We paid employees in the national roads design office.  Serious investment has gone into the design of these roads or potential roads.  Should we not be providing or even sanctioning some element or percentage of funds towards these projects?.  At present, what will happen——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	——is that these projects will fall within the next 12 to 18 months——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I shall sum up now with this point.  These contracts will fall within the next 12 to 18 months if they do not receive money.  We will be back to stage one and will have to redesign the roads.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Regarding section 12, economic and social consideration should be brought out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The key point is there is no plan in the legislation——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The language states NAMA may, or could, do such.  There is no provision made as to what——
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is no plan and this matter of special purpose vehicle is——
