JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising this important question. I think it was St. Teresa's in Roscommon that started this debate earlier in the year. What we have done in response to that issue is to work with the management bodies of the 125 special schools on a joint approach whereby a collective application would be made for insurance. Not all special schools have signed up to the plan but they are in the process. Intense communication and dialogue is ongoing between my officials and the management bodies to ensure that we are on top of this issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We will spend €620 million on schools in 2020. As Deputy Smyth is aware, there are many school extensions on the capital programme and a lot of new schools as well to keep up with demographic demands. Schools are making applications for gyms but it will not be until the latter end of the capital plan before we reach some of them.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is a very important issue. Officials in the Department of Education and Skills sit on a cross-departmental group and we take this issue very seriously. We have targeted support for DEIS schools. Initially when the DEIS school support system was set up it, it was not primarily on a geographical basis, but invariably it is on a geographical base. We are reviewing that and are looking at how we can have a more graduated and targeted intervention. Children who do not have homes will form part of that. We are in the middle of the review and we are already on record saying that we need to further enhance the €120 million funding we have for DEIS support and see how we can build on that in the future.
