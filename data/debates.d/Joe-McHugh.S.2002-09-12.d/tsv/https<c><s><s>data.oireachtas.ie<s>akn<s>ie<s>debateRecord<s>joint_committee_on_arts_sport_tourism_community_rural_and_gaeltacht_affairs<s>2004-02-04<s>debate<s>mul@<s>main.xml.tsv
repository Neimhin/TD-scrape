JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Chairman's intervention on getting submissions from different groups.Donegal County Council has the first democratically elected youth council in the country with an age range from 16 to 20 years. It may be a good exercise to have a submission from the council, as it is important to find out what is happening within that age group. The Minister of State referred to the Cabra example and the resources that need to go into capital projects. Such a model would be successful in an urban area like Cabra. However, in rural areas and small towns, young people are simply looking for an outlet or space where they can meet with their peers. Youth centres should open after 5 o'clock on a Friday and open again from 8 o'clock on a Saturday morning to 12 midnight and after school. There is a tradition in Northern Ireland whereby the authorities put great emphasis on putting youth workers through university. We must consider the human resource model as well as the capital resource move, and work hand in glove. There is a moral issue at stake here. I recall attending a regional drugs task force working group in 1996. The same issues such as preventative measures come up time and again. We mean well in what we say, but we bring up the same issues all the time. The moral at stake is that young people are bored and have little to do. Young people, including people in their 20s, look for a buzz on Saturday night by taking 15 pints or three ecstasy tablets. These people are bored and know nothing better. They are used to the buzz from drink, to which they look forward. The responsibility will rest with us if we do nothing about the problem. We should keep things simple and try to move forward. If we make progress through the committee, and through the intervention of the Chairman, we can move forward in this regard.
JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a problem with other Departments being involved. The Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism is involved and youth services come under the Department of Education and Science. Capital projects are not the solution. Social infrastructure is important. It is important for a boxing club to be funded in Carrigart or a sports centre to be funded in Letterkenny. However, the Minister of State will be aware that all young people do not play sport. We are talking about overheads in terms of human resources, or having perhaps ten youth workers in a town like Letterkenny with a population of 16,000. People will voluntarily give a room and there will be insurance reductions. All they want to do is hang out with their peers and listen to music or play guitar and they would be doing so in a supervised environment. The youth club model worked but it required parents to be involved. Young people do not want to be with their parents, they want to get away from them because they are under enough pressure. It is a human resources issue and we should encourage people to take up full-time youth work courses so they can become full-time youth workers in their communities.
