JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister. I also thank the Leader of the House for her efforts in trying to secure the Minister's presence here since I first placed this item on the Order Paper six months ago. I congratulate the Minister on his openness and frankness. We are all in this together. We have a problem in rural Ireland which it will take a long time to get sorted.When I first became involved in community development in 1995, the same language was used to discuss the build-up to the White Paper on Rural Development. What has been done is quite visible in any rural area such as west Galway, County Mayo or County Donegal. Roads that were never tarred are now being tarred. It is also encouraging that an effort is being made to hold on to our language.The town and village renewal programmes have been quite successful in County Donegal. The changes initiated by the Better Local Government programme have brought about improvements in the structure of local government. There are now different service divisions, such as directorates of community and enterprise, planning, roads, the environment and sanitary and housing.A problem exists in regard to the lack of clarity in accessing and drawing down funding. Local groups who try to access funding via the Internet do not know if they should be applying to the local authorities or other agencies. Sometimes local authorities do not know if it will get the funding or if it will go to Leader companies or ADM partnership groups. While I wish to make my contribution as constructive as possible, it has to be said that there must be proper dissemination of information among these groups; they need to know the mechanisms to use to draw down funding.The Internet revolution has increased the potential among individuals and community groups in regard to seeking funding for local projects or group sewerage or water schemes. However, if people are unsuccessful in accessing what they seek, it will erode their confidence to the further detriment of rural communities. Community groups are not just interested in rural regeneration, they have their own programmes and would benefit from some transparency in respect of the current funding arrangements. In an effort to bring about a constructive approach in conjunction with BLG, a booklet should be produced to clarify the options available.I met Liam Scollan, chief executive of the Western Development Commission, in 1996. We spoke the same language on the revitalisation of rural areas, organic farming, agri-tourism projects and turning towns into market towns. The Western Development Commission carried out research on a European scale in regard to ideas on the revitalisation of rural towns and villages in both western and eastern Europe. It was looking at areas where investment in the social and physical infrastructure of certain towns and villages had led to their survival. The effort that was made to develop and invest in indigenous local projects with the ultimate aim of keeping people in rural areas appeared to pay dividends.We need the Western Development Commission. I say this in the context of the review that is currently under way. The commission was responsible for the genesis of rural development in 1995 and I have some experience of working in conjunction with it. At that time, its two priorities were broadband and tourism – agri-tourism in particular. The simple message was that investment in broadband in rural towns and villages would ultimately result in a reduction in the agglomeration of people in urban centres, to borrow a phrase from the Minister. Technology would have allowed people to "tele-cottage" in their own homes in the rural countryside. We missed an open goal in the intervening period. Not enough emphasis was put on broadband ISDN lines in rural areas. The notion of a broadband infrastructure from Malin Head to Mizen Head appears to be mainly aspirational. It is imperative that we get this back on the drawing board. I am aware that broadband comes under the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, but there is an opportunity for the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to show some vision and tie in an interdepartmental approach.The review in regard to Leader companies, county enterprise boards and Údarás na Gaeltachta is important. We do not need duplication, we need an integrated approach. An integrated strategy is not just needed for the west, it is also needed for rural areas in general. The Minister's Department can act as a facilitator in allowing this to happen. I congratulate him in terms of his vision and his straight-talking manner, but the real test is how this will be put into action. I do not know how long the honeymoon period will last. The only way to instil confidence in a programme such as this is if people can see some result.The roads department of Donegal County Council is involved in rural tertiary roads. However, the planning and community and enterprise sections are also involved in regard to any village or town renewal scheme. How will these different directorates access funding? Next October, if large amounts of money have been allocated to Leader programmes or to local authorities but there is nothing tangible for people to see, the honeymoon period will truly be over.The Minister has already welcomed the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture and Food to Gaeltacht areas. That is a natural progression, particularly if we are serious about retaining people in rural areas and building the services around them. An American information technology company called Prumerica is based in Letterkenny. As far as I am aware, it allows some of its workforce to work from home. There is no reason someone living on Fanad Head or Malin Head or at Rosses Point cannot stay at home to do his or her work. The associated benefits to communities of people remaining to work in their areas are manifold.I could have used this opportunity as a platform to attack the Minister. I could have said that action is not being taken and that rural areas are still in decline. However, I would rather work with the Minister whose heart appears to be in the right place in respect of rural areas. People in rural local authorities are willing to work with the Minister's ideas and vision. The current climate of confidence in rural areas will be severely damaged if we do not seize this opportunity to get the channels of funding sorted out as a priority.That is the main point I wish to make. It has been the message from all the community groups – women's groups, local action groups, etc. – to which I have spoken. Their sons and daughters have been accessing information on the CLÁR programme on the Internet and making on-line applications, but they do not know how to draw down the funding. The same is true of local authority members and officials. Like the Minister, my heart is with rural areas and I accept that things will change.In ten or 15 years, people will have different occupations from those they hold at present. The typical returned emigrant has spent time in London or Manchester or on the east coast of the United States. The majority of our returning emigrants have worked in the construction industry and are coming back to Ireland to continue working in the same industry. They are bringing their talents, skills and expertise back to this country, but they are working primarily in urban centres. We should use the expertise of our returned emigrants to install broadband technology. These people have installed telecommunications infrastructure throughout the world.The emigrants who return to Ireland 20 or 30 years from now will be talented, educated and skilful. We must have adequate telecommunications and road infrastructure in rural areas – we do not need to build motorways or dual carriageways, merely to fill the potholes – for those future emigrants who will have gained working experience in Germany, Silicon Valley, Finland, Sweden and other parts of the world. Our emigrants are the most talented in the world and we must have services in place for them when they return.I thank the Minister for coming before the House. I also appreciate the time he took recently to meet a local group in County Donegal. Unfortunately, the result of that meeting was not satisfactory, but, through working together and discussing our problems, we can find solutions.
