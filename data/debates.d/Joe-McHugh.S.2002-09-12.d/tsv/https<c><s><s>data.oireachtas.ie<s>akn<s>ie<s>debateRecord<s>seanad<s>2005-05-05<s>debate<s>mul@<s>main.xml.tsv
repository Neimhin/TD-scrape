JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I agree with Senator White who raised a very relevant point with regard to the long-term sustainability of indigenous industry. Our economists can only forecast as far as 2006 regarding predicted growth of 5.5%. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to know that we will have that growth because 12% of all investment resources are tied up in the construction sector. We must examine the post-construction sector of the economy. As everyone is aware, indigenous industry throughout the country is tied up with the construction sector.If there is a lesson to be learned, it is with regard to the manufacturing sector. We learned a very hard lesson in Donegal, where the Government was left with the problem of what to do with the workforce following the decline of the manufacturing sector. The Government sent workers on computer courses as a solution. We should plan for the future.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We should facilitate the people who are currently tied up in the construction sector by offering them training programmes for the future post-construction sector. We need a debate on this issue in the short term.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister to the House. Fine Gael will support this Bill because it is technical in nature. I thank civil servants for bringing it to our attention yesterday and briefing us in anticipation of today's debate. The real issue here is rushed legislation. I do not have the experience to decide whether rushed or unrushed legislation is better but history shows that rushed legislation is bad. Due to the Minister's back being against the wall and the possibility of court cases there was a need to rush this matter. However, it is important that this House does not set a precedent for rushed legislation. We have learned a hard lesson from the Health (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2004, which will cost the State â‚¬2 billion. It is obvious that rushing that piece of legislation was not in the best interest of the State.The public, upon being asked, does not know what Senators do or that the Seanad exists. The public perception of our role is not positive. It might be time that the Seanad, as a reflective Chamber, began to sell its wares. I was involved with the Minister on the recent Irish language Bill, on which we deliberated for a long time. The time spent by the Minister on that Bill was appreciated. He accepted some amendments and rejected others and we at least had an opportunity to debate. It is important that this House is used as a reflective forum for discussion.A precedent should not be set for rushed legislation. Passing legislation overnight is not fair to our electorate, the Civil Service and others who want to have an input. It undermines the entire democratic process. The Seanad should not be a rubber stamping facility. Many people have opinions which carry weight.
