JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am glad the Minister is here, and I welcome him.  This is a great opportunity to debate all these issues.  In a radio interview over Christmas the Minister used the term "climate change" about 18 times.  We are living in a period when climate change is not just a local or an Irish phenomenon, but a global question.  Whether we like it or not, it is upon us.  The private sector will lead the way, even though policy might sometimes stimulate initiative.  I congratulate the Minister because, while in Opposition, he was a great advocate of efforts to alleviate climate change.  It is an international phenomenon and the private sector must take the lead.There is a lack of overall vision on the part of the Government, with each Minister putting forward his or her pet projects.  Has the Minister had any consultation with his colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, who is from County Meath?  The latter was in the news two weeks ago announcing the development of the rail system between Dublin and Navan.  It is to be welcomed by all, not least the people of Meath.  This investment project will cost upwards of €578 million, but was described by the then chief executive officer of Iarnród Éireann as economically unviable.The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a pivotal role to play in terms of vision.  Why is the Government not taking a broader view in respect of environmental issues?  I notice Councillor Owen Brannigan from County Monaghan is in the Gallery.  People in Cavan, Monaghan, Tyrone, Fermanagh and Donegal have no access to rail services.  It is unsatisfactory that the tail track is coming only as far as Navan.  There is an opportunity to introduce rail services into counties Monaghan, Cavan, Fermanagh, Tyrone and Donegal, where no rail track currently exists.The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is an advocate of efforts to alleviate climate change and to reduce CO2 emissions.  Facilitating greater use of rail is an effective means of reducing CO2 emissions.  I ask the Minister to show leadership on this matter.  He should speak to his Cabinet colleague, the Minister for Transport, and examine the possibility of opening up new railway lines and laying electricity ducting along those tracks, as has been done in Denmark.  Moreover, they should consider the possibility of ducting not only for electricity but also for fibre optic cables.Why is there no interconnection in terms of a larger plan for the State?  Instead, progress is merely piecemeal.  A certain issue is raised, such as overhead pylons, and the public immediately reacts to that particular issue, after which it is the turn of politicians to react.  There is no overriding vision.  Will the Minister consult with the Minister for Transport to consider the possibility of integrating services?  That is the type of vision needed.  The Minister has the leadership to advocate such a proposal and bring it forward.
