JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is a broader issue in regard to competitiveness and costs.  The Tánaiste referred in last night's Private Members' debate to a differential of 5% in price differences between North and South.  Is this figure taken from a Forfás report that has not yet been published?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Some of the difficulty in regard to the VAT differential is one of perception among consumers.  People are heading for the Border in large numbers and they cannot get there quickly enough.  I noticed a race between motorists and Tesco delivery lorries on the M1 one Thursday morning.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The six Tesco lorries were obstructed by the number of motorists coming from the South.  I heard recently that retailers in Derry cannot get fork-lift drivers to unload stock from the trucks quickly enough.I have a simple mathematical question for the Minister and her Ministers of State.  What is 21.5% of nothing?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The reality is that 21.5% of nothing is nothing.  The British Government has reduced the rate of VAT in an effort to get money into tills.  That is what will get the economy moving again.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	We must face up to that challenge.  Retailers cutting their margins will not be enough to re-stimulate economic activity.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Neither the Minister nor her Ministers of State were able to answer that simple mathematical question.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Government cannot blame retailers.
