JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are running a bit late but we will try to move along as swiftly as possible.  As members are aware, representatives from the SDLP are here to discuss the Civic Forum for Northern Ireland.  The forum was provided for within the Good Friday Agreement to provide for a broad range of voices in community relations and stimulate informed public debate in respect of key societal challenges.  As yet, it remains a non-implemented provision of the agreement.  We are discussing the value of a consultative forum and steps required for its implementation with representatives from the SDLP.  On behalf of the committee, I am very pleased to welcome John Dallat, MLA, who is a neighbour of mine across the Border and who visits Donegal quite a bit and has reasons to be there.  I also welcome Ms Dolores Kelly, MLA, who has also been pushing this agenda for a long period of time and Ms Caroline Mc Neill, who is policy advisor to the party.  Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentations, I must read the following into the record.  I advise witnesses that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now call on Ms Dolores Kelly, MLA, to proceed with her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call on Mr. Dallat to make his presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Ritchie.  Next are Mr. Murphy and Deputy Wall.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Someone's mobile telephone is interfering.  Just put it on the ground.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Somebody owns it.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Senator White will follow Deputy Wall.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Crowe will follow Senator White.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As we are under pressure of time, I propose to group questions from members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Dallat, MLA.  Does anybody wish to expand on how we can move forward on the suggestions made today?  I believe the SDLP representatives have reiterated what has happened in recent months.  There has been an appetite in Northern Ireland to get involved in the Haass-O'Sullivan process.  Without going into the nuts and bolts of that, it is significant that there were more than 600 submissions and with the vast majority from civic society it has identified an appetite for civic engagement.  In private session we agreed that we would contact the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach to follow up post-Haass outlining the committee's feelings.  We can include today's SDLP submission as part of that communique.  We can also include the full contribution because many people made observations today.  I will let the members contribute to add their own input.  I call Senator Jim D'Arcy followed by Mr. McDonnell, MLA.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	While there may be an appetite to keep the post mortem going, it is important to use the restricted time available to us to make proposals as to how we can follow up here.  I call Dr. McDonnell, MP, followed by Mr. Maskey, MLA.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will take two final speakers because we have gone over time in a big way.  Mr. Maskey and Senator Moran have indicated.  Everyone else got a good hearing.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will leave the he last word with Mr. Dallat, MLA.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Before that, I will have the semi-last word.  Thank you for your presentation today.  It is important to keep this going.  There have been a few suggestions.  We always have to go back to the role of this committee.  This is an Oireachtas committee.  It is our job to hold the Irish Government to account in respect of its responsibilities as co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.  That is where our focus is and where it will continue to be.  It is our job to put the pressure on the Irish Government.  We are undertaking an inquiry into the Good Friday Agreement 15 or 16 years on to establish the position.  This will be done with the Committee on Sovereign Matters chaired by Deputy Frank Feighan at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  We will keep you fully informed on that.  Thank you for the presentation and I will leave the last word with Mr. Dallat, MLA.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you very much.  I am not going to suspend.  We will go straight into the next session.  I call on the members of the Justice for the Forgotten group to take their seats to make their presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are now going to hear from representatives of Justice for the Forgotten to discuss their work to support those affected by violence in Northern Ireland.  On behalf of the committee I am pleased to welcome Ms Margaret Urwin from Justice for the Forgotten, who is accompanied by Ms Anne Cadwallader of the Pat Finucane Centre, the author of the recently-published book Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland.  I acknowledge the presence of several people who have joined us in the Visitors Gallery, who are representing some of the families affected by violence in Northern Ireland.  We have Kevin and Catherine O'Loughlin, Bernie McNally, Bernadette Joly, Thomas O'Brien, Noel Hegarty, John Byrne, Derek Byrne, Alan White, Monica Duffy-Campbell, Pat Fay and Raymond Walker.  You are most welcome to today's meeting.  Before I invite you to make your presentation I advise that you are protected by absolute privilege.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your remarks.  You are directed that only comments and evidence in respect of the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you do not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Without further ado I call on Ms Urwin to proceed with her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Margaret Urwin.  I will take Ms Anne Cadwallader's contribution before opening it up to the committee.  I note that Ms Cadwallader has quite an extensive dossier.  I will give her a choice.  She probably wants to read it into the record but, if so, it means she will have less time for engagement.  It is up to her but if she wishes to summarise it, that would give us more time for engagement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will leave it up to Ms Cadwallader.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Anne Cadwallader and Ms Margaret Urwin for their contributions.  Ms Cadwallader's chilling account brings us vividly to events of that time.  Deputy Brendan Smith is offering and Ms Margaret Ritchie, MP, will follow.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Ritchie is next, followed by Deputy Feighan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Murphy will follow Deputy Feighan.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Deputy Wall will follow Mr. Murphy.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will call Ms Cadwallader at the end.  We have three more contributors.  We will hear first from Alasdair McDonnell followed by Senator Mary White.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Senator Mary White who will be followed by Deputy Seán Crowe.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	The final two contributors are Deputy Seán Crowe followed by Senator Mary Moran.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No the final contributor is Deputy Ellis.  He should not follow the pattern set by the committee members.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am not referring only to Senator Moran.  Brevity is alien to the other members but this is an important issue.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, Deputy.  Before I ask the witnesses to sum up, I point out that I am obliged by another commitment and have to leave.  With the agreement of the committee, I ask that Deputy Frank Feighan take the Chair in my absence.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I thank Ms Cadwallader and Ms Urwin for their contributions today.  There will be follow-up in regard to what we propose to do, but I will leave that to Deputy Feighan.  I thank the witnesses once again and also thank the members.
