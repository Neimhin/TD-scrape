JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I remind members and those in the Visitors' Gallery to ensure their mobile phones, iPhones, etc., are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the broadcasting equipment, even when left in silent mode. I ask that they respect this instruction, athough I think there is a lack of mobile phone coverage in this area. I propose that we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We are meeting to discuss the impact of the recent protests in Belfast on the local retail sector. I am delighted to welcome back Mr. Glyn Roberts who is no stranger to the joint committee. He was here with the delegation from the Northern Ireland business trust in 2012. He is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Independent Retail Trade Association. Obviously, members of the committee will have observations to make and questions to ask following his presentation. He will be aware that as a committee we travelled to Belfast on 22 and 23 November. We had a very enriching experience when we met groups from both communities at the interface. We came away with a sense that a good deal of progress has been made and then on 3 December, a few weeks later, things changed. We know from the people we met from both communities that even at an interface level there is an overwhelming desire to progress. We as a committee would like to acknowledge the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland. We also would like to articulate the desire of this committee to act as a facilitator in a way that allows the representatives of their group and other groups the space to come before this committee and give their interpretation of the situation and to show a generosity of spirit for all communities and people who can offer constructive proposals. That is the view of this committee. We are delighted that the representatives are here today and we look forward to their presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I must suspend the sitting as there is a vote. We do not have an acting Chairman. If Mr. Roberts is agreeable, we will suspend the proceedings.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	There are such unexpected events in politics.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Two or three members have indicated that they wish to ask questions.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Perhaps Mr. Roberts could address Deputy Feighan's concerns.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Roberts. Unless anyone else wishes to add anything, we will bring the session to a close. I note in conclusion that the joint committee appreciates Mr. Roberts's attendance. Were there a blueprint for coming up with a solution to many of the problems on this island, it would already have been rolled out. However, to an extent, the blueprint we have is the Good Friday Agreement. We take Mr. Roberts's point about the Irish reputation. With the instantaneous nature of media and its international access, it is not just television, one can check on YouTube and one can readily view incidents that have taken place over the past month or more. Something that is happening in Belfast, or Pat Doherty's constituency in Castlederg, or in Derry affects the whole island. That is how seriously we take this particular crisis at the moment. We do not feel, as a committee, that we have the solutions. However, the committee has agreed to provide an opportunity to community, business and political groups on either side of the Border to offer their observations and solutions. We feel strongly that there is a sense of urgency about this, so we need to act proactively. The committee is a North-South implementation body with a diverse membership. We have an appetite not alone to facilitate but also to be with and show our support for the people of Northern Ireland who are affected by these incidents. In acknowledging that trust has been broken to a degree, there are still trust lines that have been built up since the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. The committee is confident that things will improve in future, but we are not naive enough to believe that things will work out on their own. There will have to be different interventions including, as Mr. Roberts said, at a political level. People are also working closely at community level and I acknowledge the work of everyone who is doing such work at the interfaces, including religious leaders who have been involved proactively in recent weeks. We wish Mr. Roberts well in his own efforts and campaigns. We are delighted that he came down here today. The committee wishes to demonstrate its support for him and his colleagues.  Over the years, people have said that we cannot be complacent about the peace process. Complacency is back on the agenda but we will certainly not be complacent. We are offering our support and the good offices of this committee as a vehicle or mechanism for other groups to meet with us. We look forward to hearing their suggestions and observations. We will continue to pursue that path in future.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the joint committee, I thank Mr. Roberts most sincerely for travelling and being with us today and for his helpful engagement.
