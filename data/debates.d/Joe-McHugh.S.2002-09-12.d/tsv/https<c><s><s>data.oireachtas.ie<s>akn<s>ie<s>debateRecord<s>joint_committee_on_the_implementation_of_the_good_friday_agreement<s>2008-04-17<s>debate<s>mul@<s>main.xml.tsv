JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank everyone who has been involved in the process over recent years.  I thank the Taoiseach for his genuine efforts to bring us to where we are today.  To borrow his slogan from the last election, this committee finds itself having to take the next steps.  There is plenty of work for it to do and I look forward to the participation of all representatives, including those from the Unionist tradition.Let me focus on economics.  We will not have an economic plan for our country if we do not have an inclusive debate.  The Taoiseach mentioned the â‚¬580 million for the A5-N2 road.  When the project is completed, I have no doubt the Taoiseach will be using the road to come to Downings on holiday, as he has done in the past.On the making of announcements on new roads or innovation funds, we are not in the business of playing catch-up any more in the north west and Cavan-Monaghan.  In saying "the north west", I include Pat Doherty's area west of the Bann.  We have been neglected historically and traditionally by central government, be it in London or Dublin.  The challenge is to achieve proper, balanced regional development.  I, as a politician, do not advocate the business of playing catch-up.  We must put the neglected regions to the forefront in terms of competitiveness and we must introduce proper next-generation broadband and whatever else is required to stimulate the economy.  Playing catch-up is not good enough and this is a challenge for the committee.  I look forward to working with the Chairman because we are involved now in the serious business of economic generation.
