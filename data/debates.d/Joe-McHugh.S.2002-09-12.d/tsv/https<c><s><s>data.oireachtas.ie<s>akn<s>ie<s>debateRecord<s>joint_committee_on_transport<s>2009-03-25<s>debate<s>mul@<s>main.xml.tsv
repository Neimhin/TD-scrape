JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation.  I wish to raise a parochial point with which the representative from east Derry, and maybe others, will be familiar.  Derry city is the fourth largest city on the island and Conor Murphy is on record, with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, as stating that if a feasibility study is done and if there is proof that it satisfies the cost benefit analysis he will lend his support to a light rail system from Derry city, servicing the suburbs which extend into east Inishowen as far as Manorcunningham and Letterkenny.  Will Mr. Cobain and his committee lend their weight to this possibility?  We have already targeted moneys to carry out the feasibility study, without putting pressure on any organisation that intends to provide it.
