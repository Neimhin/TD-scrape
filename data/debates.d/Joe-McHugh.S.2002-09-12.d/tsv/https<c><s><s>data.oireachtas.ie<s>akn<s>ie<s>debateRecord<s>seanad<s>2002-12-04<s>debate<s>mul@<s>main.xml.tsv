JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In deference to the Leader of the House, I will be parochial. This is a bad day. The situation we are discussing has come about over the past two years, not just today. The reins of the economic horse should have been pulled back then, rather than leaving it until now.With regard to Donegal, there is nothing happening in terms of additional investment in roads and other infrastructural projects. It appears we may only receive â‚¬5 million from the National Roads Authority this year. There was a contradictory announcement about Letterkenny becoming a gateway for additional investment under the national spatial strategy. I cannot see that happening. For the peripheral counties, including Senator Dooley's county of Clare, this is a bad budget and, in that context, we will return in tomorrow's debate on the national spatial strategy.
