JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I will answer the question. I assume the focus of the Deputy's question is recent public comment relating to the role of the lead consultant in the multi-agency transboundary programme of research and the potential impacts on the environment and human health from unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects. This research programme is administered by the EPA and co-funded by the EPA, my Department and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, with oversight from a broad-based steering committee that includes representatives from my Department. As is usual in major and broad-ranging projects, the project team involves a wide range of expert institutions and companies. CDM Smith is the lead consultant in the consortium engaged to carry out the programme of research. The consortium includes the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster University, Amec Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors, each offering a particular specialism required by the project scope. I understand that the contract for this programme of research was awarded following a robust evaluation process in compliance with public procurement guidelines and that the tender submitted by the consortium headed by CDM Smith was evaluated as being the strongest bid. I am aware that there has been some comment on the fact that internationally CDM Smith has provided expert advice to oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources. However, CDM Smith has also provided advice to State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is common that a broad range of parties will seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There are legitimate concerns, which are shared by the Minister, Deputy White, and me. The former Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, also shared those concerns in 2011 when he made the decision to begin the process. The EPA is independent and I have tremendous confidence in it to do a job like this. There was a procurement process and CDM Smith won the tender. We can use all sorts of terms such as "leading", "co-ordinating", "heading up a team" or whatever.  I have confidence not alone in the EPA but in the steering group. I have tremendous confidence in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Health Service Executive, An Bord Plean√°la, the Northern Ireland Environment Agency and the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland. A collaborative effort is taking place to get the research right and to ensure we are informed and that any future decisions will be informed ones. That is the important thing. No reputational damage has been done to the EPA. It has been very consistent and focused in ensuring the two pillars of the research, namely, environment and human health, are addressed. A public consultation process took place. The Deputy referred to Queen's University Belfast. For the purposes of the public record, it was confirmed that the university was initially participating as part of the research consortium. Due to a change in the resources available in the university, the tasks allocated to it were transferred to CDM Smith, supported by GSNI. The university is still involved, and it is important to point that out, as part of the internal review process carried out by the consortium.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There is cross-party concern. The Deputy's constituency colleagues, Deputy Tony McLoughlin and Senator Michael Comiskey, have reflected local concerns. We have to give responsibility to the EPA. No organisation is better equipped to examine the environmental impact of the process.I have confidence in the stakeholders I have listed - I will not list them again - to ensure this is a collaborative approach that they conduct the proper research and that they are given sufficient resources to do so. Too often the public says politicians make decisions without investigation or research and without ensuring they know what they are making a decision on. Politicians will be making a decision based on informed investigation. That is why I have confidence in this process. It is important we ensure there is a collaborative effort.
