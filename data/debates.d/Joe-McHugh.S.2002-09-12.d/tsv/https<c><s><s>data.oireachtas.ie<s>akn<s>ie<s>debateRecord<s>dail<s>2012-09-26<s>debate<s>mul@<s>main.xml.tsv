JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, to the House. I have correspondence from a party colleague, Councillor Mickey Doherty, regarding his and his community's concerns with the switchover to Saorview on 24 October. Included is a petition of 25 names representing Meenavanaghan, Cross, The Cloghan and Lemacrossan in an area of east Inishowen besides Quigley's Point. The demographics of the area show 75% of the community is elderly. The advice from Saorview is that once the switchover happens on 24 October, these communities will not be capable of receiving television coverage through Saorview. They have been advised to apply through Saorsat which will take upwards of 12 months to get, as well as an additional â‚¬170. I do not believe that is a fair option or solution for the people living in these communities. The local television experts have done their research into the availability of television coverage in these geographical pockets. The existing mast in the area is not part of the Saorview upgrade. Even the largest television mast in Buncrana will be no good as an option. RTE will recommission some of the masts in Glenties and Clonmany, to ensure coverage in these areas. Saorview is of the opinion that channel 45 from Moville will suffice but I do not believe that will be a feasible option. I do not know what research the Minister's officials have done into this matter at this early stage. The information the Minister will make available this afternoon may not reassure the communities in question. Accordingly, will his officials investigate this particular issue in depth? It may be a micro-issue and could be repeated in other parts. My colleague, Councillor Doherty, believes this is an issue of great concern to the communities in question. Up to 75% of the population in them are elderly. From a fairness and community point of view, as well as preventing rural isolation, television is a necessary communication mechanism. If the Minister does not have an update on the matter today, will he use his offices to research this issue because it concerns a great number of people in east Inishowen?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the research the Minister of State and his Department have done in this subject. He has provided options. Locally, there are concerns and what we are trying to do here is reassure people. There seem to be options albeit more expensive ones which comes back to the fairness issue. If this continues to be an issue, I acknowledge there is an option for the Minister to pass it on to RTENL. Sometimes we take for granted certain services. There is a concern that if Saorsat is not in an area, it could take 12 months to commission. I welcome the fact the Minister is keeping an open line. I accept he does not have a direct influence with RTE but at the same time, people do bump into each other and they could highlight an issue. Those from Meenavanaghan, Cross and Lemacrossan who did not get tickets for last Sunday's all-Ireland football final watched it on their old television sets with excellent coverage.
