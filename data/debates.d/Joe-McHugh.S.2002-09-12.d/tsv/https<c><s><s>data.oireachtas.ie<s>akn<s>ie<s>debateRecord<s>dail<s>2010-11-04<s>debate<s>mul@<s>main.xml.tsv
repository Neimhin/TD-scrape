JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This has been the longest build up to a by-election that I have been involved in.  As Deputy McGinley said, we have our plans in place.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Our candidate, Barry O'Neill, is knocking on doors at the moment in Ballyshannon.  We will be making an effort to reflect on what has not been happening in Donegal South-West.  Mr. O'Neill will be challenging the Government on health issues as well as job creation.  Unfortunately, Mr. O'Neill's worthwhile opinions and worthy policy initiatives that he has been pushing for on Donegal County Council have not been reflected in Government policy.  This will be an opportunity for him to continue with his campaign, working closely with the sitting Member, Deputy McGinley.  He will articulate a strong message that jobs can be created in Donegal in future.  Barry O'Neill will be a strong voice and it is important for Donegal South-West that that message will be clear come polling day on 25 November.When a student was not pulling in the right direction, an old geography teacher of mine used to say "Your life is hanging by a thread".  This Government is now hanging by a thread.Unfortunately, the right thing to do would have been to have these by-elections out of the way.  We should not even be here discussing this issue.  Serious business of the House on economic matters should be undertaken but, unfortunately, as they say on the other side of the House, "We are where we are" and we must take the next steps.
