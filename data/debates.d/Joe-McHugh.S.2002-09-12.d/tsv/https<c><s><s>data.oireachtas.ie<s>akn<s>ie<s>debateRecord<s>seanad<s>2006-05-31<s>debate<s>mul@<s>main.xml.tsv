JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to the House again tonight. He is a busy man as he was also here last night on the Adjournment. The Minister of State is probably aware of the high profile campaign on cancer services which has been ongoing for some time in the north west. The campaign covers retention of current cancer services and also considers the expansion of a range of ancillary cancer services for the people of the north west. I will not cover old ground I have previously covered with the Minister of State. As he is aware, proposals have been made for radiotherapy centres in Waterford and Limerick. We have existing services in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The north west is completely disenfranchised in terms of an equitable radiotherapy service. We are aware of arrangements with Belfast for patients from County Donegal, with the proviso that bed space must be available. However, Northern Ireland has a jurisdiction that caters for 1.5 million people. Belfast is not and will not be a centre to cater for the needs of the people of the north west. It is incumbent, therefore, on the Government to provide a satellite radiation centre in the north west because it is pivotal to the needs of the people there. It would cost â‚¬15 million to set up the centre. A key meeting will take place on 6 June between administrators of Altnagelvin, Galway and Letterkenny hospitals to discuss the potential of sharing services and the permanent appointment of a breast consultant surgeon in the north west.At primary level, breast screening is not provided in the region. Donegal women do not have that luxury or option similar to women in the east. At secondary level, the appointment of a permanent breast consultant surgeon at Letterkenny General Hospital is urgently needed and this call is being echoed loudly and clearly by the people of Donegal. Recently, a demonstration took place in the town on a wet Sunday afternoon. More than 15,000 people turned up to highlight their frustration and anger and to demand equitable health services for their peers and families in the region. A radiation service must be provided at tertiary level. A satellite radiation unit is needed, which could operate on an east-west basis between Altnagelvin and Letterkenny hospitals and which could also incorporate Galway and Sligo hospitals.Cancer patients are acutely aware that all specialist services cannot be sporadically provided throughout the State on a piecemeal basis. People appreciate such services must be located centrally where the expertise is available. All we are looking for in the north west is a level playing field and appropriate cancer services. Will the Minister of State intervene prior to the meeting on 6 June? The Minister for Health and Children visited Letterkenny last Monday and stated there would be an outcome after 23 June. However, between now and then, we need to know where we stand regarding the facilities that will be provided in the region.A range of people are involved in this process. Ultimately the patient is the key part of the equation but the Government and the administrative and nursing staff and consultants are also involved. What is the consultants' favoured option regarding the relationship between Letterkenny, Altnagelvin, Galway and Sligo hospitals? We need to know where the consultants and the Government stand because nobody is standing at the moment. Everybody is sitting down and they are not delivering. A pathway needs to be found so we know where we are going in this regard.
