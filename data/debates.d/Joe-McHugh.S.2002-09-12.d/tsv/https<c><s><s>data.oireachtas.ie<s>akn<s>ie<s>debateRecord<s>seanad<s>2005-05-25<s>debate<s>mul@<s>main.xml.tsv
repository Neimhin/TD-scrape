JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. We first debated this matter in May of last year and we should continue to do so to keep up-to-date, focus and undertake research in this area.CNN and Fox News broadcast a simplified version of the Iraq war as a war on terror whereas Senator Norris believes the war was about oil and money. An in-depth examination of any war will reveal multiple root causes rather than one simplistic cause; the same is the case for the war in Iraq. It is easy for organisations like CNN and Fox News to come up with a simplified focus because they want to ingrain a message in the subconscious of their audience, which they seem to have achieved in regard to the vast majority of the population in the United States.The multiple causes of war include ethnic-cultural, ideological, economic, territorial and environmental factors. We must keep an open mind as to what caused this war, as well as examining all the causes involved. This is especially so given the experience of war in this country. We should be mindful of the important point raised by Senator Minihan, namely, how numb we have become in regard to the news reports of war.Living in Donegal, I am often subjected to BBC and UTV news reports. On a daily basis throughout the 1980s, I was subjected to news reports about booby-trap bombs, incendiary devices and Protestants, Catholics and British soldiers being killed. To be honest, one develops an immunity to that type of news. There is a probably an explanation for this, although I do not know whether it is a natural human condition. As Senator Minihan explained, one becomes numb to certain news which is what happened to us in Ireland with regard to people being killed, bombed and shot. We took it for granted that this was a way of life and what we had to deal with. The same has happened with regard to the situation in Iraq in that it is no longer news. The entire world media was located in Iraq this time last year and right through the summer. Subsequently it focused on the US for the elections there, and then on the countries affected by the tsunami. The current media reports from Iraq are minimal and concerned with British and American soldiers being killed there. The coverage is maintained as low-key. It is important that we as legislators and politicians keep the debate going because we will not get transparent viewpoints if we rely on the world media.The Iraq war cannot be considered in isolation. We must look at the conflict in Afghanistan and the motivation of the US in that regard, which relates to Afghanistan's centrality. It is a strategic and central location of which the US is very mindful in terms of access to oil and gas reserves. I am not saying this on a whim, because evidence exists to support this assertion. In 1999 the US National Security Council noted:The United States will continue to have a vital interest in ensuring access to foreign oil supplies . . . we must continue to be mindful of the need for regional stability and security in key producing areas to ensure our access to, and the free flow of, these resources.Afghanistan is also part of the Iraqi debate. It posits the territorial argument as a cause of war and a fundamental part of the overall debate regarding the Middle and Far East. There is vital economic interest in respect of US companies building gas pipelines in Afghanistan. Legitimate trade is taking place in the central location of Afghanistan in terms of oil and gas supplies. However, Americans focus on the issue of illegitimate trade of narcotics and arms of which we must also be conscious.The situation in Iraq has generated much interest. The outcome of the American elections proves that Americans are divided on the issue. The same was proven in respect of the UK elections which showed the British are also divided. We are mature enough in that the debate has evolved and we are neither pro nor anti-American because America is split down the middle in terms of its opinion on Iraq. We meet US citizens all over the world and here in our own country. I have considerable contact with quite a number of Americans through politics and also with those who have come to live here. A large percentage of Americans are nomadic in nature. Many of those I meet are embarrassed by the situation in Iraq and by President George W. Bush. They refer to him as an idiot. On the other hand, there are people sitting in houses in Ohio who think he is a great man and world leader. This divided opinion was reflected in the votes.On the matter of oil reserves, in 1980 former US President Jimmy Carter declared that any attempt by hostile powers to cut off Persian Gulf oil supplies would be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the US. This relates to the environmental needs in respect of gas and oil supplies.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The word was used by people I met on the tour circuit. I was quoting US citizens who imparted their opinion that the US President was an idiot.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am transferring, through the political process, the opinion of others.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does the Chair wish me to withdraw the reference?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Chair has much more experience than I.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will withdraw it.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I was simply passing on the message from people I have met who would be of a Democratic Party disposition.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Acting Chairman for his intervention. I appreciate that he has much more experience than I in this regard. The situation in Iraq is serious, as is that in Northern Ireland. We have tried everything and are faced with a grave problem in Iraq. A solution will not be found overnight or in the short or medium term. We must weigh up every aspect and angle, including UN intervention. At the outset of this debate one year ago, my ambition was for the UN to be sent in and not the US. However, that might not have worked and the Iraqi people might have regarded the UN as an imperial power. We might have faced the same democratic deficit and war as is currently the case. Should we look at a UN composition of Muslims or one that reflects a broad range of Sunni and Shia Muslims and Kurds? We should consider every possible aspect in order to move the situation forward.Returning to the issue of Northern Ireland, we cannot get the DUP, Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the UUP to sit around a table and form a power-sharing executive. However, we would regard ourselves in Northern Ireland as a more civilised environment than Iraq. The situation will not be resolved overnight and requires further debate and whatever intervention is necessary.We are currently faced with a capital imperialism, a contradictory fusion of the politics of state and empire and the molecular processes of capital accumulation in space and time. Many people advocate a debate on the major environmental and territorial causes of war. It is not a simple war on terror or one regarding oil and gas. Rather it is a question of resources. Michael T. Klare argues: "As shortages of critical materials rise in frequency and severity, the competition for access to the remaining supplies of these commodities will grow more intense". That is something on which the Minister of State might dwell.Population increase and economic development in different parts of the world mean that demand for resources is expanding at a faster rate than nature can accommodate. It is estimated that two thirds of the world's known petroleum reserves will be consumed in the next 20 years. The result will be temporary or chronic shortages in different parts of the world.War is not just about money or making a simplistic connection in terms of 11 September, Iraq and al-Qaeda. The causes are ethnic, cultural, ideological, environmental and economic. This is a major debate and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it. Long may the debate continue.
