JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas as ucht an chuiridh teacht go dtí an Seanad inniu. I am delighted to be in the House to present this statement. The work of the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, a division of my Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, covers a vast scope. It acts as the national earth science agency. Its remit is to conduct geological surveys to assist in the sustainable development of our natural resources. It provides a wealth of information and scientific knowledge, free for all citizens and me as Minister of State, and independent scientific advice and data on a wide range of topics, from mapping of the Irish seabed to protecting public wells to mapping landslide susceptibility to remote sensing of subsidence and other natural hazards. Much of the subsurface of the country is a mystery to the majority of its citizens, yet much of the economy is based on it or impacts on it. The geology, or the ground beneath our feet, is where we grow our food, extract sands, gravels and stone for building, from where we pump our water for drinking supplies, and mine for lead and zinc. It is also the unseen space where we place much of our waste into landfill, where man-made pollution ends up, and from where naturally occurring hazards like landslides, sinkholes and radon gases originate. The GSI covers all these aspects and more, and impacts through collaboration with Government partners, providing guidance in the planning processes, supporting education and outreach, de-risking investment into Ireland for exploration, supporting indigenous SMEs and providing guidance and steering of third level research. To put the work in context, let me describe and outline the economic scope of geoscience in Ireland. Near the height of the boom, in 2006, the value of the geoscience sector to the economy was put at €4.24 billion, some 3% of GDP, contributing significantly to the building, energy, mining and environmental services sectors. A more recent independent study of the minerals industry alone puts the value of that sector at a still significant €800 million per annum, representing 1,400 jobs, largely in rural areas. Given that context, let me explain the role of the Geological Survey of Ireland. Its primary function is to map the rocks, subsoils and minerals of Ireland, both onshore and offshore. It makes high-quality digital and paper maps available to the public and professionals. I would like to stress that all of the digital data, information and knowledge gathered by the GSI on our national geology is available free of charge, on its and my Department's websites, probably one of the most significant and diverse bodies of knowledge freely made available by the State to all of its citizens and beyond. The GSI also has a very active education and outreach programme which is built around successful products, explaining Irish geology and its natural resources, and aimed at primary, secondary and third level students and their teachers. Increasingly, I am delighted to say these are being produced bilingually and support the education of geography and geology in the Irish language. I had the pleasure last week to launch a number of these Irish language products at one of our newest gaelscoil, Coláiste Ailigh in Letterkenny.Is treoir shothuigthe staidéir é an foilseachán "An Gheolaíocht ó Bhun go Barr" faoi na bunphróisis gheolaíocha agus thíreolaíocha a bhaineann le hÉirinn. Tá sé fíorúsáideach d'iarbhunscoileanna agus beidh sé an-úsáideach do dhaltaí meánscoile sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di. Beidh sé fíorluachmhar do dhaoine fásta ar mhaith leo foghlaim faoi stair nádúrtha na hÉireann agus a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú ag an am céanna. The publication of "An Gheolaíocht ó Bhun go Barr" as an accessible study guide to the basic geological and geographical processes relevant to Ireland is particularly useful for post-primary schools. It will be of great use to secondary school pupils in the Gaeltacht and outside it. It will also be of immense value to adults who will be able to learn about the natural history of Ireland while improving their Irish. I am going to make the book available to all Senators. Perhaps they might share it with their constituents in bunscoileanna and meánscoileanna. Tá ceann do gach aon duine sa lucht éisteachta. I would like to speak briefly about the Tellus project. Many Senators from Border counties might recall the aircraft that flew low over the countryside to collect geophysical data in recent years. This was done as part of the Tellus Border project. The airborne survey was just one component of the project. Extensive land-based sampling and geochemical analysis of soils, sediments and stream waters was also conducted, with a range of sponsored applied research on the data. The Tellus Border phase was conducted with the assistance of €5 million in INTERREG funding from the Special EU Programmes Body. It was delivered in partnership with the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland, Dundalk Institute of Technology and Queen’s University Belfast. The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources subsequently committed funding of €1.5 million for 2014 and €3 million for 2015 to continue the Tellus programme into other areas. The north midlands region of Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath is being surveyed, with data to be released early next year. The Geological Survey of Ireland's largest endeavour is the programme of integrated mapping for the sustainable development of Ireland's marine resource, known as INFOMAR. The aim of this national marine mapping programme is to complete the surveying of all of Ireland's marine territory by 2026. This programme which is funded by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is managed by the Geological Survey of Ireland in conjunction with the Marine Institute. A major milestone will be reached next year when the first phase of inshore mapping is completed. The mapping results are applied across a range of sectors including safety, environment, fisheries, energy, infrastructure and heritage. Other applications include research, EU collaboration and, critically, support of Ireland's claims for sovereignty over its marine territory. INFOMAR which is acknowledged internationally as a world-class example of best practice has been listed in Ireland's integrated marine plan, Harnessing our Ocean Wealth, as a key enabler of blue growth. Like any long-term Government programme, INFOMAR is periodically externally reviewed. It has consistently returned a positive benefit-to-cost ratio, which has estimated a return on the project of four to six times its cost. The programme received Government approval in 2013 to continue at the current level of €3 million per annum until 2018 at least. Such provision has been made in my Department's budget. I will describe briefly the Geological Survey of Ireland's environmental, planning and safety initiatives. It carries out mapping that is targeted at the development of specific planning tools and initiatives to support public safety. These tools and initiatives which are of vital use to planners and local authorities include the programme of groundwater mapping for the protection of the underground aquifers that provide over 20% of Ireland's water supplies. This programme works closely with the Environmental Protection Agency and has been critical in Irish compliance with the EU water framework directive. The Geological Survey of Ireland also has a strong role in research. It supports research through data, expertise, partnering and funding across a range of programmes. For example, it managed the Griffith geoscience research awards between 2007 and 2014. This major programme which was funded by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources provided almost €10 million across the island of Ireland for research in the sector. It is considered a major success in terms of building capacity. This is best demonstrated by the recent successful award by Science Foundation Ireland of €24 million, in the six years from 2015 to 2021, for a new Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geoscience. Work in this area is being targeted on a number of research spokes, namely raw materials, marine geoscience, groundwater, hydrocarbons and big data. This research is supported by platforms of enabling technologies such as 3D models, new sensing equipment and accurate laboratories. The stated aim of the research centre is to help unlock Ireland's natural resources, contribute to securing supply of energy and safe water and educate and improve understanding of geosciences. The Irish Centre for Research in Applied Geoscience which will include strong involvement and support from the natural resources divisions of my Department has the potential to put Ireland on the map as a location for world-class geoscience research. I wish to refer to a relatively new and innovative GSI programme in the area of job creation. In addition to provision of maps, data and advice for development and planning, the GSI is also involved in a programme targeted at creation and retention of jobs in its sector. Geoscience Ireland is a business cluster of Irish based companies providing geological and related services who are collaborating to win work overseas. The cluster, comprising 22 companies, is managed by the GSI with assistance from Enterprise Ireland and has worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Initiatives undertaken include training, attendance at trade fairs, group branding and promotion. Critically, to date the 22 companies have added 145 jobs in the period since they joined the cluster in 2013. I thank the House and the Members for giving me this opportunity to share with them some of the activities under my area of responsibility. I trust they will have found it both informative and interesting to get this update into an area of Government activity that may not be often in the spotlight or news, but I also hope they will agree with me as to the fundamental need for Government support for such strong, independent and scientifically valid endeavours, given their economic impact and safety importance. Obviously, they will have questions and I will do my best to engage with them on the issues relevant to their areas of interest. I acknowledge the endeavours of my officials, coming from a perspective where I spent my time learning geography at secondary level and at university level and then teaching geography. As a resource I probably had one geography book with which to try to enthuse my students on a daily basis, which was not easy, as I tried to talk about Pangaea and the theory of continental drift and the excitement of metamorphic rocks, sedimentary rocks and so on. It was difficult. However, I wish to note that within the Department there is a new energy and a new enthusiasm which works in a number of ways. There is a relationship between the education sector and the officials in the Department and industry. It is a three-way working relationship. The enthusiasm of the people in the Department who are tasked with this responsibility is as a result of this new thinking and new type of collaboration. I encourage Members to go out with this new bilingual book on the geological mapping of Ireland. It is interesting and will be of interest to primary and secondary school teachers.

JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Acting Chairman. I must be careful about where my political career started.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Acting Chairman is correct to note that I am a former Senator. As I recall a debate in this Chamber on whether a person was a former distinguished Member or a distinguished former Member, this is a place in which to have a debate to discuss matters. I acknowledge the contributions of Members and it certainly was not simply a case of making contributions and asking questions.A few of the Members have made suggestions which I will take on board and wish to note.  Senator Mark Daly focused in his contribution on the very real concerns people have about fracking. It is important that I am prescriptive in stating Government policy on this issue. There is no and will be no fracking while an Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, survey is ongoing. The EPA survey is linking with Government agencies and Irish universities and also those of Northern Ireland; therefore, there will be a heavy reliance on expertise, information and education on North-South, intergovernmental and educational bases. This is important because the survey will last at least two years. I have spoken at length to my officials about this. I do not want a situation to develop where there is a vacuum for a period of two years in a survey which started in August this year. I wish to build into this research and have the conversation continue on an internal political level. Through this House and the Dáil, I hope we can, at some stage or at various stages, have an input into the study and find out what its current position is and the direction in which it is going. Senator John Whelan asked what the current position is. We need to ensure the input of this House because there are very real concerns at a community level. I have met many groups, including groups in counties Leitrim and Sligo. The Minister for Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, and I met a delegation from Cavan and Leitrim County Councils. We take their concerns very seriously and the two pillars of the research focus on environmental and human health issues.  I agree with Senator John Whelan that this is a small country. This is not Russia or the wild plains of Dakota. We have to take archaeology, geology, heritage, flora, and fauna - every single element - into account in this study to ensure a proper investigation is carried out. We need to ensure the proper advice is given to people who will make the necessary decision when it arrives on their desk. It will not be my decision. It is a decision that is at least two years down the line. However, it is important that we have a mechanism to feed into that conversation.  Senator Mark Daly is correct in saying that there has to be a connect between community and business. I am open to suggestions he has on this issue.  Senator Martin Conway who comes from County Clare made reference to the correlation between history and geography. As a geography student, I spent time in County Clare exploring its flora and fauna and all other aspects of the geological bounty at the disposal of the local people, in particular the Burren and the Cliffs of Moher. We will do whatever we can to share the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, research, to promote the linkage between university, the Government and community and to share the economic and tourism benefits that might follow.  Senator Martin Conway made the point about making information understandable. This is key and critical, as sometimes we get bogged down in jargon. Before taking office in my Department, I had the possibly stereotypical predisposition towards geology that it cannot be made exciting. I wondered how we could excite and engage primary and second-level students in it. We do it by bringing the information to them in an understandable way. I acknowledge the work of Glenveagh National Park in this regard. No doubt there will be other projects, for instance in County Kerry where Senator Ned O'Sullivan is from, where the national parks, our rich heritage, archaeology and landscape are shared with schools through school trips. Students will be brought to the areas to learn in an interactive way.  Senator Martin Conway also mentioned preventive measures when referring to flooding issues in County Clare in the past few years. The engagement between the OPW, local authorities and different agencies in trying to prevent future flooding is key and my Department is central to this task.  Labhair an Seandóir Ó Clochartaigh faoin leabhar geolaíochta agus an ceangail agus an nasc idir an stair agus an tíreolaíocht. He made the point about regarding Ireland in its proper context. Ireland is the fourth largest country in Europe. We should make a concerted effort to get that information and message out there. In terms of our sea basin, we are fourth in size after France, Spain and Portugal. It is an immense resource. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is involved in a big partnership in terms of our ocean's wealth, into which my Department is feeding. I acknowledge the INFOMAR project again and its research. Senator Terry Brennan has been out off County Louth. It is invaluable work, as the resources are available. It is not just about oil and gas. There is momentum in terms of companies looking at the potential for exploration drilling. However, we have to look at the magnitude of the basin in perspective. Saying this is the fourth largest country in Europe puts the matter in perspective.  Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh raised the possibility of linkages between na hollsoileanna i Mheiriceá agus na ceantair Gaeltachta i gConamara. If there are potential linkages which the Senator considers we in the Department can explore, we will sit down with him and look at these possibilities.  In terms of geothermal and geoscience technologies, we are all on the same page when looking at potential alternative sources of energy and not just relying on a few different sources. There has been a lot of research into tidal and geothermal energies. If my departmental officials could add to the conversation, that would be helpful. The possibility of a State-owned petroleum company was also mentioned. It is suggested in the Wood Mackenzie report that at some stage we look at the possibility of having a State-owned company. I do not think we are at that stage yet. In terms of the development stage, we have had four successes. Are we at a stage, as a nation, to invest perhaps €100 million in a drill which might not be successful? In terms of the developmental stage and our current position, we are going in the right direction and, at some point in the future, the suggestion in the Wood Mackenzie report should be considered.  Senator Trevor Ó Clochartaigh also raised his concerns about fracking. I have dealt with those concerns.  Senator John Whelan has asked how geography, science, the geological surveys and all of the information that we collate feeds into decisions? That is a legitimate question. For example, if we look at the mistakes in building houses on flood plains, we must ask was the appropriate information available? It probably was not. Is the information available now? A lot of the information from the GSI research will be invaluable in building houses on flood plains, which has been a disaster for many.  On the connection between our history as a people and the landscape, I am finding out more and more about my local area while on my own journey re-learning Irish. There are Irish placenames with connotations or references to flood plains.If we had that knowledge even through language, we would not have built those houses in the first place. The Senator raised a legitimate question about information not being used in the proper context. He also asked how all this information feeds into the decision and into local authorities, what happens when it goes to An Bord Pleanála and what information the board uses. The work going on in my Department and the resources available to us through the Tellus project will be key to decisions local authorities will have to make. It will also be key to have the OPW involved. I have covered the Senator's concerns about fracking. There are fears around timelines. I was prompted by him to put on record that ongoing engagement is needed. I am sure he will avail of the opportunity in the new year. At some stage in the new year, I will seek to examine what has been happening and what has been found through the EPA research. I will demand that we have an opportunity in both Houses to continue the debate because there are concerns. Once I took up this post in the middle of the summer, there was a debate about my Gaeltacht portfolio, but people in counties Leitrim, Sligo, Fermanagh and Cavan did not overlook the fact that I had responsibility for this area. I will, therefore, ensure the conversation continues. Senator John Kelly also asked about EirGrid and surveys in the context of subsidence within distances of between 40 and 50 miles. I will seek the information on that matter because it comes under the auspices of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. If surveys of subsidence have been conducted in the context of EirGrid developments, I will check it.  The Senator also referred to focusing on wind energy, not other forms of energy. A conversation has taken place in recent years about moving into one area or another, but we need a mix. There is no single quick fix to the country's energy needs. I have a keen interest in the ongoing work and research on tidal and wave energy, but, at the same time, we must consider a mixed basket in order that we do not become too reliant on one energy form or another. Senator Terry Brennan referred to the information I had provided on GDP and how much of a benefit this was to the economy. Since I took up this job, I have learned about the benefit to the economy of the likes of Navan Mines. It is the largest zinc producer in Europe. Perhaps we are not getting the message across. Navan Mines contributes 2.2% of the world's zinc production and 0.8% of the world's lead production. It is massive and I would like to acknowledge all the people involved in all the companies engaged in lead and zinc extraction. There is momentum in the industry. There are 634 prospecting licences. The message from my Department is there is an enthusiasm in this regard. Ireland is open for business in terms of lead and zinc extraction. The Senator also alluded to the Tellus project and its benefits as well as his concerns about fracking. He will no doubt keep me on my toes to ensure we have a debate in 2015 in both Houses on where we are in the context of the research. At one stage, Ireland was the fourth largest country in Europe, which is phenomenal. When I met people from Newfoundland in the past few weeks, they pointed out that they were interested in the west of Ireland because during Pangaea, we were all locked together. They are coming across the same tectonic patterns and sharing information. As the Senator said, all the research and information the GSI is getting from Tellus is publicly available. Schools and business can access it and it is available to the Government, which is beneficial. Gabhaim buíochas arís leis an Seanad as ucht an chuiridh a thabhairt dom teacht anseo. Tá mé thar a bheith sásta leis an díospóireacht mhaith a bhí againn um thráthnóna. Tá suim mhór agam sa cheangal atá ann idir an mheánscoil agus an bhunscoil. Tá daoine sa Roinn Cumarsáide, Fuinnimh agus Acmhainní Nádúrtha ag obair ar an ábhar seo. Mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le mo chuid oifigeach - mo chomhghleacaithe - sa Roinn sin. Tá iarrachtaí móra á ndéanamh acu leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun tosaigh. Ba mhaith liom arís mo chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh leo. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach arís.
