JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be very brief, a Chathaoirligh, as I know you are under pressure. In response to what Senator Ó Murchú said, I acknowledge that he was brave during the debate on the Iraqi war more than a year ago. He was brave in conscientiously speaking out on behalf of his constituents against the war in Iraq be it morally or otherwise. We, as a party, believe the UN represented the way forward and I am glad that Senator Mooney has backtracked and agreed with this.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I would like to expand further on Senator Ó Murchú's point in stating the Americans must acknowledge their responsibility. The British must also acknowledge their responsibility. As one brought up close to the Border, I know that some British soldiers in Northern Ireland were involved in internment, interrogation and arresting and abusing innocent people. Any true democrat in this country who backed the British involvement in the war in Iraq has blood on their hands.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, I pressed my button but nothing happened.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	There must be a technical problem.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was only just brought to my attention. I assumed it had worked. I had confidence in the system.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, will the Senator consider sharing his time if he finds this debate a complete waste of time?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Sinn Féin the Workers Party.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is flawed history from Senator Leyden.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will not respond to the items raised by Senator Leyden because they are not appropriate to the motion. However, I shall refer to something Senator Ross said about the economy and all the debates that have taken place on it. Senator Ross's viewpoint is simplistic. Every time he speaks about the economy, he speaks about the Government and what it will say and what the Opposition will say. All he mentions is income tax. I accept that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, and the Government have contributed to lowering the income tax band but there is more to the economy. I am glad the Minister is present. This is the first time I have had the opportunity to speak to him and I shall be selective in terms of the two issues I wish to raise.The Dyslexia Association of Ireland has 37 workshops and employs tutors to carry out essential services for those with dyslexia. On average, each of these workshops raise €30,000 per annum which is completely voluntary. It is raised locally and from the parents of children with dyslexia and from different fund raising activities. That is a direct failure of the Department of Education and Science. While it is not an issue for the Minister's Department, it is an issue for another day. In September 2004, there will be a call on the tutors to pay income tax on their earnings. That is fair enough. Anybody who earns income has to pay income tax. I asking the Minister to provide some form of subsidy or support for these workshops. They are charity organisations and the volunteers are fulfilling a service that should be provided by the Department of Education and Science.Senator Ross accused us of being selective for one reason. If Senator Leyden and his colleagues are confident that the economy is in a good state of health, there is no reason we cannot subsidise these workshops because these volunteers are being hammered and are faced with brick wall after brick wall. I met with a group from Letterkenny last night which is crying out for some form of support or acknowledgement of their work.The second item I wish to raise is non-residents accounts. I am not talking about tax evasion. I do not condone tax evasion and never will do so. I am referring to elderly people who have accounts in Northern Ireland and the UK, containing €5,000 or €6,000.A tax amnesty was introduced which was a good scheme to recover money from people who were laundering money or earning income illegally without paying tax. I ask the Minister and his Department to examine why the Revenue is looking for 230% on top of the penalties and the sums that must be repaid.I know of an elderly gentleman with €6,000 in an account in Northern Ireland and he must pay back the guts of €8,500 in penalties and interest. That is wrong and is an injustice to the elderly. This is a group of people who were not involved in tax evasion. They may have lodged a few pounds every year. Prior to 1987 and 1988 when the interest rates were high, they were the ones being crucified. The banks are charging these people €35 per hour to access information and that is wrong. Some accounts hold only €1,000, €1,500 or €2,000 and were set up to help put students through college. They are not bogus accounts. These people have not been involved in fraud or tax evasion. If Senator Leyden feels fully confident that the economy is in such a healthy state, why are these people being crucified? They are vulnerable people at the margins of society. Senator Ross spoke about income tax. This generation cannot further penalise those people because we owe them a debt.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I ask the Minister to consider some way in which his Department and the Government can intervene in this situation.I know of one man in Donegal who was hospitalised as a result of the pressure and stress of this serious situation. I am calling the Government's bluff regarding the good state of the State's finances. I ask the Minister to take this vulnerable section into consideration.If people are to be penalised for alleged wrongdoing in the period pre-1989, for simply opening an account in the North——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The holders are still liable for these penalties.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	If it is not declared in previous tax amnesties.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	These people are forced to employ bank staff and pay €35 an hour to access information to prove they have not been involved in tax evasion. This is a very strong issue on the canvass. People are very irate. The Government can intervene; the banks should not be the facilitators in this matter.If people are to be penalised for something as simple as having €3,000 or €4,000 in an account, who will be penalised regarding the handling of the €15 million Punchestown affair? I am not raising this matter because it is in the Minister's constituency. Who will be penalised for the mishandling of Punchestown and who will be penalised for the mishandling of e-voting and the €55 million incurred? The vulnerable have been punished consistently since 1997.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to the House. While I have raised a general matter concerning the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, ALAB, an autonomous body established by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I am specifically concerned about the application by Marine Harvest for a fish-farming site in County Donegal.This is a very straightforward issue. ALAB discussed the merits and demerits of the application. Although the board officially had a quorum, because all members were not present a balanced and definitive argument on the merits and demerits of the site were not forthcoming. I have a problem in that when the board was established each of the representatives came from different backgrounds within industry and the fishing sector. If the full representative group was not present to make a competent and comprehensive decision on that licence application for the salmon industry in County Donegal on behalf of Marine Harvest, the decision must be reviewed as must the role of ALAB in general.I look forward to the Minister's response. ALAB has been compared to An Bord Pleanála and there have been difficulties with that board as planning is also not a defined science. However, in order to make a competent decision on any issue concerning a licence application for fish farming we need all representative parties at the table.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response and welcome the fact that there will be a review. It is timely after five years. I accept that the Minister of State cannot respond in the House on specific applications due to his independent role. I ask him to try to find an opportunity to contact Marine Harvest in Fanad, County Donegal and, through his officials, to discuss its case.
