JoeMcHugh	Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	I acknowledge the Deputy's consistent approach to this matter which he is keeping live. I also acknowledge the work done by him and his constituency colleagues, Deputy Tony McLoughlin and Senator Michael Comiskey, who have had regular meetings with me to discuss this important matter. No doubt we will get into the Deputy's last question in a supplementary reply, but, first, I wish to respond to his initial question. I understand the contract for the unconventional gas exploration and extraction research programme was awarded following a robust evaluation process. The evaluation panel included personnel with the capacity to make informed decisions on the six tenders received. The constitution of the evaluation panel was approved by a broadly-based steering committee.  The evaluation panel found that the tender led by CDM Smith Ireland Limited provided the best response and a contract was awarded to the consortium in August 2014. The consortium includes commercial consultancies, academics, a geological research institution and a legal firm, each offering a particular specialism required by the project's scope, as was detailed in the terms of reference. The project team was expected to include members with a comprehensive understanding of geology and hydrology, as well as an in-depth knowledge of a range of legal, environmental, health, socio-economic and technical issues, with a knowledge of mineral and fossil fuels. I am aware that there has been some comment on the fact that, internationally, CDM Smith has provided expert advice for oil companies involved in the development of unconventional gas resources. I should point out that it has also provided advice for State bodies and regulatory agencies across its area of expertise. As I am sure the Deputy will appreciate, it is common for a broad range of parties to seek to draw on the specialist expertise available from a firm such as CDM Smith. The fact that disparate entities seek to draw on such expertise is generally seen as an indicator of a company's recognised experience.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Ireland is a small country.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is a small island and I am on the record as having expressed my own reservations about this industry. It is also important to point out that this work was initiated in 2011 by the previous Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who wanted to find out what was best practice. There was consultation and the Deputy knows the history. Timeframes were set. I want to highlight a couple of important items. The first stage of the research programme is to conclude by the end of January 2016. It is a significant piece of work on the first phase. The plan was that, with work on the second phase, it would feed into a single report to be presented by July 2016.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No; this is important, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. It is important to point out that that is not going to happen within the timeframe set. As the tendering process for the second phase of the research programme has not commenced, there cannot be a final report by 2018. I will ask the steering committee to publish an interim report on the significant findings made at the end of January.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It was not envisaged and was not part of the original plan, but I will ask the steering committee to produce at an early date interim findings on the significant body of work done. No decision will be made on the tendering process until that work is carried out.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	TTIP will involve the European Union and the United States, so that is a wider question. Sticking to this question and this issue, making that presentation to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications will be considered. It is also important to point out that representatives of the EPA have appeared before the committee and made a very worthwhile presentation. The steering committee needs to be afforded space now because this question has just been asked publicly. I want to give it the space to produce an interim report on the significant body of work it has completed to date. That will happen. I am asking for that to be done sooner rather than later.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	All I am saying is that we are asking the steering committee to produce the findings of its significant work. Nothing will happen until that is achieved.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is important to emphasise that the EPA is independent of the Government. Instead of reading out the formal response I will take up the point made by Deputy Clare Daly. A decision was taken in 2011 to inform ourselves as policy agents and as legislators on the best thing to do on foot of the research and based on the best evidence available. I have taken a decision to approach the steering committee to produce an interim report. Deputy Clare Daly is correct that it was not part of the original thought process but it is important. The original timeframe was to have phases 1 and 2 completed by July 2016 and to dovetail them into a report in 2016. That is not going to happen. A tendering process has not been initiated for phase 2. In light of that, I am asking the steering committee to examine the significant body of evidence produced and to draw up an interim report and that will give us time to take stock of the information gathered. Deputy Clare Daly indicated in her question that 50% of research on fracking has been done since 2012 but we need to evaluate, take stock and produce an interim report to consider the information that has been garnered in the time afforded in the first instance.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Queen's University is still involved in a reviewing capacity but it was not able to commit to the original proposition for funding reasons. It is important to point out that the information is garnered on a cross-Border basis. Some of those involved include the British Geological Survey, universities in Northern Ireland, UCD and the EPA. We have a collection of expertise and they form the steering committee. I will make formal contact with the steering group and ask it to produce a review. That will happen. I have spoken to the officials and indicated I would like that to happen sooner rather than later. A body of evidence is available from the information that has been garnered that will address my initial fears. When I got this post on the very first day I was answering a question asked by Deputy Colreavy and I put my reservations on the floor of the House. We are a small country and we have plenty of offshore capacity. We have had 42 expressions of interest for licences in terms of the Atlantic margin offshore. As to whether I have reservations about fracking, yes I do, and I want us to be clear and coherent in terms of getting the review and to take stock of the significant body of work that has been completed today, even though that was not part of the original terms of reference.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Let us be clear, this is a significant piece of work that will be completed by the end of January. It will cover areas such as those mentioned by Deputy Clare Daly, namely, groundwater, surface water, associated ecosystem, seismicity, air quality, impacts and mitigation measures for project operations and a regulatory framework for environmental protection. Significant work is being done so let us find out what has been evaluated and researched and then inform ourselves as legislators. As someone who lives in the north west and has plenty of contacts in south Donegal and Leitrim I have my own personal fears and concerns about the process. We are a small island with plenty of offshore capacity. In terms of geographical magnitude we are the fourth largest country in Europe when our sea area is taken into account. I acknowledge the legitimate concerns of people in this House and within the communities that could be affected. I have asked the steering committee to produce a mid-term review and to take stock of the findings we have in the first instance.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	As the Deputy may be aware, the EPA has commissioned a research programme into the potential impacts of unconventional gas exploration and extraction on the environment and human health. This all-island programme of research, which is being administered by the EPA, comprises five interlinked projects and involves field studies as well as an extensive desk-based literature review of unconventional gas exploration and extraction practices and regulations worldwide. This scientific research programme considers existing baseline data with respect to groundwater, air and seismicity, and the potential implications and mitigations that are required to be considered to understand the environmental impacts of using this technology and whether it can be undertaken in an environmentally protective manner, in accordance with the requirements of environmental law. The programme has been designed to produce the scientific basis, which will assist regulators, North and South, in making an informed decision about whether it is environmentally safe to allow unconventional gas exploration and extraction. As well as research in Ireland, evidence from other countries will be collated and considered. As I have stated on a number of occasions, and I would like to once again confirm, no application to engage in such exploration and extraction has been received in my Department, nor would any such application, if submitted, be considered until the research programme has concluded and there has been time to consider its findings. On the Paris summit, which the Deputy raised, any policy decision will be taken in the context of the objective of achieving a low carbon energy system by 2050.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	No applications have been submitted and even if they were, they would not be accepted because it is clear fracking is not allowed. I want to give the steering committee time and space to consider the possibility of producing an interim report. The committee has produced a significant body of work and the research has been conducted on a joint basis. I have long been an advocate of North-South co-operation and I am delighted that universities in Ulster, the British Geological Survey, UCD and the EPA are sitting around a table examining this research. We will learn from that and I am asking and encouraging the EPA and the steering committee to produce an interim report at the end of January.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The company was selected independently and the EPA dealt with that at the joint committee meeting.
