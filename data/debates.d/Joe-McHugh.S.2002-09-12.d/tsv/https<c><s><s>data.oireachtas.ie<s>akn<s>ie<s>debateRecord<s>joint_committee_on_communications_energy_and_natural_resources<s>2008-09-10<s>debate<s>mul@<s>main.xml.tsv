JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation and congratulate Dr. Ciaran Byrne on his appointment.  It is positive that the board is involved in outreach programmes in various communities and the education sector.There was no mention in the presentation of the Farrell, Grant and Sparks, FGS, report on restructuring the fisheries boards on a central and regional basis.  There was also no mention of our obligation under the Good Friday Agreement in implementing an integrated cross-Border marine strategy.  Are there any recommendations made in the FGS report that are being implemented, followed up or will come down the line?  I raise this in the context of the current economic position with regard to value for money, economic and scientific best practice and cutbacks.I appreciate that excellent work is being done at a regional level under the various chief executive officers.  However, from an outsider's perspective, seven chief executive officers under the direction of Dr. Byrne might seem excessive.  I am not talking about personalities or questioning the role of the other chief executive officers in a regional context, but I would like Dr. Byrne's opinion of the existing model.People working within the aquaculture section, for example, in freshwater systems and in small businesses in general, are finding it difficult to secure loans from the banks.  In addition, there is little public investment in spawning grounds.  I refer in particular to spawning areas for salmon where, in some cases, rehabilitation work has not been carried out since as far back as 1929.  Are there plans for an intensive roll-out of funding to rehabilitate spawning grounds?Will Dr. Byrne elaborate on the status of the integrated cross-Border marine strategy?  In east Inishowen in my constituency, the Loughs Agency is doing an excellent job of trying to work with two accountable structures at Stormont and Dublin.  However, under a fisheries governance restructuring which incorporates Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England, the Environment Agency in the United Kingdom is seeking to subsume the function of the Loughs Agency in the North.  Is there not an opportunity for us, at a further outreach level, to look to a model of best practice where we go back to the natural river basin using the north west as an example, as administered by the North-Western Regional Fisheries Board and the Loughs Agency?  We should show leadership on this side of the Border in view of our obligation under the Good Friday Agreement to devise an integrated marine strategy.  Could we not advocate a position whereby we go back to the natural terrain of the north-western river basin, which would incorporate Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry, Donegal and Cavan?  Is that discussion taking place within the Central Fisheries Board?
