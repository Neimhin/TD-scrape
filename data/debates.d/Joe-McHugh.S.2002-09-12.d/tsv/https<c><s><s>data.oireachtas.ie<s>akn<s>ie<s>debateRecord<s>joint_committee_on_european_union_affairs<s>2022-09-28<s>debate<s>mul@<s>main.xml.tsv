JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ar son an choiste, on behalf of the committee, cuirim fáilte roimh Ms Noelle O’Connell, príomhfheidhmeannach, agus leas-phríomhfheidhmeannach, Mr. Stephen O’Shea, ó European Movement Ireland chuig an gcruinniú inniu. They are very welcome to the meeting. Béimíd ag caint faoin an torthaí a bhaint amach ón Conference on the Future of Europe, the comhdháil on the future of Europe. We will discuss the outcome of that agus na torthaí of the latest polling by European Movement Ireland, EMI. Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members all know the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I am leaving out bits and bobs there because I think everybody is okay with that.  We are looking forward to our discussion today and to digging into the poll results. We are assuming that there is good, positive news in there and positive news stories. I will hand it over to Ms O’Connell to make her opening statement.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms O'Connell. I call Senator Chambers first, to be followed by Deputy Ó Murchú. I have a quick question. What was the sample size for the poll? Perhaps that is more relevant to Mr. O'Shea's area.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will leave the regional breakdown until the end. It is somewhat disconcerting that on some of them, especially the question on the future of Europe, 45% of the responses were from Connaught-Ulster. That area is the most peripheral within Europe, but we will come to that. Before Senator Chambers comes in, I would like to ask about the cost. How much was the work commissioned from RED C?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Thank you. I call Senator Chambers.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No, it is okay. I know my place.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms O'Connell did say-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	-----"Cathaoirleach and distinguished members", so I do not think I am in that category.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank members. I also thank Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea. The engagement has been very helpful and informative. We will take the witnesses up on the suggestion to look at areas where we can work together. Our focus as a committee is to continue to look at the eastern front of Europe. We want to continue with our engagement with the Balkan countries. We had a representative of North Macedonia before us last week. We have learned a lot from our trip to Moldova and Romania. Peripherality is an issue. Many countries on the eastern side of Europe believe the region is getting attention now because of the war, which gives rise to the question of why the attention was not on it in the first place. We could look at the inverse of that on the north-west coast of Ireland and the various percentages. In terms of peripherality, it is not just about having meetings in peripheral areas, although that is a big part of it. The witnesses held one of the four national meetings in Donegal town, which was a big deal. Core versus periphery is more than just a logical analysis; it is a feeling.We will be happy to engage with EMI in our work, as we continue to work with the Balkans and with eastern Europe. If there is anything we can do in that space, especially to commemorate a significant landmark like the 50-year anniversary, as well as the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, we will be happy to do it. Gabhaim buíochas leis na finnéithe arís. Beimid i dteagmháil leo faoi achan rud sa spás seo. Guím gach rath orthu ina n-obair féin. Rinne siad sárobair leis an taighde agus an beartas atá bainte amach. Beimid ag caint leo amach anseo.
