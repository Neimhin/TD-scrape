JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, has been working hard and made a commitment in the area. I will be happy to speak to her and get her to revert directly to the Deputy on the issue.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter. Officials of my Department and I met the chief executive and staff of the National Council for Special Education this week. I will ask them to look specifically at this matter in Dublin 12. I will be happy to revert to the Deputy when we receive an update.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I am happy to obtain the detail on the project and revert to the Deputy directly. I reassure him that there is a capital plan for 2020 and that capital funding increased from €740 million in 2018 by €200 million in 2019. Activity will continue apace, with €620 million to be spent on schools next year.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I will be happy to get the detail on that individual case from the Deputy. At a wider level, I assure the House that we are looking at a new school inclusion model. This will enhance communication between the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, and the Department of Health. A pilot scheme is up and running whereby speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, behavioural therapists, and teachers operate in the same setting. The Minister for Health and I are working closely on this. With regard to this specific urgent case, I ask the Deputy to give me the detail.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas as an cheist. Chonaic mé an ráiteas san Irish Times inné faoin imní atá ar na múinteoirí scoile uilig. Bhí mé i dteagmháil le mo chuid oifigí agus leis an State Examinations Commission, SEC. Dá mbeinn in ann solúbthacht ná cuidiú a chur ar fáil maidir leis an scéal sin faoin teastas sóisearach, bheinn sásta é sin a dhéanamh. Maidir le cúrsaí an lae inné, tá am ann fosta. B'fhéidir go mbeadh breis ama de dhíth. B'shin an fhadhb a bhí ann inné. Tiocfaidh mé ar ais nuair atá níos mo eolais agam.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This issue with regard to south Dublin has been raised by a number of Deputies on all sides of the House. I assure the Deputy that we are conscious of the demand for places. The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been in touch with many individual schools. I have decided to invoke my powers under the legislation for a second time. I invoked it in respect of Dublin 15 last April. This unilateral invocation of powers under legislation is not good enough in itself. This issue has to be resolved on the basis of persuasion and partnership. I implore the schools to stay in touch with the NCSE and my officials. If they have concerns and fears - and I know there are concerns about support systems for schools - we will alleviate them if we can. At the end of the day, the demand comes from mothers and fathers whose children do not have a place. That is the immediate priority. It is with reluctance that I invoke the legislation again and direct schools to add classes. This will not work without partnership. There is a very good example in Dublin 15. People, including Archbishop Diarmuid Martin, showed leadership in this regard and we now have the places we sought back in April. Invoking legislation is not in itself good enough. We also have to persuade people.
