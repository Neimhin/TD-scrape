JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the gentlemen to this meeting, which is important to progressing the debate.  We are somewhat stifled because every time we ask about future plans or forward vision, the Minister cannot reply and claims his hands are tied because his making a statement would influence the tender application for next-generation broadband.  I refer to the Government policy and the roll-out of the national broadband scheme.  What is happening is stifling and very annoying to politicians and, I have no doubt, the industry itself.I am not totally confident that what is proposed will be the answer to all our questions on the national broadband scheme.  Does the industry believe sufficient sums of money will be made available?  Does it have confidence this policy offers an overall solution for industry needs?I refer to projects that are coming down the tracks such as, for example, the dual carriageway that will be built from Derry city through east County Donegal down as far as Aughnacloy, County Tyrone.  Does consultation take place between the telecommunications industry and those who propose building such roads?  Is this not an opportunity to lay fibre optic cables when digging and delving the ground on a cross-Border basis?  That is only one example.I refer to the international advisory forum that has been commissioned by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, which met in January.  Has the Telecommunications and Internet Federation been consulted and will the witnesses be making contributions from a bottom-up or Irish perspective to the report that will be forthcoming in the next few weeks?As for the emphasis Mr. McKeon has placed on a bold step, such a step is needed when countries such as Slovenia and Slovakia are considerably ahead in respect of broadband access in rural communities.  I am a public representative from County Donegal, where metropolitan area networks, MANs, are in operation in places such as Carndonagh and Letterkenny.  While a review is under way on their efficiency, such products constitute solutions to urban needs.  However, are the witnesses confident in respect of people who live in rural areas?  I refer to those who live outside Eircom exchange areas and to availability in smaller towns in County Donegal.To take up Deputy McManus's point, is there not a danger the Government may draw a map and state there is radio broadband availability in the rural areas of, for example, 1 Mbps?  Is there not a danger this will become a solution?  Bandwidths of 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps, which Vodafone will apply on the fixed line, is not a solution for next-generation broadband in respect of competitiveness and business solutions.  My confidence is low and I am annoyed the debate in this regard has been somewhat stifled.  I acknowledge this has nothing to do with the witnesses.  However, my question pertains to their confidence as to whether sufficient information exists regarding next-generation broadband in terms of policy and moneys.  How confident are they in respect of a mechanism or solution for rural areas?
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the sensitivities involved given that both Eircom and BT are involved in the tendering process.  The danger for rural areas lies in the 1 Mbps requirement.  Studies from rural parts of Germany indicate there has been a real advance in terms of supporting SMEs in such locations.  The danger is that rural areas will be left with speeds of 1 Mbps through radio broadband.  That is my concern at present because the solution is to try to provide advanced radio broadband solutions in rural areas.At a wider level, this country's problems arise from the location of the majority of its population on the east coast.  I refer to problems of congestion and house price inflation whereby the further one goes towards the population conglomerations, the more expensive it becomes to live.  Moreover, people have a poorer quality of life in respect of travelling to work.  The overall solution at a wider level will be to induce people to establish micro-industries in rural areas.  However, my concern in respect of this tendering process is that it will satisfy the criteria by rolling out 1 Mbps broadband in rural areas.
