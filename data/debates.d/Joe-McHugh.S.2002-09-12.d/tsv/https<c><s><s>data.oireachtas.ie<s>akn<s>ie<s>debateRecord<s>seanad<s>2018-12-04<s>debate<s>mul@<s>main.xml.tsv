JoeMcHugh	Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Joe McHugh)	2002-09-12	None	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Seanadóir as ucht an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a ardú inniu. Is léir ón teachtaireacht inniu ón Seanadóir go bhfuil fuinneamh dearfach ag dul ar aghaidh sa scoil. Tá sé ceart go bhfuil sé tiománta agam an teanga a bheith ag bailiú nirt amach anseo fosta agus gabhaim mo aitheantas chuig an ceannaireacht thíos sna scoileanna fá choinne an tiomántas ar son na teanga. Mar atá a fhios ag an Seanadóir, tá Gaelscoil Cholmcille ag obair faoin ethos Catholic agus ag obair faoin fhoras patrúnacha agus tá suas le 277 duine óige sna mbunscoileanna ag foghlaim trí mheán na Gaeilge. Tá daoine obair sna scoileanna fosta agus tá 11 cloigeann duine ag obair agus 2.5 duine ag obair i dtacaíocht speisialta. In 2008, my Department provided a two-storey, semi-permanent school building consisting of 12 classrooms and ancillary accommodation for Gaelscoil Cholmcille. As this building has a life span of 25 to 30 years, my Department has no plans to replace it in the foreseeable future. However, I take on board what the Senator stated in the context of parents seeking a period of certainty. I understand that in March 2018 the school submitted an application under my Department's additional school accommodation scheme seeking the provision of additional temporary accommodation to provide for a further mainstream teaching post being appointed for 2018. Having engaged with the school to seek clarification on aspects of the application, my Department finalised the assessment of the application in September. I am pleased to confirm that my Department granted approval for the provision of two permanent mainstream classrooms with en suite toilets and a separate assisted user's toilet to address the deficit of accommodation in the Gaelscoil. The project was devolved for delivery to the Gaelscoil authority. This means that it is now a matter for the Gaelscoil authority to appoint a consultant and advance the project through the design and construction phases. Gabhaim buíochas arís leis an Seanadóir as ucht an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a ardú inniu.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Chuala mé an teachtaireacht inniu. I hear the message. I place this in the context of the pressure the Department has been under over many decades.Even going back to the late 1970s and the 1980s, many flat-roofed schools were built and they are still fit for purpose and being used today. The Department is looking at a type of retrofit project that will address environmental and sustainability issues for schools built before 2008. The accommodation in question was built prior to 2008 and I understand that parents and the community want a more permanent solution. In the context of options involving alternative sites - and the Senator has come forward with options - one thing I have to say about the officials, who I have only got to know in recent weeks, is that they are very flexible and adapt to new suggestions and ideas. Obviously, I am trying to get a figure for the budget that has been spent in the areas of Wicklow, Kildare, Meath and Dublin in the past ten years, given there has been phenomenal growth in population and we must add that to the pressures and constraints on new buildings. I understand that when parents hear of other announcements of new schools, they obviously ask what is the situation regarding this school. We have a ten-year capital plan and the Project Ireland 2040 plan, which points to the space we will be in by 2040. I know parents and others in the community are not living in a space where they believe this is to be realised by 2040, but that we start working in that capital space in terms of how we get there over that period. Cloisim an teachtaireacht ón Seanadóir. Ba mhaith liom mo aitheantas a ghabháil leis fá choinne seans a thabhairt dom labhairt ar Ghaelscoil Cholmcille - ainm deas agus ceangal le mo chontae féin, Tír Chonaill. Nuair a bhíonn tograí scoile ar intinn ag Seanadóirí, bíonn mo chluasa foscailte. Beidh mé ag labhairt le mo chomhghleacaithe chun níos mó sonraí a fháil i dtaobh stádas an togra atáthar ag iarraidh a bhaint amach ó bhí 2008 ann, agus i dtaobh an plean nó an bealach a bheidh de dhíth go dtí go mbeidh foirgneamh níos fearr ag an scoil sa todhchaí.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator for the opportunity to address the matter regarding the career break scheme for special needs assistants. In accordance with the Education Act, the terms and conditions of employment of special needs assistants employed in approved posts funded by moneys provided by the Oireachtas are determined by the Minister for Education and Skills, with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. Special needs assistants are recruited specifically to assist in the care of pupils with disabilities who have additional and significant care needs in an educational context. They may be appointed to a special school or a mainstream school to assist school authorities in making suitable provision for a pupil or pupils with special care needs. The first priority is that the care needs of the pupils are met on an ongoing basis during the school year. In June 2012, my Department, in conjunction with the school management bodies and the relevant trade unions, agreed a career break scheme for special needs assistants in recognised primary and post-primary schools, the provisions of which are contained in Circular 22/2012, which is available on my Department's website. Paragraph 1.2 of the circular states:The main objectives of this scheme below, which are not exhaustive, are for employers, wherever possible to facilitate applicants in the areas of:- Personal Development - Education (including teacher training) - Public Representation - Childcare/Dependent care - Self-employmentThe career break scheme therefore is applicable to special needs assistants who wish to pursue courses such as teacher training where participants are required to spend significant periods of time on school observation or teaching practice during the school year. The taking up of regular paid employment while on career break would be contrary to the objectives of the career break scheme and such applications shall be refused by the employer. Paragraph 4.2 of the circular states, "A career break shall be a period of not less than one school year and may be extended on an annual basis provided the total period of the career break does not exceed five years at any one time.". Thus the priority of my Department is to ensure that the continuity of care and the welfare needs of pupils take precedence over all other considerations in the granting and duration of career breaks. I thank Senator Burke for affording me the opportunity to respond to the House on this matter.
JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Senator is being quite reasonable in his representation today. He has spoken to a cohort of people doing tremendous work and who are very much part of the school "infrastructure", for want of a better word. It may not be a good word but it signifies the value that students, teachers and principals place on the role of special needs assistants so integral as they are to the running of a school. They are very much part of the ecosystem. We are looking at reviewing the role of the SNAs and this will provide an opportunity to feed in the sentiments and observations made by the Senator today. Maybe this matter can be considered in that context. I refer again to the contribution of SNAs. There will be an increase next year and upwards of almost 16,000 SNAs will be employed; we announced another 900 in the recent budget. This demonstrates the value of and demand for those SNAs. In 2011 there were approximately 455 special classes but that number has increased this year to almost 1,500.That is the position in terms of the demand. Obviously, it also reflects the growing choices parents have as to whether they want their children to go to a special school or to special classes within mainstream schools, be they ASD units or other forms of provision. The most important point with regard to SNAs is the role they play. They provide one-to-one help and support but they also play an all-inclusive, all-school role. They play a fundamental role in education. I acknowledge the work they have done and continue to do and obviously they will have a future role in our education system. That is why we are going to carry out a comprehensive review of SNAs. I will keep the Senator and this House posted on developments.
