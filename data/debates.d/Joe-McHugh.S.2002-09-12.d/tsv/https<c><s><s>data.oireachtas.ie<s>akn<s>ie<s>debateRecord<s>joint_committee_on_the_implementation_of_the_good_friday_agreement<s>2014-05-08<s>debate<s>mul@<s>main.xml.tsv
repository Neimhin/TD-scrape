JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I welcome the delegation to discuss UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.  As members will be aware, the national action plan on the Council resolution on women, peace and security was launched in November 2011 by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the former President, Mary Robinson.  The plan sets out how Ireland will, across Departments and agencies, promote and implement the objectives of the resolution in the prevention of conflict, including gender-based violence, the participation of women in decision making, protections from gender-based violence, the relief, recovery and rehabilitation of women affected by conflict, as well as the promotion by the Irish Government of the resolution at national and international fora.The national action plan also established a monitoring and evaluation group to track its implementation, comprising representatives from the relevant Departments, agencies and civil society organisations. I hope my preamble is not stealing anything from the scripts of the representatives. On behalf of the committee I welcome representatives of the monitoring and evaluation group, which includes Ms Liz McManus, its independent chair; Ms Helena Keleher, deputy director of the conflict resolution unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Ms Orlaith Fitzmaurice, director of the reconciliation fund in the Anglo-Irish division of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Dr. Melanie Hoewer, school of politics and international relations, University College Dublin. We look forward to exploring how we as a committee can assist in the implementation of the resolution. Before commencing, I advise that the witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee. However, if witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence. Witnesses are directed that only comments and evidence connected with the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses, or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. While Ms McManus knows the drill, it is no harm to refresh her on these matters. Before calling on Ms McManus to make her opening statement, my colleagues will join me in thinking
of all the good work being done at community level, within our respective constituencies by many women in dealing with post-conflict issues, not necessarily only in Northern Ireland but in the Border areas. They have been at the vanguard at a community level. I would like to see how we can work as a committee to achieve the objectives and aims of the monitoring group, towards which it is working, but also to develop the capacity of the human infrastructure. Many women's groups involved in cross-Border activity have lost out in terms of funding, perhaps because of a two year or three year funding stream. They have built up the capacity and the relationships and are ready to move on to the next stage in dealing with many legacy issues and post-conflict challenges. Today's meeting is an opportunity to explore a few of those issues. It is great to have representation from the reconciliation unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is good to see Ms McManus again. I invite her to make her presentation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will open up the meeting to the floor now for questions.  We will come back to Orlaith Fitzmaurice and Melanie Hoewer.  I believe we have a new Minister for Justice and Equality as well.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will ensure that this transcript lands on her desk.  We have had a good conversation this morning.  As Deputy Wall is under pressure time-wise, I invite him to speak first.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I am sorry but could Deputy Wall please switch off his phone to prevent interference?
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will get the response to Deputy Wall straight away because he is under time pressure but I believe that was a constructive suggestion with regard to the North.  There may be an opportunity for the joint committee to contact Paula Bradley, as head of that delegation.  The witnesses may have a few thoughts on that and I thank the Deputy.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Fitzmaurice.  That is helpful.    A number of members are indicating.  Deputy Seán Conlan will be followed by Deputy Seán Crowe.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Deputy for his intervention on two counts.  It is only right to acknowledge the funding allocated to Justice for the Forgotten which formally thanked the joint committee for its intervention.  There is something we can do on the British-Irish aspect of the issue.  There are a number of advocates present.  Deputy Frank Feighan is chairman of the sovereign matters committee of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  Deputy Seán Conlan is a member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly also, as is Deputy Seán Crowe.  Deputy Jack Wall is chairman of the social affairs committee.  It is a social affairs issue, but there is also a sovereign matter element in lack of recognition of Northern Ireland as a conflict zone by the British.  There are options, in respect of which there are plenty of advocates present.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	A division has been called in the Dáil and, with members' agreement, we will suspend for the vote.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We will resume.  I had an opportunity to congratulate Deputy Frances Fitzgerald on her appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality.  Reflecting on our deliberations and probably the informal conversation of members, the posts of Chief Justice, interim Garda Commissioner, Attorney General and Minister for Justice and Equality are held by females.It is not a bad starting point but there are still challenges.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I will be interested to hear the witnesses' response to Deputy Feighan's challenge that women are smarter than men.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	No, I will be ruthless because Deputy Ferris has indicated and I am working in a systematic, chronological fashion.  Senator Moran will speak after him.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Deputy Conlan and other members for their contributions.  It is obvious that there is an appetite among committee members to further deliberate on these issues after today's meeting.  I now call on the panel to make their concluding remarks.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We have been given a great deal of information.  I think members will agree that we will reach out to Paula Bradley and her group, and we will work with the delegates on that.  We can still pursue the promotion of principles, but we appreciate the realism of the delegates.  Ms Fitzmaurice mentioned the funding call for this October, and I am sure members are thinking of the different women's groups in their own areas that are doing great work.  I am aware of the Inishowen women's outreach group, which has been involved in supporting women who experience domestic violence in the Inishowen Peninsula.  If, following this meeting, we can get the word out and call for groups to submit applications, that would reverse the previous deficit.  I note that the delegates did not take the bait from Deputy Frank Feighan when he said that women are smarter than men.  I think it is understandable.  While it is good that the Government has set a quota of 30% female candidates, the debate has moved on.  The cultural and traditional patterns of child rearing have changed.  Men are engaged equally in rearing their children.The location of one's constituency is an issue.  Deputy Martin Ferris is from County Kerry and I am from County Donegal.  Young men from those areas must consider whether to enter politics knowing they will not see their family for three days every week, whereas if one represents a constituency in Dublin one will see the children every day.  There is an issue around geography that needs to be thrown into the mix.  Male politicians have a responsibility to be more proactive in the debate.  As things are changing the situation is becoming more complex.  It is not all about children, because there are many who do not have families but are willing to work with organisations with a specific focus on the objectives of UNSCR 1325.  We look forward to our continued relationship and to working with the delegation, and if we are here to help if we can.
