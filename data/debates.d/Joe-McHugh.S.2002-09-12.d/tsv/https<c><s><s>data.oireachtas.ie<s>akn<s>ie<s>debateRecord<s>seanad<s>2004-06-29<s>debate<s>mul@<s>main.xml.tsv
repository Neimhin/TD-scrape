JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, would it be possible to interject at this stage? While I do not disrespect the good offices of the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, who is very much in tune with community and voluntary needs, would it be possible to delay the debate in order to have present here the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, would it be possible——
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Would it be possible to relay my request to the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív because this is serious legislation?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, the Minister of State said there is no point setting up another body. That scraps this legislation.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, it is about the legislation. This legislation amends existing legislation but the Minister of State said there is no point setting up another body.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has responsibility for the technical aspect of the Bill. However, I wished to convey my desire to have the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, in the House. The Minister needs to be present so he can see what is happening because his ministerial colleagues are taking a hand off him. I accept the Minister talks the talk and I record my admiration for what he says and his intentions for the west, disadvantaged areas and, if I may be parochial, CLÁR areas of County Donegal. However, when the Minister began talking the talk, I had serious reservations about how he would finance his broadband projects, road, sewerage and water programmes and general targets for disadvantaged areas. Up to one year ago, I believed the Department of Community and Gaeltacht Affairs was nothing more than a bridesmaid ministerial post.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I felt it did not have the teeth because it did not have the resources. However, things change. The Government, including the Progressive Democrats, did not do its homework when it forgot that dormant accounts could be a significant resource — some would call it a significant slush fund. However, it became obvious this was likely to be a significant resource. Deputy Ó Cuív's ministerial colleagues realised they were dealing with a budget of €60 million for 2004, which might increase to at least €225 million and perhaps €250 million in three years, as the Minister of State noted. Figures available to me suggest it could go to €500 million in three years. Ministers who were under pressure at Cabinet due to promises made at the last general election decided they wanted to get their paws on the money. This is why I wanted the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, present in the House for this debate. He is a competent and confident Minister and I am surprised his Cabinet colleagues are taking a hand at him. However, I am sure he will get the message in the short term.The other reason I wanted to speak in this debate was to emphasise the importance of this issue and the outrageousness of the legislation. The Bill undermines the confidence of the community and voluntary sector and the relationship built up in regard to ADM Limited since 1992. The Bill should not be before the House. A body was set up and was working in this area. Why redesign the wheel when it is not broken? If it is a question of resources, why not employ the extra staff dotted throughout the country who could do with extra work? The Minister of State has already stated that, at some stage, additional staff may be required under the new mechanism. Why not do this under the current mechanism? The removal of representation from ADM Limited is the first part of the process to undermine the healthy work which has been ongoing. That representation linked the community and voluntary sector with the political sector.The significance of the current situation lies in the timing of this legislation, which is being dealt with in late June and early July. The Minister of State knows that those involved in the community and voluntary sector carry out the majority of their administration work in the winter. However, most of the sector's programmes take place over the summer, whether out of school hours programmes for children in June, July and August, community youth work, or working and engaging with the community. The implementation programme is carried out during the summer. To introduce the Bill at this time is to set a dangerous precedent and there will be a backlash from the community and voluntary sector, which is unprepared for the legislation.I am totally opposed to the Bill. There has been a lack of communication and consultation and the community and voluntary sector is not aware of what is going on. It is politicising a fund which could have been earmarked for the community and voluntary sector. It could have been decided by the independent and transparent forum which was already set up. However, that forum is being replaced by a similar board, although the ultimate responsibility for decision making will not lie with ADM but with Department officials and Ministers.The primary legislation was good and had the confidence of the community and voluntary sector. There is absolutely no reason to move the goalposts. ADM was a transparent and representative body, and publicly accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts. In regard to funding and accounting procedures, the existing dormant accounts board employed a consultancy company to make sure everything was above board. It was serious about its business. While there may have been a question regarding resources and a lack of qualified staff to appraise different applications, all that was required was the employment of extra staff, which should not have been difficult.That was the situation in regard to the primary legislation. However, a highly politicised appraisal body has now been set up, which no longer deals simply with dormant accounts but which is broken into four or five different mechanisms. I accept there will be an open, advertised application process which can be accessed online. That is not a problem. The next stage is the assessment, when civil servants begin working in liaison with their bosses, the Ministers. The second appraisal stage begins when the results are reported to the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, and his Department. There is a third appraisal stage when the results return for Government approval at Cabinet level. The Minister constantly talks about the need to get rid of bureaucracy and the legislative barriers to getting work done.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	In one go, the Minister has completely contradicted his philosophy on the appraisal of projects. He has introduced three different stages. At the first stage, the proposal goes to the public bodies and public officers and civil servants discuss it with their Ministers. The Ministers decide that the project will be considered. Then it goes back to Deputy Ó Cuív's table and he and his staff decide which projects to pick. The project then goes on to the third stage, when it comes before the Cabinet. Lobbying takes place and all the Deputies in different parts of the constituency and the country put on the pressure and decide, ultimately, where the €500 million will go.This is a politicised, non-transparent system that is tantamount to a political slush fund. A dagger has been put in the back of the community and voluntary sector, which has been working well with this Government. I commend where commendation is due. The community and voluntary sector has worked well. It fought hard for its rights. When it all comes out in the wash, however, its members will not be happy.There was mention of consultants, advisers and support staff in this legislation. Why were these provisions not introduced in the primary legislation when we had the existing dormant accounts disbursement board? It is a bad day for the community sector. There is no specific provision for consultation in the amendment Bill. For people working in the community sector, the major issues were a lack of transparency, communication and consultation. We need some form of consultation with the community sector. There is no feedback mechanism or communication mechanism and there is no appraisal system that involves the community and voluntary sector.There will be a complete duplication of mainstream funding. That is clear from the Minister of State's contribution. He stated that the dormant accounts fund would assist "persons who are socially, economically or educationally disadvantaged, and persons with a disability." That could mean anything. There are areas which merit consideration and discussion, but this statement could cover anything. Senator Brady has always highlighted the problem of drug abuse and the resources that are needed in this area. Under the existing primary legislation, the dormant accounts fund was to provide resources for this, along with funds for CLÁR and RAPID areas. Senator Brady cannot contradict me on this. This is the existing focus of the dormant accounts disbursement board. That will no longer be the case. The Minister of State knows this.The rural social scheme for small farmers was given another €10 million from the dormant accounts fund. The money for this scheme should come from mainstream channels, not from an account which could be used to aid the disadvantaged — to provide broadband in Sligo, west Galway or Kerry, or physical infrastructure.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	This is a sad day for those involved in the community and voluntary sector. It is not over. I am not happy with the Bill and I have no qualms about proposing a vote of no confidence in it. While there is probably no provision to do this, I propose a vote of no confidence in this legislation. This Bill should be thrown out because it is a embarrassment to the community and voluntary sector. It is outrageous, politicised legislation. I propose the Bill be scrapped.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	On a point of order, I am the only Senator who contributed prior to Senator Ó Murchú and I made no suggestion that there was a problem with civil servants.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I do not like to do this, but would it be possible to ask Senator Ó Murchú to withdraw his remarks?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	They are appointed at the discretion of the Minister.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Has the Senator been drinking?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	CLÁR is gone from the programme.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not mentioned in the conclusions.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not mentioned.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Will they be appraised publicly?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Hear, hear.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Does the Minister envisage that it will reach €500 million? It is an ageing population and people are dying.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is a transparency and not a personnel issue.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	ADM Limited is an independent and transparent body.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The word "may" does not instil confidence. ADM Limited was not mentioned once in the Minister of State's opening speech.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is not mentioned once. That is a kick in the teeth.
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	Why not?
JoeMcHugh	Mr. McHugh	2002-09-12	None	The Minister of State is questioning their independence of judgment.
