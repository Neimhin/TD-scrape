JoeMcHugh	Senator McHugh	2002-09-12	None	I welcome Mr. Kelly to the committee. It is interesting that his core contribution was based on the set up and structure of voluntarism. The GAA has never found itself wanting in terms of contributing to and building communities. As the Chairman knows, it also built bridges across the Border, in terms of the Ulster championships and cross-Border tournaments.I was glad to hear him mention the diaspora. I was a member of the highly talented United Arab Emirates team in 1996 when a tournament was organised in Bahrain. It was a great celebration of Irishness, although the level of skill may have been suspect. However, being abroad for a year there was a sense of pride and, perhaps, homesickness. It was a way for people to express their love of being Irish and their sense of Irishness. It is the same across Asia and the world and not necessarily in traditional emigration spots, whether on the east coast of America or in England.Can the GAA explore the possibility of an international gathering of teams from the wider diaspora, utilising our magnificent Croke Park, be it for a weekend or more? This would not be a problem in terms of financial backing, as there are many successful and wealthy Irish people willing to invest in anything Irish. At the time of the Bahrain tournament, many Irish investors competed to put us up in the Hilton, provide our air fare, buy tracksuits and provide us with sports gear. There is no lack of investment, financial or otherwise, in these different locations. It may be an avenue to explore.The British Government has suggested that a stadium may be built in Northern Ireland. Is the GAA involved in the negotiation of this possibility? There is a stipulation that all codes would be played there.I concur with Senator Feighan. Perhaps it is best if politicians stay out of the debate about the opening up of Croke Park. As we say in politics, it is a matter for the organisation to decide. However, returning to my point about the celebration of Irishness, we are proud of our Irish sports stars across the water. We are proud of players such as Shay Given, who represents Irishness in Newcastle. Irish emigrants there see him as a symbol of attachment. He has said that to set foot on the hallowed turf of Croke Park would be a moment of glory for him, surpassing anything he has done. This man has played in World Cup tournaments, but he said that stepping out in Croke Park would be the highlight of his career. However, I agree with Senator Feighan in that it is a matter for the organisation to decide.
