JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Apologies have been received from Deputy Marian Harkin. I propose we go into private session to deal with some housekeeping matters. Is that agreed? Agreed.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Barry Andrews, Ms Deirdre Clune, Ms Clare Daly, Ms Maria Walsh and Mr. Billy Kelleher. Today's meeting offers us an opportunity to engage with our MEPs on issues facing the EU. Before we begin, our guests are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. I advise the witnesses giving evidence from locations outside of the parliamentary precincts to note that the constitutional protections afforded to witnesses attempting to give evidence before committees may not extend to them. No clear guidance can be given on whether or the extent to which the evidence given is covered by absolute privilege of a statutory nature. Persons giving evidence from another jurisdiction should also be mindful of their domestic statutory regime. If our guests are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter, they must respect that direction. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise, or make charges against a person outside of the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Some of the MEPs sent opening statements to the committee. We will go straight into the discussion. If there are observations or questions from committee members, we can take them.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Senator Chambers. There was a specific question for Mr. Andrews. If other witnesses wish to indicate, I will take them in rotation.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Clune and call Mr. Cuffe.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Yes.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Mr. Cuffe has digressed a little there into a question which was not raised, which we totally welcome. It has afforded me the opportunity to go back to the members. Perhaps after that we will come to Ms Walsh and Mr. Kelleher but rather than getting six responses to one question, we will try to vary it a bit.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	Ms Maria Walsh is next, followed by Mr. Billy Timmins. I think Ms Daly is indicating to come in on this as well or her hand is up-----
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I apologise to Mr. Timmins. The order is Ms Walsh followed by Mr. Kelleher and Ms Daly.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I was, like an eejit.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	In the spirit of the suggestion made by Ms Daly, if members remain specific to the issue we will get through a lot more questions. There are many members indicating. I call Deputy Richmond.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	As mentioned by Deputy Richmond if there are questions specific to particular MEPs that are not in this block they can respond to them in the next round. This block comprises Mr. Andrews, Mr. Cuffe and Ms Clune.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	We shall see Mr. Andrews in an hour's time. Next is Mr. Cuffe who will be followed by Ms Clune.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Ms Daly. We have 15 minutes remaining and three members wish to ask questions. I will take them in a group, after which we will go to the next bloc of Mr. Andrews, Mr. Cuffe and Ms Clune. I call Deputies Calleary and Ó Murchú and Senator Doherty, in that order.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I call Senator Doherty to speak now, please.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank the Senator. We have three MEPs in this block, Mr. Andrews, Mr. Cuffe and Ms Clune. We have approximately eight minutes left. If our guests can keep their contributions to two minutes each please, we can then allow Ms Walsh and Mr. Kelleher to come in for one minute each at the end, which will mean that everybody will have received three interventions. We will try to be as fair as possible.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	That was two minutes exactly. The pressure is on Mr. Cuffe now to show his agility in that department too.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr Clune. She has afforded Ms Walsh and Mr. Kelleher a final intervention but we are talking 60 seconds for each, if that is of any use to them.
JoeMcHugh	 Chairman	2002-09-12	None	I thank Mr. Kelleher and everybody present. I have 60 seconds as well so I will try to use them as productively as possible. What has come out of this meeting is that further discussion and exploration is needed. It is evident from all the contributions that significant items are coming down the track. Somebody suggested that we move now into a more specific phase and it will be great to call on the witnesses again. We appreciate their time and insight today and we also appreciate the work they do in adding value to the big issues that will be in front of us.
