JoeMcHugh	Deputy Joe McHugh	2002-09-12	None	It is my understanding that NPHET met this week to discuss the issue of Covid numbers in County Donegal. It is really important that its research and insight are given to the community. People in the county are working hard. Our businesses and restaurants are closed, and we are struggling to get our numbers down. People are worried. GPs and other medical staff are working very hard. People are looking forward to 25 December. Businesses are looking forward to 1 December. We really need to make public the information NPHET has regarding Donegal to try to tackle the issue and bring these numbers down.
