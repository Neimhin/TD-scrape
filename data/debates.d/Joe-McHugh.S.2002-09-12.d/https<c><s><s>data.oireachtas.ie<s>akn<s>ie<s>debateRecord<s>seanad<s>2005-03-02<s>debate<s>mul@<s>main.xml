          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Ulick Burke that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Finance to urgently put in place a disabled drivers medical appeal board for people seeking redress from the now defunct board who have been waiting for up to three months with no acknowledgement of correspondence, no indication of the status of their appeal or information as to whether there is an appeals process in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Browne of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Transport to outline the steps he has taken to ensure that taxpayers receive value for money in the national roads building programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to report on the arrangements agreed by her Department with Castleknock Educate Together national school and St. Brigid's GAA club on the use of the remaining land at Beechpark Avenue, Castleknock, Dublin 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Finance to discuss the extension of the rural renewal scheme in County Longford for a further two years, in light of the unprecedented number of development applications and the necessity for completion of current works.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Ulick Burke, Browne and Terry and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Bannon may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_12">Does the Leader agree that one of the greatest examples of courage we have seen recently is that shown against the face of intimidation by the McCartney family in Northern Ireland, particularly in Belfast, who have stood up to the paramilitaries in their demonstration last Sunday, in their public comments and the way in which they have handled the issues concerning the murder of their brother? They have shown tremendous courage to the people of this country and, particularly, to those in Northern Ireland who live in fear in terms of the hold paramilitaries have in those communities. I am aware the Lower House, both yesterday and today, is dealing with this matter by way of a cross-party substantive motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">Does the Leader agree that what these brave women, the McCartney sisters, want to see is a court case where people come before the court, there is a prosecution and a defence and, ultimately, a result? That is in contradiction to the continuous abject injustice of the paramilitary organisations who believe they have a right to take people down alleyways and put bullets into their knees and bodies. It is important that a court case emerges and we should use this opportunity to encourage people to come forward with the evidence in that case to face down the appalling threat and intimidation of the paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. It is worth stating that more Catholics were killed in Northern Ireland by the IRA than any other paramilitary group in the past 30 years, a fact which is sometimes forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">On 19 May 2004, a substantive motion was tabled by our group, supported by the Labour Party and by Independent Senator Ross, I think, on the issue of the McCabe murder. At that time a Government amendment was moved by Senator Jim Walsh, arguing that the McCabe issue could only be dealt with in the context of a final settlement in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The Taoiseach has moved the bar; he has changed his position three times on this matter. Those of us on this side of the House listened to all kinds of allegations of moralising and the like from rather naive Senators who put that charge last year. Can the Leader now ensure that time is provided over the course of the next few weeks to allow the Fine Gael motion — which is now also the Government position as it has been changed three times in the past 18 months — to come back to the House to allow the record of the House to be corrected? On 19 May 2004, the Government voted down a motion which is now its own position. Time should be provided by the Government to correct that matter so that it is clear to all in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I welcome Senator Cummins's Totalisator (Amendment) Bill 2005. I ask the Leader to accept this Bill tonight and allow it proceed to Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_17">I ask the House to note and acknowledge the extraordinary, comprehensive and visionary description by Dr. Paisley of the situation in the North. The House should note he has ensured we all recognise that doors are not closed and that progress can be made. The discussion with the McCartney family over the past fortnight was a most hopeful, perhaps the most hopeful, optimistic and encouraging intervention in the Northern discussions. It is crucially important that this is recognised by the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">In 1917 millions of people died from an influenza pandemic which had devastating effects on every continent. A similar situation and circumstances which led to that outbreak are coming into place at this time. There is a very strong likelihood, articulated by international medical experts, that there could be another flu pandemic looming on the horizon. The manner in which science and medicine have developed in the past 100 years means it is possible to have significant safeguards against such an outbreak and various countries are preparing for this scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The Government was embarrassed a few years ago by the lack of preparedness in the case of nuclear fallout and the distribution of iodine tablets. I do not wish the country to be caught out in the same way in the event of a flu pandemic. I presume this issue is under consideration by the Department of Health and Children. The House should be reassured that the country has sufficient stock of anti-viral medicines or whatever is required to deal with this situation. I ask that the Minister for Health and Children come to the House to reassure us.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">On a housekeeping matter, the media had a good outing last week on the question of the expenses of Members of the Oireachtas. This will continue for as long as we play it in a very naive manner. The House should take a clear position on this matter. I refer to the Cathaoirleach's position. As Cathaoirleach of the House and as a member of the Council of State he is required to represent the country abroad on many occasions. It is disgraceful that in the case of Members of the House who travel abroad, the cost of their travel tickets, money which they neither see nor spend, is recorded as being part of their personal expenses. Any other moneys which are paid directly by invoice should not appear as expenses. Many Members of both Houses are of the opinion that one of the ways of dealing with this matter is to publish all expenses every month in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> or somewhere else. People can then go to the trouble of doing the addition. We need to be a little cleverer in our approach to this issue and should not leave ourselves open to having to defend what appears indefensible. We do not have a chance of overturning the prevailing view on the issue. Instead, a big media day out, a bad news day, will be created every year at our expense.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I agree that the extraordinary role of the sisters of Mr. Robert McCartney will reverberate through the peace process in future. I hope a rapid outcome will be reached which will keep them happy. What they have done has changed the perception of many. Their role has opened our eyes and changed the view of the world on what is really happening in the name of defending communities. This matter will never return to a box of silence.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Last week the Government announced it would refund a large sum of money to those who had been illegally charged for services in publicly funded old people's residential units. As a result, the Health Service Executive set up a helpline. Some HSE staff are paid salaries in excess of the Taoiseach's salary because they are allegedly super efficient. However, the HSE cannot run a telephone line. It had two opportunities to do so and failed on each occasion. Where is the efficiency in the Health Service Executive if it cannot operate a helpline which works? Even when it knew it had got it wrong and tried to fix the problem, it failed. This episode is a poor augury for the future of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I draw Senators' attention to a matter with which the Leader will be familiar. Following the Order of Business, I and other Members will attend a private meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs attended by the ambassador of the United States. It will be held in private at the ambassador's insistence. The reason I raise the matter in the House is that it will not be reported if I mention it elsewhere. I have met most of the ambassadors who have appeared before either the Committee on European Affairs or the Committee on Foreign Affairs. They have represented various regimes of varying colours of democracy but not one of them has ever insisted that the whole meeting be conducted in private. It is astonishing that the official representative in this State of a country which is launching a crusade to expand democracy and freedom around the world will only talk to Members of our Parliament in private.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I draw Senators' attention to the decision of the IFA to appoint a full-time lobbyist. Having served in the House for 20 years, I thought the organisation had many full-time lobbyists here. If I was a member of either of the two larger parties in the House, I would start to worry because it is clear they have badly let down the IFA when it decides to pay some of its hard earned cash to have Members lobbied instead.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">I join previous speakers in raising the issue of the sisters of Mr. Robert McCartney, which I also raised a couple of weeks ago. The House should support the Mr. McCartney sisters in their efforts. An alarming word has crept into this debate. I noted the subtle introduction by Mr. Adams of the word "manslaughter". It has leaked into the media as if the groundwork is being laid for negotiations. The same approach, albeit less subtle, was used following the killing of Detective Garda Jerry McCabe, when a murder charge was changed to a manslaughter charge as a result of intimidation of witnesses. A lesson should be learned from people power which we saw in Ukraine and during the fall of the Berlin Wall. In the aftermath of these events people believed for many years that they had been conned. I hope the result with regard to this issue will be the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">Senator Brain Hayes commented on the Government's position on the McCabe issue. The House is well aware of my position in this regard. However, I remind Senator Brian Hayes that it was Sinn Féin that moved the bar after May 19, not the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">I agree with the previous speaker on Dr. Paisley' s recent interview. While the man is 80 years of age, he has mellowed a great deal. His comments create hope for the future in the North. Members should reflect on the situation with the peace process before Christmas. At that time a photograph was holding up the process. There was the famous meeting outside St. Luke's in Drumcondra when the Taoiseach said Sinn Féin would not accept the request for photographic evidence as it did not want to be humiliated. However, Dr. Paisley was adamant at the time. If we had proceeded then, the subsequent and amazing sequence of events would have had a serious impact on the process, with the Government ending up with egg on its face. It indirectly owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. Paisley for sticking to his principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">In December 2003, legislation was introduced giving the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland 5% of the television licence fee. It has now built up a pool of approximately €17 million, yet not one euro of this has been paid to any radio or television broadcasting station. What is happening to this pool of money and when will it be paid out? It is shocking that nothing has happened since the legislation was introduced in 2003.</p>

I speak from a qualified position on this matter as I came second in the expenses charts behind our esteemed Cathaoirleach. This was primarily due to my being a member of the Council of Europe for the past two years, involving much travel. As Senator O'Toole correctly identified, I saw little of that money.

A monumental decision was taken by the US Supreme Court in recent days. The US has now embraced democracy in its fullest sense by abolishing executions of people under 18 years. As a member of the Council of Europe, I had a small but modest part in highlighting the death penalty issue. Having visited America as a member of the Council of Europe's human rights committee, I welcome this decision. I hope it will lead to the full abolition of the death penalty in the US. This is a matter, from which American politicians tend to shy away, on which Senator Ryan and I could engage the US ambassador in private or public.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I wish to raise the issue, which the House has treated seriously in the past, of the use of Shannon Airport by a Gulfstream V jet and other Boeing planes. When I first raised this issue one year ago, I could hardly believe what I was saying could be true. I wondered if I was detached from reality. It seemed to me strange that the Government should be involved and implicated in the commission of very serious international war crimes. The evidence, however, is growing. I direct Members' attention to a long and detailed article in <i>The New Yorker</i> on 8 February 2005 and other articles in the last week’s <i>Newsweek</i> and <i>The Village</i>. We now have clear evidence that Shannon Airport is involved. The logs clearly demonstrate that, on several occasions, Shannon Airport was used during an operation in which citizens were illegally snatched by American operatives and taken to third countries where they were sometimes tortured to death. This has been the subject of international protests from Sweden and Canada. Will the House fully debate this issue? I will table a motion. I do not think we can afford to be involved in this type of scandalous and disgraceful behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">It is a matter I will certainly raise with the American ambassador when he visits us privately and secretly at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs. Perhaps one reason the Americans do not want it out in the open is that they do not want the world to know they are involved in torture. Much of this information is coming from the most unimpeachable source, the Central Intelligence Agency. The information being harvested from these unfortunate people under extreme pain is so unreliable those involved are wasting their time and do not know what to do with these people who survived torture. They cannot bring them to court. Are they expected to murder them? It is a very serious situation and this country is being involved in the commission of international crimes.</p>

A pattern is now emerging which was demonstrated on Shannonside local radio on which a firm from Athlone advertised for business to place claims for residents of nursing homes since the 1970s. It invites people to come to the firm so it can place claims on their behalf — in other words, it is touting for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">It is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, mentioned earlier by Senator Ryan, to encourage people to make claims without recourse to legal representation. Some 8,000 people have been refunded €15.5 million already in respect of the €2,000 refund which was agreed. Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform review the statutory instrument on solicitors advertising for business, particularly in this instance as this legal firm advertised for business straight after the Health Service Executive called on people to apply themselves for the forms to seek the refund. People do not need legal representation. This type of touting for business is grossly unfair. It will increase the cost to the public.</p>

As far as I know, our plan dates back to 2002 and has not been updated. Today in Luxembourg, 22 countries will meet to discuss this important topic. England already has 14.6 million doses of an anti-viral drug and has plans in place to close schools and cancel public events. It is important we are prepared.

          <p eId="para_66">That the redress board did not consider the loss of earnings on the part of the many victims who have already received awards was a shortcoming on its part. Given that the Committee of Public Accounts will publish a report on this matter tomorrow, there is an urgent need for an opportune debate about the plight of the many victims of abuse who are continuing to suffer under the aegis of the redress board. It is important, in the interests of justice, that this matter be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>

They are all looking for the rule of law to be applied. Could we have a debate on policing in the North five years after the Patten report? Policing is the key to the whole process. I wonder what is left for Sinn Féin to continue demonising the police.</p>

Certain precautions need to be taken against eventualities. One should consider what is happening at present in Northern Ireland. Anti-viral drugs are being stockpiled to provide for one quarter of the population. I hope a similar measure might be implemented here.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">A recent survey has shown that the health service and health facilities have deteriorated greatly over the past four months under the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. This has been pointed out by hospital managers and others involved in the health service. Will the Leader invite the Minister to the House to explain what purpose she is serving by running around the country pretending to open facilities and hospital wards given that they are padlocked when she leaves them because of a shortage of finance?</p>

          <p eId="para_74">I call for a debate on the practice of telemarketing, particularly in the telecommunications sector. A practice is emerging around the country such that some of the new entrants to the sector are calling consumers at night and in the evening requesting them to change from their incumbent provider, Eircom, to a new service. They are transferring consumers to their services without any written agreement or contract. This presents a particular difficulty for older people, who, in order to get some of the sales people off the telephone, accept whatever offer is being presented to them. Without their signing a contract or receiving any written notification, these older people find themselves receiving bills from the new company.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">This is a considerable problem throughout the country. I have had numerous representations on it in recent weeks. In particular, certain free services associated with one's previous provider are not being transferred such that old age pensioners who used to receive bills for €2 or €3 are now receiving bills for €70 and €80. This could be addressed through legislation. Nobody should end up being changed from one service provider to another without first signing a contract and going through the normal procedures we associate with this process.</p>

Nonetheless, one has to note that despite the fact that some of the right noises are being made, nothing has actually happened so far in response to the sisters' demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">I never believed I would see the day on which Dr. Paisley would be joking on an RTE broadcast about ecumenical breakfasts with the Taoiseach. His statement was particularly important, especially in light of some commentaries outside these Houses to the effect that the peace process is dead as a dodo and that we should simply stop talking to certain people. Dr. Paisley made it very clear that his party would be prepared to enter Government with Sinn Féin in the right democratic circumstances. That statement is important not just for now but also for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the matter of the McCartney women folk. They will visit the Houses of the Oireachtas next Tuesday, International Women's Day. We can meet them first downstairs and afterwards. Senator Hayes mentioned how admirably they have presented themselves and encouraged people to come forward. He is quite correct in that. It is interesting how quickly these women have caught the public imagination, perhaps because they are not afraid to speak out, and have admitted clearly that they were Sinn Féin voters. This, and their love for their brother, makes their case very powerful.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The Senator also raised the matter of the vote here on 19 May 2004 on the Fine Gael motion regarding the murder of Detective Garda McCabe and seeks Government time for that motion to be debated again. I do not know the logistics of such a request, or how one goes about doing that but I will look into it. He also welcomed the Bill Senator Cummins is putting forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Senator O'Toole welcomed Dr. Paisley's statement. Like Senator Mansergh, I never thought I would see the day when in this House we would welcome a statement from Dr. Paisley. It is a measure of our growth in the peace process. He was remarkably generous, and it was a very timely statement in which he said he was willing to go into government in the correct democratic environment. That needed to be said.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">I have been conscious throughout the rightful debates about awful events, and the calls for people to be brought to account, that central to our thoughts must be the larger picture namely, that we would all live at peace on this island. It is difficult to manage all those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Senator O'Toole mentioned the flu pandemic of 1917 and sought reassurance of our readiness should there be a recurrence, which we hope will not happen. I heard the Senator on radio last week explain in sterling tones that the information distributed about our expenses did not refer just to travel expenses, which is fair enough but also the telephone expenses we receive twice a year. This was not explained. I do not fault the media for this. It is the fault of the way the information was presented.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">I assume the request was for the total expenses allowance for each Senator. This covers office expenses apart from telephone expenses. Some Senators pay part-time staff and various expenses are never explained. Then in one's local shop people remark that we earn a great deal and wonder how we could travel so many miles, although we have travelled them.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">There is an obscure code printed beside each payment which nobody understands. It must be explained. That is up to us. Perhaps the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, which is responsible for financial matters, would suggest to the person in the one-stop-shop who dispenses this information that the payments be correctly itemised as travelling, telephone and office expenses. Then everybody will know where the money is spent. It is quite extraordinary that this is not done. I looked at the code because those responsible show us what is being sent out but one would need to be very well versed in operations here to decipher it. The media reports what it receives. It is for us to ensure that the information dispensed is self-explanatory. Senator O'Toole did well to go on air and clearly explain the payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Senator Ryan spoke of the extraordinary role of the McCartney sisters. He also asked that the Health and Safety Authority run a help line. I agree with him that six people is very few to answer thousands of queries. On the first day they are bound to be under pressure but I think they have addressed that problem. The Senator says not but I thought there had been a change.</p>

        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_74">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_125">I am pleased to have this opportunity of setting out for the House the Government's approach to waste management, one of the most wilfully misunderstood of policy areas. I also look forward to hearing the views of Senators on the many complex aspects of the waste management agenda. There are no simple solutions in this area despite several disingenuous comments to the contrary, which suggest that we can magically spirit away a problem that is not limited to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Our waste management policy is grounded in the internationally accepted waste management hierarchy which has informed the waste policy of our counterparts across Europe. In other words, we are practising integrated waste management. We are not just making strides towards full achievement of this approach but are moving towards the top of the class in European terms. For example, in the area of recycling, we have made remarkable progress. Contrast this with our historical approach to waste management and I am sure the House will agree that we are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The very idea that waste management services could continue to be treated as the Cinderella of environmental services has long since passed. Traditionally, waste management was a local authority function with no direct involvement by central Government and no Exchequer funding of any significance was provided to the local authorities. This approach, coupled with an underdeveloped regulatory framework, effectively resulted in the application of low-cost technology solutions by local authorities in developing landfill facilities. In fact, "low-cost technology solutions" is a euphemism for simply finding a large hole and dumping as much waste as possible in the ground without paying any attention to the consequences. The net result was that we were heavily reliant on a landfill network that did not reflect, or even come close to, modern environmental standards. Clearly from both an environmental and an economic development perspective, such a situation could not continue. I would, therefore, like to turn to the challenging targets we have set ourselves to address this situation and to reflect on our achievements to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Our comprehensive policy framework for modernising our approach to waste management was set in place in the 1998 policy statement, Waste Management: Changing Our Ways. The policy approach is centred as I have said on the integrated waste management approach, based on the internationally adopted hierarchy of waste options which places greatest emphasis on waste prevention, followed by minimisation, re-use, recycling, energy recovery and, finally, the environmentally suitable disposal of residual waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">This is being achieved through a regional waste management planning process. These regional plans, which have been drafted, are being reviewed now by the relevant authorities. Much has been achieved since the first round of plans were adopted but much more needs to be achieved; "a lot done, more to do", to coin a phrase. In particular, we must deliver the high quality heavy waste infrastructure — heavy waste infrastructure is jargon that refers to things like landfill or heat treatment — which we will continue to need even if we achieve the highest ambitious waste diversion targets. I know there are concerns on the part of people in regard to the location of thermal treatment plants and landfills. We must develop public confidence by stressing that such projects must pass through physical planning and environmental licensing processes which are among the most rigorous and open in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">The overall policy context was strengthened in 2002 with the publication of Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change. These policy statements will remain the bedrock of waste management policy in Ireland in the coming years. They are designed to achieve, by 2013, the ambitious targets set out in Changing Our Ways. These include a target of recycling of 35% of municipal waste and recycling of at least 50% of construction and demolition waste by 2001, with a progressive increase to at least 85% by 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">Changing Our Ways also set out a number of complementary targets, which are aimed at increasing recycling rates, to be achieved over the same timescale. These include a diversion of 50% of household waste away from landfill, a minimum 65% reduction in biodegradable waste consigned to landfill and the development of composting and other biological treatment facilities capable of treating up to 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Putting this in context, until recently, our recycling rate was one of the lowest in Europe but now we have a much better story to tell. We are now steadily advancing towards the ambitious targets we have set. In its national waste database report for 1998, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated that only 9% of household and commercial waste was recovered for recycling in that year. The 2003 figure was 28%. The recovery rate for packaging waste is estimated to have increased from 15% in 1998 to 42% in 2003. These statistics show a very positive direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">All the indications are that the recycling position has improved even further. First, we have had the progressive roll-out of two bin collections. Dual bin collection is now available to 560,00 households — approximately 42% of all households nationally. There is the continued expansion of the bring bank network with over 1,800 bring banks currently in place compared to around 850 bring banks in 1998. An increased network of civic amenity recycling centres and waste transfer stations are being progressively put in place. There are now 61 civic amenity sites around the country, with more planned, accepting a very wide range of materials for recycling. Some local authorities have been particularly adventurous in this regard and they are to be complimented. The roll-out of the pay-by-use charging system is a potentially significant stimulus to more emphasis by individual households on recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">The expansion in the waste recycling infrastructure I have described has been substantially assisted by funding provided to local authorities from the environment fund. The fund itself was a very significant change in the approach to State funding of waste infrastructure both in terms of its objectives and that its income is derived from environmental levies. This in itself is in line with best international practice in applying the polluter pays principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">Using the fund, a capital grants scheme established in 2002 has provided €50 million to over 90 projects, from bring banks to composting facilities, materials recovery facilities and civic amenity sites. The House will appreciate that it would be remiss of me in discussing our waste management challenge not to deal with the issue of waste enforcement. While enforcement of waste regulations is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement, I am determined to ensure that whatever resources are required to tackle the problem of illegal dumping are made available and that current initiatives we are taking will succeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">The Office of Environmental Enforcement established by the Government just over one year ago has consolidated environmental enforcement activity through the establishment of a national enforcement network. This network is harnessing the collective resources, expertise and investigative capacity of all the agencies engaged in stamping out illegal activity in Ireland. The network pools and co-ordinates the resources of the local authorities, the Garda Síochána, the Environment and Heritage Service in Northern Ireland and my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">This all-island approach to what is environmental crime is resulting in a step-up in actions against unauthorised waste movement, including roadblocks and inspections of premises. The initial focus of the network is in dealing with unauthorised waste activity in Ireland and, in particular, the issue of illegal cross-Border movement of waste from the Republic to Northern Ireland. The network is bringing a level of consistency and focus to waste enforcement in Ireland that did not exist prior to its establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">The office has commissioned a study, to be completed in mid-2005, on unauthorised waste activities. This will include establishing the extent of unauthorised activities, reviewing current procedures and developing improved guidance for investigation of unauthorised activities. I am satisfied that these comprehensive new structures are delivering a significantly enhanced waste enforcement system. The allocation of over €7 million funding this year for dedicated waste enforcement staff to local authorities, coupled with the efforts of the enforcement network in co-ordinating activities and providing training, means that we are now in a better position to identify and suppress irregular waste movements and illegal cross-Border waste trafficking. Each and every citizen, corporate and private, has a responsibility in this regard. Whether it is a householder or a big corporation that is approached with an offer to dump waste in an unauthorised way, they have a responsibility to which I hope they will live up.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">I am determined that all of the legal and administrative resources of the relevant State agencies will be brought to bear in dealing with this problem. In support of this "get tough" approach I shall shortly be using my power under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001 to issue a policy direction designed to bring a clearer focus on how to deal with waste disposed of illegally and those responsible for it. I am urging all of the enforcement authorities to see this activity as environmental crime and to act accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">While making these points I am happy to acknowledge that the vast majority of those engaged in waste management activates do so in an entirely lawful manner. We have seen the emergence of a strong waste management industry to complement the services, whether infrastructure or collection services, provided by local authorities. This, however, has created new issues that must be addressed. These centre on price setting and the potential for anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to emerge whether in the public or private segment of the market. For this reason I am currently giving careful consideration to what we must do to develop a vibrant but properly regulated waste market.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">I trust that I have made it clear that the Government has a real and serious intent to tackle the waste challenge. The results we want will not be achieved overnight but will be if we all pull in the same direction. The performance indicators being used show that we are making progress. The Irish public has demonstrated its willingness to join the war against waste, the race against waste, and is to be congratulated on its efforts. Individual householders in particular warrant our congratulations. People are making real efforts everywhere with a bring bank or a recycling centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">I thank Members of the House for providing me with the opportunity to address them on this important matter and I await with interest their individual comments during the course of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">I will in due course. I went on to say that it is time to have a debate on waste management because it is evident that there are differences in the Government on this issue. Waste management in Ireland has become a deeply contentious and divisive issue, particularly in regard to incineration with "nimbyism", now the buzzword for some political parties, who are saying yes to incineration but no to incinerators in their own back yards.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_147">In particular I refer to the Progressive Democrats' incinerator policy and call on Deputy Sexton, who is a Progressive Democrats Deputy from Longford, to come clean on that document in the light of her recent comments on radio, which do not tally with her party's stated aims. This followed the publication of the facts concerning a certain Galway-based Progressive Democrats Deputy. With the backing of his party he has proposed the building of a super incinerator sited in the midlands, which he unbelievably and shockingly described as underdeveloped and deserted. This is laughable coming from the man who said in 2003 "I oppose incineration and I have not changed on that". It seems he has changed his mind, as long as an incinerator is not positioned in his own back yard. That it would be acceptable anywhere but in his home county is obviously a big part of the PD policy in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Deputy Sexton in the meantime has stated on radio that the PDs are against mass burn incinerators but recent developments have given the lie to that. As a member of the Progressive Democrats and a public representative for Longford-Westmeath in the heart of the midlands, she must clarify her position on this outrageous plan, which has the backing of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who both plan to bring it before the Cabinet. Deputy Sexton had the nerve to call me a liar on Shannonside Radio when I produced the facts on this sad charade. She accused me for pointing out the facts but she should be ashamed of her behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">The Galway Deputy who first mooted this plan has effectively ruled out a proposed incinerator for Galway. Senator Brady referred to Fine Gael's policy in Meath. The PD candidate for the by-election in Meath has stated on national television that she is not against incinerators in all circumstances, only when they may be located in Meath. Deputy Sexton is trying to muddy the waters. She and her party need to produce straight answers to questions that are of the utmost importance to the midlands and avoid accusing others of lying.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">If we were to look at Deputy Sexton's record of telling it like it is, we would have to ask who it was that promised the setting up of Cardinal Health was a done deal prior to the last general election. It was the self-same Progressive Democrats Deputy for Longford. Was that pledge kept? The answer is no, as all the disappointed people of Longford know too well. This was allied to other pre-election promises made by Deputy Sexton, including those concerning child care facilities. There are currently nine communities waiting for assistance under the child care programme. That no such assistance has materialised leaves her record on delivery very much in question. I have worked extremely hard with people in Longford and have submitted many Adjournment motions on this issue. I hope the assistance can be delivered shortly.</p>

Deputy Sexton and her party must answer some questions. Are the Progressive Democrats now in favour of mass burn incinerators? If so, why does Deputy Grealish want to situate those incinerators in the midlands? What does Ms Sexton really know about this plan and why is she trying to avoid the issue? This has happened again and again, demonstrating a split between Fianna Fáil and the PDs on waste management policy. The Minister should ensure that the PD whip whips Deputy Sexton into line on this.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_157">It is shameful that a member of the Government parties should act in this manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Under the proposed PD national plan, a mass incinerator would be built to cover the total needs of the country and, according to the party, it would almost certainly be sited in the midlands, despite the commitment in the Progressive Democrats' local election manifesto that the party remains opposed to mass burn incinerators, where every possible type of waste is dumped into a great furnace and burned.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I also remain opposed to these incinerators and, unlike the Progressive Democrats, I will stick to that view. Fine Gael does not believe that incinerators are the solution. Along with my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, I support an alternative policy based on recycling. Currently the State recycles less than 8% of our waste, well below European levels. Fine Gael has a target of 50% recycling of household waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Among the key issues that Fine Gael wishes to highlight in current Government policy is the lack of universal waiver system for waste charges. The hardship caused by the refusal of the Government to deal with this issue is a disgrace. We have been subjected to harrowing calls from elderly people on "Liveline" and other programmes on local and national media articulating the difficulty that these charges will cause. It is sickening to see the Government parties, who profess to a Pauline conversion in terms of compassion, who say they have changed and are about inclusion and caring administration after Inchydoney, sit in stony silence as this national debate lingers on.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">As far back as July 2003, Fine Gael was in complete opposition to the Government stance on this issue. The right to a waiver is a statutory one for those who qualify and is granted strictly on hardship grounds. At present, in areas where local authorities sub-contract private companies to arrange collection of household waste, the householder pays the private collector. In cases where the poor and the elderly enjoyed the waiver on hardship grounds, they are now being forced to pay the private collector or their waste will not be collected. Many people have been left in limbo as a result and they are annoyed with the Government's attitude to a waiver scheme. At the moment, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, through the local authorities, compensates hardship cases for the effect of the withdrawal of this waiver system. The Minister refuses to continue to do this and the most marginalised people in Ireland are now being hit again. With refuse collection charges of up to €700 per year, this is a massive burden on the elderly, the sick and the long-term unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">In 2003, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's response to Fine Gael when questioned on this subject at the Oireachtas committee on the environment was to tell these people to apply for supplementary allowance from their health boards. This is totally and utterly unacceptable and the new Minister must immediately take steps to ensure that the thousands of people affected by the loss of this waiver will be helped out by his Department through the local authorities. It is another example of the Government imposing a stealth tax except this time it is hitting the old, the elderly, the sick and the long-term unemployed.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">This Government's record on waste management is embarrassing. According to the EPA, household and commercial waste in Ireland has increased by over 60% in the five years to 2002. That means that every man, woman and child generates 600 kg of waste every year. In Ireland, 2.1 million tonnes of household and commercial waste were generated in 2001 — an increase of 46% since 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">What is the Government's reaction when illegally dumped material is found at the Drogheda bypass? It covered it up and it only came to light following extensive probing by Fine Gael. There are questions to be answered and the Government must reveal where exactly the material was discovered, where it was disposed of, the quantity of the material and what it consisted of, whether gardaí were notified of the discovery and why the general public and the media were not informed. This shows once again how the Government continually pulls the wool over our eyes for its own ends.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Ireland's record on recycling is deplorable by European standards. We recycle less than 8% of our household waste compared with 46% in Austria, 44% in Holland, 40% in Belgium and 30% in Denmark. Already our landfill sites are at 86% capacity. In recent weeks we have been treated to reports that the State's only tyre recycling centre has shut down, the only paper mill recycling plant has closed its doors and the shocking fact that almost 70% of Ireland's recyclable waste is exported. There is a total lack of any political will in Government to drive forward the environment agenda. We have a Government that cares about roads, money and votes — all important, but only part of a bigger picture this Government cannot comprehend. It is left to the Opposition to make it accountable on these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">If I had time, I could speak until 6 p.m. pointing out the shortfalls in Government policy on waste management. I plead with the Minister not to poison this nation. Less than 1 g of the dioxin waste from an incinerator could kill 10,000 people. We do not want any lives to be taken by the Minister or the Government. I hope he takes note of our remarks on this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome the Minister to the House. This is a complex debate but it is a relevant issue, there was even a discussion this morning on "Morning Ireland" about the difficulties in Cork with illegal dumping. The city manager in Cork assured us that his staff were dealing with the issue and collecting waste on a regular basis. There have been many scares recently and we have heard a lot about illegal dumping. I condemn what is happening, as I have done on previous occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">We have moved on from the time where every town in County Galway had a small, unlicensed landfill site. Many people wanted those landfills closed down. Their only advantage was the free service but people are now prepared to accept the principle of the polluter pays. There are now fewer landfills licensed and regulated by the EPA. I would be much more positive than Senator Bannon in regard to the recycling issue. The position has improved but we may not have reached a point where we are as good as other countries in Europe. We have come a long way since 1998 when we talked about 9% recycling whereas we have now reached a level of 28%. This matter is being discussed in schools. Some good booklets on the environment and the importance of preserving it have been produced in the European Union office in Molesworth Street, some of which I have taken to schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">The last report of the EPA, the third EPA state of the environment report, had some positive things to say about the environment and the way in which we deal with waste management. A welcome development is that we are investing money in waste management. We have gone from being over-reliant on landfill to looking at issues of recycling. This has been welcomed by local authorities, although, as the Minister said, some local authorities are better than others. We are now considering recovering energy from landfills. In 2004, one of the issues I welcomed was the provision of funding of €36,000 to Limerick County Council and Ballinasloe Town Council to prepare model contracts for landfill gas to energy projects. We have had a landfill at Poolboy in Ballinasloe for many years. It was a welcome announcement that funding was to be provided with a view to getting gas from that landfill. In 2004, Galway County Council received €125,000 for bring banks, €128,000 for civic amenities and Galway City Council received €80,000 for bring banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">There are now more bins in Galway city because of the availability of contractors and the great work done by Rehab in providing more bins. In rural Galway, there are two bins. In many parts of the country there are plans to provide a second bin for household waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">I wish to refer briefly to a comment made by the Minister at the end of his speech in regard to the monopoly on waste collection. It appears that some counties have only one or two contractors. The Minister referred to the potential for anti-competitive practices and a monopoly situation, whether public or private. This leads to the issue of waste collection costs. Those on low incomes and social welfare payments have showed me the figures and the huge increases in charges over five years for bin collections. The Minister must examine this in any review carried out. I am pleased to note that in the past two or three years bin collection charges have remained at the same rate. When we seek a waiver we are told it is a private collection and that nothing can be done. This is disappointing for many people. The Minister will recall parliamentary party debates on a standard rate charge, which some local authorities can provide. Sometimes within one county there are different rates, for example, in the city of Galway, in rural Galway or Ballinasloe. People are concerned about this and particularly the absence of a waiver scheme, to which we had become accustomed in regard to water charges. I hope the review, to which the Minister referred, will take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The Minister referred also to the illegal cross-Border movement of waste from the Republic into Northern Ireland. Down through the years we had been familiar with various types of cross-Border activity — smuggling and so on. This is another issue that has led to concern. I hope the Minister will take whatever action he can to ensure illegal dumping does not happen. He mentioned, in particular, the Office of Environmental Enforcement, which is important to progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">As others have said this issue could be the Cinderella of local authority services and environmental legislation. In most towns and villages there are bring banks and various facilities for recycling clear and coloured glass. A concern I have raised with our county manager is that if a person is providing a bottle bank he or she should empty it on a regular basis. There is nothing so disgusting as bottles left outside a bottle bank. Some people are too lazy to place their bottles or other recyclable goods into the banks. This has led to some towns and villages losing the facility. I hope that where a facility such a bottle bank is provided it is maintained, cleaned and emptied on a regular basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">There is also the question of public awareness which is well provided for in schools but not so well provided for those who left school many years ago. I hope an improvement can be made in this area. The policy framework for modernising our approach to waste management, Waste Management: Changing Our Ways, was a positive document. It recognised there were many different options in regard to waste. There is no one-off solution in this complex area. Senator Bannon gave us a great insight into incineration. I would not start with incineration if I was talking about waste management, given that we have regional plans for 40% recycling——</p>

          <p eId="para_176">——40% thermal treatment and 20% disposed into landfill. Therefore, there are various options for a sustainable waste management infrastructure. We should look at all the options and not simply incineration. In fairness to the Progressive Democrats Deputy, to whom the Senator referred, his party at least had the option for Galway City Council to have an incinerator. In most European countries if incinerators are not located in the cities they are near the cities because there is a question of recovery of energy from those developments. I am glad we have had this debate. I would be much more positive than Senator Bannon in regard to developments. I hope discussion of the issues of minimising and reducing waste will also positively deal with the question of recycling. The points I made about bottle banks are very relevant. We do not want bottle banks to become another litter nightmare in towns or cities where citizens are trying to develop recycling facilities and keep their environment as clean as possible.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_90">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_177">I welcome the Minister to the House. He will be aware of my interest in the subject of waste management and I welcome what he had to say in his contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I am a great believer in the policies that have been put forward for reducing and recycling waste but the House should make an effort to implement the policies it is suggesting to individuals outside the House. It is the effort of so many individuals that has caused the significant reduction in household waste and packaging.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I have raised this issue before in the House. I ask the Minister to insist that all ministerial speeches are printed on both sides of the paper. This would halve the amount of paper used by Departments. Unfortunately, documents of this House are printed on one side of the paper only. It would be a significant start if the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government printed its documents on both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">As the Progressive Democrats have been mentioned already, I refer to the frequent request of former Senator Máirín Quill that Senators only receive copies of reports they request rather than every report which is published. I ask the Acting Chairman to forgive me for raising this issue but now that reports are also published in the Irish language, they are thicker than ever. Senators now receive a large number of reports and due to lack of time rather than interest, many cannot take the opportunity to read them completely either in English or in Irish. I ask the House to consider this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">At one stage the reuse of large brown envelopes was encouraged. I used to bring my envelopes to the General Office for recycling but this scheme seems to have fallen into abeyance. It was a suggestion of mine that the Houses of the Oireachtas should buy recycled paper for use in the photocopiers and this is used everywhere now.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The efforts made by the public regarding the reduction of waste have been extraordinary. We must be a most adaptable and versatile nation because we took to life without the plastic bag like ducks to water. The amount of litter this measure has done away with is astonishing. It is now very rare to see barbed wire entangled with plastic bags. At one stage the plastic bags on the barbed wire were so thick it provided good shelter. These bags were a curse on the nation and they frequently harmed animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">One of the most depressing aspects of our dependency on landfill was that very often some of the best land in the country was used as landfill where it was adjacent to large conurbations. I listen with terror to some of the suggestions for the opening-up of landfill in north County Dublin when one considers the extent and importance of horticulture in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I understand the concerns expressed about incineration. The real problem with incinerators is not the health hazards but rather that they do not encourage people to minimise waste. It is too easy to keep creating waste if one believes it will all be burned. The dioxins from a well-maintained incinerator are far less than those from bonfires which, although illegal, are still very enthusiastically used by some people.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">I am indebted to a lady from the Wicklow waste management facility who was speaking on the "Today with Pat Kenny" programme recently. She listed how the various forms of plastics can be reused. Some plastics have additives and others have nylon linings. These plastics are then almost impossible to recycle. Is the Minister in a position to encourage manufacturers to use recyclable plastic wherever possible? She pointed out that if yogurts were sold in glass rather than in plastic containers, they could be reused if returned to the shop. This might be a possibility because people have become very good at using the bring centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The Minister referred to the bring centres and they are a success. I cannot speak too highly of the two centres in Bath Avenue and Ringsend. This is the place where the chattering classes go on Saturday afternoons in Dublin 4, bringing along their bits and pieces. The centres are beautifully kept. I have never seen them in the state of other centres referred to by Senator Kitt where bottle banks are overflowing. My local centres have always been kept in perfect order and I compliment them.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">It was a little depressing to read in the newspapers that all the tetra pack and plastic cartons which one had so carefully segregated were in fact re-mixed in some sites. If the public is being encouraged to segregate waste, then a great effort should be made to promote this new industry of recycling. It was interesting to hear how much of our plastic waste is exported to China where it can be made into other sorts of plastic materials, such as various types of cloth.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Polystyrene is a curse of a product. It does not appear to be possible to do anything with it. Is the Minister aware of any means to minimise its use? I acknowledge it is a very useful packaging material and it protects items from breakage. I suggest that bubble pack which is recyclable could be used instead. I ask the Minister to consider punitive taxes on the use of polystyrene. If one piece of polystyrene breaks, it goes everywhere and it is very difficult to clean up.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The Minister referred to the significant improvement in the reuse of construction and demolition materials. I recently had a small amount of work carried out at my home by a company who then informed me it was my responsibility to dispose of the bits of electrical wiring and plaster which were left over from their work. I had the impression that the customer is always in the wrong by the time I had finished discussing this with them. Is it the customer's responsibility to deal with leftover demolition products?</p>
          <p eId="para_190">The Minister will be aware of my interest in the subject of the disposal of tyres, as I raised this matter on the Adjournment. I was depressed to hear Senator Bannon state that the only facility for dealing with these tyres has closed down due to lack of supply, which was previously discussed in this House. During that debate, I made the point that farmers in Northern Ireland must pay a fee to retain a certain number of tyres on their land for use over silage pits and so forth. Will the Minister consider this method? The fee is not excessive, approximately £250, but its use might mean that tyres are not dumped on farms.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The scandal of the dumping of electrical appliances in vast numbers in west Dublin should be examined. We must ensure that the national enforcement network has all the powers and manpower as well as money required to stop this practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">I noted with interest the publication by a newspaper the other day of the names of those fined under the Litter Act. It is clear, given that several names cropped up several times, that more than a fine is required to get certain people to desist from their wilful ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">It is vital that we deal with toxic waste because we cannot continue to move it around Europe or elsewhere. Hospital waste is another serious problem. It is disgraceful that it has ended up on illegal dumps. Anyone who produces toxic waste, including hospital waste, must ensure it is properly disposed of as it could seriously damage water courses. While disposing of waste in quarries appears to be an easy solution, it may affect water courses, as was the case in County Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Minister may have heard a doctor from the Irish Medical Organisation point out on radio this morning the serious problems which could arise due to uncollected rubbish being left on streets. They are primarily caused by rats attacking the rubbish which could lead to the development of problems such as Weil's disease. Infection can spread through rat bites or rat urine on products such as rubbish bags and bins and so forth. Rubbish collection should be paid for in view of the fact that we no longer pay rates but what does the Minister propose to do as regards those who refuse to pay?</p>

          <p eId="para_195">I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in seeking to fulfil his responsibility to find solutions to waste management issues. The Government has achieved a great deal since the 1998 policy statement, Waste Management: Changing Our Ways, all of it with all-party support and co-operation. Elected members reached consensus on every aspect of the waste management plans adopted by local authorities and the eight regional authorities. It is now the responsibility of the Minister to implement the wishes of the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Many of the objectives of the regional plans have been achieved and they are being reviewed by the relevant bodies. However, we do not have all the solutions. Thermal treatment, for example, has been mentioned in every regional plan, although the viability of having a thermal treatment plant in each region is open to question. Public authorities have commissioned consultants to produce reports at considerable cost. Having cost an arm and a leg the final reports have been the same. The Minister, in his wisdom, will have to review the current plans to determine the best national plan which will be acceptable to the public. I wish him well in his efforts, for which he has the full support of the Government parties.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">When considering waste management we must look back to the position from which we started. In the mid-1990s, less than a decade ago, waste became the final environmental issue to be subject to modern legislation and policy development. Until then, it had not been considered important. At that time, we relied on low cost, poorly managed landfills, had no recycling facilities or biological treatment of waste and public awareness of the consequences of our actions in the area of waste was low. One of the main changes during the short intervening period has been a large increase in public awareness.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">We are moving rapidly towards having a small number of regulated landfills licensed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Some biological treatment and energy recovery also takes place and this is important. Contrary to comments made by previous speakers, recycling rates have increased from 9% in 1998, shortly after the Opposition parties left office, to 30% currently.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">Perhaps the most dramatic and noticeable development has been the high level of public awareness about the necessity of change. People understand the reason we are introducing waste management measures. Successive advertising and public information campaigns and initiatives such as the Green Flag for schools have generated environmental concerns, particularly among young people, whose future depends on our awareness of the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Despite all the information provided and money spent in recent decades, 72% of our municipal waste continues to be sent to landfill. While the figure is falling — it declined by 4% in the past year — we must seek alternatives. As the Minister pointed out, we have invested in 1,800 bring banks and 60 civic amenity sites. I have experienced a major change in my constituency where the North Strand Road recycling centre was forced to restrict its opening hours because the queues of people trying to get to the centre were interfering with the lives of local residents and causing traffic jams on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">All these developments, the results of policies pursued in the past ten years, are paying significant dividends. We must plan ahead, however. The current policy objective is to achieve 40% recycling, 40% thermal treatment and 20% landfill. Even with thermal treatment, landfill will continue to be required because we cannot burn everything. I understand, for example, that 10% of waste must be disposed of in landfill facilities. One cannot argue that there is only one solution. All options must be used and we must have a comprehensive framework for waste management.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The regional waste management plans are proving to be highly successful and provide an integrated approach with set, monitored targets. They will provide for sustainable waste management infrastructure which is crucial because we must sustain changes in future.</p>

Many were sited in the middle of towns, providing alternate energy sources including heating and electricity. They were totally safe and accepted as such in the communities. As part of an overall framework, these facilities contribute to that country's image as a clean, modern and progressive state. We have no alternative to this policy. Any commentators——</p>

          <p eId="para_222">I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to the House and look forward to his summing up.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Over the years, this has been the most divisive issue discussed in the House. When debating waste management, we must acknowledge that we, as a people, are dirty and do not have a culture of looking after our waste properly. Three years ago, while on holiday, I wondered if, as an experiment, the community on the peninsula on which I was staying could look after its energy needs and dispose of its waste. Such an arrangement could be a model for communities in the future. To encourage such models, residents would be entitled to an appropriate tax break.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The biggest problem in dealing with waste is that people do not want to take responsibility for it. The biggest argument is always about in whose back yard the waste will be disposed. An honest debate on incinerators is needed. I agree with Senator Brady's comments. While I am no expert in the area, all I have read leads me to believe we must acknowledge the part incinerators have in waste management. Unless it is proved otherwise, incineration is cleaner than other methods of disposal. We were all raised with the back yard burning approach to getting rid of waste, which still happens. However, the most basic scientific studies show that this throws more dioxins into the atmosphere than an incinerator. I have argued this point with my Green colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Exporting thousands of tonnes of waste every year to China cannot continue. If people get excited and energised by the costs and waste of energy involved in importing kiwi fruits from New Zealand, they should be equally energised about Ireland sending its dirt to China to be dealt with there. That is not good practice for the future. Landfill is finished and we cannot continue to employ this method.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I agree with Senator Bannon that recycling is simply not happening. Every week in my house, the car is loaded up with materials to go from north County Dublin into a city bring centre, as there are not enough in my area. After Christmas, all the bottle banks were spilling their contents on to the road, as they were not emptied. This problem must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Waste management needs to be examined on an individual basis. Too much of the debate has taken place on a national and local level. I want the debate to take place on a household level. Every house needs a green bin but this is not happening. For example, there are no green bins in the Fingal County Council area, a council which I consider progressive. Every house must have a composter in the back garden, with large houses required to have heat driven turbo composters. Any user of a composter knows how impossible it is to fill them. I congratulate Fingal County Council on being the first to introduce the pay-by-volume bin collection system. One only pays when one puts one's bin out, a huge incentive for people to delay putting their bins out.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">There is also a national public and governmental responsibility to keep our country clean. Some waste collections must be done. Will the Minister recognise that some people, such as the elderly, cannot afford to pay for waste collection, even on a volume basis? To resolve this, a national waiver scheme must be introduced to bring uniformity to the matter. I am sick and tired of hearing debates on the difference in collection charges between Fingal, South County Dublin, Kildare and Kerry County Councils. An element of conformity must be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">We can learn much from young people on recycling. Every house should be required to have a green bin and a composter. The introduction of turbo composters should be examined. A real and unbiased debate, without spin, is needed on incinerators. I know of no country that has implemented an acceptable national waste disposal programme without including incineration. Can communities be incentivised through tax breaks to take responsibility for their waste? As long as a community looks after the waste from its nearest town, it will be understandably resentful. The bottle banks must be in clean, easily accessible locations with safe parking and must be emptied regularly. I have studied some newer models in other countries and much progress has been made in new approaches. Is it necessary for the bottles to be colour sorted between green, brown and clear? Colour sorting only slows the process. We should be proud that we were the first country in Europe to get rid of the plastic bag. It was an extraordinary move. People complied with the regulation, showing themselves to be flexible. That other countries have followed suit is a good sign.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Approximately ten years ago, one of the Minister's predecessors, who went on to become a famous, if not infamous, EU Commissioner, had the idea of ridding this country of drink cans, which is the next issue at which we must look. Over the past 20 years, I have seen how we have dealt with this issue. Friends of mine were involved in a huge campaign 15 years ago to get rid of CFCs, chlorofluorocarbons, emanating from pieces of plastic which were being used by all the fast food joints at that time. They are no longer used. We have moved on in many ways. Let us acknowledge that movement and keep moving forward. I wish this was a non-party political debate. We must all shoulder and share this responsibility and there are measures which could be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Will the Minister take on board the idea of a community in a set geographical area, such as a peninsula, taking responsibility for its own waste disposal and energy requirements? The new 1.6 MW generators in west Kerry could look after all that area's electricity needs and, by my calculations, could even sell some. It would also be possible to have some type of waste disposal scheme. One could offer the residents of a community tax breaks if it looked after its energy requirements and its waste. That is worth thinking about. It is creative and is worth doing to see how it works.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">I am delighted the Minister has been able to join us for this debate. I thank the Leader for arranging this discussion, for which we have been calling for the past couple of weeks. I am opposed to the concept of incineration as a method of reducing or getting rid of waste. That is a strongly held personal view. I was a member of the local authority in a city that introduced one of the first waste recycling schemes in the country, which has been hugely successful. The environmental progress report presented to Galway City Council last Monday evening stated that in 2004, Galway City County diverted, through recycling, 57.5% of waste. Some 10,431 tonnes of rubbish were diverted from landfill. In the past four years, the city has gone from one which sent everything to landfill to one which now recycles over 57% of its rubbish. There is composting, kerbside recycling and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Cities, towns and county councils throughout the country are learning from, and investing in, various recycling projects. Not only are county and city councils introducing such initiatives but people are beginning to learn and to think about recycling, reduction and, increasingly, about reuse. That is what is needed. I know the Minister is open and I plead with him to give us a chance in respect of waste management and to consider a moratorium on introducing incineration as a method of getting rid of waste. I strongly suggest incineration is something we do not need. I will not engage in scaremongering that incineration kills everybody, dioxins will be emitted and we will all die from cancer. However, incineration emits more dioxins into the atmosphere.</p>

          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_235">A municipal waste incinerator will emit dioxins. If we do not have a municipal waste incinerator, these dioxins will not be emitted. I am not saying dioxins will not be emitted by other methods of waste disposal but why introduce a technology into a country which is clean and green and which has not had this type of technology heretofore? Why introduce this technology when we can simply wait a number of years to ascertain whether we actually need it? The people in Galway have taken recycling to their hearts and have, against all the odds, been able to show the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government a success story that over 57% of waste in Galway is recycled.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">We talk about the waste pyramid, reuse, recycling and reduction. In regard to reduction, there is the wonderful example of the plastic bag levy introduced by the Minister's Department and the former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey. People thought it was mad and would not work but Ireland is held up throughout Europe as an example of how one can actually do something successfully. It has been a most successful initiative. If we use our imagination, determination and the goodwill of the people, we can introduce other initiatives to reduce waste.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The Minister might consider the following example. When people go shopping in supermarkets, they buy many different products which are wrapped in cardboard boxes and plastic bags. One of my pet hates is that when one buys dishwasher tablets or tablets for the washing machine, they come individually wrapped in non-recyclable material and in a box which is generally wrapped in plastic. We should put a tax on such products because there is no need for those tablets to be individually wrapped. One manufacturer, from whom I try to buy, does not wrap these tablets, so it has reduced the amount of wrapping.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Toothpaste comes with wrapping around the top of it, so is there a need for it to come in a box with a plastic cover? Is there a need for all the extra wrapping on cereals? Should we say to manufacturers who want to sell their products in Ireland that they have a responsibility? We say to the manufacturers of fridges and computers that they must in-build recycling into their products as it is part of the EU directive. Why do we not say to the producers of everyday products to cut out the excess packaging? Why do we not put a tax on such products to act as a disincentive? Why do we not give manufacturers a year to look at their packaging to see what they can reduce and say that if they can do so satisfactorily, we will not have to introduce a tax?</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The people have welcomed the concept of waste recycling, reuse and composting with open arms — we only have to see the green flags around towns, cities and in schools. Schools educate children who now understand the concept of recycling. Children take rubbish home from school and place it in recycling bags, or they certainly do in my house. We wash out yoghurt cartons, Coke bottles and plastic and recycle them; they do not go to landfill.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Without getting into the emotive arguments on incineration as a method of waste disposal, I plead with the Minister to look at the bigger picture, to see how successful we have been in trying to reduce the amount of waste and to say perhaps we do not need incinerators in Connacht, Ulster, Munster, Leinster or one large municipal incinerator in the centre of the country, to which waste will be transported. It is not fair to inflict that on any community.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Perhaps we can find other ways to achieve the targets set out in the EU directive while at the same time ensuring that we do not introduce a technology most people would prefer not to see. We have a chance to prove ourselves as we have done with the plastic bag levy and with recycling. As a nation, we will be delighted to take the opportunity to prove that those who think we cannot do it are wrong.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, to the House to discuss this important issue. I am sure previous speakers have made some of the points I am about to make, but this is an opportune time for me to raise some matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The issue of illegal dumping is of particular interest to me. I attended a public meeting in Tullow, County Carlow, last weekend. A number of residents of that area asked me about the polluter pays principle. We all agree with the lofty and noble principle that those who are responsible for producing waste should foot the bill for its removal. Illegal dumping is getting out of control in many parts of the country, however. There is a considerable amount of State forestry in my local area and there has been a substantial increase in the level of illegal dumping in such wooded areas since Christmas. A great deal of the rise in such activity can be attributed to the dramatic increases in refuse collection charges in many local authority areas. This aspect of the matter has not been considered as part of the argument on the polluter pays principle. Something needs to be done as a matter of urgency to ensure that such activity, which is a blight on our landscape, is eradicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">I am sure all Senators can name several places in their local areas where illegal dumping is a considerable problem. I do not suggest that it is an easy problem to solve, but certain actions can be taken. A national newspaper this week published a list of the names of organisations which have been fined for illegal dumping or littering. All local authorities need to take such action, sadly, to ensure that those who are convicted of illegal dumping are named and shamed, a phrase that has been used by Senator Leyden. That is the only way to ensure that the practice, which is having terrible effects on all parts of the country, including many scenic areas, can be stamped out as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">During this debate on waste management, it is opportune to discuss the existing proposals for incinerators in various parts of the country. The projects have moved past the proposal stage in some places. The South-East Regional Authority has published a couple of reports on waste management. There are indications that incineration will be pursued, but I am not convinced it is the final solution to our waste problem. If we adopt that approach in every part of the country, we will remove a significant part of the incentive for people to reuse, recycle and reduce the waste they produce.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">If incinerators are built in the various regions, I expect they will be managed by private companies in most cases. Such companies have a perfectly legitimate right to expect to earn a profit for what they do, but it is obvious they will be keen to burn as much waste as possible as part of the profit-making process. That is in direct contradiction of the policies of the Government and my party, which are keen to reduce the amount of waste being disposed of. It is difficult to square the two arguments. I urge the Government to show caution and restraint and to ensure all other options are exhausted before the option of incineration is pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">There has been a significant increase in recent years in the proportion of the waste produced in County Kilkenny that is recycled. Senators are aware there have been dramatic improvements throughout the country. In some cases, the percentage of waste that is recycled has increased from a base of 3% or 4%. The percentage of County Kilkenny's waste that is recycled has increased to 23% or 24% and continues to increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Many of the bring centres found throughout the country are unable to cope with the increase in recycling. While the Rehab Group and some other organisations are doing tremendous work, it seems that recycling is almost becoming a victim of its success in some parts of the country. The recycling bins used at bring centres are constantly full or overflowing. People often arrive at bring centres with cars full of segregated rubbish only to find that the recycling bins are full. They often leave bags of bottles and tin cans beside the bins, which is an open invitation to other unscrupulous people to dump bags of mixed household refuse in such locations. I encourage the operators of such centres to keep them in as good a condition as possible and to ensure that recycling bins are emptied often, so that people are not given an opportunity to engage in illegal dumping at such places.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I urge the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bear in mind that any decision to pursue a policy of incineration would remove a significant part of the incentive, which has been developed successfully in recent years, to reduce the amount of waste produced by each household. I urge the Minister and the Department to think seriously about the matter before taking such a retrograde step.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Roche, and his officials. I welcome the significant progress that has been made in the relatively recent past. There was a time when bottle banks were the only recycling facilities available. We have started to adopt a policy of waste separation, which has been pursued in continental Europe for many years. I have experience of household waste management in a rural area — south Tipperary, where the waste collection service is operated by a private contractor — and in an urban area — Dún Laoghaire, where it is operated by the local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I would like to the draw the Minister's attention to the unintended operation of financial incentives, an issue that was raised by Senator John Paul Phelan and others. The countryside cleaned up greatly when the plastic bag tax was introduced. My colleague, Senator White, has reminded me that the idea for that successful initiative emerged from a Fianna Fáil policy group. I regret that dumped bags full of rubbish are appearing on our roadsides to a greater extent in recent months than was previously the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_253">The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that people who are not willing to pay refuse collection charges are putting their rubbish into their cars and dumping it at the side of the road. The Minister should review the matter with the local authorities. I endorse the "name and shame" notion mentioned by Senator Phelan. People who engage in the activity I have mentioned do not belong in jail, unless they are doing it on an industrial scale, but they should be prosecuted and fined because they are causing significant harm to the community. Lists of the names of people found guilty of this anti-social practice should be published from time to time, for example, in local newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">I referred earlier to bottle banks. I have always wondered what one should do with blue bottles — I put them in the space reserved for green bottles.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">I was in the Oireachtas Library before I came to the Chamber. I glanced through various publications which one would not normally buy, including <i>An Phoblacht</i>, which has devoted two pages to anti-bin protests.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Regardless of who promotes the campaign, be it the Socialist Workers Party, Sinn Féin or another party, it is entirely without merit. People can apply for waivers from their local authority if they cannot afford the cost of refuse collection.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">There is nothing left-wing about this campaign. I understand that left-wing policies are supposed to be about community solidarity, for example. The idea that refuse collection costs should only be paid for out of general taxation is flawed because people would have no incentive whatsoever to reduce the amount of waste they produce. The campaign is without intellectual or ideological merit. It is an appeal to people's selfishness rather than to their sense of solidarity. The Minister showed great skill in dealing with some of the false ideological arguments in campaigns on European treaties and other matters and he should address this argument in a similar fashion. I am sure he is doing so to some extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The campaign represents the most tired form of politics I have ever seen.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">On landfill and incineration, we sometimes talk as if landfill is an environmentally clean and desirable method of waste disposal. It is anything but that. In many respects, it is a filthy way of dealing with waste. I was once involved in an issue concerning an incinerator in Tipperary. The issue, which is no longer pertinent, involved a proposal to site a bonemeal incinerator in Rosegreen. I do not have an ideological stance on incineration but I took the view that Rosegreen was not the right location.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">The incinerator would not have affected me one way or the other, that was not the issue. The proposed location was 30 miles away. Extreme care must be taken in determining the right location.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">If one goes to the suburbs of Vienna in Austria, one will see an incinerator that has been there for years. It looks like an art deco object. I have lived in Austria from time to time and have not read or heard any complaints about it. Austria has an extremely environmentally clean image and attracts more tourists than practically any other country in Europe. Denmark has an agricultural industry and its butter competes with ours. There is no suggestion that its very modern incinerators pose a problem. Of course there were serious problems with some incinerators 20 or 30 years ago, but the technology has improved a good deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">There is some merit in the argument that one needs to ensure there is not so much capacity that one creates a disincentive to better waste management practices. When planning, one needs to determine the overall capacity needed in the country as a whole and not go above that.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">I used to be involved in energy policy when I was in the Department of Foreign Affairs. There was much talk about combined heat and power, which is very relevant in that the energy created in the disposal of waste can be used for heating purposes.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">I would need more than five minutes to deal with some of the myths that have been trotted out in the House today. I will deal only with the major ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">No issue has been handled more dishonestly in political debate than incineration. It is simply dishonest for any politician, irrespective of where he or she comes from or the identity of his or her party, to suggest that we can somehow magically deal with the waste issue without talking about combined heat and power. It is simply dishonest because no country in Europe with a good environmental record has done so. It is also dishonest because the very councillors, Senators and Deputies who make the argument against combined heat and power would be the very first people to argue against landfill.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Senator Mansergh is absolutely correct in stating that landfill is a filthy way of dealing with our waste. Even if Senator Cox is correct that Galway City County diverted, through recycling, 57% of waste — that is a tremendous achievement by the people of Galway — 43% of waste still goes to landfill. I look forward to Senator Cox, or any other Senator, being the first to support me or somebody else if we say a landfill facility is to be created at a certain location. The same faces one will find to the fore in the dishonest debate on combined heat and power would also be to the fore in the debate against landfill.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I come from a county which has been defaced disgracefully by landfills, many of which have been established illegally. Landfill is the worst option, the last option. We should only contemplate putting inert material into landfill. The tragedy is that, because of political dishonesty, we are stuck with time bombs all over the countryside. We do not know the long-term consequences of dumping a large tonnage of waste into holes in the ground, but we do know that the lives of people who live near those dumps have been made a misery. I am acutely aware of this because of what is happening in my county. We also know that aquifers will be destroyed. If an aquifer is destroyed, it will take generations to cleanse it.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">It is not just the Government parties that have made a positive contribution to this debate. In this regard, I must give credit to Fine Gael on its Plan for the Nation of January 2000. It reads, "We must open our minds to a future which involves incineration as an integral part of a waste management strategy". It also states that "properly located, operated and monitored high-temperature incineration can be consistently operated over very long periods with no significant pollution". That is a truthful statement. The 2001 Labour Party policy document on waste states the strategy would not rule out thermal treatment, that is, incineration, or residual waste after segregation. That is also a truthful statement. Any politician who suggests we can continue to operate blithely, as we are now doing, is not being straightforward.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Another issue that has arisen for debate in recent times, that of the national waiver, has not been dealt with particularly truthfully. It was almost dealt with disingenuously. In the history of local government in Ireland, there has never been a policy under which central Government took charge of waste from all over the country. It would be wrong for it to do so. Over the years, central Government has been accused, rightly and consistently, of far too much interference in local government. If there ever was a quintessentially local policy, it is that of dealing with waste. It is up to local authorities to determine how they should deal with the need for a mitigation of the cost of introducing a waste charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I agree with Senator Mansergh that there is an incredible amount of political dishonesty on the extreme left, such that it is suggested that waste can be magicked away. I expect more from politicians from more sensible political parties. Local authorities can, if they so wish, run their own bin services. Most of them have pulled out of doing so for all sorts of obvious reasons. Where they do run bin services, they can operate waiver systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I do not wish to focus on Senator Bannon's remarks in particular, but I must state that the Fine Gael and Labour Party group in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council recently introduced a new and very ingenious system of charging. It is one of the most complex systems but, ultimately, it will probably be adopted by many other local authorities. The council actually made a reduction in respect of the waiver system. A national politician in the Lower House, not from Senator Bannon's party, called for me to intervene when his colleagues in his council had actually made a reduction in respect of a waiver system. A little political honesty would go a long way in these debates. Even where local authorities are not the providers of services, for example, in Bray and Limerick, it is possible with a little ingenuity to introduce some form of local service or waiver that mitigates the consequences of our position.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Several contributions were based on common sense. Senator Brady made the point that backyard burning, which is a feature of life and has been for many years, produces large quantities of dioxins. By contrast, all the incinerators proposed or in place would probably contribute an infinitesimal amount to pollution.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Senator Henry made a very thoughtful contribution which deserves longer consideration than I can give it now. Along with Senators Brady and O'Toole, she said political honesty in the debate is necessary. People must stop exaggerating the reality and say if we do not go in one direction what is the alternative? The tragic reality we must face is that there is no zero waste option.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">We have a responsibility to those who elect us and look to us for political leadership, which we demonstrated in the case of plastic bags. When we showed political leadership the people responded magnificently, as they are doing in regard to recycling. The people are more than capable of taking sane decisions on such issues. I wish to have a calmer, more structured and focused debate on these issues. Above all, I want more political honesty in our debates on this matter.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_286">I am pleased to introduce this, the second of two Bills intended to implement the €874 million social welfare package announced in budget 2005. The sum represents a €244 million, or almost a 40%, increase on the 2004 package of €630 million. It brings the projected level of social welfare expenditure in 2005 to more than €12.25 billion. That represents an increase of €1 billion, or almost 9%, on the allocation for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">This level of expenditure is the highest ever on social welfare. It is indicative of the Government's priority to protect and improve the living standards of social welfare recipients. It is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to addressing the needs of people with disabilities and their carers, children, the elderly, widowed persons, the unemployed, those who are parenting alone and many others who are disadvantaged, vulnerable or on the margins of society. It continues substantial year-on-year increases in social welfare spending, representing an increase of almost 60% in four years and a doubling of what was spent in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The budget for my Department, at more than €12 billion, is the largest spending allocation of any Department. I will spell out what that means in real terms. It means that for every €3 that will be spent by the Government in 2005, almost €1 will go in social welfare entitlements, benefits and supports. An estimated 970,000 people on average are expected to claim weekly social welfare payments this year. Overall, almost 1.5 million people, including dependants, will benefit from these payments. That is two out of every five people in the State who, one way or another, receive vital welfare supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Since the Government took office, Ireland has changed dramatically. The facts speak for themselves. The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.9 million. The rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.3% — the lowest in the European Union and among the lowest in the world. The number of low paid removed from the tax net has increased and, this year, all those on the minimum wage are taken out of the income tax net entirely, which is a very important step forward. Spending on social welfare has more than doubled from €5.74 billion in 1997 to an expected €12.2 billion in 2005. Over the past decade, while gross average industrial earnings increased by 71%, social welfare payments have improved by between 87% and 95%, and by even more for larger families. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes have been implemented. New social welfare benefits such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grant and respite care grant have been introduced and enhanced. The social welfare increases in budget 2005 range from more than 7% to over 10%, while inflation is expected to come in at 2.5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">I could spend a long time quoting many more facts and figures that confirm the pivotal role of my Department in the lives of so many people and the great strides that have been made in just a few years. However, the Department of Social and Family Affairs is about more than statistics. The payments, benefits and supports that go directly to almost one million people are a weekly lifeline for many struggling to make ends meet. More often than not, the Department is the final safety net for those descending towards poverty, marginalisation and economic and social distress. However, the Department is more than an efficient and effective administrative structure for processing and delivering State entitlements. It is above all about people and it must continue to be people-centred.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The response of the Department must always be to shape the welfare system to meet the individual's and family's needs. That must be, and I assure the House it will be, the guiding principle for the way my Department does its work. It will continue to react and respond speedily and sympathetically to all those who reach out to the welfare lifeline. It will not be guided only by rules and regulations that may sometimes blur the real purpose. Put simply, a one size welfare system does not necessarily fit all. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is about the welfare and overall well-being of those caught in the daily struggle to make ends meet, the children at risk of poverty, the carers who look after those unable to care for themselves, older people, the unemployed and many others who must be reached out to and supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill which amend both the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993 — the principal Act — and the Pensions Act 1990. I propose making the following amendments to the social welfare code. In the area of child income support, the Government's policy is to concentrate resources on enhancing the child benefit scheme. Child benefit now accounts for more than 66% of child income support, while in 1994 it constituted just 30%. There are sound reasons for this policy. Child benefit is both neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the child’s parents and it does not contribute to the poverty traps. As a near universal payment, child benefit is not taxable. It is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits and it is payable to the primary carer, usually the mother. When account is taken of these aspects of payment, child benefit is a most effective child income support mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Section 3 provides for increases in the monthly rates of child benefit as announced in budget 2005. The lower rate of benefit, payable in respect of each of the first two children, is being increased by €10 per month from €131.60 to €141.60. The rate for the third and each subsequent child is being increased by €12 per month, bringing the rate from €165.30 to €177.30. These increases come into effect from 1 April.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">With respect to disability benefit, payment rates are in part determined by the level of the claimant's weekly earnings. Currently, where a person in receipt of long-term unemployment assistance becomes ill or unfit for work, he or she may qualify for a reduced rate disability benefit as a consequence of having low or no earnings during the governing contribution year.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Section 4 of the Bill provides that in such cases, a person may be eligible to receive disability benefit at the maximum rate where he or she satisfies the qualifying conditions and has a minimum of 260 paid social insurance contributions and 39 credited contributions in the governing contribution year. The section further provides that these customers are exempted from the requirements to have 13 of the required 39 contributions paid and to satisfy the prescribed earnings limit. These measures take effect from the beginning of May.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Currently, where a person in receipt of injury benefit suffers a second injury and establishes entitlement to disablement benefit, the total amount payable is restricted to 100% of the disablement benefit rate. Section 5 provides for the abolition of this limit, permitting payment of disablement benefit together with the appropriate injury benefit rate and this measure is effective from 2 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I am committed to the cause of carers. I set out through the budget to recognise and support the contribution carers make in society. They provide a valued and valuable service. Everyone in this House and in society in general, knows the commitments and sacrifices involved. The package of measures that I agreed with the Minister for Finance commits additional spending of nearly €35 million to enhance supports for carers and to allow more carers qualify for entitlements.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">For example, the carer's allowance and carer's benefit payments have been increased by €14 per week, which is already in payment since January and for which I provided in last year's Social Welfare Act. Moreover, on Report Stage in the Dáil, I introduced an amendment to section 6 of the Bill. Currently, when applying for carer's benefit, a carer must have been in full-time employment for the three-month period immediately prior to the commencement of the benefit claim. Full-time employment in this context is defined as insurable employment for at least 17 hours per week or 34 hours per fortnight. Section 6 of the Bill now provides for an amendment to the qualification conditions for carer's benefit to facilitate certain seasonal and atypical workers who have difficulty meeting these employment related conditions. This amendment extends entitlement to carer's benefit to those who are in employment of 16 hours per week or 32 hours per fortnight for eight weeks within the six-month period prior to the claim. I anticipate that this more flexible arrangement will allow people who have atypical and seasonal work patterns to qualify for carer's benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">In addition, the annual respite care grant is being increased from €835 to €1,000. A total of almost 33,000 full-time carers are expected to receive this grant this year. The respite care grant is being extended to include all carers who are providing full-time care, subject to their not being employed for more than ten hours per week or in receipt of an unemployment payment or signing for unemployment credits. This will result in an estimated additional 9,200 full-time carers receiving the grant for the first time. Section 7 of the Bill provides for the implementation of all respite care grant enhancements with effect from June this year. In recognition of the particular challenges faced by those carers who are providing care for three or more people, the respite care grant will be paid in respect of each of their care recipients.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">The carers' package this year also expands the income limits for the carer's allowance by increasing the weekly means test income disregard by €20 to €270 for a single person and by €40 to €540 for a couple so that all those on average industrial incomes can qualify. This means that a couple with two children can earn up to €30,700 and receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while the same couple can earn up to €49,200 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance, free travel, the household benefits package of free schemes and the respite care grant. These improvements will result in an additional 1,000 new carers qualifying for payment and 2,400 existing carers, who are currently in receipt of a reduced payment, receiving an increase in their weekly carer's allowance payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The earnings threshold for carer's benefit recipients who work for up to ten hours per week outside the home is being increased by €120 to €270 per week. The revised earnings disregard, which will be provided for in regulations, will be effective from April. The measures announced in budget 2005, which I have outlined, along with previous initiatives, will go some way to responding to the specific needs of carers. There will be further opportunities to address the carers' issues. I will continue to meet and listen to carers in order to further develop the entitlements and supports that will best assist them in the valuable work they do. A lot has been done but we must also acknowledge that there is a lot more that should, and I assure Senators, will be done in recognising and rewarding carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">With some exceptions, disability allowance is not generally payable to a person who is residing in an institution. Section 8 of the Bill provides for the introduction of a means-tested payment of up to €35 per week for persons currently excluded from the disability allowance scheme by virtue of their residence in an institution. It is estimated that some 2,400 people will benefit from this provision, which is effective from 1 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">Section 9 of the Bill provides that the amount of capital disregarded for means test purposes for all schemes except supplementary welfare allowance, will be increased from €12,694.38 to €20,000 — an increase of over €7,300, This significant improvement is being introduced following an examination of the current arrangements for the assessment of capital and property, particularly in so far as they apply to special savings investment accounts, SSIAs. The enhanced disregard applies to all capital regardless of where it is held, be it in an SSIA, a credit union, with An Post or in any other account with a bank or other financial institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">This significantly increased disregard will mean, for example, that a single non-contributory pensioner, with no other means, can have capital of up to €28,000 and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. A single pensioner can have capital of up to €76,000 and still qualify for a minimum pension. These figures are doubled in the case of a pensioner couple.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">The SSIAs were introduced in 2001 as part of an overall Government strategy to encourage a regular savings culture among the population in general. These new measures are consistent with this strategy and are designed to ensure that social welfare means testing procedures do not act as a disincentive to claimants to become savers or to harshly penalise those who have been regular savers in the past. The provisions take effect from early April for carer's allowance and from early June for the other relevant means-tested schemes. The increase from €12,000 to €20,000, an increase of over €7,000, is a very significant measure in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">Section 10 provides for an entitlement to island allowance to those in receipt of certain payments from other EU member states that correspond to the social welfare payments with which the island allowance is normally payable. This measure takes effect with the enactment of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Section 11 standardises the transitional arrangements that were introduced following the alignment of the income tax and calendar years in 2001 for determining entitlement to certain insurance based social welfare schemes. The section confirms that the second last complete contribution year continues to be used to determine entitlement to the short-term benefit schemes such as unemployment benefit and disability benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">Sections 12 and 13 provide for the same treatment of the community employment scheme for the purposes of employment under the rural social scheme, which operates under the aegis of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, regarding unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and farm assist.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">As I mentioned at the outset, this Bill provides for a number of miscellaneous amendments to the social welfare code. These amendments are contained in sections 14 to 22 of this Bill and they include the following: a technical amendment which provides that only one carer's benefit or carer's allowance payment will be made in any one week in respect of the full-time care of a care recipient; the addition of the Mental Health Commission to the list of specified bodies authorised by legislation to use the personal public service number as a unique public service identifier; the awarding of bereavement grant and the application of the "six weeks after death" payment arrangements, in certain defined circumstances, without the necessity for referral to a deciding officer; an amendment to the timeframe for initiating summary prosecution proceedings in cases of fraud and abuse; amending payment arrangements to allow the orphan's payment to be made directly to an orphan aged over 18 years where he or she is not residing with a guardian; providing for the definition in regulations of the types of employment from which a portion of earnings may be disregarded in the assessment of entitlement either to rent or mortgage interest supplements; providing that the approach to recovery of social welfare overpayments will be prescribed in regulations; and the alignment of the residency conditions attached to the homemaker's scheme, in so far as that scheme applies to people providing care to ill or elderly persons, with those that apply to the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and respite care grant schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">This Bill also provides for amendments to the text of certain provisions of the principal Act in advance of the publication of the social welfare (consolidation) Bill 2005 which is currently being prepared. These include amendments to reflect the changes effected by the Health Act 2004, by providing in section 23 and Schedule 1 for the changes consequent on the dissolution of the health boards and the establishment of the Health Service Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Section 24 and Schedule 2 provide for the substitution of the Third Schedule to the principal Act with a reorganised, accessible version of the text. This schedule contains the rules governing the calculation of means. Section 25 and Schedule 3 provide for further amendments which are required on foot of the revised Third Schedule.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Section 26 and Schedules 4 and 5 to this Bill provide for a number of technical and textual amendments to the text of the principal Act, which are required in advance of consolidation of the Social Welfare Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I now turn to the other aspect of this Bill, occupational and supplementary pensions, an area I regard as one of the key challenges of my Ministry. We had a very constructive debate about occupational pensions in this House in November and I listened very carefully to Members' concerns. As I said then, I am also concerned that the statistics are not encouraging — only 59% of workers over 30 have supplementary pensions; only 43% of women in the State have pensions and people in their 20s generally make no pension provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Since I addressed the House in November, I have asked the pensions board to bring forward from the original date of September 2006 to mid-year the completion of the review of the current strategy. I am hoping the review will identify specific and targeted proposals to address the current situation. However, I am only too aware that getting a balanced strategy will not be easy and I will continue to keep the House informed of developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The measures outlined in the Bill provide for the implementation of a major EU directive on pensions and also measures to address the very real problems being experienced by defined benefit occupational pension schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The EU Directive, EC Council Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision, otherwise known as IORP, is generally referred to as the IORPs directive. This directive sets out a framework for the operation and supervision of occupational pension schemes in all member states and will facilitate pan-European pension plans. In Ireland, the Pensions Act 1990 already provides for much of that framework and requires only a small number of amendments to ensure compliance, including the insertion of a section regulating cross-border activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">However, there are three areas of change I want to bring to Senators' attention. The first relates to emerging opportunities for Ireland in the context of pan-European pensions under this directive. A task force, on which my Department was represented, was established under the auspices of the Irish Financial Services Centre Clearinghouse Group to consider how Ireland might best respond to these emerging opportunities. That group recommended that Ireland position itself as a domicile of choice for such pan-European pensions schemes while recognising that this is a medium-term objective. One of my overriding concerns in transposing this directive is to ensure it is transposed in a way that facilitates that aim and I recently had discussions with the chairperson of that group as to how best we progress this agenda. In Ireland, occupational pension schemes have traditionally been trust-based vehicles and, in the months following enactment of this Bill, I intend to engage with interested parties to establish whether there are other suitable pension arrangements which may facilitate those considering pan-European schemes. For the short term, institutions establishing in Ireland will have to be on a trust basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The second area relates to Article 18 of the directive which deals with investment rules and these rules will be set out in regulations. Article 18 also prohibits borrowing by pension schemes other than for liquidity purposes and on a temporary basis. Section 36 of the Bill implements this requirement. On Report Stage in the Dáil, I introduced an amendment to this section which would allow me, by regulations, to exempt certain types of schemes form this prohibition. I introduced that amendment as I have decided that the implementation of the borrowing and investment requirements must be examined together and will require very careful consideration as will the application of the exemption rules allowed under the directive. A working group, comprising my Department, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the pensions board and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority will be established to consider the prudential and tax related issues involved prior to the making of the regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The third issue relates to the requirement that those who run pension schemes must be of good repute and must possess appropriate qualifications and experience. To deal with this aspect of the directive, section 34 sets out the circumstances under which a person must not act as trustee of a scheme, such as having a conviction for dishonesty or being prohibited from acting as a director of a company. The requirements with regard to qualifications and experience will be set out in regulations. The pensions board will be empowered to make a determination as to whether a trustee satisfies these requirements. A determination that a trustee does not satisfy these requirements will have the effect of removing that person as a trustee. The section includes appropriate appeal mechanisms.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The other aspect of the Pensions Act amendments relates to recommendations made to me by the pensions board on foot of a review of the funding standard for defined benefit schemes. As Senators are aware, in 2003, my predecessor, Deputy Mary Coughlan, introduced short-term measures designed to alleviate the funding crisis in pension schemes. The review recommends retention of these provisions which it found were largely successful. However, what has emerged clearly since these provisions were introduced is that the liability side of pension funds is also under severe pressure. Improved longevity and lower interest rates are just some of the trends increasing these liabilities. I have, therefore, provided that an extension may also be granted regarding difficulties on the liability side and details of this measure will be specified in regulations. I believe these measures, which are being introduced after extensive consultation, achieve the required balance between member protection and encouraging continued pension provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Other amendments to the Pensions Act include a change to section 7A to ensure that, where guidance issued by the Society of Actuaries in Ireland is specified in regulations made under that section, it may not be altered by the society without ministerial consent; an amendment to section 18 to allowed the pensions board to require certain documents or seek certain information in the context of an investigation of a scheme; a requirement that trustee consent should always be required where early retirement is being granted in the case of a defined benefit scheme which is under-funded; an increase, from €4,000 to €10,000, in the transfer value in respect of which a certificate comparing potential benefits from the occupational pension scheme to those from the PRSA will not be required and an increase from 15 days to 30 days in the cooling off period required when taking out a PRSA contract, which is in line with the period provided for in distance marketing of consumer financial services. I would like formally to ask the Cathaoirleach to request the Clerk of the Seanad, under Standing Order 121, to substitute the word "of" for the word "or" in page 3, line 3, of the Bill. This is to correct a typographical error.</p>

It safeguards the living standards of those who rely on social welfare income and other supports and prioritises the allocation of resources in favour of those most in need.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_327">I welcome the Minister back into the House to discuss this important Bill. While I feel it is a continuation of a debate we had previously, I now want to address some of the points raised in this Bill. I must acknowledge that matters have improved for many people and that is only fair. Given our economic growth, we would expect that everybody should benefit from it. While I accept that many people in many areas have seen improvements, I must also acknowledge that some people have not benefited from the growth in our economy. Ireland is one of the EU member states with the greatest rich-poor divide. There are aspects of this Bill that will increase the difference, which I will address when I speak on the topic of pensions.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">A recent CSO report estimated that approximately 120,000 children and more than 23,000 lone parent households are living in consistent poverty. We should not be proud of this. While I accept that improvements have been made, we are still falling short of what we should be doing. In light of a recent debate on lone parents, I recognise that the Minister wishes to address the issue and improve the lot of many such struggling individuals. They would appreciate the opportunity to work if provision were made for the difficulties they face, such as child care costs. I await the Minister's proposals to ensure that lone parents and their children do not have to live in consistent poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">A Combat Poverty Agency study launched in 2001 shows a clear link between low income, poverty and ill health. The poor are more likely to be ill and to visit a doctor more often than people on higher incomes who take care of themselves better. The Government has failed in its promise to increase child benefit payments for the third year in a row. I acknowledge that improvements have been made but a commitment was given that has not been lived up to. The child dependant allowance, a payment for families struggling on social welfare, has been frozen since 1994. The back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance was not increased for a second year in a row.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I draw the Minister's attention to the shortage of education welfare officers. Teachers are struggling with the problem of children missing for longer than the 20 days allowed before an education welfare officer is alerted. Some children miss up to 80 days, even more in some circumstances. There are nine counties that do not have such an officer. If we could help children with problems in primary school and their parents we would save them heartache in the future and would save the country the cost of dealing with the difficulties experienced by these children in later life. This is an issue we must tackle. The correct number of education welfare officers must be in place in order to cope with the present large backlog.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">There was a constructive debate on the pensions aspect of this Bill in November 2004 to which the Minister gave consideration. There is, however, a difference between listening and taking on board the suggestions made. The Minister did not take a blind bit of notice and I wonder whether we were wasting our time putting forward suggestions on behalf of our electorates. As his predecessors did, the Minister listens to the pension industry and vested interest groups more carefully than to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I am disappointed to see that the Minister has given in to these groups through the amendment introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil on 1 March 2005. I refer to the EU directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision which sets out a framework for the operation and supervision of occupational pension schemes. Article 18 of the directive deals with investment rules, whereby "borrowing by pension schemes is prohibited other than for liquidity purposes and on a temporary basis". We have known for some time that this directive was in the melting pot but why did Ireland breach it? We did so when the former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, introduced this provision to allow people to borrow money to invest in property. We know this provision was abused, particularly by individuals with larger pension schemes, and we know that the pensions board was opposed to this scheme because of such abuses. While there is a provision in the directive to allow for exemptions for smaller schemes, the Minister said in the Dáil on Second Stage that, if the scheme was not working well for the larger schemes, it would be prudent not to allow it for the smaller schemes. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">Someone has now influenced the Minister into making exemptions in certain cases. I do not know what these cases will be but it was stated that they will be smaller schemes. Through this legislative loophole, fat cats in larger schemes will transfer to smaller schemes. Why is the Minister doing this, who has bent his ear and who is he helping? It is not the ordinary PAYE worker who will benefit. He should introduce regulations that will help to protect existing pensions and encourage the creation of new ones. The Minister claims he wants people to take out pensions but they will not do so. There is no protection for them and the eventual worth of their pensions will be lower than expected. Under this Bill we will be looking after the fat cats and not the ordinary man on the street. I am disappointed that the Minister has given in to industry pressure as I did not believe he would. Once again we are helping the pensions industry. The Minister listens to it but not to the ordinary man in the street who wants his pension protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The pension schemes of the top ten companies in this country are underfunded to the tune of €3 billion. The pensions fund deficit was €1.9 billion in 2003 and is now over €3 billion at a time when the stock market grew by 10.4%. Those figures do not add up. How can those pension funds lose so much money and be underfunded by such an amount while, at the same time, the stock market is going up? What are they doing with the funds they are getting from the hard-pressed worker? Who is raiding the fund and what are they doing with the money with which they are entrusted? What rules is the Minister putting in place to ensure they manage those funds properly?</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The Minister is making it easier for them to continue losing money. If a scheme is underfunded, the Minister proposes to extend the funding period for ten years. What evidence is there that this will be effective? If in the good economic climate of the past two years the pensions industry lost money, how do we know its funding will be any better in ten years' time? Companies are winding up their pension schemes or changing from defined benefit schemes to defined contribution schemes, another fudge. People will not know what they will get when they retire but the pensions industry knows what they are putting in. We are not protecting these people and I ask the Minister to offer them some protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">If such a friendly hand is being extended to the pensions industry, what is it being asked for in return? Could it not be asked to put in place a bonding scheme so that if a company goes bust or has to wind up its scheme, some protection would exist for the workers? Why can it not give something back? No pensions industry company is losing money; they are all earning large profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">IFSRA should be put in charge of the pensions industry. It is doing a fine job. The Pensions Board, while doing a good job, exists to promote pensions not to protect them. IFSRA should investigate the value for money the Government is getting because the tax incentives the pensions industry gets do not offer value for money to the Government or the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I will vote against this Bill. I am disappointed that the Minister is helping the pensions industry which is not delivering to its members. It is time it was shaken up and I hope IFSRA will get the opportunity to do it.</p>

        <speech by="#MargaretCox" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Ms Cox</from>
          <p eId="para_340">I welcome the Minister to the House. We are becoming familiar with him from earlier debates on transport and more recent debates on pensions and social welfare provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">It is a great occasion to be able to welcome legislation in this House that provides for the largest ever social welfare expenditure of €12 billion. It is indicative of the attitude of the Government and its focus and desire to ensure that the people in need of our support, at a time when there are less people than ever in that position, are looked after within the social welfare system. That is the type of country we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The Minister spoke about the different increases and it is worthwhile listing them: a €14 per week special increase for lower payments with new rates of €148 and €168 per week; a €12 weekly increase for pensioners, giving new rates of €166 to €179; €10 and €12 increases in child benefit; a €39 increase per week in family income support thresholds; the €1,000 respite care grant, an increase of €165; the respite care grant extended beyond carers allowance and carers benefit; the capital assessment ease, with the first €20,000 of capital disregarded; an increase in maternity benefits from 70% to 75% of reckonable earnings; and a €35 weekly payment to residents in institutions not on disability allowances. Those are the highlights.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">The differences those changes make to people on a daily basis are amazing. The State pension is paid to older people who feel that they have contributed to the economy we all enjoy today. It is this economy that allows us to put €12 billion per annum into provisions for those less well off than ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">I have, however, some concerns. An advantage of being in Government and in charge of Ireland Inc. is that it gives us a chance to reflect. We are not firefighting on a daily basis, scrimping and saving every penny, and we can look to the future to see our priorities and the gaps on which we should concentrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Minister has heard this before but child benefit is the single most effective family income payment. It is not means tested or taxed and is paid to the mother of the family. It is a significant amount of money per month. For four children, it comes to a total of €637.80, a huge amount of money to receive every month and it is welcomed by all families. It is not a payment, however, that deals with child care costs. It deals with child poverty and is a universal family support mechanism that does not focus on working or non-working parents or two or one parent families.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">It is time it was recognised at Government level that child benefit does not address child care costs for families where both parents must work to pay for a home and not be reliant on the State for housing or health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Senator Terry said we had failed to address some of the commitments made in the area of child benefit. It is time for a review of child benefit to see whether it is achieving what was intended. Is it effective given that there are more women at work than ever before, that women wish to work family-friendly hours, flexible hours, part time and so on? Is this the appropriate mechanism to address the issue of child care? My view is that it is not. We need to look at the whole issue of recognising the cost of child care and deal with it within the Revenue as well as by continued improvements in child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I welcome the changes made in the carer's benefit and allowance and the respite grant scheme. The increase to €1,000 in the respite grant is a significant improvement for a number of reasons. One can do something significant with €1,000. If one is looking after three or more people one may have €3,000 or €4,000. That it is issued automatically gives great joy to many. I am aware of this from my mother because I have a sister at home with Down's syndrome who has been on DPMA. In the summer of each year the respite grant cheque arrives automatically. It did not matter whether it was for a weekend away for the two of them or a weekend away for my mother on her own, it was the fact that the State had recognised the work and the effort she was putting in to look after a family member. The recognition was worth more than anything else. It is an important grant and it is universal to all carers in receipt of carer's benefit or those looking after people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Minister referred to the means test income disregard which has been increased to €270 for a single person and to €540 for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn up to €30,700 and receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance. If a person in receipt of a widow's or widower's allowance receives child dependent allowance, because he or she has young children, and is looking after a relative such as a mother, father or a father-in-law, he or she cannot receive an additional payment from the Department of Social and Family Affairs in terms of the carer's allowance. That is not fair and we need to find a way of addressing the issue. While I understand the principle of dual payments from the social welfare system, it does not make sense that if one's spouse was alive one could have a income disregard of €540 but because one's spouse is not alive, and one is in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension, one cannot receive a carer's allowance. That issue will have to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">I welcome the removal of those on the minimum wage from the tax net. We have worked hard to achieve this and it needs to be recognised. It is a first for Ireland and a first for us within the system. When we talked about the introduction of the minimum wage we never believed that within a few short years those on the minimum wage would be out of the tax net.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The Minister dealt at length with the issue of pensions and cited the statistic for the number of women who do not have a pension provision. As one who is lucky to be a Member of this House, I recognise the Minister's commitment to that area but something must be done for those who stay at home for a number of years to raise their families and do not get back into the active workforce. Some way will have to be found to ensure there are flexible pension arrangements to deal with short-time, part-time or whatever hours they work while also reflecting the years they spend at home — when they do not cost the State anything — and make a net contribution through their efforts as a homemaker, a child carer or their involvement in various societies such as meals-on-wheels. That group deserves our attention and it is incumbent on us to ensure they get their due as they move towards retirement. I ask the Minister to keep that issue at the top of his agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I turn to the increase in maternity benefit from 70% to 75% of reckonable earnings. I plead with the Minister, as I did on the last occasion when the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, dealt with the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004, that if parental leave is to be effective, in respect of looking after one's children and taking time out of the workplace, it is incumbent on us to find the money to pay parental leave benefit. We allow carer's leave and protect rights. We have provided for parental leave but we do not pay a parental benefit. To allow people take their full amount of parental leave,  many smaller organisations may have to introduce a policy which forces them to take it in bulk in order to manage a business behind the scenes when a person takes time off. They operate a policy that provides that under legislation one is entitled to parental leave but one has to take the 14 weeks together, rather than a day or two at a time, or whatever. That legislation has changed and the minimum amount of time one can be forced to take is six weeks. However, to take six weeks off, when one forfeits six individual wage packets, is not a feasible option for many and is of no benefit if people cannot receive some funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Like the respite grant, it is not always about the amount of money but the recognition. I appeal to the Minister as he continues to build on a social welfare system that is inclusive and provides for our society and our economy, to look at parental leave and ensure something positive is done. It may be only a small payment in the beginning.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I compliment the Minister's Department on its communications system. It is absolutely superb in regard to how it keeps people informed of benefits and it should be complimented. If it can continue to improve in that area it will certainly be worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I refer to an issue in regard to child care and I do not know if it will have a bearing on social welfare. Senator Henry mentioned a system in France on which I do not have much detail where one can buy tax free cheques and pay for child care or for looking after the elderly. No tax is paid by the recipients of those cheques. This is a way of ensuring equity within the tax system for payments that are important to the social welfare system, be it child care, caring for the elderly or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">On the occasion of the debate on the Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2004 with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, we raised the issue of <i>force majeure</i> leave where people can take three days in any one year and five days in any three years, in every employment. There is no central register for employers to check whether the person has taken this leave in a previous employment. In regard to the expansion of the PPNS number, it might be possible to create a central register whereby if companies pay <i>force majeure </i>leave to employees it is registered with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and employers can check whether the person has used up his or her entitlements in the previous three or five years. This may be an additional headache for the Department but it will help the operation of <i>force majeure</i> and, hopefully, parental leave in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I thank the Minister for coming to the House. I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to its completion. The comments made by Senator Terry about pensions are very valuable and important. I ask that this Bill should not be obstructed because it will be of overall benefit to all other payments.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the Minister and his officials back to the House. I am pleased to second this Bill. It provides for the introduction of a series of social welfare improvements announced in the budget in December 2004. It also provides for a number of amendments to the Pensions Act 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Minister has done a marvellous job in securing the largest ever budget for his Department in the history of the State. He has secured an additional €1 billion this year, which is an increase of almost 9% on last year, bringing the total budget to €12.25 billion for 2005. The Minister stated in his contribution that for every €3 of Government expenditure, €1 is expended on social welfare payments. This is an astounding figure and the Minister and the Government are to be congratulated in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The total expenditure on social welfare this year will be €12.25 billion. Payments have increased by three times the expected rate of inflation. A total of 1.5 million people will benefit from weekly social welfare payments. There has been a four-fold increase in child benefit since 1997. The increase of €10 for each of the first two children and an increase of €12 for the third and subsequent children is welcomed by the mothers and fathers of this country. As my colleague, Senator Cox, stated, this is a very welcome payment every month.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">I welcome the Family Support Agency increase of €2 million for family resource centres which are spread throughout the country and do excellent work. I can testify to the excellent facilities in Cavan and the good work being done by the family resource centre there. I welcome the sum of €900,000 for the expansion of the family mediation service which provides much needed facilities throughout the country. I welcome €600,000 additional funding for marriage and family counselling and the €70,000 for the development of information dissemination to the general public. I also welcome the €60,000 provided for the second phase of the family research programmes and the increase in the budget for the money advice and budgeting service. The service has centres throughout the country which help people who are in financial difficulties through no fault of their own. They may not be good at managing their own affairs. This organisation does excellent work with people who need help to get out of the circle of debt when they cannot see any light at the end of the tunnel. The service deals with the creditors when the clients are unable to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">I welcome the changes in the carer's benefit. A person is no longer required to be in full-time employment for three months before applying for the carer's benefit. I was delighted to hear the Minister state in his contribution that carers are wonderful people and the State recognises their hard work. The Bill deals with pension provisions and rights. Despite what Senator Terry said, the ordinary man and woman in the street will benefit from the pension provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">I welcome the changes that have taken place in the past few years. The number of people at work has increased to almost 1.9 million. The rate of unemployment has fallen dramatically from 10% to 4.3% which is the lowest in the EU and among the lowest in the world. The number of low-paid workers removed from the tax net has increased. This year all those on the minimum wage will be taken out of the income tax net entirely.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Spending on social welfare has more than doubled from €5.74 billion in 1997 to an expected €12.25 billion in 2005. Over the past decade while gross average industrial earnings have increased by 71%, social welfare payments have improved by between 87% and 95% and by even more for larger families. Substantial improvements in the conditions for entitlement to a range of social welfare schemes and services have been implemented. New social welfare benefits such as farm assist, carer's benefit, widowed parent grants and respite care grants have been introduced and enhanced. The social welfare increases announced in budget 2005 range from more than 7% to over 10% while inflation this year is expected to be at just 2.5%. The increase in the budget achieved by the Minister is almost 9%, which is more than three times the expected rate of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">In her contribution Senator Terry stated that the Minister comes to this House but does not listen, and that if he does listen, he has not learned. I wish to put it on the record of the House that this Minister listens, the Government listens and the Government delivers. It has delivered the best social welfare package in the history of the State——</p>

          <p eId="para_371">They failed to do so and they not only failed but failed miserably. I remind the Senator, while she is in listening mode, that £1.80 was the sum received by pensioners from her Government in 1995. In the three budgets for which that Government was responsible, pensioners were given the enormous amount of £3.80. The Senator should not come into this House on behalf of her party and try to lecture the Minister who has achieved the highest budget in the history of the State. The three parties had the opportunity and they failed miserably. The people of this country appreciate the work being done by the entire Government. The 1.5 million people of this State who rely on weekly social welfare payments appreciate the work of this Minister and of this Government. I welcome the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005. I look forward to the Bill proceeding through all Stages in the House. Perhaps Senator Terry will consider allowing it to pass unanimously because one cannot vote against such a package.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_374">I welcome the Minister and his officials. In defence of Senator Terry, she was present for and contributed to the debate. I expected to hear a voice from the Labour Party before making my contribution but perhaps its absence is an eloquent statement on the quality of the Bill. I congratulate the Minister on the size of the social welfare package, the largest in the history of the State, for which I am sure he had to fight hard.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">This is the first social welfare package to be unreservedly welcomed by CORI. Some years ago, around the time of the rainbow coalition's final budget, Fr. Seán Healy denounced the package produced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, to the extent that I felt a little sorry for the Minister. I happened to meet Fr. Healy and asked him whether he had approved of any budget during the previous ten years, to which he replied he would need notice of the question. At last we have legislation which satisfies him.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We read reports and see statistics about the level of inequality in our society, most of which is relative because we have made significant progress in reducing absolute inequality. Debate on this issue takes place in every country in western Europe. The left wing of the Labour Party in Britain denounces the Government of Prime Minister Tony Blair for widening the poverty gap. In Germany, despite the fact that the Social Democrats and Greens govern together, opponents of what are probably necessary reforms of the country's social welfare system make the same point. Ireland is not alone in having this type of argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Under the Bill, increases in social welfare benefits will range from 7% to 10% in nominal terms, well ahead of an expected inflation rate of 2% to 2.5%. While such increases have been a feature of budgets for several years, from the early 1990s through to 1997 social welfare increases, with the exception of unemployment assistance, closely tracked the rate of inflation and during much of the 1980s they trailed it. I recall the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Alan Dukes, for whom I have the highest respect, stating that people should not expect social welfare increases every year. We have moved far beyond that position, partly due to the quality of economic management. An unemployment rate of only 4% to 5% gives us the opportunity to do more for those who need the welfare net or have reached an age at which they require a pension.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The Government is a model in western Europe in the area of pensions to the extent that it concentrates on making provision for future pensions by allocating 1% of annual GNP to the national pensions reserve fund and encourages people to improve their position through private effort. None of us is under any illusion that the State pension can provide anything other than a modest standard of living. Although it has been much improved, those in employment who want to live in a degree of comfort have a duty to make some pension provision for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">As an energetic and reforming member of Cabinet, I ask the Minister to examine the individualisation of social welfare payments. This issue has different connotations from individualisation in the taxation system and has few downsides from any ideological viewpoint. We are entering an era in which both spouses in a relationship will probably have worked when they reach retirement age and will, therefore, expect to be treated in their own right rather than as a spouse dependent. For this reason, individualisation would be a desirable reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">In the area of private pensions evidence has emerged of defined benefit schemes running into difficulties. I have personal experience of this from work I do with institutions on a charitable basis. The problem is evident in the private and semi-State sectors and causes a great deal of unhappiness.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Minister placed considerable emphasis on further increases in child benefit and the advantages and efficiencies of the payment. A Government decision was taken four or five years ago that child benefit would be the main vehicle for addressing the cost of child care. I am sure the Minister will closely study my view, which is shared by other Senators on this side, that we need to reconsider whether that strategic decision is sufficient. A child tax allowance was administered here until its abolition 20 years ago by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Alan Dukes. Its value was gradually eroded until it was worth only €100 per annum or thereabouts and it was then abolished in exchange for a marginal increase in child benefit. I am not sure this was the correct decision. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, is very proud of a child tax credit scheme applied across the water — I do not hold it out as the model — under which those earning below a certain threshold of approximately £56,000 receive tax credits. It ceases to apply to those with earnings above the threshold. One of the messages coming though on the doorsteps in counties Kildare and Meath is that child benefit on its own is not a satisfactory final solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I will briefly address the issue of social welfare for immigrants. As part of the enlargement package, Ireland, to an even greater degree than Britain, adopted the most liberal, open employment regime of the existing 15 member states for immigrants from the new accession states. On the whole, the system appears to be working well. However, I heard a report on radio this morning concerning a group of about ten Poles who travelled to County Sligo for employment only to discover that the work they were offered was not available. Fortunately, word travelled quickly, alternative offers were made and the matter is apparently being sorted out. In another recent case an immigrant woman living on the streets had her legs amputated. Some kind of safety net, not necessarily the conventional social welfare model, must be in place so that people are not utterly without cover. I have listened to the Minister's reflections on single parents. There are cases, when a child is beyond a certain age, where the mother is encouraged through the provision of child care facilities to go back to work. However, single mothers should not be compelled to go back to work with the threat of losing their social welfare benefits. We would not compel anyone else in society in such a way.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_147">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_383">It is nice to hear sympathetic words from the Government side regarding single mothers. They received very poor press recently thanks to some electrical engineer who could do with a lesson in sociology before making pronouncements.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I am glad the Minister has rowed back on some of the restrictions introduced in the last budget, particularly those regarding lone parents. Previously, if they earned over €293 per week, many of their benefits were removed and they only received transitional benefits for a short period. Now I am glad to see they are allowed a six-month transition period. I am also glad that the back to education allowance has been examined more favourably. Lone parents who have poor education are much more likely to stay on the lone parent's allowance than those with a better education who are in a better position to get jobs. I pay tribute to the Eastern Health Board, now the Eastern Regional Health Authority, which was always sympathetic in funding Cherish, now One Family. The organisation is dedicated to getting girls back into education, running computer courses and so on. It is a pity that the back to education allowance is not given until the person has been out of the school or college system for a year. Previously, it was two years which was worse. However, an academic year is a long time in the life of a teenager or a person in his or her early 20s. Efforts must be made to change this arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">During the ill informed and violent debate on the issue of single parents, conducted by some people who should have known better, a woman told me it was all very well for these teenage girls to get a lone parent's allowance, but they should also be made to go back to school. They will go back to school if schools take them in and child care is provided. As the Minister is aware, some girls' families give great support which allows them to get back into education in a short time. Unfortunately, others may be years out of education and can never get back in. Far from planning a life of idleness thanks to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, these people have no plans. It is important that we help them with their planning, particularly by getting them back to school as quickly as possible. I applaud the group of women in Waterford who, on a voluntary basis, look after the children of some schoolgirls, allowing them to return to school. It is a great initiative and good to see people being so public-spirited. From a practical point of view, it is important the Minister addresses the back to education allowance. Poverty is associated with lack of education and these factors lead people into the worst of lifestyles. The allowance gives an opportunity to get these girls back into either school or college.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Another myth is that there are vast numbers of teenage mothers. In 1980, the number of 16 year olds who gave birth was 206. In 2000, this number stood at 196. It is not as if we are trying to cope with vast numbers of young girls with babies. While it is a small number, it is important for these women's and their children's future that everything is done to ensure they get back into education in order that they can gain employment. Our society is now described as knowledge-based. If people are left on the sideline now, they will be there forever. I wish I could see these mythical people who have four or five children at the expense of the State and live in such great luxury that to emulate it one would have to earn €40,000 a year. I am sure the Minister would be delighted to see them too. Helping this group to continue in education is one side of dealing with the matter. While it can be difficult for schools, they have improved at ensuring people come back into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Considerable amounts of discretion now seem to be used in the administration of doctor-only medical cards. I would hate us to return to a system where what matters is who one knows, not what one's needs are. I am sure the Minister is influential at Cabinet discussions. When the Minister is having thoughtful discussions with the Minister for Health and Children on this issue, will he inform her that it is important to spread the safety net as broadly as possible? The doctor-only card has been described as the half medical card, but it is a useful half. The back to education allowance is the most important benefit from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is absolutely vital for those people to get back into education again.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_148">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_388">I welcome the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, to the House. Of all departmental staff, the majority of those in the Department of Social and Family Affairs are helpful, courteous and responsive to representations from public representatives and the public. However, there have been instances, particularly in the appeals process, where some individuals have set themselves up as judge and jury. They can be abrasive to the applicants, causing them great distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Several years ago two social welfare offices were located in Gort, County Galway. Appeals were held in a hotel rather than in the privacy of the offices. Applicants waited in the reception area to be called publicly for their appeal hearing. This unfortunate event, embarrassing for the people concerned, should not have happened in this day and age.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Minister inherited the savage 16 cuts from his predecessor. We were told the Government had changed its ways post-Inchydoney but the reality is only a few of these savage 16 cuts have been reversed. Most have only been partially reversed. Senator Henry mentioned one such cut, the back to education allowance, which has certainly not been reversed. As Senator Henry outlined, it was a benefit of which so many people wanted to avail. Many social welfare recipients realised they could benefit enormously from the back to education allowance. They could see in it the chance to win back an opportunity for gainful employment. It was unbelievable that a Minister saw fit to extend the waiting period to 15 months. None of us fully understands the experience of becoming unemployed or of being long-term unemployed. People genuinely wanted to get out of the vicious circle in which they found themselves but they could not do so. While the Minister has, to a degree, responded, it is important he looks at this allowance again and fully reverses his predecessor's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">If we consider all social welfare recipients, we will find people in the social welfare net most commonly associated with poverty. When we talk about poverty, particularly child poverty, we analyse the recent budget and ask what could have, to a great extent, eliminated child poverty. We see clearly that commitments by the Government to eliminate child poverty over a period of three or four years have not been met. The promises made have been broken, although the commitment was met in one year, namely, election year 2002. The commitments, however, were reneged on in the following two budgets. This year we were told an €18 increase was required to keep pace with inflation but there was only an increase of €10. Senator Wilson went back to 1995 and said the Opposition parties did not do this, that and the other but there is an absolute lack of awareness of the resources available at the time and of incomes relative to those of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">In the past fortnight, most people will have received an ESB bill, including the elderly who receive a supplement of 150 units to offset their energy requirements. We are in the depths of winter and are experiencing a cold snap yet many elderly people will have received a crippling bill not long after Christmas and the introduction of the budget. Any increase they have received as a result of the increases in some pensions or otherwise has been totally eaten up by the increase in ESB charges. That is something with which perhaps Senator Wilson is not familiar. That is what it means to be in the poverty trap. While the Minister might say these people have received tremendous increases in their payments, those increases are worth very little when one takes into account all the stealth taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Will the Minister introduce a national waiver for refuse charges? Elderly people in receipt of social welfare payments or on pensions who are in the poverty trap are forced to pay those charges as they have no choice. If for any reason they store refuse, they will be fined. They are in a vicious circle and it is of the utmost importance that the Minister introduce a national waiver policy. The Minister should not say, as many local authorities have, that because many of these services have been privatised, he cannot introduce such a waiver. Local authorities are using that as an excuse. If the goodwill existed in the Department to provide the resources to introduce such a waiver for elderly people, it could be done. Will the Minister introduce a waiver scheme for the elderly, particularly pensioners, the unemployed and social welfare recipients as a matter of urgency?</p>
          <p eId="para_394">We are aware of the recent controversy about lone parents. Lone parents with one or two children or otherwise are most likely to be in the poverty trap. People have failed to realise that and have made negative comments. It is incumbent on the Minister to address the needs of single parents. The response of Government to date has been very poor. It is a scandal that we cannot respond in a positive way and take those people out of the poverty trap. Children, in particular, are most vulnerable. Once those children fall into the poverty trap they face other social difficulties from which they will never extricate themselves unless they are particularly lucky. Those who say single parents get themselves into that situation in order to receive social welfare benefits are far removed from reality and do not understand what life is like for single parents. We should ignore their comments and the publicity given to them by the media. We should react in a positive way. It is in the media's hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">There seems to be an overlap between the operations of the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Health and Children. When something is everybody's responsibility, it is nobody's responsibility. Certain supplementary welfare allowances which were administered by the health boards are now dealt with at local level by the Health Service Executive. We need to streamline the various allowances. The Government took a retrogressive step by returning responsibility for the rent allowance scheme to the local authorities. It is an example of another agency being given responsibility for a social welfare benefit. It could be referred to as decentralisation, which I do not oppose. The Combat Poverty Agency has raised some concerns about the proposed decentralisation of the agency to Monaghan. It believes that if it is based some distance outside the greater Dublin area, it will face difficulties in driving the anti-poverty agenda and eliminating poverty from society.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">I hope the Minister will examine some of the savage 16 cutbacks in an attempt to make a great difference to many people. I ask him to respond in a meaningful way to his predecessor's errors, including the introduction of the cutbacks. It is a pity that his response, which has resulted from adverse publicity, has been partial.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_397">It is tempting at this stage of a debate to proceed to beat the Government over the head and I am as good as anybody in that regard. It is good fun, but I would like to be somewhat more reflective on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">I wonder about the universality of the welfare system. It is no longer universal because those without Irish connections who have lived here for less than three years are not entitled to any social welfare assistance. We are starting to hear anecdotes telling of victims of poor Irish employment or bad luck. Such people are often penniless, homeless and, in many cases, frightened. We panicked in the early part of last year when it was anticipated in some quarters that a flood of people would arrive here. Such people are sometimes described as "welfare tourists", but such a species of people has not been found to exist in any country in which the matter has been investigated. The suggestion that we would be flooded with "welfare tourists" was great for newspaper headlines, to which the Government responded. It is astonishing that the system we have constructed offers a person who has come here lawfully to work and happens to fall on bad times two choices — to starve or to go home. That is not worthy of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">I attended a committee meeting this morning at which the US ambassador was present. The meeting, which was held in private session, unfortunately, considered the plight of Irish illegals in the United States. Senator Mooney gave the members of the committee copies of an eloquent document that was prepared by a major group in the US that lobbies on behalf of such people. The document stated that Irish illegals are not entitled to any welfare in the United States because they are not there legally. I have every sympathy for the illegal Irish in the US, but I could not resist reminding the US ambassador not only that Ireland does not look after illegals but also that we do not give any social welfare assistance to legal immigrants who have been here for less than three years. We should work out a joined-up position. If we decide that immigrants who are here legally under EU treaties should not be entitled to any support from the State, regardless of the misfortune they may encounter, it is somewhat rich for us to say to a big country that is 3,000 miles away and getting closer all the time that we think our illegals there are being treated badly. I will not say any more about the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">We need to understand what welfare is for and what it does. I have always held the view that State income support has a number of purposes, the first of which is to protect people against poverty. In many ways, we are not doing too badly in that regard. We have used a significant proportion of the resources available to us to protect older people, in particular, from serious poverty. I hope we will take similar action in respect of child poverty, about which we should be embarrassed.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The welfare system has a role to play in the labour market. It should help people in a way that smooths over the ups and downs of the marketplace. It is a great pity that we abolished pay-related benefits, which allowed people to have flexibility in work and meant that the loss of a job did not mean a quick descent into basic living. My party was involved in the decision to abolish pay-related benefits, but the abolition was mostly achieved by the Fianna Fáil minority Government that served between 1987 and 1989. It was one of the major cutbacks in the welfare system that was introduced at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Other countries which have successful economies and are as rich as Ireland can operate systems which ensure that those who are victims of the variations of the labour market do not suffer enormous hardship if they lose a job temporarily and have to find another job. Such systems involve a number of other things. Our welfare system is totally inadequate in that respect. If a person who is paid €300 or €500 loses his or her job and slips back to the basic rate of social welfare, he or she will encounter a huge change in his or her life. The State has a duty to look after such people, who are not responsible for the difficulties they encounter.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Evidence from countries like Sweden suggests that the presence of a good system facilitates major structural changes when an industry is no longer viable. I refer, for example, to the Swedish ship-building industry which had to be dispensed with because it was no longer competitive. The workers involved in that industry were able to find new employment because the presence of an intelligently honed welfare system meant they did not carry the burden of the fear of not being able to support themselves and their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">I remind the House that social welfare is an insurance system for many people. Governments rob the social insurance coffers from time to time to pay for other things. The previous Minister for Finance did that on at least one occasion. Workers are paying into an insurance fund that is in good shape at present, unlike many of the State's pension funds, because it seems to be able to manage itself quite well.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">We need to examine the issue of social welfare in that context. One cannot buy a single dinner in a restaurant near this building for the amount of money that is regarded as the basic rate of social welfare payment. That is an indication of the gap that exists in Irish society. It is inevitable that some gaps will exist, but as a society we need to decide whether we are willing to tolerate the existence of a gap of that nature. In particular, the Government has to make a choice in that regard. We need to consider whether the levels of social welfare payment achieve what we want them to achieve. They do not achieve the desired goal in that they do not eliminate poverty or protect people from a sense of insecurity. Above all, they do not do much to eliminate child poverty. There is no doubt that child poverty will be the cause of so many of our future social problems. Diversionary tactics such as talking about a reduction in persistent poverty, which have been used intermittently by members of the Government, do not add to this debate. We should be embarrassed if anybody in this State is living in circumstances in which he or she cannot afford to have decent clothes or footwear. That is the definition of persistent poverty. The Government, in its talk about reducing the incidence of persistent poverty, assumes that poverty is somehow inevitable. Gospel quotations notwithstanding, I do not accept the statement, "The poor you have always with you." It is a rationalisation and justification for policy inertia.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">If we are to do something about poverty, we must remember that whenever there are debates on social welfare, there are always targets and scapegoats. These are essentially used as the example by which the system is undermined. In the 1980s, it was unbelievable how many economists stated we had high unemployment because the unemployed would not work. That was gospel. All sorts of issues, including the wedge effect, were raised by such economists. I heard an OECD economist talk about the increased utility of leisure of the unemployed. This was in the 1980s, during which 250,000 people left the country to find work, yet senior influential international economists were suggesting people were unemployed because they had a few bob and considerable leisure time. People believed that nonsense. Once we started creating jobs, all the allegedly disincentivised unemployed people queued up for them. This was before the tax cuts that reduced the famous wedge. Unemployed people, to the certain knowledge of every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas, wanted desperately to work. I know a person who hitched approximately 30 miles between Limerick to Mitchelstown every morning and evening simply to participate on a community welfare scheme. He wanted to do something.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">We now have new scapegoats, our immigrants, who are perceived to be arriving here to live off our generous welfare system. If I were a Lithuanian, Latvian or Pole, I could think of better countries than Ireland in which to milk the welfare system, if that were my intention. We have a great obligation to avoid creating a new set of scapegoats. Moreover, what was said in defence of single parents in recent weeks needs to be said. Whatever about the tiny minority of teenage girls who become pregnant, single parenthood covers a whole range of tragedies in many cases. We need to assert this fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Let me return to the issue of bin charges and waivers, as raised by Senator Ulick Burke. Unlike some on the political left, I believe people have a universal right to education, shelter and good health care. I do not believe anybody has an unqualified right to generate as much waste as he or she wishes and expect the taxpayer to pay for its disposal. Anybody on the left who suggests one has such a right is guilty of absolute nonsense. People have a right to expect that they will not have to bear a financial burden for the disposal of refuse that is out of proportion with their ability to pay. People must have choices, but that is a matter for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">On 17 December, a letter was sent to me by Cork City Council about the new waste disposal system in Cork. It stated specifically that everybody would have to pay the tax although the service in question was publicly provided and that there would be a waiver applying to the fixed charge but not to the tags, which would have to be paid for by everybody. There was uproar over this and in late January the council put advertisements in the newspapers, which I suspect cost as much as a children's playground, stating people on social welfare would have a 100% waiver.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">However, these advertisements were placed three weeks after the introduction of the system. Before their placement, old age pensioners living on their own had been trying to figure out where they would get the money to pay for a service for which they had not had to pay heretofore. For these pensioners, the charge would have been the equivalent of between one and two weeks' income. They depend on waste disposal services to take away their waste. They cannot bring it anywhere themselves and must take what they get. If we are to institute a proper waste service to deal with our waste problems, it must incorporate a universal national waiver system that does not impose financial burdens on individuals out of proportion with their capacity to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">I have stated before to the Minister and must reiterate that I do not have any great ideological hang-up over how pensions are paid. There is much scope for the imaginative use of public resources to mesh together private and public pension provisions. However, I cannot accept that people who have worked all their lives can be left in a position in which they are victimised by the vagaries of the stock or property markets. It is our job as a society to try to use the market as effectively as possible to fund our pension provision to the maximum extent. However, we must give the elderly a guarantee that their income will not be dependent on whether the price of Elan's shares, or those of any other company, increase or decrease.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Simply saying people have to fund their pensions privately is ducking the issue. We must ask how we can fund pensions, privately or publicly, in a way that gives pensioners a secure, decent income related to the income they had when they were at work. This would lead to a good, imaginative pension scheme and link private and public provisions. It would guarantee that those who paid into a fund would not be dependent on the vagaries of the market but that they would have security in their older years.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_150">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_413">I am pleased the Minister for Social and Family Affairs is in the House because I believe he is fair-minded. I want him to convey a message to his colleague, the Minister for Health and Children. There has been much discussion recently on nursing home charges. Today I telephoned the helpline of the Health Service Executive, Midland Area, on behalf of an elderly person to find out basic details on the charges. Given the pent-up emotion associated with this subject, it is obvious that once such a helpline is advertised everybody will want to use it to make inquiries about how the charges will apply to him or her. When I telephoned I waited for 28 minutes for a response. I must admit that the girl to whom I spoke was very helpful. She stated the staff were up to their tonsils with inquiries and trying to deal with specific queries, some of which were taking a long time to answer. To what degree has the Minister for Health and Children staffed this resource to provide information? The information the helpline staff provide relates only to public hospitals. They are just taking details at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Although I had the patience to wait at the end of the line out of curiosity to see how long it would take before I received a response — I did not get much satisfaction when I had finished — I can imagine the frustration of many people who are trying to obtain information. Perhaps the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will raise this with the Minister for Health and Children, who circulated a document to us all during the week making reference to the need to provide a fair and efficient type of service. The word "efficient" is incorrect considering that it takes so long to have a basic inquiry dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I am tired of listening to Ministers who attend the House for statements make comparisons with 1995 and 1997. I ask people to be realistic about those years. We did not have the much-vaunted Celtic tiger in those times, nor did we have the economic buoyancy of recent times. Therefore, in respect of changes and improvements, whether in social welfare or otherwise, if the finances are available a great deal more can be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">One of my colleagues referred to stealth charges. While the increases may appear substantial, stealth taxes erode them rapidly. The ESB is one example. Over the past four years there has been a 30% increase in electricity charges. Whenever the ESB approaches the energy regulator for consent he grants it automatically, whether for increased oil or gas charges, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The electricity market is liberalised but that will not make a whit of difference to the domestic consumer because the other providers are not chasing the domestic consumer. The Minister should pick up the bill his wife received in January to see the significant increase in charges over recent years. This is not in the Minister's remit but the pensioners about whom he speaks receive ESB bills and in many cases, although they receive some units free of charge, the value of their money is eroded by the increased charges on the balance of the bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I support the points made about refuse charges. Most local authorities have privatised the refuse service and are glad to get out of it as fast as they can. However, the waiver system that some operated, although it may have been restricted to certain deserving social categories, does not exist in the privatised service. The private contractor will not be flexible or give any concession to those who were on the waiver scheme. They will pay the same amount as those whose tax code includes a concession to claim back a certain amount of the overall refuse charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">This issue was brought to my attention last week by a pensioner who said refuse charges cost €400 per year, paid in two six-month instalments. It is rather unfair that those who can afford to pay and who pay tax will receive a concession whereas the pensioner must pay the full amount. When Charles J. Haughey was Minister for Health and Social Welfare, as the office was then known, he was praised for introducing the free schemes. It is time to look at the impact the removal of the waiver system has on the cohort of people whom this Minister is trying to help through the social welfare system. It is time for innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">While this may not be the Minister's brief I compliment the health service officials in my area who manage special aid for the elderly which is usually granted to pensioners. The recent controversy about nursing home subvention charges should have exposed the need to create incentives to keep elderly people at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The homemaker's allowance operating in a pilot scheme in Dublin should be extended nationally. It works out at approximately €190 per week. In many cases those who decide to stay at home to maintain their previous quality of life are assisted by a few hours' home help. The number of hours the home-help organisers can give is often constrained by their budgets. That group should be considered to see to what degree it is possible to keep them out of nursing homes for the elderly, administered within the public system. This is often also true of the private sector because many of these people would like to live in the home environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Minister should consider the possibility of putting in place a system for refuse collection. He cannot change the ESB price increases which are remarkable. By contrast, An Post, which is probably reeling from its recent problems, encounters long delays and rigidity from its regulator, ComReg. Good work in the form of social welfare increases can often be rapidly eroded by stealth charges which creep up on people and must be considered to ensure that social welfare increases yield real value.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_423">I welcome the Minister to the House to debate this Bill. I welcome too his recent statement that he would reconsider the lone parent payment to see whether it can be reformed and modernised to meet the needs of lone parents. I look forward to hearing his views on the matter when the review is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The Minister may need to consider my point at interdepartmental level because social welfare affects many other Departments. Much of the work of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is administrative, paying out the schemes established through various consolidated Social Welfare Acts. I encountered a case in my area which exemplifies how unfair the system is to lone parents. A woman with a small child, and who had been out of education for eight years but wanted to return to third level education, sought a maintenance grant from the local authority. She was prevented from getting it because under the rules of the maintenance scheme, applied by the local authority, the total income in her house was taken into account. She lives with her parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">This is an example of a young mother who did not go onto the council housing list but stayed at home with her family who received a grant from the local authority to extend the house for her and her child where they could have her parents' support. The State, however, came down hard on her because her parents' income was added to hers in assessing her eligibility for the maintenance grant. The lone parent payment is her sole income. This demonstrates how unfair the system is to lone parents. When they try to better themselves and improve their education they are prevented from doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The Tánaiste was quite honest when she said a few years ago that for young mothers in particular it would make sense if they could stay at home with their families. This is particularly true for teenage mothers. A major problem in Dublin is that when young women are housed in housing estates they are picked on and their property is vandalised. A sub-culture exists around this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">In the example I have cited, the State supported this family to help the young mother yet when she tried some years later to get a grant to improve herself, the State refused it because the total income in the household was assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">While this is not an issue for the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Minister needs to tackle it because his Department's decisions have implications for the Department of Education and Science and others. It requires several Ministers to work on such an initiative. Perhaps the Minister will take this up with the Minister for Education and Science because this is discrimination against lone parents who do their best and work hard to find new economic opportunities for their children.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. S. Brennan)</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I thank Senators for a very good debate. There has been more than two hours and ten minutes discussion and I listened carefully to what was said. Almost every issue raised could be the subject of a debate in this House. We could have a debate for a whole day on issues such as child poverty, child benefit, pensions, child care and carers, so I will not try to get through all of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Senator Terry and others expressed concern about child poverty and the child benefit promise. Child benefit has increased substantially in the past couple of years. Since 1997, it has increased by €38 for the first and second child and €49 for the third and subsequent children, up to €141 and €177, which is a substantial investment. I want to put on the record of the House a commitment the Minister for Finance and I gave in the Lower House, namely, that the child benefit package, which was announced some years ago, will be completed next year. We will complete the package we laid out, which will fully meet the commitment given on child benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The Senator also took me to task on the pensions issue. I will not give into the pensions industry at the expense of ordinary people. There has been much debate in the media about the borrowing provision. I have received a significant amount of correspondence on that matter. I said that what was prudent for schemes of over 100 people was equally prudent for smaller schemes. One could ask what is the difference between 101 and 95 members. However, one cannot look at the borrowing issue in isolation from the other investment rules which may impact indirectly on any facility to borrow. I am also of the view that complex issues arise in regard to prudential concerns and taxation issues. For that reason, I have established a working group comprising my Department, the Department of Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, the Pensions Board and IFSRA. We will move forward in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The Senator is correct that the Minister for Finance exempted small schemes last year. He said it is fine for one person to borrow to buy a property or make an investment because this is someone providing for their own pension purposes. Tax breaks are a different issue. It is a matter for the Minister for Finance in the context of tax breaks generally. It is a much bigger subject than just pensions. However, I acknowledge that tax breaks for pension purposes amount to more than €2.5 billion a year, which is substantial. We give more tax breaks for pensions than we pay out on contributory and non-contributory pensions. In any discussion on pensions, one must take the €2.5 billion on tax breaks for pensions and the €2 billion paid out on contributory and non-contributory pensions together.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Minister for Finance exempted these schemes and the EU directive allowed me to continue that exemption. Between now and September, when the IORPs directive kicks in, I will examine how best to continue the exemption. Having examined it carefully, there does not appear to be an argument on prudential protection grounds to, on the one hand, encourage people to take out pensions and, on the other, to say that if one takes out a pension, one will be stopped from borrowing to protect one from oneself. These pension schemes mainly include one to four people; they do not include up to 100 people. They include a small number of people, the majority of whom may be single individuals. I can only do so much to protect them from themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The query that arrived on my desk was whether I should stop them borrowing. If one is employed in a small business or whatever and wants to buy a property to be used as one's pension fund for the future, and if the former Minister for Finance said it is fine for them to borrow money to buy that property so that they will have a pension for the future, I cannot say to them that they cannot borrow because I must protect them from themselves, I do not trust their judgment on the borrowing issue or they will have to buy a cheaper property and have a smaller pension. I did not buy that argument. I bought the argument that it is better to encourage people to have pensions, and let them borrow for it, if they are the only pensioner. If there are hundreds or thousands of pensioners, borrowing should be out of the question.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_155" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. S. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I have a duty to protect pension funds that might include 100 or 1,000 recipients. Any Member of this House, or any other individual, might buy a property as their pension for the future. Someone who owns a shop and has no pension might decide that instead of giving their money to Irish Life or a pension fund to invest in equities and so on they would buy an apartment or a shop. However, in order to do so, these people must borrow money. Should I say to these people that while I am aware they need a pension, I must protect them against themselves? I did not cave into the pensions lobby. I have stood up to many lobbies in my political life and it does not cost me a thought. I would tell the pensions industry to get lost like a shot if I thought it was the correct thing to do. My focus is on protecting the pensioner, but we can discuss that issue again.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Senator also raised the issue of the funding standard and took me to task about giving them ten years instead of three. This is an attempt to protect individuals. In the UK recently they tried to make the funding standard so strong that companies had to pay up immediately. Many companies that were forced to pay into the pension fund immediately went broke and closed down and the pensioners got nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The Pensions Board is made up of professional staff who keep an eye on the pension funding standards on a daily basis. Over a period, they will be able to monitor that the funding standard is being reached. If we force them into a three year jacket, many companies could not afford it. They would probably not remain in business and the situation would be worse. I provided for an extra seven years in order to make it possible for these companies to remain in business and make the contribution to the pension fund.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusBrennan" eId="spk_157" as="#Minister_for_Social_and_Family_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. S. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_441">There is no guarantee because these are private pension schemes. I know of no party that has recommended nationalising these schemes. We have a choice to make. Should we press the company so hard that it says, "To Hell with this, we are out of here", or should we take companies under the wing of the Pensions Board and, over a longer period, nurse them to a situation where they can get their pension funds up to the required standard and thereby have a better chance of protecting the pension funds of the individuals involved?</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We could spend the whole day debating this issue. I want to convince the Senator that I took these two decisions in order to protect pension funds, not to give into some bunch from the pensions industry. That is not my brief. My brief is to protect pensioners and ensure more people take out pensions. This is where I am coming from in this debate. I know the Senator is taking a special interest in this matter and I listened carefully to what she said. However, I have given my response to the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Senator Cox has been consistent for many years on the issue of child care. It requires a joined-up Government approach. It is becoming a major issue. Anyone campaigning in the by-election will know that commuting to and from Dublin and the requirement for young families to have child care is being brought up on every doorstep. It is a major issue which will require a combination of a number of Departments to pull it together. The Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Social and Family Affairs and Finance have a big role to play in this regard. While there are taxation and safety implications involved, there is a need to develop a strong child care policy. I note the example of France, which I will take on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The Senator also raised the issue of carer's allowances and widows. The Oireachtas committee recommended that we should pay half rate to widows who go into caring. We could not do that this year, but provided the €1,000 respite grant instead. My Department will continue to examine whether it is possible to include widows in the carer's allowance in the future. I note the Senator's points on parental leave benefit which is also a major issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Senator Wilson paid tribute to the money advice and budgeting service and I wish to join the Senator in praising the agency which helps people out of debt and to manage money. While there is much talk about social inclusion, MABS is concerned with financial inclusion, a very important step on the road to full social inclusion. If one can teach people to use bank accounts, pay their bills and manage their money, they are much more likely to be socially included.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Senator Mansergh raised the issue of individualisation. I think there is scope to do more in this area. The rather Dickensian concept of a dependant, particularly one who is a fine healthy adult, does not have much place in a 21st century social security code. While that is easy to say, moving from the present state to our desired destination will be another day's work. I am taken with the argument that the concept of dependancy is one that should not be in our system, unless a genuine dependancy exists. It makes more sense to deal with people as individuals, and we will examine what is possible in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Senator Mansergh also suggested a basic review of whether child benefit is reaching its targets. A number of Senators discussed child poverty. The National Economic and Social Council is examining a possible amalgamation of the family income supplement and the child dependant allowance into a new, second-tier children's allowance, to be aimed at low-income families. The NESC has almost completed its work and as soon as it is available, we will take some decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">I accept the argument that the universal nature of child benefit is important in getting funds to families on behalf of children. We need to examine a more focused approach to child poverty. One way to do so is through the introduction of a special type of child benefit which would be like FIS and child dependant allowance. I hope we can make some rapid progress on that issue. While it is important to cherish all of the children of the nation equally, it is more important to cherish the targeted few that are on the poverty line. I do not think that takes from the constitutional principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">I thank Senator Henry for her comments. In particular, she spoke about the back to education allowance. Originally, the limit was six months but my predecessor raised it to 15 months. I brought it back to 12 months and I told the Dáil that between now and September, I will review the position to see if it is possible to bring it back to nine months. September is an appropriate time, as it is when most people return to the education system and sign on. We have eased the restriction, but have not yet gone further than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Senator Ulick Burke complimented the staff of my Department, with which I agree. They are a fine body of professional people. He also spoke about the importance of confidentiality in appeals. We can track the specific case he raised to ensure that if it occurred in the manner described, it will not recur.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">He also mentioned waiver charges, as did a number of other Senators. In the main, the issue arises from the privatisation of the refuse collection system and the non-requirement of the private sector to introduce waivers. Successive Governments have taken the view that is a local issue concerning local authorities, which should be the bodies to organise waivers, even with the private sector. However, a pensioner who did not have a bill for €300 last year but now suddenly does, will not care which local authority he or she lives in. The bill must be paid, which may be a problem. This means that my Department and I must give the issue some consideration. The Combat Poverty Agency recommended that it be done with a locally-operated waiver system. From the Government's perspective, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and myself continue our discussions as to how we can help with some kind of waiver regime that might be targeted. It would have to operate through the local authorities. In the short term, there is no scope for a major national scheme along the lines suggested by the Opposition Members. I thank Senator Ulick Burke for raising the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">Senator Ryan spoke about habitual residence. He mentioned a requirement of three years, whereas it is actually two years. I see the Senator is not with us. I do not wish to dwell on this in detail except to state that there is no discrimination in the social welfare system against those from the accession states. There are five tests which they must meet as must everyone in Ireland. One of the tests is a two-year residency requirement. The habitual residence issue is under review and we are examining all the requirements to ensure fairness for people from the accession states in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Senator Finucane raised the issue of a helpline and the waiting period. I will pass that to my colleague the Minister for Health and Children. He also raised the issue of waivers. Senator Brian Hayes raised the issue of lone parents, particularly the maintenance scheme issue. The Senator has a case, which I will examine.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">I wish to make some points about lone parents. There are some myths extant about lone parents, essentially pub talk, and we should put some facts on the record. In reality, less than 3%, 2.8% to be exact, of lone parents are teenagers. The notion that there is an army of teenagers is not accurate. In fact, 75% of all lone parents are over 25 and the average age is approximately 27 or 28. One third of lone parents are in their 30s. People have a false impression that one is dealing with a mass of teenagers. The other myth is that lone parents have a multiplicity of children because there is great money to be had from the system. This is also inaccurate as 60% have one child and 25% have two. In other words, 85% of lone parents have two children or fewer. Lone parents tend to be older than pub talk suggests and tend to have one child. This gives the lie to the myth that somehow there is a racket going on as the figures show clearly this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">Lone parents have genuine pressures and our job is to meet those pressures. The best way to do so and I note what has been said about the back to education allowance, is to encourage people back into education and back to work. Joined-up Government is required in this area as it affects a range of Departments, and an interdepartmental group is examining how the system can be changed to encourage lone parents back into education and work.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I am interested in revisiting the issue of the cohabitation rule. We are working on it but do not have an easy answer. I do not like a social policy where in the 21st century, the Republic sends inspectors to the homes of 50,000 to 60,000 lone parents to ensure that the child's father is not in the house. This cannot be good social policy. Joint parenting is clearly better and if the parties involved agree, cohabitation is also probably better for the child. A State system that polices lone parents to ensure that does not happen cannot be right. However, as I noted in the Dáil yesterday, the situation is similar to the leaving certificate points system. It is not perfect, but until a better method is found, one should not mess with it. I must confer with my officials and garner advice from wherever we find it, as to how we can improve social policy in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">I am convinced that funding and income support are the main responsibilities of my Department. We also have a responsibility to use that income support to help solve the social problems behind the payments being made. It is not sufficient to salve our collective conscience by having schemes for such things as child poverty, lone parents or pensions on the basis that if we pay the bill and sign the cheque, the problem will go away. If the problem does not go away, we must deal with the social issue behind the payment. All of us have this responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Perhaps sometime in the future, we might find out that there is no longer a need for a particular payment because the social problem behind it has been solved. It is not sufficient to institutionalise the problem, lock people into poverty traps, pay the bill, brag about the amount of money provided as part of social welfare and then assume that it constitutes social policy. Social policy goes much deeper than that and we have a responsibility to go much deeper into many of these issues. I have only skimmed the surface of this and I look forward to many more debates with Senators on the detail of all these issues in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_169">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_513">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_514">In June 2000 an interdepartmental group reported on the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 1986. It recommended that an age limit of 18 years should apply to the use of gaming machines, the purchase of lottery tickets, the placing of bets with bookmakers and the totalisator, otherwise known as the tote. It also recommended that a new Act should place the responsibility for ensuring that the age limit is strictly enforced on the operators or proprietors of the gaming premises and the vendors of lottery tickets.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">In October 2002 in reply to a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister said that the preparation of legislation to implement the report on the Gaming and Lotteries Act was included in the Government's legislative programme and that the Bill was likely to be published in 2003. These were the words of the present Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform — it was part of the legislative programme and was part of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In 2003 I raised the matter on the Order of Business in the hope that it would jolt the Government into some action but to date nothing has been forthcoming. It is because of this lack of will and the lack of action that I have been forced to introduce the Bill before the House. I hope this necessary legislation which obviously clears up an anomaly in the law will be supported by all sides of the House. All it seeks is to implement the recommendations of an interdepartmental report.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">At present, one must be over 18 years of age to buy a lottery ticket or to place a bet with a bookmaker either in a bookie shop or on the course but any child can have a bet on the tote in the State. Is this correct? How long more are we, as legislators, prepared to accept child gambling because that is what we are doing by allowing the present situation to continue?</p>
          <p eId="para_518">A constituent of mine, Frank Hennessy, has devoted many years to studying this subject and campaigning to have the law changed. I have viewed many hours of video in various racecourses and dog tracks throughout the country where children barely out of nappies and children in communion dresses in some cases were having bets on the tote. Are we prepared to accept this? Some may ask where is the harm in having a few euro on the tote. For most children there will probably be no problem but I have spoken with many parents and adults whose lives have been destroyed by gambling and most, if not all, started having a bet on the tote when they were children.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I refer to the review group's report and its comments on compulsive and addictive gambling. The appetite for gambling is perceived to be greatest among those who can least afford it and this requires protection. The serious social and personal consequences of compulsive gambling behaviour remain as relevant now as when the 1956 and 1986 Acts were framed. Personal problems experienced by individuals include various forms of destructive behaviour such as involvement in crime, including theft from employers to finance gambling, incurring large debts, damaged relationships with family and friends, and, in some cases, suicide and attempted suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">These are the words of the experts. I am sure that many Members of the House realise that people have lost farms, businesses, homes and marriages because of compulsive gambling. This House should do everything in its power to prevent children and future generations from suffering similar fates. Addiction to alcohol or drugs is a visible addiction but for many addicted to gambling it is much more secretive and less likely to be discovered until much damage has been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I will describe how this country compares to other countries where age limits are concerned. In the UK and other European countries a person must be over 18 years to bet on the tote. In the US, the age limit is 21 years. The Minister may be familiar with Lifford dog track where children can bet at will on the tote and yet a few miles across the Border, children are prevented from betting at the Derry dog track because the legislation is in place and is being enforced. This country is therefore out of line with the US, our European neighbours and with our closest neighbours in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">In 1997, all 166 Members of the Dáil were asked by letter whether they agreed that children under 18 years should be permitted to bet on the tote. Some 87 Deputies, including a number of present Ministers, supported a ban on children under 18 being allowed to bet on the tote. Only eight Deputies did not support a ban, 37 sat on the fence and the remaining 30 did not reply. This showed overwhelming support for the type of action which my Bill proposes and overwhelming support from a number of Ministers currently in caring Ministries.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I expect the Government to put its money where its mouth is and support this Bill which will prevent child gambling. I suggest that a similar proportion of Members of both Houses of the current Oireachtas would support the ban on gambling by children under 18 in what is a semi-State body, the tote. According to expert advice, the current law is wrong and it should be changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I am not anti-gambling. I enjoy a bet myself and have gone overboard on betting on several occasions. I have often met the Minister at race meetings. The opportunity for children to bet should be done away with. This would drastically reduce the numbers of people who will become addicted to gambling in the future. If this Bill prevents one person from becoming addicted to gambling, it will be worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">In a recent survey, 100 gamblers were asked at what age they started gambling. Some 92 stated that they began between the ages of eight and 12. Almost to a man and a woman, they wished they had never been allowed to bet as it only brought misery to their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">There are vested interests which regard betting as just a bit of fun and who regard me as a killjoy. A former high-ranking member of the Irish Horseracing Authority stated on television that the authority wanted to develop the customers of the future. In my view it is time enough at 18 years of age to develop the customer of the future. The authority should target them with their marketing machinery rather than targeting young children. Any anomaly should be rectified at the earliest possible opportunity. I appeal to the Government and all Members of the House to support this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">The interdepartmental review group report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_528">The Review Group is concerned that no age limit applies at present to betting on the totalisator at racecourses and greyhound tracks. Although the Group acknowledges that the 1929 Totalisator Act does not lie within its terms of reference, it is of the view that it is an issue which should, for the sake of consistency be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">This Bill addresses the inconsistency outlined by the review group and is a tangible and constructive way of addressing this problem. I hope the Minister will not reply by stating that the Government plans to introduce its own legislation in the future. The reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2002 stated that the Government planned to introduce legislation in 2003. It is now 2005 and children in communion dresses are still being allowed to place bets, with the possibility that several may become addicted.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I have met many people who have become addicted to gambling because of their proximity to racecourses and dog tracks in particular. A visitor to any race track or dog track will see lines of unaccompanied children, in many instances, being dragged through the mire because a State-run body promotes gambling. I am not a killjoy, I enjoy placing a bet. I want to give these children a fair chance. It should be our prime responsibility as legislators to protect these children and give them that chance.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_170">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_531">I second the Bill proposed by my colleague, Senator Cummins. I welcome the Minister to the House. The Government has two options tonight. As Senator Cummins said, an issue of principle is to be determined. The Government can vote the Bill down and the issue will remain off the table for a significant period of time. The Government has sat on this issue since the interdepartmental report was published some years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The other option which is one I recommend to the House is that the Bill be given a Second Reading and be allowed proceed to Committee Stage. The Government could at that stage produce amendments to the initial totalisator legislation established some years ago. The review of the Gaming and Lotteries Act and the report of the interdepartmental group highlighted not just this issue but many other issues. We wish to facilitate the Government this evening in accepting the Bill and allowing it to bring forward its own amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I ask the Government to consider this suggestion by 7 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">As Senator Cummins noted, many Members, including me, gave commitments in 1997. I was delighted the Senator was able to show me a letter I wrote in 1997 as I could not recall it. Before other Senators express a view they need to be certain about what they said in 1997 as those who wish to have it both ways will be embarrassed.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">This is not a laughing matter and anyone who believes it is should address the straightforward issue of whether it is appropriate that those aged under 18 years can go to the tote and bet unlimited sums of money. Those who believe it is right will oppose the Bill, while those who believe it is wrong will support it and allow it to proceed to Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">Senator Cummins demonstrated in stark terms that the protection of children is at stake here. Given that we do not accept that children should be able to drink alcohol or have unrestricted access to lottery tickets before reaching the age of 18 years, why should we take a different approach to the tote? I am a strong supporter of the tote which gives better odds than the bookmakers and the profits by and large go to a good cause. As Senator Cummins correctly stated, however, we have a responsibility to protect children and address the problem of gambling by children as well as the more significant problem of gambling by adults.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I am glad to hear that because the Senator has not done so thus far. We should deal with the issue in the strongest possible terms. Clearly the Government has a view on the matter given that it commissioned an interdepartmental report which produced stark findings. The Bill offers us an opportunity to implement one such finding.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">At a recent meeting of the Committee on Procedures and Privileges I proposed that a sessional order be made to allow for three Private Members' Bills to be taken at any given time by any given group in the House. My sole purpose was to ensure that issues of this nature, which may not get a hearing in the other House due to time constraints and the argy-bargy of party politics, could be raised here. I hope the Seanad, with its long and proud tradition of taking initiatives such as this, addressing them in a serious manner and adopting a firm position, will move beyond Second Stage this evening and bring forward the Remaining Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I welcome the Bill and ask the House to give it a Second Reading. We must address the only issue before us, namely, whether it is right that a child under the age of 18 years should be able to gamble an unlimited amount of money through the tote. This is the issue Senator Cummins has bravely and repeatedly raised on the Order of Business and the debate should focus on it to the exclusion of all other matters.</p>

          <from>Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism (Mr. O’Donoghue)</from>
          <p eId="para_542">I thank Senators Cummins and Brian Hayes for their interest in this matter and for providing me with an opportunity to discuss issues relating to two of Ireland's oldest cultural and sporting activities, horse and greyhound racing. The special place both sports hold in the lives of many Irish people is evident in the numbers following racing and attending race meetings in every corner of the country. Bord na gCon estimates that 1.4 million patrons will attend greyhound racing in 2005, while Horse Racing Ireland's strategy is to increase total annual attendances to 1.5 million by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">As well as the enjoyment and entertainment provided to millions of people every year, both sports contribute substantially to the economic and employment sectors. For example, an estimated 17,000 people are in full-time employment and a further 18,000 in part-time employment in the horse racing and bloodstock industries, while an estimated €840 million is generated in gross income by these industries in 2003 alone. Similarly, greyhound racing provides approximately 10,600 full and part-time jobs in the various sectors associated with the sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">I am pleased that Government support for both sports has been substantial over recent years, particularly since 2001 when the Oireachtas approved legislation creating the horse and greyhound racing fund "for the purpose of giving support to horse and greyhound racing". The rationale of the fund was that horse and greyhound racing needed certainty regarding its funding support on a multi-annual basis and that such funding to develop the industries should be derived from the duty generated from all off-course betting. Prior to this the horse and greyhound racing bodies were funded with annual grant-in-aid allocations from the Department of Agriculture and Food and a fixed fee and 0.3% of turnover from off-course betting. In 2004 the Government introduced regulations to increase the limit of the horse and greyhound racing fund from €254 million to €550 million to continue the fund for a further four years to 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I have outlined these facts merely to underline the importance of both sports in our social and sporting traditions. Both sectors provide opportunities for family groups, parents and children of all ages, to enjoy thrilling races and a meal in convivial surroundings. Both sports, as I have outlined, make significant contributions to our economic well-being and are one of our distinctive characteristics as a nation. Wearing my tourism hat, I am in a position to inform the House that I have heard many reports of foreign visitors, families and larger groups thoroughly enjoying the racing experience at horse and greyhound stadiums here.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">Since the establishment of the Totalisator Act, families have enjoyed sociable occasions visiting greyhound and horse racing stadiums. Many of us remember the excitement of placing a 50p or shilling wager on the tote. Spending is effectively controlled and restricted to the funds provided by parents and it would be a shame if this pleasant tradition were to be stopped. I have seen no evidence to suggest that wagering by persons under the age of 18 years on the tote is problematic. It takes place in a controlled environment with parents in attendance. If the proposed restriction is implemented, it will result in parents placing wagers on behalf of their children.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">The view has also been expressed that modern society is, in many ways, becoming overly regulated. The key facts are that children should not be admitted without an adult in company and effective control can be maintained by parents by restricting the funds available for wagering.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Internet has opened the gateway to gambling and the controls on Internet gaming are only as strict as those imposed by parents. Bord na gCon and Horse Racing Ireland are not aware of any significant concerns expressed by parents or the public generally. The current system has served the sport well and the board has indicated there is no need to change the <i>status quo</i>.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">The key is control and balance of parental guidance as opposed to another set of restrictive legal impositions.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Persons under 18 years attending horse race meetings do so under the accompaniment and control of their parents and, as such, would also invest with the tote in a controlled social environment. The normal investment in the tote by persons under 18 years is of the order of €1 on selected pools. Persons under 18 investing with the tote are generally confined to holiday festival type race meetings frequented by family groups. There is a concern that introducing the proposed measure would have a negative effect on overall attendances, particularly by family groups, and could have a negative effect on the level of interest in racing among the coming generations.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">Since August 1996 the age at which one may marry has increased. However, it is still possible for persons between the ages of 16 and 18 years to make an application to the court for an exemption to the law to be allowed to get married.</p>

Consequently, the proposed amendment to the Totalisator Act 1929 would render the policing of this amendment to the Act unworkable.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I originally come from south Kildare gambling territory and grew up with an interest in horses and backing them. I have no puritanical inheritance about one of the great joys of Irish life. However, I have puritanical views on access to modern cinema, which is in many cases restricted to people over 18 years, and alcohol, which by consensus is also restricted to people over 18 years. Until Senator Cummins raised the matter, I was blissfully unaware that there was no age restriction on tote betting. One of my children, when 16 years old, went with his friends to the dog track in Cork city. The Minister referred to parents being present but they went on their own. They had a wonderful night, spending about a tenner each. It was a million times better than most 16 year olds would have had trying to crawl into a pub or drinking behind walls. In my blissful ignorance I asked him if anyone had objected to their being there, thinking he got away with something against the law. I now discover that was not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">For most of us gambling, like alcohol, can be great fun. Whether it is the horses or the dogs, it would not be the same without the fun of a flutter. However, it is undoubtedly true that for some it is a deadly dangerous addiction. Not long ago, Dublin city had a crisis with young people becoming addicted to slot machine gambling. Dublin City Council subsequently banned slot machines. While not a great enthusiast of slot machines, I am not sure if there is much in the world that is not inherently dangerous to other people that should be banned, except for Senator Mansergh's rude remarks about the Labour Party this afternoon.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_567">The alternative to a liberal and open regime on alcohol or gambling is one of protecting people when they cannot handle them. I am not being patronising but society must prevent commercial forces from stealing people's childhood ahead of time. This is distinct from protecting young people from alcohol, drugs, sex or gambling. There is a commercially driven tendency to reduce the term of childhood, whether through the sales of cosmetics, clothes or teenage magazines.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">For some people, gambling can become a wholly destructive addiction. South Kildare, as good gambling territory, has well-grounded anecdotes about the deeds of farms being thrown into poker schools at six o'clock in the morning. I do not know if such events happened. However, there is ample evidence of many families driven close to destitution by the addictive gambling of a family member. It is a pity the Minister, in opposition to the nanny state, has nailed his colours to the mast, given his previous incumbency as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Such a remarkable reversal of roles must be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">Other than inconvenience, there is no other convincing argument for not restricting access to this form of serious gambling. Penny slot machines are one matter, but this is serious gambling to people old enough to take responsibility for themselves. The argument that funds might be lost is dangerous and flawed. If the amounts of money gambled by people under 18 years are large enough to reduce the funding available through the tote, then it is a big problem. Young people should not be in a position to gamble that much. If they are, then they are well on the way to serious problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Those opposing the Bill argue that the sums of money involved are trivial. If that is the case, then for once we are closing the stable door before the horse has bolted. Laws concerning access to alcohol were created when most people under 18 years had no disposable income and could not afford to drink. This regime persists yet young people now have large disposable incomes. The same will happen in the case of the tote. What objections has the Minister to accepting this Bill in principle? I accept an ongoing study is being conducted, but why can it not run in parallel with this Bill? Slot machine gambling is allowed, through the technology the Minister described, at a race meeting in Leopardstown. However, it is ironic that one is prohibited by the local by-laws in doing the same outside the course. Unless the public is screaming, Governments always put aside and delay Private Members' Bills. Senator Cummins will just be patted on the head and thanked for raising a matter of some concern. I would be disappointed if Senator Cummins started to raise matters which were not of some concern to him. That is not much of a compliment. Is there really a Government consensus that it might be acceptable for people under 18 years of age to have unregulated access to serious gambling? Is there really a Government consensus, discussed and agreed at Cabinet, that it might be okay because for most of us, it would not be?</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Since we have an obligation to give people time to grow up and to protect people until they are old enough to make rational choices, to have money of their own and to act independently of their parents, the principle of this legislation, whatever about the detail, should be accepted. I, and the Labour Party, will support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_572">Unlike the previous debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2005, I am glad I have the benefit of following Senator Ryan having listened to the wisdom of his views. I welcome the Minister and was glad to hear him give an overview of the importance of the racing and greyhound industry. In general, I commend Members who bring forward Private Members' Bills. In fact, the Minister, as Opposition spokesperson on justice, brought in the most important Private Members' Bill of the past ten years, namely, the Criminal Assets Bureau Bill, or whatever its precise title was at the time. As we have seen recently, it is the most vital legislation in the criminal justice area.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I refer strictly to the under 18s aspect of the Bill which I regard as <i>de minimis</i>. Like Senator Ryan, I did not realise the full legal position. I have not read any article or listened to any radio programme — perhaps I have missed them — referring to this as a serious social problem. I can think of many serious social problems relating, in one way or another, to young people — for example, disorder on the streets late at night, drink, drugs, unwanted pregnancies and so on. This particular problem, however, has never been brought to my attention. Some of the leaders in this House, not least the leader of Senator Cummins’s party, found the title of the Bill a bit of a tongue-twister on today’s Order of Business but I suppose it relates to the 1929 legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">I do not know about Senator Cummins but I cannot remember when I first placed a bet at a racecourse. However, I suspect it was at approximately the age of eight or ten, which is probably true of most people. I admit it was not unsupervised but with parental encouragement and approval. A racecourse is not much fun unless one is a small child running around and playing in the circle with nothing to do with the racing. It is not much fun unless one is able to place a bet.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">Racecourses are fairly boring places unless one has an interest in the outcome. What the Minister said about family groups is absolutely right. I am sure there are cases of people in their late teens going in groups and these days the money they have is probably mostly money they have earned. However, I can think of many other ways in which that money might be spent which could create more problems than placing a small bet.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">Gambling takes a number of forms and Senator Cummins is quite right that it can be a serious problem and can be addictive both among older and younger people. I fully approved of the ban on slot machines in Dublin city and I believe it helped remove a problem. However, race meetings, by their nature, only take place at intervals and are a controlled environment and one must pay an entry fee. The scope for abuse is, in practice, not too great.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Life is full of anomalies and I do not believe it is necessary to get rid of every anomaly. The report suggested that the reason this is an issue is that for the sake of consistency, this should be addressed. If there was evidence that we were addressing a serious social problem, I would be much more sympathetic. We are all fairly middle aged here, with all due respect to Senator McHugh, and we do not want to give the impression we are always trying to close down things for young people. Attendance at a racecourse is one of the most harmless and enjoyable occupations. It can be enjoyable for a child of eight or ten and I presume Senator Cummins went to racecourses at that age.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">I am prepared to remit to the wisdom of the Minister who, along with his Department, will have studied the report. If legislation is to be introduced on foot of the report, then it should deal with several matters rather than this one in isolation. When introducing legislation, one must make the case and I do not believe it has been made.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">There should not be a debate tonight. We have in our company Senator Mansergh who is a skilled and experienced debater but there is no issue about which to argue the toss. It is a black and white issue. We are talking about children and young adults under 18 years of age who are not allowed buy a lottery ticket or to go into bookmakers' offices because there is a legal age limit in place. We are talking about gambling among under 18 year olds which is facilitated by a State-sponsored body, namely, the tote. It is a black and white issue and it should not be allowed or encouraged. It is an issue we should seriously consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Until young people have a voice, we will have to make decisions for them. Young people cannot vote until they are 18 years of age, so they do not have a voice. What Senator Cummins is trying to do is to act, as best he can, in the interests of the State, families and of young people who are not being provided for by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I accept there are scout groups and certain councils within schools, but such bodies are not elected democratically. It is not good enough that young people do not have a voice. The National Youth Federation, Foróige and skilled people in the community sector are working on behalf of young people, but that does not mean they have a voice. I am keen to encourage people to appreciate that young people from the age of 14 are young adults. Public representatives must act in a responsible manner, for example by protecting the family and society, until young people are given a democratic voice that can be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">It is not good enough for me to talk about giving young people a voice if I cannot suggest a way of doing so. I have proposed a solution to this problem on many occasions in this House. I have discussed with my colleague, Senator Cummins, the question of how the Government can facilitate young people by giving them a democratic say on matters which relate to their daily lives. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is familiar with the operation of a scheme in County Donegal that gives a voice to young people. Many other Ministers are familiar with the organisation in question because many of them have visited the county in recent months, for some strange reason. Perhaps I should raise this matter on another occasion. The Taoiseach and the Ministers for Education and Science, Arts, Sport and Tourism and Enterprise, Trade and Employment have visited County Donegal in recent times.</p>

          <p eId="para_586">Many Ministers, including the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, are familiar with the work of the Donegal Youth Council, which is a democratically elected body of young people between the ages of 16 and 18 who represent their peers. As legislators, we will have to fill a niche by representing those between the ages of 16 and 18 as best we can until a national body with a democratic mandate is established for them. The Bill introduced by Senator Cummins, in the interests of protecting young people, families and society, is credible and responsible. It is a black and white issue. It is nonsensical to contemplate allowing people under the age of 18 to gamble on the tote, especially given that they are not allowed even to enter an official bookmaker's office.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I ask the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, to see sense. I listened to the Minister's earlier comments in my office. As young people are not represented, it is our job as legislators to protect them. The day will come when people between the ages of 14 and 18 will have a national democratic voice. We will listen to them and take on board their points of view on that day, when they will be able to tell us what is in their best interests. Such a system is not in place at the moment, unfortunately. It is important in the interim to fill the gap I have mentioned. Senator Cummins has made a sensible and responsible argument this evening. I will be interested to hear what a responsible and competent man like Senator Leyden, who will be the next distinguished Senator to propose an hypothesis and an argument, has to say on this matter.</p>

I compliment the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and all those associated with the production of the Bill. They should be commended on their efforts. It is something of a killjoy Bill, however. When I went to Roscommon races as a child, most people paid to get into the inner area, but there was a carnival atmosphere in the outer area, where one would find various sports. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, has been to Roscommon and I will be happy to welcome him back in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The racecourse in Roscommon has contributed greatly to the economy of Roscommon town and the surrounding areas. It would have been closed in a previous era of rationalisation, however, if it had not been for the intervention of the former Minister, the late, great Brian Lenihan. He has never been given in this House the recognition he deserves for the substantial work he did for County Roscommon. Such credit is also due to other people who served as Deputies for that area. Some of those who represented the Roscommon side of the former Roscommon-Leitrim constituency, for example, might not always have been given the recognition they deserved.</p>

I appreciate that there are difficulties because bookmakers cannot take bets from those under the age of 18, whereas the tote, which is controlled by the State, can take such bets. I suppose Senator Cummins has introduced a little idea all right. We are in danger of adopting a "nanny state" approach of protecting everybody from themselves. I have been to race meetings at Roscommon, Ballinrobe, Galway and Kilbeggan. Nobody has ever brought this issue to my attention on such occasions. If submissions have been made about this issue, I am sure they have been made to the Minister, but concern has never been expressed to me about a young person going to the races and placing a bet of €1 each way. It is not a big issue. Opposition Members should have more to concern themselves with than this minor affair.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_634">I welcome the Minister to the House and commend my colleague Senator Cummins on his initiative in undertaking the great task of publishing a Private Members' Bill and doing all the necessary research thereon. It is amazing to hear the hypocrisy of the Government. Only two and a half years ago, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform indicated he was willing to examine this area and rectify the anomaly that exists, yet the Government side will vote against this Bill tonight. While I appreciate that the Government might have difficulty with some minor aspects of the Bill, these could all be teased out on Committee Stage. However, it is shooting down the Bill at the very first hurdle.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">In June 2000, an interdepartmental group issued a report reviewing the Gaming and Lottery Acts of 1956 and 1986. These Acts are clearly out of date. The group recommended that 18 years be the age at which one can bet at the State tote. I have a difficulty with this age and believe it should be reconsidered. I would prefer if it could be examined on Committee and Remaining Stages rather than being shot down on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">We have clear regulations prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to people under 16. We clearly prohibit the sale of alcohol, both in off-licences and pubs, to those aged under 18 and we clearly prohibit the placing of bets at racecourses through bookmakers, yet the tote is completely unregulated. The Minister must agree that this should not be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Senator Cummins mentioned the negative consequences of gambling at an early age. All Members automatically assume that teenagers or young children place bets of €1 or €2 but I wonder how correct we are in this assumption. It would be interesting to have the relevant statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">It is obviously quite dangerous for youths to get into the habit of gambling, especially when they do not have money. It is dangerous enough even for adults, many of whom have destroyed their lives as a result. This is a common sense Bill in that it plans to introduce regulations in this area and remove an anomaly. It is obviously very difficult for the Senators and Deputies from the Border counties, such as Senator McHugh, to witness one rule applying in Donegal, for example, and an altogether different rule applying a few hundred yards across the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The Bill deserves more attention from the Government. Two weeks ago, we noticed that Senator Norris had put considerable work into his Private Members' Bill. It required years of work but the Government kicked it to touch, fudged the issue and, in doing so, destroyed the very purpose of parliamentarians. The purpose of parliamentarians is to legislate, yet when two Members on this side of the House take the initiative to bring forward legislation, the Government's immediate reaction is to torpedo it and ensure it gets no further. It is disingenuous on the part of the Government to vote against this Bill on Second Stage and not allow it to proceed to further Stages, in which the complicated issues involved could be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Senator Cummins referred to the link with crime, including theft from employers to finance gambling. We are very familiar with such cases in the newspapers and I am sure they only represent the tip of the iceberg. People are obviously incurring considerable debts and suffering from damaged relationships with family and friends as a result of gambling. In some cases, they commit or attempt to commit suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">This issue was debated in 1997, at which time the Members of the Dáil were written to on the subject. Almost half of them indicated that they supported a ban, eight were against it and 37 were unsure. I am sure a similar ratio obtains today. It is quite clear there is considerable unease and disquiet. The public and Members of the Dáil would like to see some work being done in this area. It is regrettable that the Government will not even look at Senator Cummins's Bill or table amendments on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The issue involved is quite simple and yet complicated in its own way. We cannot allow young children to place bets at an unregulated State-run tote while banning them from doing so at bookmakers and banning them from buying cigarettes and from purchasing scratch cards worth €1 through the national lottery. The age issue needs to be reconsidered. The recommended age of 18 might be too old. I would prefer to see a restriction on those under 14. This could be achieved during Committee and Report Stages if the Bill is allowed to proceed. It is very regrettable that the Government has sought to knock this very worthwhile Bill, which has already provoked considerable debate in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Senator Leyden certainly made very little sense in his contribution. If we were to follow his logic, we would allow children to buy cigarettes in shops and alcohol in pubs and off-licences. We clearly do not allow this, for very good reason. The same principle should apply in the case of gambling. Many families affected by the scourge of gambling will not thank this Government in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">It is unfortunate that the Government has tried to portray the Opposition members as killjoys when in fact they are fully in favour of people enjoying themselves at race meetings. I regularly go to my local racecourse in Gowran and believe the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism have also been there quite a few times. I have not seen the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in attendance but perhaps he will attend on a later date. We are able to enjoy ourselves but we are also aware of the serious damage gambling does to families. That is why it must be controlled and regulated. The Government should reflect on and support this Bill, and if necessary bring forward changes on Committee Stage as it does with every other Bill. It is rare that the first draft of a Bill is perfect.</p>

          <p eId="para_645">I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his well-merited appointment. I wish him well in his post. I have followed his record and he is doing a fine job.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I thank Senator Cummins for introducing this Bill. While we may disagree with it on this side of the House, I admire the strength of his feeling on the issue and acknowledge his right to introduce the Bill. There is an anomaly in the 1929 Act which states that a child under 18 years of age may bet on the tote at a racetrack but not on or off course in a bookmaker's shop, and many not buy a lottery ticket. Whether we want to do something about this or believe it is necessary to do so is another issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">This Bill is a result of an analysis by an interdepartmental group of the gaming and lotteries legislation 1956-86. The group stated in its report that it was not part of its remit to refer to this, apart from considering consistency within the law. If a group attempts to make an issue out of something it will at least investigate its effects on children if that is relevant. The group stated that it did not do that. Its views are based on the whole debate, not on any one issue of real concern. While it may be concerned about this it cannot back that up with any statistical value. There is no evidence that this anomaly causes, or is likely to cause, a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Neither of the bodies that runs the events endorses this amendment because it will be impossible to police since the introduction of automatic vending machines. The organising bodies could not be held responsible for policing those machines. I have heard no call from parents or the public at large expressing concern about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Children up to the age of 15 years attend race meetings as family events where their parents supervise them. As one who enjoys a flutter and a race meeting, if I had to wait until I was 18 years of age to place my first bet I would never have supported the sport. I would not have known its joy.</p>

          <p eId="para_653">We may as well cancel life if we take that approach. I grew up in Galway and one of the highlights of the year was to go to the Galway races with my parents, which we did faithfully every year. We had a few pennies in our pockets to lose or accumulate. Part of the fun was to back a horse without letting one's siblings know which it was until the horses came around the bend and she was either leading the way or in the shake-up.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">One's excitement was such that one could not contain oneself and the family discovered which horse one had backed only at the last minute. I cannot imagine what it would have been like if I had to rely on one of my parents to place my bet, thereby losing my bit of independence and the little secret I kept until I wished to release it by way of a yelp or a roar.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">That lives with me today as part of the enjoyment I had with my family at a race meeting. I would hate children to lose that opportunity. My nieces and nephews enjoy similar occasions with their parents, my brothers and sisters. It is one of the most enjoyable days out one can have. Many of our neighbours and friends had the same experience and none of us, and none of them, to my knowledge, has ended up in Gamblers Anonymous. While I respect Senator Cummins' opinion and his reasons for putting this Bill before us on a topic which needs to be debated it is not serious enough to require amending legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">As the Minister said, racing has been part of Irish culture and Irish life for centuries. We are hailed internationally as being the greatest horse lovers in the world. We probably have the most knowledgeable punters imaginable, as well as the best horses and jockeys. It would be a loss for a child, a teenager or an adult to miss out on enjoying that to the fullest extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">The Minister also mentioned the economic value of the horse racing industry which employs 17,000 people full time and 18,000 part time while the greyhound industry employs 10,500 people full time and part time.</p>

          <p eId="para_659">That generates great income for the Exchequer. I read an article last year about a proposal to allow people play the lotto through their mobile phones. That would be of much greater significance because a child in the comfort of his or her bedroom could bang out lotto tickets on his or her mobile phone without his or her parents' knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">That is more devious than betting on the tote but I do not know whether the plan took off. There are far more devious ways of losing money through gambling than in the comforting situation of being at a race meeting as a child with one's family. While I accept the Senator's right to introduce this Bill I cannot agree with it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_661">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe. It is very nice to see him back here in the Seanad where I recall his genial and well-informed presence on the Government benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I also welcome the introduction of this; it is a healthy development. Over recent sessions several of us have put down Private Members' Bills, which is an important function of the Seanad. That is why it is a pity this is being nipped in the bud this evening. I wish there were some procedure to allow these Bills to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I fought a tough battle two weeks ago and my Bill is hanging on by its fingernails on the Order Paper. This gives me the opportunity to study what the Minister and contributors from both sides of the House said, and await the final report of the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, the outcome of a court case and the response of the Law Reform Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Questions have been raised on both sides of the House tonight. The Government side seems to say it does not appear there is any impact on children but it is obvious we do not know. Some aspects of that ignorance are rather worrying. It is worrying to reply on the basis of the profit motive, or employment considerations when one is dealing with children and in the absence of real information as to the impact on their welfare. However, I am not a complete killjoy. Listening to Senator Kett brought pictures back to my mind not of the Galway races, but of Fairyhouse. It is appropriate in my case because that was where I attended at Easter. Prince Monolulu used to turn up there and sell tips. I put the odd sixpenny bet on the tote. Senator Kett recalled his joy in keeping his investment secret until he saw the horses coming around the corner. I was a little cuter. I recall on one occasion buying a ticket for every horse in the race and waiting until the race had been run and won.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_245">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_666">At sixpence a shot, even the Minister of State could afford it. I quietly discarded all the tickets that had not won and when I nonchalantly turned around the corner, everyone wanted to see my tickets. When I said I had not looked at them, they said I got first, second and third. They were so impressed by my racing knowledge that they followed my advice for the remainder of the afternoon with totally disastrous results.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">My only other experience was being sent by <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> to Killarney races. I invested heavily in Delia Murphy because I always liked her singing of the Spinning Wheel and various other songs, which included the words “If I were a blackbird I’d whistle and sing”. I thought that she deserved some support. When she took a belly flop into the first fence, the decent people in the tote told me to leave it alone. They were very kind because I got some unofficial advice at one point.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">While people certainly do not want to be killjoys, there is a question which has not been answered. It cannot morally be answered by the type of criteria the Minister included in his speech. Members on all sides agree with the Minister that there is enjoyment and entertainment involved in racing, which for most people can be completely harmless. However, he said that these sports contribute substantially to the economic and employment sectors. This is not an argument when dealing with the welfare of children. As yet, we do not know what happens in respect of children. The Minister poses it as if he knows.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">He said that people under the age of 18 are accompanied by their parents. We do not know that is the case. There has been no factual information produced in the House in that regard. He said that persons under 18 years attending horse race meetings do so under the accompaniment and control of their parents and, as such, would also invest with the tote in a controlled social environment. I do not know if that is the case. I strongly doubt it. No evidence has been placed before the House this evening that this is the case. I would prefer if the Minister said that possibly a significant social factor has been drawn to the attention of the House and he would have it examined, but he did not quite say that. Instead of being concerned about the welfare of children, he is concerned that attendance at the races might be diminished if this requirement was introduced. We are dealing with attendance at the races and the income from that activity. It should give us cause for thought if there is a substantial contribution by children to what is a multi-million euro industry. We should ask are children investing more than €1 each way.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I do not like the sound of the new machines which appear to be dangerous. If one can go to a machine to make a bet, there is no interaction with any human being and there is no supervision whatever. These are precisely the circumstances in which children could be liable to become addicted. In my area of the city, we have been infested with places which are full of one arm bandits and so on. I know that young people, poor people, elderly people and widows have become seriously addicted to these gambling machines and, even though the initial bets are quite small, they have lost considerable sums of money. These people have got themselves into debt and trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">My final point is a bit of a clincher, even though it has probably been made by the proposers of the Bill. The interdepartmental review group, which reported in 2000, made it unambiguously clear that an age limit of 18 years should be enforced vigorously. The list it provided included gambling machines in gambling dens, lotto and the tote. If we establish an official body to draw up a report and then blithely ignore that report in the absence of information that supports on a factual basis the Minister's side, we will be in some difficulty. I have no problem supporting Senator Cummins's Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_246">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_672">I welcome the publication of the Bill. I am sure Senator Cummins has very honourable and sound reasons for bringing it forward and I commend him on the amount of time he has given to preparing it. It is worded very well and the principle he is seeking to apply is laudable.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Like Senator Norris, I would not like to debate the principle in terms of money, jobs or anything else because the issue is one of practicality. There is a serious problem, but it does not involve the correlation between youth gambling and compulsive gambling in adulthood because we do not have these figures. I agree with Senator Cummins and Senator Norris that we should have these figures. That brings me to the question of the body which was established by the Government to draw up a report on the matter. There is an anomaly which must be examined and addressed. I am not sure how the anomaly should be addressed to safeguard people under the age of 18 from the potential compulsion of addictive gambling in adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Nevertheless, there is an important principle which must be examined and the Bill is one way of doing so. All the Members who spoke here tonight recalled stories about days of enjoyment, gaiety and fun at the races. Being from the hills, the only fun, enjoyment and gaiety we had was at greyhound meetings. I will now tell a story about the trouble I got into over betting.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_248">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_676">It happened in your county, a Chathaoirligh. On one of many occasions when we had fun, enjoyment and gaiety at the greyhound races rather than at Limerick Junction, we had just secured a dog called Feakle's Champion. His name still lingers on in my memory and nightmares. As I thought he was a real champion, I decided to pass on the word to my buddies that he was worth a little flutter. It so happened that a Cork Christian Brother overheard me who had a disposition for gambling. I knew nothing about it because I was just a young fellow at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">It appears that the Cork Christian Brother took my word more seriously than some of my school pals and invested rather heavily in Feakle's Champion in the first round before everyone else would discover that he was a real champion. Unfortunately, Feakle's Champion got hit by the other greyhound on the first bend, turning the hare at a coursing meeting, and Feakle's Champion was out of the meeting. I will not disclose how I suffered afterwards. While I did not suffer any physical punishment, I suffered in the school in the subsequent days and weeks for sharing that little secret with my school pals.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">I wished to share that tale as it still occasionally lives on in my nightmares. On a more serious note, coming back to the principle involved in this issue, we should seek to safeguard our children from becoming compulsive gamblers. We should establish the incidence of addicted adult compulsive gamblers who were permitted to gamble on the tote when under 18 years of age. I make no apologies for stating that all possible measures to address the issue should be brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">There is a fine line between being a killjoy and providing safeguards for children. Senator Cummins is trying to provide a safeguard and I will not accuse him of being a killjoy. He probably goes to the races more than me, presumably with his family. However, I am concerned that the measure put forward by the Senator could be a bureaucratic nightmare. I listened to the debate in my office and tried to envisage what the situation would be like if this measure were adopted. No law is better than bad law and this measure would be bad law. In my limited experience of going to race meetings, although I am open to correction, there is usually a half hour between races. Usually the last ten minutes or quarter of an hour is spent queuing for the tote and if it is a big meeting, there could be up to 100 people queuing. How would one supervise the queue to enforce Senator Cummins' proposed regulation? It would be a nightmare scenario with massive disruption. With many families present, one would deem many people to be under 18 years of age and would try to identify and challenge them. If even one person decided to confront the challenger and had parental support, there would be chaos and disruption. I wish to speak about the issue of parental supervision shortly, as it has been mentioned several times this evening. I am not speaking about money but about the fun, gaiety and enjoyment of the occasion. Senator Cummins's proposals are not workable.</p>

          <p eId="para_685">I am not blaming the voters. That was cynical. I know the Senator did not mean it that way. I am talking about what fundamentally makes law important when we are legislating for young people. We must have their parents on our side. If we do, we have some chance of success for our regulation or new law. In this case, however, I do not believe we would have the parents on our side which is why the Bill will not work.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in the future. I also wish to compliment and congratulate my colleague Senator Cummins on bringing this important Bill on children gambling on the tote to the House. I spent much of my youth going to race meetings. I did not go because I enjoyed it, but because my father went with his friends. I think I was sent in the back of the car to ensure that they came home at a certain time at night. Hence, I did not particularly like race meetings and thankfully did not start gambling at the time. I now enjoy gambling and have gone to race meetings and greyhound races to enjoy a flutter all my adult life. Someone has said that my downfall in life would be fast women and slow horses.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_257">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_688">Hopefully the horses will get faster. I am a lottery agent and by law, anybody under 18 is not allowed to buy a lottery ticket or scratch card. As an owner of an outlet that is a lottery agent, I must enforce this law rigorously. I am sure the full rigours of the law will come down on any lottery agent seen to break the law. Thankfully, we have had no trouble. There were times in the beginning, where parents were in the pub and sent their children in with €5 to ask for lottery tickets or scratch cards, and we had to tell them we could not accept their money. The children would then return to their parents who were initially quite upset. We had to state that we were obliged to enforce the law and could not accept the money unless the parents came in themselves. Senator Fitzgerald has a point in this regard, but it would only apply for the first day or two. Thereafter, the parents learned they could not send their children in for cigarettes or lottery tickets because it is against the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Gambling starts for young people between the ages of eight and 12. There is much hypocrisy where people state that parents do not mind. I see many parents at the greyhound track, the racecourse, the football matches or coming in to buy lottery tickets who I would not like to have supervising my child or indeed their own. We must have laws that we stick by. Over the years we saw everyone say that drink-driving was doing no harm. Then, everyone stopped, or the legislation became more effective because people feared losing their licence or insurance. They never thought they might kill themselves, or worse, kill or maim innocent pedestrians. We certainly need laws and legislation to ensure that gambling is not prevalent among young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The State and Government are there to protect young people. There is currently an anomaly where they are able to protect them from going into bookmakers or gambling in newsagents. They should also be protected from on-course betting and the tote. The solution is to have children ask their parents to put €1 or €2 on a horse. There is great fun to be had, but legislation must be introduced to protect young, vulnerable and innocent children.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I am not a killjoy. I gamble myself at the racecourse and thankfully it has not affected me — well perhaps it has — but we need protection. In the UK, the age limit is 18 while in the US it is 21 which is somewhat restrictive. We should follow the example of our near neighbours in trying to raise the age to 18 years. Young people are vulnerable and impressionable. Sometimes, we all think we can gamble our way out of our debts, thinking that with one more win we will be able to buy this or that. We have a duty to protect people under 18. I acknowledge the Minister's point that there are 17,000 full-time jobs and 18,000 part-time jobs in the racing industry and in Bord na gCon, but the act of banning young people from putting €1 or €2 over the counter will not affect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">We are prepared to introduce legislation, which I welcome, that does not allow children into pubs on the grounds that it protects children. We cannot then refuse to introduce similar legislation to protect children in other areas. This Government has introduced draconian legislation which has probably worked out very well and it is now refusing to introduce legislation that will prevent young and impressionable people from gambling on race courses. This is an hypocritical stance and I congratulate Senator Cummins on raising this anomaly in the gambling process. I hope the Government will support this motion because children need to be protected; people can become addicted to gambling, as shown by the existence of Gamblers Anonymous.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Gambling can be great fun and I have seen the bond between parents and children when they go to the racecourse or greyhound stadium and their horse or dog may win. Young people could still place bets through their peers or parents. There should be some restrictions in the area of gambling, because we are leaving ourselves open to charges of hypocrisy if we do nothing.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_694">I listened with interest to the contribution of my colleague, Senator Feighan, to the debate on the Bill. I thought that he would go on to inform the House of his recent, highly successful evening of gambling where I believe he made a substantial profit. At least he did not have to worry about the age limit because it would have been clear to the host or hostess on the night that he was well over 18 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">That Senator Cummins is bringing forward this piece of legislation at least allows me to keep calm because I know of his huge interest in horse racing and the industry. I know of his experience as an on-course bookmaker and I appreciate his concern about children developing a gambling habit at an age that might be a little too young. I appreciate he has done much research and is genuinely concerned about the matter. I was not present for the Minister's response but I have read it. He makes a quite convincing case as to why the problem may not be as profound as Senator Cummins believes. The Bill before us allows us to reflect on the situation and we must take into account the fact that many adults are perhaps spending too much on all forms of gambling — Senator Feighan referred to Gamblers Anonymous, an organisation that is doing great work. It is a bit like entertainment of any sort in life, whether it is alcohol or gambling — it is a question of exercising restraint and moderation.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The Cathaoirleach is aware, as a person who is very involved with horse racing, of the huge numbers of people employed in the industry. Horse racing is almost as old as the nation and is synonymous with it. In a fortnight's time, some of us and tens of thousands of Irish people will be at Cheltenham, the annual mecca for Irish racing fans. Over the course of four days, one will see enormous sporting endeavour and goodwill between Irish and British people. During the years when there was such strife between these two islands, if there was any sport that worked overtime to build bridges, it was the racing industry. Irish, English or French winners at Cheltenham will be cheered home equally by all of the fans because everybody is there to watch the sport. We must try to ensure that whatever we do about this legislation or any legislation covering horse racing, we ensure its continuation as an integral part of Irish life. We must try to ensure we protect the industry and the sport because they do tremendous good.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">Senator Cummins feels that people under 18 should not be allowed to place bets with the tote. The Minister is saying the opposite. Perhaps we could consider the possibility of having a maximum bet of €1 or €2 for children under 18. Something like that could be considered. I respect what Senator Cummins has said. He is a great racing fan and while I may have inadvertently suggested he is a bookmaker, I do not think he is. Perhaps he invests with the bookies. At least, he has given us an opportunity to reflect on the situation. I have read the Minister's reply and I will be supporting my party colleague's proposal. However, I think I will be pressing the button with a heavy heart.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_698">I wholeheartedly support the Bill proposed by my colleague, Senator Cummins. I am slightly perplexed by some of the arguments I have heard tonight from those who oppose this legislation. Senator Cummins outlined in his opening remarks the numbers of Members of the other House who have already expressed their support for the idea behind his proposal so it is slightly puzzling to listen to the objections that have been raised. Senator Cummins is basing his proposal on the interdepartmental report on the gaming and the lotteries Acts and I think it is entirely justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Senator Fitzgerald's and the Government's central difficulty with the proposed legislation has been the question of how to police it. How is anything policed? How is the sale of alcohol policed? If one walks into a pub in Dublin or any city tonight, particularly the superpubs that could contain more than 1,000 people, how do staff know who is 18 and who is not? They ask for identification if they are doing their job correctly. Surely, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the staff of the tote would be in a similar position to ask for identification from people placing bets.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">A number of Government speakers raised the issue of the automated machines which will be introduced in a number of different parts of the country over the next couple of months and years. I share Senator Norris's doubts about the introduction of these machines. Providing such easy access to gambling facilities is a retrograde rather than a positive step. It is not a good idea to treat an addiction to gambling lightly and install unmanned machines at different locations. I am not a killjoy and I do not see any problem with people gambling. I have gambled on a number of occasions, although I would not be a regular gambler. Now and then, I have a flutter and I have recently been in the bookies with regard to the by-elections in Kildare and Meath. I backed both Fine Gael candidates to win because I think they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">It is right and proper that if someone under the age of 18 cannot buy a lottery ticket or gamble through an on-course bookie, he or she should not be allowed to gamble on the tote. It is irresponsible and wrong. I was not familiar with the legislation that governed this area until Senator Cummins brought it to my attention. I compliment him for the work and research he has invested in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">A number of Government speakers have inferred that this proposal would have a negative impact on the racing sector. This is not true, since it would be shocking if Ireland's gambling sector depended on children under the age of 18 years. It is not unreasonable to suggest that a similar barrier existing in other areas should extend to betting and gambling on the tote. I would not have a heavy heart in voting on this, but whether we vote by pressing buttons or walking through lobbies, Senator Cummins' proposal is eminently sensible.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">People tend to be cynical about politicians. If they were to read the names and details of the Members of the other House who supported this idea when it was first mooted and then see the other side of this House vote it down, they would see that it is rank hypocrisy of the highest order. I understand that a number of people did not support it then and do not do so now, but for people to change their views in order to vote against this Bill in the name of political expediency makes no sense.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_704">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and thank all the Members who have spoken on the Bill, particularly those on the other side who agreed that something must be done. They are not, however, prepared to act accordingly. I listened to the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism speak about the horseracing and greyhound industries and his related responsibilities. I support his views and the industries in question but they cannot be allowed to prosper on the misery of children and parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">The Minister said racing is a pleasant tradition that he would like to continue. He did not say he would address the situation. In 2002 the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said he would change the legislation to bring it in line with the recommendations of the interdepartmental group. There is a complete difference of opinion here. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, is saying, in effect, that he is content to support child gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The Minister mentioned that children are in a supervised environment because they are with their parents, but he is in cloud cuckooland if he considers that to be the case. If he were to visit any racing track around the country, especially a dog track, he would find children of six to ten years of age who are unaccompanied. What are we saying to these children? One may ask what they are doing unaccompanied or what their parents are doing. However, it must be asked what we, the legislators, are doing about it. We control the bookmakers and lottery agents but we can do nothing concerning the tote.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">The Minister commented on Internet betting, whether we have control over it and whether children can gamble on it. They cannot. To obtain a credit card a person must be 18 years old. In this instance, self-regulation of children betting on-line occurs because they cannot get credit cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The Government must introduce legislation in this area. We cannot have it both ways. We cannot prevent children from buying lottery tickets or gambling in the bookies but allow them to bet on the tote regardless of age. That is not realistic. This legislative anomaly has been recognised by Members on the other side of the House but the Minister is not prepared to do anything about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">I have a list of 87 contributions to this issue by Members of the Dáil in 1997. Four of them are now Ministers, eight are Ministers of State and several are Senators on the other side of the House. They agreed then with what I am proposing but will tell me now that I am wrong and will vote against what they put in writing several years ago. It is hypocritical. We are talking about children's lives. I have seen people that have lost houses, farms and marriages through gambling but this smug Government claims it is a pleasant tradition and is not affecting anyone's lives. It is affecting lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">I would have lauded the Minister if he had supported this Bill's progress to Committee Stage and introduced his amendments there, but the Government has washed its hands of this. It means people can say that because of its failure to act, child gambling is a policy of this Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_760">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, to the House. The matter I wish to raise concerns the need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to urgently put in place the disabled drivers medical appeal board. Those seeking redress from the now defunct board have been waiting in limbo for three months and the waiting list is two years, with no acknowledgement of correspondence and no indication of the status of their appeal or if an appeals process is in place. Those in need of support have been badly treated. The matter has been transferred to the Department of Finance given that the Minister of State has overall responsibility for the board, despite the fact that the Department of Health and Children has responsibility for providing the primary medical certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">The essence of the problem lies in the definition of who is eligible for the certificate, a definition which is archaic. The medical criteria to enter into the scheme limits access to those who are severely or permanently disabled. According to the criteria laid down, applicants must be wholly or almost without the use of both legs or be severely restricted in the movement of the lower limbs. It is unbelievable that stroke victims and motor neurone disease sufferers as well as those with MS are excluded from the scheme. The medical requirements for the scheme are much too restrictive. Conditions do not allow for discretion and are deliberately restrictive.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">The Ombudsman, who has successfully challenged the scheme on three or four occasions, recently outlined serious issues in regard to it. The scheme was first introduced in 1994. Since then, approximately 8,000 people have benefited from it. That between 400 and 600 individuals are awaiting an appeal is an indication of the numbers seeking access. The criteria are so restrictive that elderly spouses and children are dependent on the passenger concessions to buy extra equipment when no longer able to lift their charges in and out of the vehicles. I welcome the fact that an element of discretion will be introduced into the new appeals board. I am pleased that following a long delay the appeals board has been enhanced by two additional medical doctors and secretarial staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">It is frustrating for those who have made appeals in the past that they do not know where their papers are and when they contact the board they get an answering machine and no reply. That is frustrating for those in urgent need of assistance. That VAT and VRT is refunded to the applicants is of assistance. In many instances where assistance is provided, it prevents people from being institutionalised. For that reason the concession is value for money. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that steps are taken immediately given that there are 600 people on a two-year waiting list seeking an appeal. Something has gone terribly wrong over a period which has allowed this problem to develop. An amnesty will have to be declared to enable the board, when it is put in place along with proper funding, to begin operating on a level playing pitch and deal with the new applicants. Where medical evidence is provided, there should be no delay in allowing those appeals to go through.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Where the word of the general practitioner, who has been in constant contact with the applicant, is not taken it is a sorry state of affairs. An amnesty should be allowed for a short period for all existing applicants. The amount of money involved is small and would improve the conditions of both the applicant and his or her spouse and children, or whoever is caring for the applicant. That would be an indication that the Government is serious about caring and responding to those who are disabled and immobile.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">I do not know the definition of "mobility" within the Department of Finance or the Department of Health and Children. At local level, responsibility which formerly rested with health boards is now a matter for the Health Service Executive. Some element of discretion will have to be taken on board to allow this valuable scheme to function properly.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_766">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House and thank Senator Ulick Burke for sharing time with me to allow me to support him on this issue. I could name people who are close friends both of mine and the Minister for State who, fortunately for them, are on the right side of the border with Offaly. These people have a difficulty with this legislation and the lack of facility for appealing a decision in which they were refused a primary medical certificate. They were urged to contact Dr. Angela McNamara, the chairperson of the disabled drivers medical board of appeal in Dún Laoghaire. As public representatives we discovered there is currently no appeals board. I understand the Department of Finance has signed off on an agreement to increase the membership of the board from three to five. When will the head of the board or the consultant be appointed? When will a secretary to the board be appointed to respond to public representatives and, more important, to the people who are waiting on an appeal? When will they receive a response? The Department of Finance and the Department of Health and Children have treated people with a disability in a disgraceful manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I know of an individual who suffers from post-polio syndrome. He was refused a primary medical certificate. The first condition for such a certificate is that a person has lost the use of one leg and the second condition is a partial use of the second leg. This person fulfils those conditions yet he was refused and he is being denied a right of appeal. He is waiting for a response to his letters and telephone calls. It is disgraceful behaviour on the part of the Government to treat people with disabilities in such a manner. I understand the CEO in the National Rehabilitation Institute, Mr. Greene, had serious problems with the manner in which he was expected to finance the operation over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">I am pleased the Minister of State has come to the House tonight. I ask for this problem to be addressed. The treatment of these people is appalling. They are falling between two Departments on this issue and no letters or telephone calls are being answered. I am hopeful the Minister of State will achieve a proper solution to this problem and that immediate action will be taken. It is appalling that people must wait more than two years. I know of an individual who is waiting over a year for a right of appeal.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_267">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_769">I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify the matter relating to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal. The disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme provides for certain tax concessions in respect of the purchase and running of a vehicle for persons who meet particular medical criteria relating to physical disablement. The tax concessions include remission or replacement of vehicle registration tax, VRT, repayment of value added tax, VAT, in the purchase of the vehicle and a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The criteria for medical eligibility are as follows: The applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; the applicant is wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; the applicant is without both hands or without both arms; the applicant is without one or both legs; the applicant is wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; the applicant has the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">In order to qualify for tax concessions under this scheme, a person must be in receipt of a primary medical certificate issued by the senior area medical officer in the local Health Service Executive area. Where a primary certificate is refused, this maybe appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal whose decision is final.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">The medical board of appeal of regulated by the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) (Amendment) Regulations 2004. These provide that the Minister for Finance may appoint five medical practitioners to the board on the nomination of the Minister for Health and Children, each for a period of four years. The amended regulations were signed by the Minister for Finance on 23 July 2004 and provided for the expansion of the panel of medical practitioners serving on the medical board of appeal from three to five; and amendment of the appeals process by introducing a six-month waiting period between an appeal and a subsequent application and introducing the requirement for a second application to be certified by a registered medical practitioner to the effect that there has been material disimprovement in the medical condition since the previous application. These changes were introduced on foot of recommendations of the interdepartmental review group report established to report to the Minister for Finance on the operation of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">These changes were recommended in order to improve the operation of the appeals process and enable the backlog of appeals to be tackled. In particular, the expansion of the board from three to five medical practitioners will facilitate more meetings of the board as only three members are required for an a appeal hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">As regards the current difficulties referred to, the Departments of Finance and Health and Children are engaged in the process of reconstituting the board, following a number of staff changes late last year and a number of administrative issues. The two Departments have been consulting intensively in order to put arrangements in place which should lead to an improved and more streamlined service from the reconstituted board. The issues involved are complex and, therefore, the process has taken some time. However, I understand that significant progress has been made and that the last outstanding matters are now being resolved. On the basis of this progress, it is expected that the board will be resuming operation within a matter of weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">I certainly do. It firmly belongs in Carlow.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Government speaks a lot about value for money and ensuring that taxpayers' money is well spent. Both I and people living in Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny and in the south east, have grave concerns about the proposed new motorway. The original route was changed substantially to accommodate Roadstone. The originally planned bridge was doubled in size. Business plans went missing and were then conveniently found again. There is a question about whether dolomite is present on the site. This is now valued at 3 cent per tonne. The compensation for Roadstone has risen to 38 cent per tonne. There seems to be a large amount of over-compensation in this issue. I am not convinced the taxpayer is getting value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Bennettsbridge is a beautiful part of County Kilkenny with a long tradition of pottery making. The original route of the road satisfied everyone. It is amazing that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, is intervening on behalf of a private company to have the route altered. This involves the doubling of the length of the bridge which I presume will mean a doubling of the cost in that section, not to mind the bad visual effect which the new bridge will have on the village. I am not convinced the Government is utilising taxpayers' money in the best way.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">I could not raise this matter on the Adjournment tonight because I would have been ruled out of order and told that responsibility lies with the NRA. This issue has been before the PAC. It is with regret I must announce that the PAC seems to have accepted the NRA figures without further scrutiny.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">It is the only committee on which Senators may not sit and, as such, we are at a major disadvantage. I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue in Bennettsbridge. He will have an interest in it given that he lives close to the area in question and the Progressive Democrats informs us that value for money is its core principle, even if that claim is not believable in light of the current actions of the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">The Government should ask serious questions about the Department's intervention on behalf of a private company and the reasons the amount of dolomite allegedly present in the mine has never been quantified, business plans went missing, the compensation to be paid to Roadstone will be 38 cent per tonne of dolomite given that it is valued at 3 cent per tonne, and the doubling of the size of the bridge. These developments make no sense. Having brought the matter to the attention of the Minister of State, I hope his officials will examine it and I look forward to the reply.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_790">With regard to the matter the Senator raised, I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the progress being made in the implementation of the national roads programme and the ongoing priority being accorded to maximising the return on the major investment in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Exchequer investment in the national roads development programme provided for in the NDP is at an all time high. More than €1.4 billion will be invested in 2005 and the capital investment framework provides for a further investment of €7.7 billion over the period 2006-09. The high quality road network we are putting in place is contributing significantly to supporting our national competitiveness, job creation, and more balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The benefits of the development programme are evident throughout the country in the elimination of major traffic bottlenecks leading to shorter journey times and greater journey time certainty. Road users are enjoying major journey time savings on the Ml, the N7 and N8 due to the Kildare, Monasterevin, Cashel and Limerick bypasses and elsewhere on the road network. Since 2000, a total of 48 projects with a combined length of 341 km have been completed. Work is under way on a further 21 projects amounting to 201 km in length and is due to start this year on 17 more projects. The removal of major bottlenecks such as those at Kildare, Cashel, Youghal, Ballincollig, Loughrea, Ennis, Mullingar, Sligo and others have been prioritised.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">These figures indicate that despite the increase in the cost of the ambitious national roads programme mandated in the national development plan, good progress is being made in the implementation of the upgrade programme. The reasons for the increase in the cost of the NDP have been documented in a number of reports on the programme, most recently in a 2004 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. This report concluded that the main reasons for the increase in costs were construction cost inflation which accounts for more than 40% of the increase, initial cost underestimation, changes in the scope of projects and the additional cost of land acquisition.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">It will also be clear from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the National Roads Authority has implemented a range of measures to improve cost estimation and control in recent years. These include the appointment of a cost estimation specialist; greater use of design and build, lump sum, fixed price contracts offering cost efficiencies, greater certainty of outturn costs and reduced scope for claims; standardisation of designs for high cost items such as bridges and other structures; buy-out of the price variation clause and risk where this gives good value; and greater use of public private partnerships which leverage private sector investment in the programme, incentivise private sector innovation and limit the risk exposure of the Exchequer by transferring risk, including construction risk, to the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The various measures taken by the NRA to date are acknowledged by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report and in other evaluations of the roads programme. These evaluations acknowledged that the national roads investment programme is, in general, well managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The beneficial impact of the measures taken to strengthen cost estimation and control is evident in the fact that virtually all major projects under construction now, particularly those being constructed under design and build contracts, are within budget and on time. Many projects have already been delivered within budget and ahead of schedule. They include the Kildare, Monasterevin, Cashel and Ballincollig bypasses. All major road projects are subject to appraisal and detailed cost benefit analyses in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines on the appraisal of capital projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">A high priority will continue to be accorded to strengthening the arrangements in place for programme and project implementation and cost estimation and control. It is important that all involved in the implementation of the programme — the Department of Transport, the National Roads Authority, local authorities, consultants and contractors — maintain a clear focus on and commitment to maximising value for money in the implementation of the programme.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_798">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I appreciate he was not aware of the specific case I outlined. He should note that one section of the land covered by the project in question has been treated as commercial, although it is currently an agricultural field, which has significantly inflated its value. Having drawn the Minister of State's attention to the project, I ask that it be re-examined.</p>

          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_799">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, to the House. The matter I raise refers to land at Beechpark Avenue, Castleknock, a site well known to the Department. We are fortunate that the fields in question have been available to the community for many years and have been managed since 1984 by St. Brigid's GAA club. They are used by five large local primary schools and two community schools which have no playing fields of their own.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">A few years ago Castleknock Educate Together school was given permission to construct temporary buildings on the site, a welcome development and, more recently, it was granted permission for a permanent building. When it received permission for temporary buildings, consultations took place with St. Brigid's GAA club. The school has a tenancy agreement, signed during the term in office of the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, indicating that it would be built on the site and the club would have use of one adult pitch and two smaller children's pitches. In addition, the sports pitches would be available to the school during school time.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">A difficulty has arisen in that the location for the permanent school interferes with the pitches. The community wants both the school and the club to be facilitated. Construction should proceed and the agreement with St. Brigid's GAA club should be honoured. My understanding is that the club should have been accommodated. It is concerned that it will not have use of the full adult pitch and the two children's pitches which the community needs. The club has more than 60 adult and juvenile teams and accommodates teams from local schools in the Blanchardstown and Castleknock areas. Demand for sports pitches is considerable for all the sporting clubs in the general area.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I ask the Minister of State to outline the terms of the agreement between the Department and Castleknock Educate Together school with regard to the layout of the site. I hope she will be able to provide a guarantee that St. Brigid's GAA club will be facilitated and have access to one adult and two children's pitches.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
          <p eId="para_803">I thank Senator Terry for the opportunity to outline the proposals of the Department of Education and Science for the Castleknock Educate Together national school and the position on the lands at Beechpark Avenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The new school project for the national school is due to proceed to tender and construction within the next 12 to 15 months. It will be a 16 classroom school which will also have a special needs unit. It is envisaged that the construction period will be approximately 12 months from the date the project commences on site. The lands at Beechpark Avenue, owned by the Department of Education and Science, were purchased in order to provide educational facilities. The design for the school means that the Department will be using part of the land traditionally used for playing pitches to build the new school. The design team for the school building project is aware of the St. Brigid's GAA club's use of the land. It has, as best as possible, positioned the new school building to minimise the impact on these playing fields.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The school is designed as a two-storey building. However, road safety concerns for the children demand that the school is placed a certain distance from the main road. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, recently met officials from St. Brigid's GAA club to update them on the school building project. At this meeting the Department proposed a compromise solution by agreeing to move the boundary of the new school 5 m, which it believes will leave enough land to continue accommodating two junior pitches. As previously indicated, the Department intends to put in place a formal legal agreement governing the use of the remaining lands once the school is in place.</p>
