          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Mansergh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take measures to address the spate of theft and vandalism of churches of different denominations in various parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when the Youth Work Act 2001 will be fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to outline the current position in relation to the sewerage scheme at Milltown, Tuam, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to outline when funding will be provided for the construction of a 16 classroom school at Castaheany, Dublin 15.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator Morrissey of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to make a statement on the level of suicide in Ireland and to clarify if the number of suicide victims who had been prescribed cipramil by their GPs and were on this medication when they committed suicide can be ascertained.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make a statement on the Government's plans following the report of the Commission on Science, Technology and Innovation and, in particular, to outline the strategy that is to be adopted regarding research and development expenditure as a result of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators Mansergh, McHugh and Kitt and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Terry, Morrissey and Tuffy may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</p>

        <heading>Order of Business.</heading>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_14">The Order of Business is No. 1, motion re the recommendation of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges; No. 2, statements on the progress made in implementing the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, to be taken after No. 1 until 1.30 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time; No. 3, Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, to be taken at 2.30 p.m. and to conclude not later than 6 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes and on which Members may share time; and No. 13, motion No. 25, to be taken between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. There will be a sos between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">On a point of information, No. 1 is a motion to facilitate three debates in this House about the Convention on the Future of Europe. It will allow Deputy John Bruton, who is a member of the praesidium which is debating the future of Europe in the convention, to address the House and to answer questions. Mr. Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, will address the House between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Wednesday, 26 February, Deputy Dick Roche, Minister of State with special responsibility for European affairs, will attend a debate in the House on Tuesday, 4 March, between 3.15 p.m. and 5.15 p.m. and Deputy John Bruton will be here on Wednesday, 12 March, from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. Mr. De Rossa and Deputy Roche are entitled under existing Standing Orders to address the House and a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday agreed that Deputy John Bruton should also be allowed to do so. No. 1, a motion to that effect, will be moved after the Order of Business has been agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I am sure the three debates will be interesting. They will represent the first opportunity for the Oireachtas to listen to the thoughts of the three men involved in this important process, as such discussions have not taken place in the other House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_17">I do not oppose the Order of Business. I asked the Leader yesterday if she is prepared to provide time for Opposition business tomorrow, given that the House is not scheduled to meet, and I repeat that request today. The Government is not proposing any items for tomorrow's business, but the Opposition has at least 14 separate items on the Order Paper. It would be appropriate that time should be set aside for Opposition business tomorrow if the Government cannot produce business of its own. I ask the Leader to comment on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I agree with the proposal made yesterday by Senator Brady with regard to suicide. It is important that this issue should be debated. It is one of the biggest killers of young men in Ireland and I agree with the Senator that there is an urgent need for the House to debate the progress, if any, being made by the various Departments involved. I urge the Leader to organise a debate on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The Leader is aware that when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998 there were implicit commitments, North and South of the Border, regarding human rights legislation. The legislation in Northern Ireland was passed four years ago, but, some five years after the Agreement was signed, we in the South still have to put in place a new regime for human rights. I am aware that the Government proposed the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001, but that has still to be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Will the Leader endeavour to discover where is the Bill in question and what are the remaining difficulties which prevent the Government enacting it swiftly? We cannot lecture other states about their need for human rights legislation when there is no change to our legislation. This was an implicit commitment to all citizens, North and South. However, that commitment has not been put in place in the South during the past five years, which is ridiculous.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_21">On two occasions last year, I raised the question of the function of auctioneers and how they operate. I suggested that the House should look at the way they do business, their duties and their responsibilities. On both occasions, I received strong support from all sides of the House and Members felt that something should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">There should be a discussion on how this profession might be regulated properly. There are people involved in it who drag down the good name of decent people. The vast majority of auctioneers are decent people who do decent work, but there have been cases, detailed at the tribunals and elsewhere, of prices being bumped up in the case of young people buying houses. There have been high profile cases where auctioneers have been both buyers and sellers of land, which is grossly unfair to ordinary consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">This is a consumer issue and should be looked at in that way. From talking to people in the profession, I have no doubt that it would welcome some arrangement which would keep control over the cowboys involved in it. There is a motion on the Order Paper in the name of Senator Ross and other Independent Members seeking the establishment of a committee to consider the matter. Whatever about that, there should be a debate on this matter in order that we could be given the Government view and hear the thoughts of the appropriate Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Everybody in the House has a view on how the profession should operate. It operates differently in other jurisdictions, where consumers must be told if there are other bids and what are the relevant amounts. We need to look at this matter seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">This is an appropriate time for a debate on neutrality. There is confusion on the issue and neutrality can now mean anything and everything to anybody who wants to speak about it. No one distinguishes between the various forms – military, moral, political or otherwise – of neutrality. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, the former Minister, Mr. Dick Spring, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, have articulated clear views on these issues in the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">A discussion has to take place on this because there is utter confusion about it. I will not open a debate on it now, but I would welcome an opportunity for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to put his views to the House for discussion. It does not matter if others have different views, but people should be forced to engage with the issue. Discussion is currently taking place on this matter in terms of the constitutional review, but it would be good to understand our position and outlook on this matter. I ask for a debate on neutrality.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_27">The Order of Business is agreed. I agree with Senator O'Toole that there appears to be confusion on the issue of neutrality and that is mirrored by the general confusion in Government on foreign policy. Only weeks ago, the Minister for Defence gave his, possibly personal, opinion that Ireland is no longer, if it ever was, neutral.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">We stand at a crossroads with regard to foreign policy and we need clarity not confusion. Instead of that, we have been treated to a wait and see approach from a wait and see Taoiseach. Is he waiting to see whether another 100,000 people will march on the streets to express their concern about the possibility of war and the possibility of this State supporting unilateral action by abandoning its traditional support for a UN position? There is an urgent need for clarity on that and I ask the Leader to request the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come before the House at the earliest opportunity to explain when the wait and see approach will end.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I understand from a report last week that the publication of the strategic rail review is imminent. When it becomes available, will the Leader arrange an early debate on its findings? I know she is amenable to this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_30">I speak on behalf of an endangered species – the bean an tí in the Gaeltacht – and I hope to engage the support of the Leader in this regard. As a result of new guidelines from the Revenue Commissioners, it is almost certain that mná tí will no longer be available. There is hardly a Member in the House who cannot look back with affection on their first visit to the Gaeltacht. The bean an tí was the teacher, guardian and confidante.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_7">

        </speech>
        <speech by="#LabhrasOMurchu" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_32">It will be more difficult for the bean an tí in the future. It is particularly appropriate for the Seanad to debate this matter and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should come before the House because he has his finger on the pulse in regard to these matters. A recent survey on the Gaeltacht shows it to be more endangered than ever. If the bean an tí cannot be found to help with the summer courses, they will not proceed. It would show great leadership on the part of this House if we could show a united front and arrive at a solution to this problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_33">There have been many calls for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House. When he does so, I hope he will not read a long script but that Members will be able to ask specific questions because there are many issues to be dealt with. For example, today's newspapers contain the story of the murder of a 24 year old Jamaican woman with two young children. The person who is supposed to have perpetrated this murder was on early release. What are the criteria for early release? Was any psychological assessment carried out on the person in question, particularly if he was in custody for serious assault?</p>
          <p eId="para_34">When Ms Nora Owen was Minister for Justice, she was much maligned by the current Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, and Deputy Liz O'Donnell, when a person being escorted from prison escaped.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_41">I support the request for a debate on suicide. This is a most important issue here and also in Northern Ireland. It would be helpful to know whether there had been any epidemiological or other studies made about the incidence of what is an extremely complex issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">I support the request from Senator Brian Hayes for information about the human rights arrangements. He is correct that there is complementarity in the Good Friday Agreement, under which it is inherent that arrangements should be made in this jurisdiction. It is the subject of much comment and criticism, especially by Unionists in Northern Ireland. Apart from this, there is an intrinsic case for human rights protection and the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in our domestic law, which should stand in its own right. It would be helpful to know when progress can be expected on this.</p>

I agree with the Senator's call for a debate on neutrality. Given the diversity of views, there is widespread confusion to the extent that the country is in danger of lacking coherence and focus on the issue. We would not want it become another bit of scata bullán.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a review of the new guidelines for the Revenue Commissioners and their implications for the bean an tí. As a former member of the tax strategy group, I am surprised at the move.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I also support the calls from the other side of the House for clarification on the issue of neutrality. There is nothing incompatible between neutrality and support for collective security under the United Nations, a point on which there is much confusion. The founder of the Constitution, Eamon de Valera, a great international statesman, was strongly of the view that the Executive should not be tied down on matters of foreign policy and fine judgment.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_47">I agree with the calls for a debate on suicide. The issue is predominantly concerned with the mental health of young males. In view of this, perhaps the debate should be widened to cover other mental health issues involving young men, especially given their involvement in violent crime and drug and solvent abuse. The Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, is very competent and open to considering intervention measures in this area. Society has a responsibility to address the issue because young men are dying.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attend the House to debate the issue of equal pay for women. At a recent conference Niamh Crowley of the Equality Authority and Gráine Healy of the National Women's Council of Ireland spoke about the lack of enforcement of the legislation in this area. They pointed out that women were getting 30% less than men for the same work. This is unacceptable. I hope the Minister will stop paying lip service by enacting legislation but not enforcing it.</p>

          <p eId="para_49">I also support the call for a debate on suicide. Only a few homes have escaped its long shadow. Many, if not all, of the health boards have helplines which should be utilised. General practitioners have a pivotal role to play. Those who "feel down", to use a phrase, should not be afraid to consult the appropriate qualified people. It is no sin to be depressed but some like to conceal it. Many of the problems in this area emanate from this.</p>

I understand there are over 700 of them and that over 24,000 students avail of their facilities every year. Perhaps the Minister for Finance should address the House on the changes in the tax laws. A debate would be welcomed.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">Senator Brian Hayes referred to the business for tomorrow. I propose to arrange a meeting with the Whips immediately after the Order of Business to see what can be done. As I explained yesterday, the business for Thursday was arranged but then deferred. The Senator and many of his colleagues also supported Senator Brady's call yesterday for a debate on suicide. I agree that one should be held. Some Senators requested a multi-faceted debate involving different Ministers. I am not sure if that would be possible but it would be helpful if one was arranged with the relevant Minister. It is a huge issue. Senator Brian Hayes also asked about the human rights legislation promised in fulfilment of the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. I will make inquiries and advise the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Senator O'Toole referred to the role of auctioneers and inquired if it was time for the profession to be regulated. He also proposed a debate on neutrality.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Senator O'Meara supported the call for a debate on neutrality and sought clarification on foreign affairs matters. The Minister is doing a remarkable job in the way he is enunciating policy and representing Ireland at various fora. I understand he gave a very good account of himself on a television programme last night. I did not view it. The Senator also sought clarification on the railways review. She appears to have an insight on the matter. Having initiated the review when Minister for Public Enterprise, I would like to have it debated in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I agree. I have mixed feelings about one bean an tí but that was a long time ago. Senator Ó Murchú requested the attendance of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to debate the issue. There is an ongoing debate in this area and I hope we can consider the matter in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Senator Finucane requested a question and answer session on crime. I agree that would be the best way for the House to address the crime epidemic and I am seeking to arrange it but the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is busy presenting three Bills to both Houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">Senator Maurice Hayes supported the call for a debate on suicide. He also questioned the current status of the human rights legislation promised as part of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">Senator Coghlan referred to the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill. Senator O'Toole played a great role as chairman of the accountancy review group. The Bill was to have been debated tomorrow but has been deferred. It will be taken first in this House. The House is initiating many new Bills. Two further ones will be debated next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Senator Mansergh also called for a debate on the bean an tí and pointed out that the foreign policy we were executing was being carried out in a very proper and comprehensive manner. He stated foreign policy must always take account of what is happening elsewhere in the world and not be tied down.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Senator McHugh suggested linking the debate on suicide with that on mental health, which was a good idea. Senator Terry raised the issue of equal pay for women. It sounds so odd that, 30 years after the then Commissioner Paddy Hillery dealt with the relevant European directive, there are still some areas of life in which this is still an issue. I think we are all paid the same amount in the Seanad.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_35">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_74">I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad in my capacity as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy and update it on the progress made in implementing the strategy which was launched almost two years ago and for which my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating its implementation. While it is set to run until 2008, I am pleased that much progress has been made since it was launched.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I do not need to tell Senators that drug misuse is a complex problem, one that impacts on the provision of many services. As such, it requires a response from a range of Departments, agencies, professionals and local communities. For example, drug misuse impacts on the health and education systems, the Garda and Customs and Excise, city and county councils and training bodies such as FÁS. Additionally, it has a very direct and often devastating impact on local communities. That is the reason the strategy is a very comprehensive document, which is the result of a thorough consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Approximately 190 submissions were received and eight regional consultation fora held around the country when the strategy was being considered. In addition, the review group and the then Minister of State met 35 separate interest groups. The views expressed throughout that process are reflected in the strategy. The result is a national drugs strategy that brings together in a single framework all those involved in drug misuse policy. In recognition of the complexity of the issue, the strategy contains 100 separate actions to be carried out by a range of Departments. These actions fall under four pillars: supply reduction; prevention, incorporating education and awareness; treatment, incorporating rehabilitation; and research.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">Since my appointment as Minister of State last June I have been very interested in meeting and hearing the experiences of recovering drug misusers and those working in local communities to address the problem. The message I have received continually is that there has been considerable progress in recent years but that there is still much work to be done. The Government is aware of this and will continue to prioritise the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">With a strategy as broad as this it is important to put structures and processes in place which ensure its effective implementation. I chair an interdepartmental group on drugs which meets regularly to discuss the progress being made by Departments and agencies in the implementation of the actions set out in the strategy. A range of Departments and State agencies are represented in the group, the role of which is to bring to the attention of the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion issues which may impede the progress of the strategy. My Department consults closely with those involved in the delivery of the actions in the strategy to prepare a six monthly progress report which I present to the Cabinet sub-committee. To date, we have presented two such reports and a third is due in April this year. The first annual report on the strategy is due to be published towards the end of April or in early May.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">We have requested the production of a critical implementation path for each action to ensure each Department and agency implements the strategy in the most effective manner possible. The value of implementation paths is that they allow us to plot a time frame for each action and monitor the progress of the strategy. The critical implementation path document will be finalised shortly. A mid-term evaluation of the strategy will take place before the end of 2004 at which time it will be possible to make any necessary adjustments and improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">This is a long-term strategy but there is already much progress to report. Under its prevention pillar are included a number of actions for which the Department of Education and Science and the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children are responsible. A joint substance abuse policy committee comprising officials of both Departments has been convened to establish what support schools need to implement the drugs policy guidelines produced last May. The Department of Education and Science is recruiting extra support staff to enable it to deliver substance misuse prevention programmes as a priority in all schools within local drugs task force areas. All second level schools are to introduce such programmes from September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">School is only one of the places young people learn about drugs and it is imperative that information is available more generally. The first phase of the national awareness campaign is being finalised and it is hoped to launch it next March. Over the course of a number of years the campaign will target various groups, including parents and young people. Through my involvement with the British-Irish Council sectoral group on drugs, for which ours is the lead Administration, I am conscious that the challenge drugs awareness campaigns present is common to many jurisdictions. I look forward to hosting the June conference scheduled in the Council's work programme which will examine that challenge further. The conference should present an opportunity to share experiences and develop best practice to maximise the potential of drugs awareness campaigns.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">The second pillar of the strategy concerns treatment. The consultation process which helped us to draw up the strategy identified a clear need to fully integrate treatment and rehabilitation services which health boards and other agencies are addressing through a wide range of actions. It is important to treat addicted young people and be mindful of the particular sensitivity of treatment of those under the age of 18 years. The Department of Health and Children chairs a group charged with the task of developing a protocol for the treatment of those aged under 18 years and good progress has been made. The Department oversees the implementation of recommendations published in the December 2002 report of the working group set up to examine the use of benzodiazepines such as valium.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">The national drugs strategy sought to increase the number of methadone treatment places to 6,500 by the end of 2002 and I am pleased to report significant progress. On 31 October, the latest date for which verified figures are available, the number of places stood at 6,446. This represents a substantial increase from the December 2000 figure of 5,032. In most areas waiting lists for those awaiting treatment have been significantly shortened while there are approximately 800 participating in the FÁS community employment scheme for recovering drug misusers.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The Garda and customs officials reported a greater number of seizures of heroin, cocaine and cannabis in 2001 than in 2000. They are on track to increase the number of seizures by 25% by 2004 and 50% by 2008. The customs service has relaunched its coastal watch programme and improved detection facilities at ports and airports. The Garda and health boards have reported increased heroin use outside Dublin and a rise in the use of cocaine generally. I have asked the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, to examine the trends in this regard and will study its work to determine what action to take.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">High quality information on the complex problem of drug misuse is vital. To this end, the national advisory committee on drugs was established two years ago to advise the Government with regard to its prevalence, consequences and treatment. The committee, whose membership comprises a range of academic, community, statutory and voluntary interests, oversees a three year programme of research. It has published an overview of current research into drug prevention and completed reviews of prevalence information and contemporary literature regarding the consequences of drug misuse for families and communities. These reviews have been used to inform further research. In November 2002 it commissioned a longitudinal study of treatment outcomes and in December 2002 published a report on the effectiveness of buprenorphine in the treatment of opiate dependence. It has commissioned an all-Ireland survey of drug use, the results of which are due late this year. An estimate of the number of opiate users should be completed in the next couple of weeks while a review of harm reduction mechanisms for injecting drug misusers in an Irish context is under way. A draft literature review in this area is due by April.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">In September 2002, as part of the implementation of its work programme, the committee launched a community and voluntary research grants scheme to generate innovative community based drugs research. Under this heading, five community groups are working on research projects in their local drugs task force area.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">In addition to specific actions under the strategy, my Department has responsibility for the work of local drugs task forces which were first set up six years ago in areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse. They operate in 14 areas – 12 in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Bray, County Wicklow, which was designated a task force area approximately three years ago. They are implementing their second round of action plans in respect of which, to date, over €14.5 million has been allocated. In total, since 1997 the Government has allocated over €51 million to implement the projects contained in the plans of the task forces under which they provide a range of drug programmes and services in the areas of supply reduction, treatment, rehabilitation, awareness, prevention and education. In total, over 450 projects have been implemented through the various task force plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">In addition to the funding made available under the task force plans, a sum of €12.7 million was provided under the premises initiative which was designed to address the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are based in local drugs task force areas. To date, over €11 million has been allocated to 38 projects under this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">The young people's facilities and services fund is another initiative operating in the 14 local drugs task force areas and the urban centres of Limerick, Galway, Carlow and Waterford. The main aim of the fund is to attract young people at risk into sports and recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. To date, approximately €59 million has been allocated for this purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">In broad terms, approximately 350 facility and services projects are being supported under the young people's facilities and services fund which fall under seven broad headings: building, renovating or fitting out of community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs; a number of purpose built youth centres; over 85 youth and outreach workers have been appointed; ten sports workers have been employed; a wide variety of community based prevention-education programmes are being supported; a number of targeted interventions for particular groups such as youth work projects for young Travellers have been put in place; and a number of national drugs education and training officers for youth organisations have been employed. I have seen many of these in operation in local drugs task force areas in my constituency and elsewhere in Dublin. Much useful work is being done in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">Diversionary activities have an important role to play in the development of young people at risk of becoming involved in substance misuse. The young people's facilities and services fund aims to provide such activities in areas that need them most. There are many areas, particularly on the outskirts of Dublin, where large suburbs were built without proper infrastructure or social amenities. However, some very good work has been done in recent years under the auspices of the fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The positive and active involvement of local communities has played a significant part in the success of local drugs task forces. The consultation process involved in drawing up local task force plans in each community has been an important factor. The underlying principle of the strategy is the development of an integrated response informed by the active participation of all the stakeholders. Partnership and consultation are the best way forward in dealing not alone with this issue but also the wider problem of social inclusion. It is of vital importance that the communities most affected by the drugs problem are provided with the opportunity to have their voices heard in the development of drugs policies. Everybody involved in the local drugs task forces, particularly in the Dublin area, believes the community has been provided with a good service as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Because task forces operate in selected urban areas of high drug misuse, the national drugs strategy recommended the setting up of regional drugs task forces in order to address the issue of drug misuse outside the main urban areas in Dublin and Cork. These task forces will operate in each of the current regional health board areas, including each of the three which comprise the Eastern Regional Health Authority. They will ensure an integrated and co-ordinated response to the problem of drug misuse in the regions and represent a team based response to illicit drug use. Each will be chaired by an independent chairperson and made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sectors, and elected public representatives. It is my intention that all of the regional task force members will work in partnership in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces in Dublin and Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Nominations have been sought from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors for representation on the regional task forces. In addition, the national drugs strategy team has prepared guidelines on their operation in consultation with the relevant sectors and agencies. It is planned to convene the first meeting of each task force by the end of March. It is hoped that, as well as examining the availability of drug services and related resources, they will also provide up-to-date information on the nature and extent of drug use in their region.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">These are some of the main areas where progress has been achieved since the launch of the national drugs strategy. The misuse of drugs is a hugely complex issue. As I am sure Senators are aware, there is not just one drugs problem, rather there are many drugs used in different circumstances. Addressing this issue requires responses from a range of agencies and service providers. We all have a responsibility in this area, especially as politicians and legislators. In particular, we need to do our utmost to ensure we make a difference to those communities hit hardest by the problem of drug misuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The national drugs strategy covers the period up to 2008. Its mid-term evaluation will, I hope, inform us on how to build further upon the firm foundations put in place. While much progress has already been made, we need to continue our efforts to drive the strategy forward. In this regard, I look forward to hearing Senators' contributions.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_36">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_97">I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive statement on the implementation, to date, of the national drugs strategy. He made an important point when he said the new regional drugs task forces to be established would continue to have a political input, which I welcome. We would not be having this debate were it not for the fact that I am a member of the local drugs task force in Tallaght. It is my involvement with our local task force which ensures that I am kept up to speed with the issues. It is essential that politicians are involved in these task forces. This will ensure that the issues on the streets with which we must deal on a daily basis can be translated into the debate in this House and the Lower House. I know the Minister of State believes in the notion of political accountability and that is essential for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The Minister of State represents a constituency where this problem is familiar and, for this reason, it is important that he – like former Minister of State, Chris Flood, who represented my constituency – was given this responsibility. The problems of urban areas are unique and radical intervention is required. A political commitment at the highest level of Government is needed in terms of intervening to resolve these difficulties. The Minister of State has a track record in this regard and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">I would have preferred if a single Minister of State had sole responsibility for the drugs issue. I intend no criticism when I say that Deputy Noel Ahern holds another busy portfolio as Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, which is a huge brief. I believe it would have been better to keep this issue at the very top of the agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">I am pleased that the Cabinet sub-committee on social inclusion, chaired by the Taoiseach, is continuing its work. The commitment to ongoing funding must be at the centre of Government policy. The original report was produced by Deputy Pat Rabbitte, in the period 1996 to 1997, when he served as a Minister of State and it highlighted the areas where action was needed. There was a commitment from the then Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton – it was taken on by the current Taoiseach – that this issue would be regarded as a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">As the Minister of State indicated, a total of €51 million has been allocated to task forces. That is a significant amount of funding. As Members of the Oireachtas, we must ensure that we are getting not just value for money and accountability but also that we can articulate the need for further funding, if necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">The perception on the streets in some parts of this city and other cities is that the problem is getting worse instead of better. The supply of drugs into the country is as significant as it has always been. The Minister of State referred to this earlier. One of the reasons it is becoming increasingly difficult to stem the flow of drugs into the country is because the price has dropped. It is now cheaper to buy scores of heroin than it was three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">As the Minister of State said, there is now the added problem of cocaine abuse. There is no medical intervention in any of the task forces in any health board area. Unless we intervene now, the cocaine problem will become worse. This was highlighted three years ago and we now face the real problem of the abuse of cocaine in the cities. Cocaine is regarded by some as a designer drug for middle class use, with none of the problems associated with heroin. I warn the House that this drug has caused a significant problem in this city and has become a real issue in recent years. Unless immediate action is taken to resolve the issue and stem the flow of cocaine into Dublin, Cork and Limerick, this problem will grow. Garda resources must be used to deal with the importation of drugs into the country and there must be medical intervention in respect of cocaine.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">When the Proceeds of Crime Bill was going through both Houses some years ago, I proposed that moneys confiscated from drugs barons should be ring-fenced for the exclusive use of the communities worst affected by the drugs epidemic. The Government did not accept the amendment, but I ask the Minister of State to consider ring-fencing the money in the manner I proposed at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Some of the areas to which I refer have been ravaged by the drugs problem. Whole generations have been lost and many families in large urban housing estates have been affected. We should put up notices in big, bold lettering in community centres that the moneys taken from the drugs barons, which they in turn earned on the backs of these communities, will be used to pay for new facilities. Until these communities see the difference that these moneys can make in terms of the provision of community facilities, we will be unable to ensure a more optimistic future for them. I ask the Minister of State to have discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">I am pleased the Minister of State is going to extend the new task forces to the regions. The task forces in Dublin and Cork have been a great success because of the multi-agency response and the involvement of politicians. As I understand it, the departmental subhead for 2003 for a drugs initiative amounts to €16.3 million and the commitment to advance regional task forces will need another €7 million. That is a total of approximately €22 million which will be required this year if the Minister of State is serious about extending the drugs task forces to all regions of the country. Will the Minister of State ensure that the additional €7 million will be obtained so that the regional task forces, which are a vital part of the next step of the strategy, are put in place? I ask him to inform the House how he intends to obtain this funding. It will not be acceptable for areas with existing task forces to juggle funds in order to meet a new need in the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">I welcome the Minister of State's remarks on research. In this year alone, over 6,400 people are on methadone programmes. I am a great believer in methadone, but we do not know enough about the long-term effects of its use. Methadone is used to wean people off heroin. I have spoken to people who are taking methadone and can work 40 hours a week and are contributing to their communities. The task forces must be careful when replacing one drug with a legally prescribed alternative. We need more information on the number of people who use methadone to successfully wean themselves off heroin. There is a sub-culture which accepts the use of legally prescribed methadone as an intervention drug and another group which uses drugs illegally.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">The Minister of State indicated that he will initiate a new programme for schools, starting in September 2003. This is an important development. Children should be shown the areas that have been affected by the drugs crisis. If the schools programme in question operates on a nationwide basis and children are informed of the problem of drugs, these children must be shown the type of environment that obtains in the communities to which I refer. Middle Ireland seems prepared to accept a subculture which has left many housing estates in areas of the country that have experienced phenomenally difficult times ravaged by the drugs problem. Children should be confronted by this so they see the harmful effects of the drugs that have devastated these communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The drugs task force in my area has raised a number of points in discussion. The Minister of State did not refer to any plans on his part or that of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to strengthen the level of support for drugs squads in individual areas. There are not enough gardaí working in this area. Those that are do tremendous work and they ferret away to get information and the desired result in the courts. However, we do not have enough people working in the area and I urge the Minister of State to address this in discussion with the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The South Western Area Health Board is unable to meet the demand for addiction counselling because it only has two counsellors available to service the entire Tallaght area, which has a population base of 85,000 and in which there is a significant drug misuse problem. We need to increase the number of addiction counsellors in the various task force areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">There is a major problem with regard to funding. Most of the treatment centres receive funding under the section 65 provision, for which the Eastern Regional Health Authority has responsibility. There is a long-standing dispute in the centres because the funding has not kept pace with the additional funding the Government provides to the task forces. There may be a case for streamlining all funding through one Department rather than through the health boards. Significant voluntary work is done by people who, unpaid, put in 16 hour days. In effect, these individuals take on the responsibility of the health boards. If we are to take this matter seriously, we must realise that it will be a long campaign to stem drugs misuse and that we need these centres to make the interventions we need. I ask the Minister of State to consider streamlining the funding from his Department for these centres because funding from the health boards has not kept pace with the level of funding required.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Action is required in respect of the level of support for families. If one child in a family is a heroin addict, this has a colossal impact on the other family members. We have not done enough to support families trying to help a loved one kick the habit. In my area we have a group called SWAN which works solely with families in which there is a drug addict. Unfortunately, in the most recent plans put forward, the Department did not recognise sufficiently the kind of funding required for these groups if they are to provide support. The encouragement provided by families is often the only way forward in terms of getting addicts off drugs. Will the Minister of State look at additional funding mechanisms in regard to this? The eight people working in this project in my constituency come from the community employment scheme or the JI, jobs initiative. Two of those jobs will go in the next few months and will not be replaced. What will happen then and who will take over? This area needs further investigation. The best support we can give is to improve the level of funding for groups working with the families of addicts who are trying to kick the habit.</p>

          <from>Labhrás Ó Murchú</from>
          <p eId="para_113">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his report. The national drugs strategy is probably one of the most important initiatives in the State. It is indicative of the serious situation with which we are dealing and of our determination to combat the drugs culture. Nobody can be oblivious to the damage that has been done. The media has highlighted it in many ways and, in particular, through outlining case histories.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">We have seen cases where people have come forward and shared with us their torment and the efforts they have made to overcome their drug addiction. We are discussing here the downside of modern society. It is easy to point to success, glamour, affluence and the positive aspects of current life and there are many examples of young people who have achieved much. We would not deserve any kudos, however, if we ignored the downside of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">It would be helpful if we returned to basics. Today we are talking about the legislative process. As the Minister of State pointed out, several Departments are involved. This is indicative of the manner in which the tentacles of the drug-taking culture tend to move into all aspects of life. The community is working in partnership with those Departments. This is how it should be because the difficulties are on the ground and those suffering live in the community. It is not just the drug-taker who suffers. We must ask questions such as why is there so much crime? Why is there so little respect for life? How can anybody pulverise or rape an old person of 80 or 90 years of age? How can people be so greedy? How can there be so little neighbourliness? Why can people benefit so much from crime? These questions are fundamental to any corrective measures we will take.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">We must ask why it is necessary for young people to take drugs. Often a young person who seems to have everything – a job, a marriage, a career and prospects – turns to drugs. When we compare such a life with the deprivation that existed years ago, why is it that they feel the need to use drugs to enhance their lives for a matter of minutes rather than years? There are issues involved, such as the lack of respect for authority, which must be examined. Perhaps there are several reasons for this lack of respect. Groups such as religious orders, the church, the Garda, politicians, etc., are under the spotlight and there appears to be less respect for them. This lack of respect permeates society and young people tend to look elsewhere for role models. Entertainment icons often become their role models. Sadly, when these role models make public confessions, which happens often, they state that they are addicted to drugs. It is these people who are the role models for our youth.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">We must highlight this fact. It would be great if these role models pointed out the disastrous consequence of drug-taking, which amounts to a living death. Once people start to take hard drugs, in particular, the chances of ever being able to retrace their steps are very slim. While I am aware that the strategy allows for treatment, I set more store by education towards prevention. I accept that we must look after the existing cases and help them in every way. We must sympathise and empathise with them and try to understand the reason they find themselves in that position. Education is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">In regard to the debate on anti-social behaviour, particularly in so far as it refers to the abuse of alcohol, it took a long time for the media to say enough was enough – that anti-social behaviour impacted on the whole community. A recent "Prime Time" programme brought us inside hospital emergency wards on a Saturday night. It was appalling to see what medical staff had to cope with. It was sad to see young people, particularly young females of 17 and 18 years, out of their minds. They were not the ones suffering; rather it was their parents, the ones left at home to worry about their offspring. The greatest nightmare for parents today is whether their children will succumb to the temptations. In fairness, most are doing everything that is possible; they are observing changes in lifestyle, personality and attitude which is vital because at that level and with the help of the community and Government many young people can be prevented from embarking on the road to addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Treatment is only of use when teamed with prevention. The entire community suffers from the consequences of drug and alcohol addiction. Television recently presented us with the sight of an 80-year-old man whose face had been pulverised. It is very difficult to rationalise such a spectacle. How can anybody deserving of the name of a human being inflict such harm on an unfortunate and innocent person? There is no answer. In many cases drugs are at the heart of the cause. When people are addicted, they will do anything to get money to feed their habit. The victims are not the only ones affected, so too are the many who were previously living out their last days in contentment and relative security who have had that taken from them. There is no longer a question of a door being left unlocked or people being able to feel secure. We have resorted to the security technology of panic buttons, alarms and so on. Fear has taken over.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Last week I spoke on the issue of drugs on a local radio programme. The interviewer asked me what I was doing as a legislator and if I was prepared to back what might be regarded as draconian laws to tackle the drug barons. I would be prepared to do so, although, generally speaking, civil rights are one of the issues at the top of my agenda. Once the drug barons and drug pushers send people down the road of drug taking the next step is addiction. The people concerned are being condemned to the living death to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Some of the laws in question have already been put in place. The criminal assets legislation has been particularly effective; so much so that we had representatives of the British Government with us in the past couple of weeks studying that body of legislation. I do not know if we can be more draconian in that regard. I would not have any difficulty in standing up to a civil rights activist on the issue. There are numerous side effects contingent on the addiction of one young person – the devastation caused to his or her family and, by extension, the effect on the community and the country. It is not too strong a statement to say we are in the middle of a war and must have the necessary weapons, in a legislative sense, to deal with the situation. If there is any other measure we can bring forward to put the people involved out of business, we must do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Currently there is only a residual glamour attached to the world of drugs – I compliment the media in this regard – but even these last vestiges must be removed. We must be particularly careful about those promoting the notion that certain soft drugs should be allowed. They are wrong and being disingenuous in using the cover of the potential use for medicinal purposes. If there are medicinal purposes, it will be in the hands of the medical practitioners. Once the floodgates are opened on any soft drug, its appeal will be reduced and people will move onto a higher level of drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">In the past three years soft drugs were posted to Leinster House to Members of the Oireachtas. While we joked about it at the time, it is really not funny, in the same way that alcohol abuse is not funny. When I see winos in the street, I say to myself there I could be but for the grace of God. Their lives are finished. They are not human beings any longer, as they exist in an almost vegetative state. The only solace they get is through the efforts of compassionate people who try to help them in their hour of misery. That is not funny, nor is a battered woman who has suffered as a result of these substances, whether it is alcohol or drugs. There is no glamour in this and it is not funny either. We have to take the comedy out of it. It was said comedians always relied on the drunkard for most of their punch lines. Making jokes about people with a stammer is no longer politically correct; neither should making jokes about abuse of alcohol or drugs. We can be so politically correct on other issues, ones which can be of infinitesimally small import. Let us be politically correct where drugs are concerned also.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">The national drugs strategy is vital. It has been running for just two years and has five more to go. I compliment Senator Brian Hayes on the responsible manner in which he made his contribution. There is no political kudos for any of us in this issue. It should be evident to the general public that all Departments, political parties, the media etc. are united in their approach. The pop and entertainment idols must also play their part. We must all work together because we are dealing with a scourge that is getting out of hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">We should give credit where it is due. I give great credit to the Minister of State because as Senator Brian Hayes said, he is at the coalface. He is not talking theory. He knows exactly what he has to contend with. I also give credit to the Garda and customs officers who have had successes. There is no doubt that the detection rate has been very good but drugs are still getting through.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">It is not only deprived people or people in the entertainment world who are part of this culture. The problem is hitting all sections of society but the victims are largely young people. In the last few days I saw a reference to the fact that a certain person was the oldest to have died from the use of a particular drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Drugs are available, not only in urban areas but in rural areas as well. Therefore, we must all work together in unison. There must be a unified approach covering the areas the Minister of State has mentioned and some of the areas to which I have referred.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_38">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_128">The message coming through the media is that this is a predominantly urban problem affecting places such as Limerick, Cork and Dublin. Senators Brady and Brian Hayes may be in a better position to talk about this issue from first hand experience in their own areas. The closest town to my home is Letterkenny, a growing urban centre – people are beginning to speak about it attaining city status. There are already drugs in Letterkenny. I am concerned about social and infrastructural intervention and about the funding of the drugs strategy in regional centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">The Minister of State referred to community-based pilot projects. The Government now has an opportunity to consider seriously the needs of our young people, who are the future of the country. I am convinced that many of the problems of youth intervention arise from the interdepartmental approach. I have already called for the setting up of a Department of Youth Affairs. Young people's problems are discussed by adults, not by young people. By involving young people in community-based projects and ensuring that they are heard in democratically elected fora and through the implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001, we will be in a better position to address their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">Although the dissemination of information to schools is valuable, young people are more receptive to information gained in community-based education fora. This was demonstrated in Letterkenny in a community-based project run by youth leaders where there was not a formal school structure. Only through proper mechanisms, a Department of Youth Affairs, the full implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001 and the employment of hands-on youth workers in each area, whether urban or rural, will we be able to take a co-ordinated approach to long-term intervention. We are not listening to young people, we are not involving them and we are alienating them from society.</p>
          <p eId="para_131">As a long-term plan, the Government must seriously consider the establishment of a Department of Youth Affairs. Interdepartmental structures merely add further to the layers of bureaucracy. We have seen meetings, meetings about meetings, people not turning up to meetings and nothing being done. Reports, and reports about reports, are produced and consultants are hired to find out what the other consultants have said. Projects like those alluded to by the Minister of State and by Senator Brian Hayes, and which will probably be alluded to by Senator Brady, run by hands-on community workers and gardaí who can befriend young people, are the only form of successful intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">I do not have first-hand experience of the major heroin-related problems that exist in the major cities but I am confident that my proposal is the only possible successful long-term strategy for dealing with the problems of young people. I have called on previous occasions for the establishment of a Department of Youth Affairs and on the adjournment of the House this evening I will call for the full implementation of the Youth Work Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Donegal County Council has set up the first democratically elected youth council. The council, which was elected through the schools, is a wheel which might inform the Minister of State's Department of some of the solutions proposed by young people. The only way forward is to use the mechanisms available to involve young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">I cannot speak about the problems of heroin because I do not have first-hand experience of it. I have never, to my knowledge, met a heroin addict. However, I can call for funding to be dispersed to the regions rather than focused in the larger centres. In a town like Letterkenny, which now has gateway status and may gain city status in the future, drugs may not be a problem today but they will be tomorrow.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_39">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_135">I welcome the Minister to the House once again. I warmly welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue and I compliment Senator Brian Hayes on raising it.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">This is a complex area. Despite ongoing efforts by Governments around the world to deal with the problem of drug abuse, no single universally acceptable and effective response model has emerged. The model adopted by this and previous Governments is having an effect. This model has evolved over a number of years, mainly in response to the ground level reaction of local communities to the explosion of social problems caused by the illegal supply and misuse of drugs in the 1970s and 1980s. Following the marches and other forms of protest and, indeed, numerous deaths, local drugs task forces were set up in 1997. Because of their make-up and membership, the task forces have proven over time that their integrated holistic approach has gone some way to stemming the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I had the privilege of being involved in the early 1990s with the first inter-agency drugs project in the north inner city. That proved to be a model for the existing task forces. It was extremely effective because it drew together many different strands. By focusing on the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, that initiative for the first time brought the elements together into a single coherent framework and indicated clearly the responsibilities of people who work in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I agree with Senator Ó Murchú that education is the main key to prevention. I welcome the fact that the Department of Education and Science is now represented on all the task forces. The aim is to have a substance misuse prevention programme in all schools in the next three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">Addicts are getting younger. Parents, teachers and children have to be educated in how to recognise the signs of drug misuse. Peer pressure, as Senator Ó Murchú has said, plays a large part in the proliferation of drugs problems and all children need to be taught the skills necessary to deal with these pressures.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">I am pleased to see work is progressing in the development of a protocol for the treatment of under 18 year olds. The many groups working in towns and cities throughout the country will say that even more crucial than detoxification or stabilisation of an addict is the ongoing rehabilitation and reintegration of the person back into society. Counselling plays a huge part in getting the addict back into a position where they feel worthy to re-enter society.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The specially designed FÁS programmes, community employment programmes, which come under the strategy, have proven particularly effective, with over 800 participants at present. It is also encouraging to see the large numbers of recovering addicts who are finding worthwhile productive employment – another sign of the effectiveness of the present policy. Over 120 task force projects have been mainstreamed, many of which have contributed to the normalisation of estates and flat complexes, particularly in the inner cities. The 340 projects being developed around the country, in conjunction with the young persons' facilities and services fund, aimed specifically at the whole area of youth involvement and sport and recreation are also having a huge effect. Work continues in the prisons and progress is being made on drug treatment for prisoners. The health authorities and the prison services are working closely in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">The recent report of the pilot drugs court in Dublin's northside is encouraging and is succeeding in diverting people from the criminal justice system and encouraging them into more effective treatment and rehabilitation programmes. As Senator Brian Hayes said, a debate is taking place on the impact and effectiveness of the methadone programme in general. It is good that this debate is taking place now. I encourage the national advisory committee to establish as quickly as possible the areas within the methadone programmes which are causing problems. We have all heard the stories of people collecting prescribed methadone and selling it to buy other drugs. These are areas that have to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Many are of the opinion that the only effective treatment for addiction is a totally drug-free approach, while others support the substitution method. I am of the opinion that there is room for both methods – methadone suits some people while a substance-free approach suits others. I had a meeting recently with a group called Saoilse in the inner city who take the totally drug-free approach. There were 15 young people, teenagers to mid-twenties, all of whom accepted that the method they were using was suitable but agreed it does not work in every case. There is scope for both methods. Irrespective of the method employed, the groups and aid agencies dealing with addicts need to be encouraged and resourced properly to continue the work. The approach being taken in this strategy is the correct one.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">In recent years the Garda has proven hugely successful in tackling the supply chain for drugs. Almost daily we hear of major seizures of illicit drugs. There is now unprecedented co-operation between law enforcement agencies in Europe and around the world. The Criminal Assets Bureau has been a highly successful weapon in the fight against those who trade on people's misery by supplying drugs. I encourage the Department constantly to review the laws in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Recent studies by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, based in University College Dublin, have revealed an alarming increase in the number of specimens taken by gardaí which contain a mixture of alcohol and drugs, mainly cannabis, but including cocaine and other drugs. These studies have shown, when the appropriate tests are carried out, an upward trend in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The campaigns in recent years against drink driving have had an effect and everyone would accept there has been a cultural change in attitudes to drinking and driving. I urge the Minister to initiate a similar campaign in the area of drugs and driving and to continue to support the research which is under way in this area. I commend the Department and the Minister on the strategy. I have no doubt that between 2001 and 2008 it will have a serious effect on this whole issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_40">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_147">I thank those who have contributed to this debate and congratulate my party leader, Senator Brian Hayes, who sought the debate over many weeks. The more times we meet to discuss the serious drugs problem the better. Hopefully, we will learn from each other and the Minister will take on board some of our recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Unfortunately, I did not hear the contribution of the Minister of State but I have been reading through it. I am aware of his personal commitment to dealing with this ever-growing problem. It is an issue that requires commitment not only from him but from many other Ministers and Departments because a multi-faceted approach is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">I listened with interest to Senator Ó Murchú who presented a different but important angle to this debate. As in many of Senator Ó Murchú's contributions, he highlighted how society is changing and how a changed society brings negatives as well as positives. Unfortunately, during the past 20 or 30 years the huge cultural change here which has produced a more economically liberal society has also had negative effects. The loss of community and interaction between neighbours and the fact that there are enormous housing estates where one family hardly knows their next door neighbours is causing traditional values to disappear. When we use the term "traditional values" we can be accused of looking back to some long gone conservative era where things were perfect. Of course things were not perfect 20, 50 or 70 years ago but there were qualities of life then which have disappeared, such as co-operation between neighbours and communities. The loss of those values has led to a much colder and harsher society.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Against that backdrop there is a growing problem among young people who do not have the foundations on which to depend which we had. That the drugs culture takes over in many cases is easy to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">A drug which the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is looking at is alcohol. We have had several debates about tobacco in this House and in the other House. Apparently further draconian measures are being introduced. The Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which I was a member, produced a lengthy and comprehensive report on tobacco but to date we have not given the same attention to alcohol. Without a doubt alcohol is the biggest drug problem in the country. I accept that in some large urban centres and, indeed, some smaller ones, soft drugs are being peddled and are creating difficulties. Tackling soft and hard drugs, such as heroin, is a major problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">In every townland, there are young people who, three to four nights per week, consume levels of alcohol which are seriously injurious to their health. This is the greatest problem facing young people. We have come to the stage where a young person is not socially acceptable unless they consume huge amounts of alcohol. It is tragic that we believe it is quite normal to go out to drink not for the sake of having a drink, but to get drunk. As Members of the Oireachtas, we should hang our heads in shame that we have allowed such a situation to develop. There is a romantic connection between the Irish and drink and we have come to accept that we cannot have entertainment or enjoy ourselves without alcohol. That perception has become a reality and it needs to be tackled as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night, streets in towns and cities are teeming with young people who have consumed huge and dangerous amounts of alcohol. Many Members have travelled to various European towns and capital cities. It is extraordinary that at weekends, streets in German or Scandinavian towns are deserted by 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. These are so-called liberal countries in which we are told everything goes, but they have an entirely different attitude to alcohol and the people of those countries appear to be able to enjoy life and themselves without becoming involved in a drinking culture similar to that which obtains here. This drinking culture needs to be analysed, attacked and reversed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">The Minister of State referred to the national drugs strategy which is of immense importance in most parts of the country, particularly large urban centres. In conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State will have to look more closely at the alcohol problem because every townland and town is affected. It is not too late to cry halt, but leadership is required from the Government. There will be cynics who will say that the taxes brought in by alcohol almost keep the country ticking over. That is a short-sighted financial analysis because the cost to the country in terms of work days lost, the hospitalisation of people and the economic and social suffering at family level is much greater than the taxes raised. As a society, we are serious net losers as a result of our alcohol culture and alcohol dependency.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Of all the drugs and social problems about which we speak, alcohol is by far the greatest menace. It is a problem not only from the point of view of health, but it results in serious crime and public order problems. As public representatives, we are made aware of these issues daily. The public is right to expect us to tackle the issue. We are only six months or so into the term of this Oireachtas and, presumably, we will all be here for at least three to four years. I hope that, during this term, all the parties will unite on the issue of alcohol abuse and put it at the top of the health and drugs agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">We should try to bring some degree of maturity to the way in which we, as a society, look at alcohol. If one speaks in this House or at a local authority meeting or if one makes public statements about alcohol abuse, it is seen as if one is trying to set up some sort of anti-fun group. As we all know, people can enjoy themselves and be entertained without consuming huge amounts of alcohol. I hope the Minister of State will look seriously at this grave problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">While we can quantify the number of people who die from drug overdoses each year, it is not as easy to quantify the number of people who suffer in some way as a result of alcohol abuse, although the number is considerable. Those who suffer, include the person who consumes the alcohol and, more importantly, their spouse and family. The advertisements by Barnardos on alcohol abuse and the excessive consumption of alcohol are quite effective. They try to speak from the point of view of children. Sadly, hundreds of thousands of people in this country are affected, to some degree, by the excessive consumption of alcohol. This problem needs to be tackled urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">My colleagues referred to some of the initiatives, including the provision of community centres, youth workers, sports workers, etc. These initiatives are positive and welcome. If we want to give young people an alternative to drug use and abuse – whether of alcohol or other drugs – we must ensure community and sporting facilities are available. It must be conceded that over the past four to five years generous levels of grant aid were made available through the national lottery fund and most communities have benefited to some degree. Given that the economic situation is not as positive as it was over the past five or six years, there is a possibility that sports and community facilities could suffer when cutbacks are being considered. We must argue that investment in sport, youth and community facilities will pay rich, long-term dividends from a preventative and developmental point of view. I hope we will not see cutbacks in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours and I apologise if I drifted beyond the terms of the statements. While the drugs issue is important, the biggest drug with which this country has failed to deal is alcohol. It is not too late to make an effort, but it would want to commence immediately.</p>

          <from>Mr. MacSharry</from>
          <p eId="para_160">I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him and his Department on their fantastic work on the national drugs strategy. There are some terrific initiatives which must be welcomed and supported. It is a good structure to properly tackle the serious problems drugs have brought to urban centres, in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">As Senator McHugh said, this problem is not confined to urban centres. I come from the regions, in which there is a growing problem in places such as Letterkenny, Sligo and even smaller towns. We have a huge responsibility to try to nip these problems in the bud. This week the local Sligo newspaper alludes in its headline to the growing cocaine problem in the town and its environs. We have a responsibility to tackle these problems as they develop. Even though we know the problem is at an advanced stage in Dublin, Limerick and other cities, we should not overly focus on solving their problems while neglecting the developing problems of smaller towns in rural Ireland. While there are many good initiatives afoot, we must strive to make drug taking uncool. So many films these days actively glamourise drug taking with some of our favourite stars. Senator Ó Murchú alluded to the fact that this glamour must be eliminated and that we must be draconian in the measures used to deal with the suppliers of drugs. This must be done as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Senator Bradford spoke about the alcohol problem. Together with drugs, alcohol presents the biggest single problem in the country. During a debate in the House a number of weeks ago I called for the issue to be tackled vigorously because the level of under age drinking was completely unacceptable. I called for the introduction of a compulsory national identification card scheme which would help eliminate under age drinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">To solve the drugs problem one must tackle the culture. As Senator Brady said, education is the key to prevention. We must seek to find viable alternatives for young people to enjoy themselves without peer pressure or the focus being on drinking or trying out certain drugs. That is where our responsibility lies and we should pump as many resources as possible into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">I wish the Minister of State well with the national drugs strategy and I am sure he will have the support of everyone in the House in that regard. I hope there is unity in the approach to tackling the issue and that we will continue to make progress.</p>

        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_42">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_165">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his presentation. I welcome the work of the local drugs task forces and the progress made to date on the strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Drug taking is, and will continue to be, a growing problem. A drugs transaction between two young people took place recently beside me at a bus stop in my area. They were not the stereotypical drug addicts. While we must recognise that the problem is to be found everywhere, there must be targeted intervention. The Minister of State mentioned the 14 local drugs task forces. However, we must consider other areas because we need to be on top of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome the young people's facilities and services fund. I am aware of a sports club in my area which obtained funding under the scheme which is being matched with funding from another Department in order to provide the facilities needed. I welcome the fact that it is able to provide dressingroom facilities in a county council park. Funding for sports facilities is provided on a very piecemeal basis. There needs to be an overall strategy in this regard. Whoever decides to apply for funding for sports facilities is the one who obtains it but it is not done in a strategic way. There should be an overall strategy in regard to sports and community facilities, while at the same time implementing the drugs strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Even though I am aware he will not have the information to hand, I want to raise with the Minister of State the issue of a secondary school in my area. It was to be provided with a sports centre extension through the Department of Education and Science which was to be co-funded by the local drugs task force. It has now been put on hold as a result of the cutbacks in the Department. These projects should be given priority. While all projects are important, if a school was to be provided with facilities under the drugs task force strategy, it should not be put on the long finger. I will speak to the Minister of State on the matter on another occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I agree with those speakers who referred to the importance of education. The reality is that most young people know much more about drugs than the rest of us. They have a blasé rather than negative attitude to drugs. Many who would not smoke for health reasons have no problem taking drugs in clubs and so on. Young people need to be educated about the dangers involved in taking drugs. The same applies to drinking and smoking. The campaign on smoking shows how successful this approach can be in educating people on the negative side of a particular addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">Many of my constituents are recovering drug addicts who should be provided with opportunities to make the best of themselves. Education is very important in this regard. Computer education should be targeted at areas where there are problems. People need to obtain skills and confidence to seek employment and so on in order that they will not go down the road of taking drugs and becoming involved in anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">Housing is a very important aspect of the drugs programme. This was not mentioned in the Minister of State's presentation. Those coming off drugs need to have security which cannot be the case if they are homeless or cannot get permanent accommodation. Councils do not want the hassle of dealing with recovering drug addicts which makes it very difficult for them to find accommodation. Very often they are sent out into the streets to be dragged back into the drugs culture. Perhaps councils should provide particular types of accommodation for those in a transition period. It may be a lot to ask them to take on board but it is something we should promote.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">More facilities for teenagers – not just sports centres – must be provided. Members mentioned other European countries where young people do not have the same drink culture. We do not provide the types of facilities for young people available in other countries – I do not necessarily mean publicly funded facilities. While on holidays in Italy, I noticed that many young people would hang out in cafés at night and then head off to a club but they did not drink.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_174">Exactly. That is something we do not have here. Perhaps we should try to work with business people to try out this type of service which would be a runner and could make money. Art and multi media centres are very important because young people are interested in these aspects which would harness their creativity in a positive way. More must also be done about investing in facilities for young people interested in animals. While there are horse projects in place, there are not enough of them. There is none in my area. I know many young people who miss school but have a positive attitude to animals. If they became interested in this type of activity, perhaps they could go on and have a career in the horse industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">There should be guaranteed treatment for people who are drug addicts. We should make progress with the drugs courts and examine the provision of drug treatment programmes as an alternative to imprisonment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_45">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_176">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. I thank Senator Brian Hayes for calling for this debate, which I welcome. I had not intended to speak on this matter, but I feel obliged to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The Minister of State said that he has consulted various groups and organisations throughout the city. I would like to put on the record of the House that drug addiction is not just a problem in Dublin. Members, including Senator Ó Murchú, have mentioned that it is a problem in every part of the country, including rural towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">We can divide drugs problems into two categories – those we can see and those we cannot. A recent "Prime Time" documentary showed people flowing on to the streets in the early hours of the morning, leading to trouble. Viewers could see that drink and drugs were causing violence and damage to property. However, we do not see the domestic violence, robberies and murders perpetrated by those under the influence of such substances. Although we know that excessive drinking, violence and drug-taking occur, we do not seem able to take steps to stop such behaviour. Nobody seems to know why we cannot solve these problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Senator Bradford said earlier that alcohol is a major problem throughout the country. CCTV systems are being installed in many towns at great expense. The Government is providing funds to chambers of commerce in some towns to meet the cost of installation, but it cannot afford to provide CCTV systems in all towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">We need to be conscious of the reasons people drink so much. Why do they feel the need to behave in a violent manner when they flow on to the streets in the early morning? Some people feel it is necessary to damage the wing mirror of a car, to break a shop window or to smack an innocent bystander in the face. Why do some people feel the need to stab or shoot other people, as has happened on many occasions? Can these problems be attributed to peer pressure, drugs, drink or a lack of gardaí? It is probably a combination of all these things and many more. The problems I have mentioned can be seen every weekend. Parents, politicians, the Garda Síochána and those directly involved are responsible for solving them. Everybody who saw the "Prime Time" documentary was astounded, but similar drunken behaviour can be seen on the streets on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">I agree with Senators who said they have grave reservations about drugs that are seen as being less harmful. We should not allow any drugs at all. People who smoke strong cigarettes may wean themselves onto weaker cigarettes, but that does not mean they have given up cigarettes. Reduction in the strength of cigarettes is not the answer for such people, as they still need to take the drug. Nobody seems to have the answer to these problems, but it seems that alcohol is playing a huge role. Many people who consume alcoholic products move on to taking drugs, as they are seeking a stronger kick. I do not think the answer is for people to look for a weaker kick, as they should be trying to eliminate such needs entirely. I would like to see a drug-free society.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">We are unable to control the problems we can see, so we certainly have no control over the things we cannot see. Nobody seems to have the answer to these problems. The streets are an absolute disgrace in the early hours of Saturday and Sunday mornings. There is not a sufficiently large Garda presence. When many gardaí are on the streets at night, it is noticeable that there is less violence and less damage to property. People have to be punished financially if we are to change their behaviour, because such punishment hurts them. They will think twice before misbehaving if they, or their parents, have to pay a substantial fine. The law should be enforced in a way that affects people's pockets. I do not deny that people with serious addiction problems have to be treated in suitable facilities and helped to return to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">If we allow the problems to which I refer to grow, we will encounter more serious difficulties that require more serious remedies. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, for coming before the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_46">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_184">I thank Senators for their contributions and their interest in this matter. Their remarks were, generally speaking, fair and reasonable and reflect the fact that the problems are difficult to solve. I welcome the supportive comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Senator Brian Hayes spoke of the need for politicians to be involved in local drugs task forces and I agree with him in that respect. Politicians are now represented on most drugs task forces, a trend that was set in my constituency. Although there was some mistrust between community groups and public representatives some years ago, the value of multi-agency groups, such as the drugs task force, is now recognised. It is important that politicians are members of such groups so they can become familiar with the issues and can contribute to debates in places such as this House. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes about the Cabinet sub-committee, which is good because it provides a forum for discussion. It receives regular quarterly feedback.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Many people are concerned about cocaine, a substance that was mentioned by Senator Brian Hayes. It is different from heroin in the sense that a substitute like methadone is not available. A number of Senators mentioned their concerns about methadone as a long-term solution, but at least it is available as a heroin substitute. The only substitute for cocaine, however, is abstinence. A cross-professional team of four or five counsellors who specialise in cocaine addiction has been established in the Northern Area Health Board's city clinic. Cocaine is a more difficult problem to deal with because a substitute such as methadone is not available. Counselling and education are the most important things when dealing with cocaine addiction. The specialist team has been in place in the city clinic for the past two or three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I agree with Senators who advocated ring-fencing the Criminal Assets Bureau's receipts – they are pushing an open door when making such a point to me. I would be keen for funds from the CAB to be spent in communities that have been affected by drugs. However, it is difficult to convince the Minister for Finance and others to ring-fence such funds.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_47">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_188">We will help the Minister of State to convince him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_48" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I will accept all help that can be offered at any level in that regard. There is a logic to it. The funds from the CAB may be a slow burner but when a meeting of the British-Irish Council was held here some weeks ago, the British Minister dealing with the matter, Mr. Bob Ainsworth, took the opportunity to visit the CAB which is deemed a successful operation and an innovative idea. I hope it recovers a lot of the proceeds from drugs. It would be good if it could be put back into the communities affected by drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">There is no problem with funding for the regional drugs task forces this year. I hope their first meeting will be held by the end of March. I do not want them to be an exact copy of the Dublin drugs task forces where there were very few services on the ground. However, if roughly the same plan is followed, it will take a number of months before they come up with plans. Given this, the funding requirement will arise next year and only administrative expenses will be required this year. The problem is not as bad in rural areas and the role of the regional drugs task forces may have more to do with information and co-ordination. I do not think they will come forward with as expensive a plan but, if they do, the funding requirement will not arise this year but in the future. As was the experience with the Dublin drugs task forces, even when the plans are sent in and approved, it may take quite a while for them to come into operation. That is one of the problems but money will not be a problem this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">Senator Brian Hayes spoke about methadone research and asked whether users were coming off it. Some are but many who are stabilised on methadone are living useful lives. It is difficult to know how to judge success in these matters. It is not just to do with the number who come off methadone but how many are leading useful lives and are stabilised. I participated in the launch of a recent report on buprenorphine, another substitute for methadone. It is a simple tablet to be dissolved under the tongue a couple of times per week but is for highly motivated individuals who are back at work and do not want to go to their chemist for methadone. There are other substitutes which are not for those still dabbling and topping up on other drugs, as we know many are.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Some 6,500 people are on methadone – a good number – but there is still a problem in some parts of Dublin city. The south-west of the city was one of the weaker spots but the situation has improved in Tallaght and Clondalkin. It could have been better earlier but those communities were not very brave. There were objections at different stages to health board proposals.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_50" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_194">Many of the schemes were community based, in keeping with the experience in my area some nine years ago. Some areas were slow to come on board but did so and no longer treat the drug abuser like a pariah. Waiting lists were a problem in that part of the city and, though it is not now as bad, it is still one of the weaker areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">There are now many family support groups which some believe the strategy does not recognise to the maximum extent possible. My Department might not agree but it is the feeling I have got when I have visited local groups. The strategy does recognise family support groups, some of which are now branching out and doing very good work. Expertise has developed at local level among families which may have had serious problems and related deaths. There are very good people who have learned on the ground and give good support. I attended a recent event involving a network of family support groups which pulls the groups together and helps them to support each other. That is an interesting development.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Senator Ó Murchú spoke about role models and the reasons for taking drugs. As it is difficult to get through to young people on this issue, role models could help by speaking of the dangers of drugs. Some dabble in drugs, perhaps at student level, and manage to escape again. In a survey of students very few of those using soft drugs such as cannabis thought it was harmful. They saw themselves as dabbling for a while and then giving it up to concentrate on their studies. Those using it thought they could walk away and that it was something that could be messed around with for a couple of months. Sadly, while drugs may do some no harm, others get trapped and do not walk away. That is the difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">There is a campaign to glamourise drug use and also a misguided campaign to promote drugs for medicinal use which could happen. There is a debate at medical level as to whether cannabis or other drugs may be of benefit for particular medical problems. However, allowing drug use for medicinal reasons is very different from throwing open the drugs market. It is a false argument.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Alcohol was mentioned by several speakers. It is strange the way the issue is evolving. The drugs strategy is about illegal drugs, not alcohol. If one told the members of a drugs task force five years ago that it should have responsibility for alcohol, they would have hit the roof. They would have said the importance of tackling illegal drugs was being downplayed. However, there has been a change and local drugs task forces are beginning to involve themselves with alcohol and see the connection between it and illegal drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">With the setting up of the regional drugs task forces, the feedback is that alcohol presents the biggest problem in rural areas also. Alcohol strategy is the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children whereas the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs co-ordinates activities regarding illegal drugs. However, it is possible that the two areas could be combined in the future in keeping with the demand coming from the community. Five years ago it would have been said the importance of tackling illegal drugs was being downplayed if they were put together. This is the growing view of the important community sector. At present they come under the aegis of various Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Senator McHugh referred to Letterkenny and said he had not met any drug addicts there. I recently met a group from County Donegal – I am not sure if they were concerned with heroin addicts – who told me of a problem that is perhaps associated with Derry and the fringes of the city. Heroin may not always be the problem in provincial areas, but other drugs are involved, be they medical, cannabis or cocaine.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Senator McHugh asked why there is no Department of youth affairs. The structure of the Government does not allow for that. Likewise, there is no Department for the elderly. He criticised the inter-departmental working group. It works well as it provides a mechanism for representatives from the different Departments and agencies to come together to give an account of their stewardship. It is the way to proceed because it makes those involved account for their progress before their peers.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">Senator Brady referred to the need for sports and recreation facilities and the situation in prisons. Much of the strategy is aimed at targeting those at risk, including those leaving prison and the homeless. A recent conference linked drug abuse and homelessness. If those at risk do not have stable backgrounds on which to fall back, they are likely to re-encounter their problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">However, too often suburban agencies, such as those in Tallaght or Clondalkin, solve their problems by sending homeless people into the city centre. I recently visited a suburban centre that was attempting to address the problem by providing temporary accommodation in the form of a hostel or such like. Sending the homeless to the city centre creates too much pressure, with the result that there can be too many hostels. Every area must do its share in tackling drug abuse and homelessness because it is easier to support those at risk if they are helped near their home communities. They can be more easily stabilised, which increases their prospects of resuming decent lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Those dealing with the homeless outside Dublin maintain that alcohol rather than drug abuse is the bigger issue. Senator Brady referred to the need to provide greater scrutiny of driving while under the influence of drugs. I am not sure if the system is geared to catching drivers who take drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Ultimately, much of what can be done in this area comes down to education. While an argument may be made for more gardaí, it would be impossible to ensure that the Garda Síochána is big enough to police every nightclub or pub. Our fundamental concern is with educating people to an awareness of the harm caused by drug abuse and giving them the self-confidence to make decisions. That is a key aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The enforcement agencies play a role and drug seizures may increase, but we can never stop drugs from coming into the country. People will always have the temptation put before them and our main concern, therefore, is to give them the confidence and the knowledge to make decisions. This requires them to be aware of the dangers.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Educational programmes, such as the shocking drunk driving advertisements, are important. It has been suggested that there be similar campaigns to cover drug abuse in an attempt to frighten people. Another suggestion is to bring schoolchildren to areas of the city where drug abuse is widespread and to let them see those who have fallen victim to it. Sometimes, such shock tactics work, but fundamentally there is a need to impart knowledge so that people are capable of making the right decisions for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Senator Tuffy referred to the young people's facilities fund. It has done much good work although there is debate, even in my Department, about deciding who is at risk. For example, who should be helped in Clondalkin, Ballymun or the inner city? Is it the young person who has become a victim of drug misuse or are all young people in the area at risk? Many projects are being evaluated on that basis. For example, some projects in my constituency, such as football clubs, are annoyed that funding seems channelled mainly at drug abuse. They sometimes ask if it is necessary to be on drugs before money is provided. We do not want that impression to become widespread.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">It is much more economical if people can be reached at an early stage by providing them with alternative healthy lifestyles. While my background is in sports, a number of other activities could be developed, be it in the arts centres or youth clubs. The sports officers provided by the fund probably gave the best value in terms of community, addiction and development workers. Some great people are working to get children, especially those in single parent homes, involved in sports and other activities after school.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The ongoing debate centred on who is at risk is also concerned with whether funding should be directed solely at those who are already trapped or if it should also apply to those who are in danger. It should be directed at both aspects and should take account of local circumstances. The fund was meant to target specific areas where the problem was most acute. That is why a separate fund was created rather than taking it from the overall general capital programme. Some very good work has been done and I have visited the results in various constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">In many instances the fund is being used in conjunction with other funds. In an ideal world, there would be just one Government fund allocated to top up the community or local contribution. That does not happen in the suburbs of Dublin which tend to have just one social class. It is very difficult for such communities, but it might be different in a country town where there is a range of social classes. In many cases the different Government funds act as the community funds. We are trying to address that so people will get funding from only one source, but it is difficult to row back after 15 or 20 years of doing otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Senator Paddy Burke spoke about people drinking until the early hours of the morning. A few years ago, when people wanted pub opening hours to be extended, their theory was that the customers would not all spill out, to use the Senator's phrase, at the same time, but at 11.30 p.m., 12.30 a.m., 1.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. In some places customers find it hard to leave until they are thrown out at the last minute, which is not what was supposed to happen.</p>

To date, many of the targets are being or are close to being met. The problem is to keep the agencies and the Departments on their toes. Sometimes people feel that if the funds of the agencies, health boards or Government Departments were cut a little, they would revert to the position in which they were a few years ago and would be reluctant to stay involved.</p>

We must continue to prioritise it because it would be silly to lose the ground we have made up. We will never stop drugs coming in and we must be as vigilant as possible in tackling the problem. The Garda has had some great success. Fundamentally, the strategy aims to make people aware of the dangers and pitfalls of drugs so they can make decisions that affect their lives.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_56">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_221">The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 is important and long awaited legislation. I have just been reflecting on how long. In 1978 the former Supreme Court judge, Mr. Justice Henchy, reported and appended to his report a draft Bill. The mills of God grind slow but grind exceedingly fine. Most agree that our law on insanity is in need of reform, a view expressed for some time by the Judiciary, legal practitioners, commentators, academics and the medical profession, particularly by those members practising in the field of psychiatry.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">It would be accepted by reference to the totality of criminal proceedings that the raising of the defence of insanity to a criminal charge, usually one of murder, is comparatively rare. However, that in no way reduces its importance in the general sphere of the criminal law because insanity raises fundamental questions about the whole notion of criminal responsibility which is premised on the principle that the individual is personally answerable to society for his or her actions. This accountablility arises from the fact that the individual will be held responsible for his or her actions. However, the criminal law recognises that in circumstances where the individual does not have the mental capacity to control his or her conduct as a result of mental disorder, no blame or liability will attach to him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">An acquittal based on the present special verdict of guilty but insane has exceptional consequences for the accused person because it subjects him or her to a special regime of detention. At present that means that the person is held in the Central Mental Hospital. The State bears two main burdens of responsibility in these cases. The first arises because it is paramount in the public interest to curtail the freedom of the person until he or she no longer poses a threat to society at large. The second arises from the fact that the State has to balance this duty with its responsibility to preserve and protect the human rights of the person concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">It has been said with some degree of understatement that this area of law has what are termed fundamental social and moral implications. I have just outlined two. However, there is a third consideration because the fundamental issue in any debate on insanity and the criminal law – something that goes right to the heart of the matter – is the moral distinction that needs to be drawn between the bad and those who do not necessarily have the mental capacity to commit crimes. At this point I want to sound a word of caution which has to do with the intention and policy considerations behind this Bill. I can put those words of caution no better than has been expressed by noted commentators, Finbarr McAuley and Paul McCutcheon, in this jurisdiction in their leading authority on the issue, <i>Criminal Liability:</i>Legal and medical evaluations of the conditions that might properly attract the label “insanity” can differ profoundly. The law regards several conditions, such as epilepsy and hypoglycaemia, that medical professionals do not classify as mental disorders as a basis for the insanity defence. This highlights the different perspectives of the relevant disciplines and it should be realised that the defence raises a legal question of responsibility, not an issue of medical diagnosis and classification. Nevertheless, it is invariably the case that medical evidence is adduced at trial and, it can be assumed, is taken into account in the determination of the defendant's sanity. Thus, while a degree of congruence between the medical and legal evaluations can be expected, the ultimate resolution of the issue is one of law, not medicine.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The main purpose for bringing this legislation before the House is to clarify, modernise and reform the law on criminal insanity and fitness to be tried to bring it into line with the jurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights. As Members of this House will probably be aware, a Bill to give effect to the convention in Irish law in line with an obligation under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement has reached Committee Stage in the other House. The Bill before this House, in addition to dealing with some general issues, contains more detailed provisions on substantive matters such as fitness to plead, a statutory definition of criminal insanity, a new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity – instead of the older verdict of guilty but insane – and a new plea of guilty but with diminished responsibility in cases of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">To appreciate fully the importance of and the need for this Bill it should be noted that most of our legislative provisions dealing with criminal insanity date back to the 19th century and some to the early 1800s. However, the origins of the insanity defence actually go back much further, they can be traced back at least to the 13th century. However, even with that early realisation of the difficulty, the common law was very slow to recognise a defence to a criminal charge based on insanity. Whatever amelioration it did provide from the severity of the sentence, the quality of mercy tended to be somewhat strained until at least the 18th century.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The attitude of the time is best illustrated in the writings of the noted criminal jurist, Hale, when he stated, metaphorically one hopes, that insanity was no defence unless the defendant resembled a beast rather than a man. It was not until the case of Rex <i>v.</i> Hadfield in 1800 that the modern defence of insanity began to evolve. The defendant in the case thought he had to die in order to save the world. His problem was that as suicide was a mortal sin and as such a sin above all others, he could not kill himself and hope to avoid eternal damnation. He chose instead to fire a shot at the King, which was a capital offence, and it was held that he was not accountable for his actions because of insanity and he was acquitted. History does not record if his disappointment drove him to further despair.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The foundation case in so far as modern insanity in the criminal law is concerned is that of Rex <i>v</i>. M'Naghten in 1843. In that case the defendant suffered from an insane delusion that Sir Robert Peel, a predecessor of mine in a different jurisdiction, was persecuting him and he believed that Peel had to to be killed. However, he killed Peel's unfortunate secretary by mistake. At his trial M'Naghten was acquitted because of insanity. The decision of the court caused so much public outrage that the House of Lords requested the Law Lords to explain the defence of insanity. The answer formulated by the Law Lords has come to be known as the M'Naghten Rules which have formed the basis for the development of the defence of insanity, albeit within extremely narrow limits, in the countries with common law systems ever since.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">It is clear, however, that with the development of modern psychiatry and a greater understanding of the underlying causes of mental illness and its associated conditions it has been apparent for some time that the criminal law dealing with insanity needs to be clarified and updated. Serious concerns have been expressed for some time by judges, lawyers and psychiatrists that the main aspects of the law in this area are in need of review. The Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 addresses these concerns by implementing the main recommendations of the third report in 1978 of the interdepartmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons which was chaired, as I said, by Mr. Justice Henchy.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">A person's mental health in relation to criminal law proceedings is relevant in two ways. First, the person must be fit to plead to the charge. If it is shown that the person, because of insanity, is unable to understand the charge against him or the difference between guilty and not guilty, or is unable to instruct counsel, challenge jurors, or follow the evidence, the trial cannot proceed. This is essentially because its fairness cannot be guaranteed due to the person's condition. The test at common law to be followed in such instances was laid down by the Supreme Court in the State (Coughlan) <i>v.</i> Minister for Justice (1968). This test is not limited to any particular definition of insanity; it simply assesses the person's ability to comprehend what is going on. If the person is found to be unfit to plead, section 2 of the Criminal Lunatics Act 1800 provides that he or she should be detained in strict custody until the pleasure of the Government be known.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Second, where a person is found fit to plead, the trial will proceed, but the person may raise the defence of insanity. The law will presume that the person is legally sane and, if over the age of 14 years, is fully accountable for his or her actions. However, if the person is able to show, on a balance of probabilities as opposed to proving it beyond reasonable doubt, that at the time the offence was committed, he or she was legally insane, then he or she will have a defence. In these circumstances, the person will be deemed to have lacked the necessary <i>mens rea,</i> or guilty mind, and should not, therefore, be held accountable. The test applied here is based on the M'Naghten rules to which I have already referred. Those rules require that it must be shown that a person must have suffered, at the time of his or her act, from a defect of reason due to disease of the mind so that he or she did not know what he or she was doing, or did not know that it was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Strictly speaking, the M'Naghten rules apply to a person who is suffering from insanity which manifests itself in insane delusions. Nevertheless, the rules were accepted as the general test for insanity in Irish law, despite the fact that doubts had been expressed as to whether they represented a comprehensive statement of Irish law on the issue. However, following the decision of the Supreme Court in the People <i>v.</i> Hayes in 1965, and its subsequent approval by the Supreme Court in Doyle <i>v.</i> Wicklow County Council in 1974, it is clear that the M'Naghten rules are not the sole and exclusive test for the defence of insanity in Ireland. The decision in the latter case means that a third factor – an irresistible impulse brought about by mental illness – which the court said “debarred [the defendant] from refraining from committing the act”, may also be taken into account. This extension of the rules to comprehend a new criterion of volitional control goes further than a strict interpretation of the M'Naghten rules would have allowed. Thus, Irish law seems to be more aligned with the formulation of insanity as set out by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen in his <i>Digest of the Criminal Law</i> in 1891 – an early attempt in Victorian days to provide a codification of the criminal law – which admits of the possibility of a disease of the mind preventing a person from controlling his or her conduct. It is interesting to note that Sir James Fitzjames Stephen codified the English criminal law, as I am currently engaged in a similar project with regard to our domestic law. Mr. Finbar McCauley, to whom I referred earlier, is chairman of a working group that is embarking upon that exact task.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Sir James Fitzjames Stephen's efforts to bring a codification of English criminal law before Westminster constantly fell foul of parliamentary vagaries, occasioned in particular by Irish MPs who were seeking home rule. Senators will be interested to know about that footnote to Irish history.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_235">That is correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">I will deal now with the main provisions of the Bill in more detail. Section 1 deals with definitions, and two matters in particular are worthy of special mention. The first concerns the definition of designated centre, which is further explained in section 2. This section follows section 5 in the draft Bill proposed by the Henchy committee in 1978 and it provides that it is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children – in consultation with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the case of the designation of a prison as such a centre – to decide where is the most appropriate place for the treatment of persons committed to detention under the Bill. The designation of a prison as a designated centre, which was not recommended by the Henchy committee, is included to cater for situations where it might be appropriate to detain a person in a prison rather than in a psychiatric hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The second issue arising from section 1 concerns the definition of the term "mental disorder" which is defined for the purpose of findings of "unfitness to be tried" in section 3, for the purpose of a verdict of "not guilty by reason of insanity" in section 4, and for the purpose of "diminished responsibility" in section 5. It is a definition for purposes of establishing criminal liability and includes a person suffering from a mental illness or handicap, dementia or any disease of the mind, but excludes intoxication by alcohol or other substances.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">While the definition is not fully inclusive, the essential element for the court, for example where criminal insanity is pleaded, is whether the accused had the <i>mens rea</i>, or guilty mind, to commit the offence for which he or she is charged. The definition of mental disorder plus the criteria in section 4 are intended as the test for the court in coming to a decision on that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Section 3 deals with the issue of fitness to be tried. This term is being adopted instead of the term fitness to plead which is used in the relevant provisions of the Lunacy (Ireland) Act 1821. The latter are being repealed. The section contains a new statutory definition of fitness to be tried based on the existing common law, upon which I have already commented. It is also provided that the question of fitness to be tried will in future be determined by a court, including the District Court, without a jury. That is a change from the current situation. I have had experience of conducting cases in which a jury was empanelled to determine the fitness of the accused to stand trial, even though – in the case in which I was involved, at any rate – a subsequent jury was empanelled to try the question of guilty or innocence once the first jury found the accused was fit to be tried.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">It may be noted in this regard that fitness to be tried is a medico-legal issue; it does not relate to the guilt or innocence of a person. If the person is found unfit to be tried, the proceedings will be adjourned and the court will then determine how the person should be dealt with until such time, if ever, as he or she has recovered. As the person will not have been found guilty of any crime, he or she will only be detained if likely to be dangerous to himself or herself or to others or in need of in-patient treatment. Safeguards are provided in the section to reduce the possibility of persons found unfit to be tried being detained unnecessarily under the criminal law. In effect, these provisions provide that where, despite the fact that the accused is unfit to be tried, the court is satisfied that there is a reasonable doubt that he or she committed the alleged act, it will acquit him or her. Accused persons may be unfit to be tried but if the court is, nonetheless, in a position to acquit them and say they are innocent, they should not be denied the benefit of having their innocence established merely by virtue of the fact that they have had some intervening mental illness. It will then be a matter for the relevant authorities acting under the civil law – that is, the Mental Health Act 2001 – to take whatever measures they may deem necessary in relation to the persons concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Section 4 provides for a new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity to replace the existing special verdict of guilty but insane, and sets out the parameters of the test for insanity which is based on the existing common law position, including recent Irish case law. I might emphasise again that the test to be applied will be related to the time of the alleged commission of the offence and not the time of the trial. The section also provides that after a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity is returned, the court will then consider the mental condition of the person by reference to the Mental Health Act 2001 to determine whether he or she should be released or detained on the grounds that in-patient treatment is required because the person may be dangerous to himself or herself, or to others because of their mental condition. That represents a change. In other words, once a person has been found not guilty on this ground, the decision as to how he or she should be dealt with thereafter is taken not by reference to the criminal law definitions of insanity but by reference to the civil law relating to mental health, as contained in the recently enacted statute which updated the law in that area. This approach is in accordance with obligations arising under the European Convention on Human Rights which will shortly be given further effect in Irish law in accordance with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001 which I am piloting through Committee Stage in the other House and hope will be debated in this House soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Section 5 introduces into Irish law the concept of diminished responsibility which concept does not exist in law. It is only being applied in the case of murder which carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. It is because of the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment that it is appropriate to distinguish between cases where diminished responsibility is a factor and cases in which it is not. The effect of this will be that if diminished responsibility is successfully pleaded, a conviction for manslaughter will be recorded with the sentence, at the discretion of the court, being any term of imprisonment up to life. There is no need to apply the concept in the case of other crimes where there is no mandatory sentence. In those instances the judge can take into account the mental condition of the convicted person when considering what sentence to impose. The availability of the diminished responsibility verdict provides an alternative for juries and should reduce the danger that a jury will return an insanity verdict when faced with a person whom they regard as not being completely sane, even if he or she does not meet the legal criteria for insanity.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Sections 6 and 7 deal respectively with the question of appeals to higher courts from decisions of lower courts that a person is unfit to be tried or is not guilty by reason of insanity. Under existing law findings of unfitness to plead and fitness to be tried or verdicts of guilty but insane are not regarded as convictions. Consequently, there is no provision for a person to appeal against them. Section 8 provides that appeals may be made by the defence or prosecution against a decision of the court of trial to order or not to order the detention of a person in these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Section 9 provides for the establishment day provision in so far as it relates to the setting up of an independent mental health review board provided for in section 10 and the First Schedule to the Bill. The mental health review board will replace the existing <i>ad hoc</i> advisory committee and, in order to comply with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, will act independently of the Executive, in this case, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Government. Its main function will be the regular review of the detention of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried, who have been detained in a designated centre by order of a court. The board will be made up of a chairperson who must have not less than ten years' experience as a practising barrister or solicitor or be a judge or former judge of the Circuit or Superior Courts and such other number of persons as the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Health and Children shall appoint, at least one of whom must be a consultant psychiatrist. The term of office of members is five years and provision is made for reappointment. It is provided that the Minister may appoint the staff of the board under the usual conditions, and that such staff shall be civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Section 11 sets out the various powers of the board, including the power to hold sittings, take account of court records, assign a legal representative to the person seeking review, require the attendance of such person before it, obtain evidence and demand the production of information and documents, pay the reasonable expenses of witnesses and administer oaths. The failure of persons to attend before the board or comply with requests by it for information or documents, or where a person is in contempt of the board are offences punishable by a fine not exceeding €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Section 12 deals with the various ways in which the detention of persons found not guilty by reason of insanity or unfit to be tried, whether they are in a prison or other designated centre, including persons detained under military law, may be reviewed. In the case of a prison this applies to the governor who shall act on the advice of an approved medical officer and in the case of a psychiatric hospital, the chief medical officer. The review board has the responsibility for ensuring the detention of such persons is reviewed at six monthly or at such lesser intervals as it considers appropriate. In cases where a person who has not been acquitted is no longer unfit to be tried, the court of committal has to be so informed and shall order that the person be brought before it to be dealt with as it thinks proper. In the case of detention under military law the appropriate authority has to be similarly informed in order that the court martial shall be reconvened.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">Section 13 provides for the temporary release, transfer and other matters related to detained persons. The purpose is to arrange for such matters without the need to apply to the review board every time. It is provided that the consent of the Minister must be obtained to ensure the public interest is safeguarded. The Minister for Health and Children might also have an interest, particularly in the case of transfers to another designated centre which is also covered in the section.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">Section 14 ensures evidence as to the mental condition of an accused person shall not be raised by the defence during the course of a trial, unless notice of intention to do so has been given to the prosecution in accordance with rules of court. This is designed to ensure neither the prosecution nor the court will be taken by surprise by the production of such evidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Section 15 applies the provisions of the Bill on the review of detentions to persons already in detention before the Bill comes into operation. Section 16 deals with consequential technical changes to the relevant provisions in military law – the Defence Act 1954 as amended – so as to maintain consistency between courts martial and civilian courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">Section 17 is the usual expenses provision. Section 18 provides for grants to be made to the mental health review board established under section 10. Section 19 is a repeals and transitional provision to be read in conjunction with the Second Schedule. Section 20 provides for the short title and commencement of the Bill. The First Schedule sets out the provisions applicable to membership of the mental health review board and its procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">I regard this Bill as an important step in the development of statutory rules and guidelines in a difficult and complex area of the law. As with most criminal legislation, it strives to achieve a balance between two opposing objectives. On the one hand and in common with all criminal law measures, it seeks to protect society at large; on the other, it also seeks to protect members of our society who suffer from mental disorder in order that they will not be answerable for crimes where they had not the mental capacity to commit those crimes and, in addition, to ensure those detained under the provisions of the legislation have an independent review body to keep their detention under continuing periodic review. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_59">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_252">I welcome the Minister who is spending a lot of time here. I welcome the Bill which is long overdue. I enjoyed the history lesson given by the Minister. The Bill sets out to bring our outmoded laws on insanity into the modern era and to affirm and codify Irish common law decisions on criminal insanity. It provides for comprehensive treatment, both legally and medically, for those whose mental state may make it impossible to participate in the trial process by providing a framework for determining fitness to be tried. It introduces the long overdue notion of diminished responsibility and sets up a system for the ongoing review of the need to detain those who have offended while suffering from mental disorder.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">"Mental disorder" is defined in section 1 as including mental illness, mental handicap, dementia or any disease of the mind. Intoxication is specifically excluded. The Minister mentioned other substances as well as intoxication with which I agree but they are not included in the Bill. I suggest that other substances should also be included. Whether a given individual comes within this widened definition will continue to be a matter for expert evidence and there will always be controversial cases. No doubt, many psychiatrists will continue to assert that individuals suffering from a personality disorder, even a severe disorder, fall outside the defence. This continues to be an area of medico-legal controversy, both in Ireland and other jurisdictions. Not specifically providing for such persons in the Bill will leave open the question of whether such individuals can avail of the defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">The test for the verdict of guilty by reason of insanity in section 4(1)(<i>b</i>) is almost identical to that proposed in the <i> Digest of Criminal Law</i> by Sir James Stephen. In Doyle <i>v</i>. Wicklow County Council [1974] IR 55, the Supreme Court effectively accepted the defence as stated in section 4(1) (<i>b</i>)(iii) while also accepting the M'Naghten Rules in section 4(1)(<i>b</i>) (i) and (ii). It is arguable that section 4 merely restates the current Irish position on the law. Should the law not have been adapted rather than restated? I accept what the Minister said in his report concerning a third factor in regard to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">I welcome section 4(2) and (3) which provides for the ongoing assessment of the mental health of a person. Section 4(2) obliges the court to commit to hospital in the old way only if the court has evidence that the accused is still suffering from a mental disorder and is in need of in-patient care or treatment. Section 4(3) provides a completely new power to remand a person in custody for assessment, initially for 28 days, but extendable for up to six months. I welcome this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">A consultant psychiatrist must now assess and report on the detained person, and the court can only commit a person without limit of time, as was the practice heretofore, on receipt of evidence from a psychiatrist that detention is necessary. There is no power in the Bill for the court to remand such a person on bail for the assessment. Will the Minister consider detention of certain convicted persons found guilty but insane?</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The new mental health review board is also welcome. This is an idea of Professor McAuley, lecturer in criminal law and criminology in UCD. The board will require significant funding and it is essential that it should have the judicial powers necessary to carry out its work.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">Section 6 dealing with appeals, fitness to be tried, seems unfair in allowing an appeal by the State of a decision that an accused is unfit to be tried but not an appeal of an accused of a decision that he is not unfit to be tried. The same can be said of section 7.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">In general I support the Bill but I will raise some issues later when we get the opportunity to put down amendments.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_260">I welcome the Minister and thank him for introducing this important legislation. Many elements of the existing legislation have probably been there since the 1800s when words such as "moron" and "imbecile" were used in medical terms and a criminal could claim lunacy as a defence.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_261">Now those terms are confined to politics.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKett" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Mr. Kett</from>
          <p eId="para_262">Absolutely. It has taken considerable time to update the law and the Minister is to be congratulated on doing it so early in his term of office. A plethora of legislation faces him but the fact that he has prioritised this indicates the need he has seen for clarification and for the development of this area of the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">It is a long time since psychiatrists referred to the mentally ill as lunatics but the term still exists in the law on criminal insanity. A person arguing that he or she should be excused from liability on a criminal charge by virtue of a mental disorder still has to plead for a special verdict under the Trial of Lunatics Act 1883. It is not surprising that both the Minister and practising lawyers are concerned that this law should be brought up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The new Bill affirms and codifies Irish common law decisions in regard to criminal insanity. It provides a comprehensive treatment, both legally and medically, for those whose mental state may be such that it is impossible for them to participate in a court of law. It also provides a framework for determining a person's fitness to be tried. It introduces the long overdue notion of diminished responsibility and sets up an ongoing review for the need to detain those who have offended while suffering from a mental disorder.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">The kernel of the Bill is the new definition of what constitutes an excusing mental disorder. This is reduced to a single issue defined by the Minister as a mental disorder. Section 1 defines mental disorder as including "mental illness, mental handicap, dementia or any disease of the mind but does not include intoxication". I am delighted it excludes intoxication, which is a state brought on by ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">People have asked our Leader to invite the Minister to discuss the issue of crime. No doubt intoxication will feature largely in that debate. It is one of the worst offences in terms of crime. In cases where people have been kicked to death or near death the perpetrators have generally been intoxicated. In my opinion the use of a boot in an assault is as bad as plunging a knife in someone's chest. We need to examine the law on that and perhaps mandatory sentencing should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">There will be continued argument as to who falls inside or outside the definition of a mental disorder, particularly in the case of personality disorder. No two psychiatrists, prosecutors or lawyers will agree as to whether the definition of personality disorder falls inside the definitions as outlined in section 1. Doctors have been inclined to emphasise the element of treatability in regard to the definition of mental illness. As dementia and mental handicap have now been brought into this Bill, doctors will begin reconsidering the notion of treatability because neither is a treatable condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Under the provision of the 1883 Act, the court is obliged to commit a defendant to the Central Mental Hospital for ongoing assessment until he or she is released by the executive. The Minister mentioned the Gallagher case. Prior to that it was assumed that the courts would decide when a person found insane would be released. The Supreme Court handed down that verdict to the Government and I understand an <i>ad hoc</i> committee now makes the decisions. The problem is that the decisions of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, which is under the Minister's jurisdiction, are not binding on the Executive. I am happy all of that has changed in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The other major change in the Bill is the introduction of verdicts of diminished responsibility. Its omission has meant a serious gap in Irish criminal law, particularly as it applies to murder. In essence, a defendant will now have to show a mental disorder as defined in section 1 but not one so severe as to merit an insanity defence. The defence operates on the presumption that it can reduce a plea from one of murder to one of manslaughter. For many years juries have been faced with a stark decision, whereas this change will allow a more sympathetic view to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The Bill provides that only a jury can decide on diminished responsibility, which is also a good development. Diminished responsibility cannot be put forward as an acceptable plea. I am informed that lawyers who practise in the Central Criminal Court are quite critical of the narrow basis of the insanity verdict as they find it difficult to convince a jury to convict someone on that basis. The Gallagher and O'Donnell cases have made juries nervous because people feel that if they acquit someone on the basis of insanity, he or she may walk free. However, this is not the case. The availability of diminished responsibility will, I believe, mean that many cases where a substantial element of mental disturbance is involved, but is insufficient for an insanity plea, will allow juries treat cases in a more sympathetic and humane way.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The remaining substantial area in the Bill is section 3 regarding fitness to plead, which will now become known as fitness to be tried. It both restates the existing law on the subject and provides for the disposal of people found to be unfit. As previously, either the prosecution or the defence can raise the issue. The person must show the appropriate level of disorder as defined in section 1. They must essentially be unable to participate in any meaningful way in the case against them by reason of their disorder. The determination in this case is made by the judge, which I agree is appropriate. In the event of someone being unfit, the power to commit arises but is optional.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">There is also the possibility for a prosecution to appeal against the judgment of the court. The court may also remand a person in custody for the purpose of assessing them on the need to commit. It is at that time that the review board comes into play. As defined in section 11, the review board has the option of speaking to people who have already given evidence in the case – psychiatrists, consultants, etc. – and I welcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">In light of the time it has taken to bring about these changes, I am satisfied the Minister will not have too much trouble getting them speedily through both Houses of the Oireachtas. Anyone in his or her right mind would push the legislation along because it is long overdue. The diminished responsibility provisions may well produce significant savings and resources if trials are shortened by virtue of agreement by both sides as to the appropriateness of a verdict in a particular case.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I am in complete agreement that our insanity laws are outdated. I congratulate the Minister on bringing us into the 21st century.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_63">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_275">I also welcome the Minister and I warmly welcome the Bill, which is long overdue. It is difficult to understand why a previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform did not bring it forward at an earlier stage, particularly when one reads so much of the good sense in the 1978 Henchy report that was incorporated into the Bill. I am grateful to the Minister for doing so, because it has been shameful to read newspaper reports on some court cases where people were obviously mentally ill and yet were being tried before the courts as though they were not.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">High profile murder cases get most media attention because mandatory sentencing makes it essential that, if appropriate, a plea of insanity be brought forward. However, it is also important in the District Court where there are summary charges against people who are mentally ill. In some cases they may not been taking their tablets or are homeless. If we hear voices it does not matter if we go around the house shouting their owners, but if one is living rough and starts shouting at people in the street one can easily find oneself arrested on a charge of breach of the peace. What these people require is supervision in order to get them back on track. In the past, if one of these people was hungry and stole bread and milk from a shop they would have been in a very serious position. However, the legislation, which is good-hearted in nature, will allow something to be done about such cases. While high profile trials attract most attention, such attention will also be important in the type of cases to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I have some difficulty with one area of the Bill. The last paragraph of the explanatory memorandum dealing with financial implications states that it is not anticipated that the proposals in the Bill will have significant financial or staffing implications but that there will be some extra costs associated with the new mental health review board because of its responsibilities as set out in the Bill. Those responsibilities will be more extensive and onerous than those of the <i>ad hoc</i> advisory committee the board is replacing. However, if the Bill is to be properly implemented, there will be substantial costs involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The type of cases I described are not currently getting sufficient attention within the community. While the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will not have to bear the expense, the Department of Health and Children will be obliged to do so. Despite the vastly increased amounts of money being spent within the health services, the percentage spent on mental health has decreased from 9% some five years ago to 7% at present. Money will have to be spent in this area so that the legislation can be properly brought forward. There are many people who run into trouble with the law due to mental illness because there are insufficient hostels for them and too few community psychiatric nurses or community psychiatrists to deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The Minister said there are medico-legal issues at stake. I can assure him I have been receiving much representation regarding this matter. His contribution helped to explain some of the differences in the definitions of mental disorder in the Bill and in the Mental Health Act 2001. Both the Minister and Senator Kett referred to the issue of personality disorder and its treatability. I attended a meeting of the Irish Penal Reform Trust before Christmas which dealt with the treatability of personality disorders. It was attended by some psychiatrists and psychologists from England who seemed to give some hope on that front. However, the majority of experts say that such people are untreatable and are only disruptive in the institutions in which they are placed.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">Henchy considered personality disorders in varying degrees. For example, mental disorder is described as mental illness or mental handicap but does not include violent personality disorder. Violent personality disorder is defined as a persistent disorder or disability of personality which manifests itself in abnormally violent or aggressive behaviour. The point was made that psychiatrists distinguish between mental disorder and personality disorder and state that the latter, of itself, will not exonerate a person from criminal responsibility if he is shown to have the guilty intent, the <i>mens rea</i> of which he is capable. If his condition is persistently violent, his own safety and the safety of society require that special measures be taken for his custody and care. It was suggested that special institutions be set up for such persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">I know that psychiatrists are very anxious about people being convicted on what they describe as a very nebulous definition. I do not know what we can do about this but it is a very serious issue. Some of my correspondents fear that we will have people pleading that they have a personality disorder to get off on lesser charges. I presume we will be able to discuss this serious issue more widely on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">While I can understand there is a legal problem, I also understand the point of view of psychiatrists. There are people whose conditions may be treatable within a few years. Who would have said 30 years ago that schizophrenia and bi-polar disease would be so well treated now? We must remember that there may be progress in psychiatry which will allow people to be treated in the future. This is certainly an area which we will have to tease out quite a bit.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">There are differences in the definitions of mental disorder in this Bill and the previous Act. The definition in the previous Act comes in after a decision has been made as to whether the person is fit to be tried or if it has been found that he or she is insane. I think I understand this now. It will be a great help to be able to bring this to those who have been in contact with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The Bill will allow a judge to ask for a psychiatric opinion almost immediately, which is very good. It has been suggested to me that the psychiatrist who comes to the court should be someone who is involved in the unit to which the person is to be referred. That seems quite sensible because there is no point in trying to refer people to units where they will not be accepted. It has also been suggested to me – I am particularly talking about summary offences – that perhaps people do not have to be sent to an in-patient centre. By the time a person has appeared in court he or she is probably back on tablets and much better with the result that admission to an institution, even for a few days, would be counter-productive. It might be possible to consider this. It frequently happens that someone recovers rapidly and the police and courts have been good in dealing with such individuals. We might consider this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">Concern has been expressed at the fact that section 13 allows for a conditional discharge of a patient by the psychiatric review board. However, the patient is not obliged to continue treatment. Should the legislation not require patients to agree to be supervised when they leave hospital? Otherwise there might be a recurrence of the original problem. This difficulty presents itself even in civil cases where people are not obliged to accept treatment, even if they have been running into trouble because of not accepting treatment or taking medication.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">A plea of irresistible impulse has been in place for a long time. There is no accord between psychiatrists and the legal profession about this and there is a constant fear that some people will claim irresistible impulse in situations such as paedophilia, for example. This problem will have to be examined carefully on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">The diminished responsibility provision is to be much welcomed. This will refer to a person who is short of being defined as insane under the various provisions we have had in place but who has an abnormality of the mind. In the United Kingdom the definition of diminished responsibility is much larger than that considered in the Bill. Those who have had accidents resulting in brain injuries, for example, can be deemed to suffer from diminished responsibility. Perhaps we could look at the British legislation and see how it could apply here. Diminished responsibility also appears to be an acceptable plea to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the United Kingdom, which will not be the case here. Perhaps we could consider this also. The courts should be permitted to reduce a murder charge to one of manslaughter. However, it is important that we include all those we really mean to include. That is the reason I say it might be as well to look at the whole United Kingdom legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">With regard to the mental health review board, I was more taken by the review board suggested in the Henchy report which recommended that there be two psychiatrists on the board. That would be well worthwhile. There would have to be a psychiatrist at any meeting of the board where a case was being assessed. The Bill should also state what a quorum of the board is to be. I could not find this in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">Could some part of the implementation of the Bill be taken over by the Mental Health Commission and could we have tribunals for the people concerned? Could we marry the Mental Health Act more closely with this legislation? The Minister may have extremely good reasons for not doing this but I wonder if it could be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Could the Bill not be used to do something about the mechanism for the transfer of patients from prisons, particularly to the Central Mental Hospital? I am delighted the Minister has said he wants to see people out of padded cells in prisons and into the Central Mental Hospital or other suitable psychiatric hospitals. We must do something to get psychiatric hospitals to take back non-violent individuals who come from their areas and are in the Central Mental Hospital. Many of them suffer from conditions such as burnt out schizophrenia and are not a danger to the population. Psychiatric hospitals will have to take responsibility for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">I totally support the hopes of the Central Mental Hospital to have the place completely refurbished. I am delighted that the Minister for Health and Children and his Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, are in the hospital this very day. When the Minister of State was in this House, he promised me that he would visit the Central Mental Hospital because the hospital had told me I was the only politician who had been there in decades. I had asked the Minister of State to go and look at the hospital because it was truly appalling. He was as good as his word and brought the Minister for Health and Children with him. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will also go and see it. Seriously ill persons are sleeping on concrete plinths and slopping out in a part of the prison built in 1852. There is a preservation order on the building but not because of its great beauty.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_293">Could a provision also be included in the Bill for a change to the relevant ministerial order? The most commonly used legislation under which prisoners are transferred is the Central Lunatic Asylum (Ireland) Act 1845. Four other pieces of legislation are used, the most recent of which dates from 1912. Perhaps we could add this matter to the Bill. Some of those affected by this procedure are on remand and have not even been convicted. It is very unfair that the psychiatric services are having to deal with such antiquated legislation when we could do something about it. Matters may improve because the psychiatic training programme now involves registrars going to the Central Mental Hospital. Therefore, they will, at least, get a better idea of forensic psychiatry and may take more people back under their care, realising that not everyone in the Central Mental Hospital is dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I am delighted with the Bill and I am really looking forward to Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_66">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_295">I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister and congratulating him, yet again, on bringing forward legislation. The amount of legislation the Minister has before both Houses is a reflection of his commitment to his new position. When one hears we are amending and repealing laws going back some time, and this legislation has been around since 1978, it is of some concern that we have waited so long to modernise an area that clearly is in need of modernisation. When one considers the whole area of mental health and the improvements that have been made in diagnosis and in treatment, it is right and fitting that such treatments, such diagnosis and such new expertise be brought into line with the judicial and legal process.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">If the Bill is ever tested I hope the Minister will not suffer the same fate as Sir Robert Peel and that we will be able to test it in the Houses rather than in that manner. The Bill takes into account the overlap between the criminal justice elements and the need to have regard to the treatment aspects of mental health legislation, particularly concerning the matters which the court must take into account when considering the options available to it in determining fitness or unfitness to be tried. The Minister has outlined to the House the new process.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">Without going into the legal definitions, I wish to refer to the whole area of assessment. To make this a success we have to ensure that whatever legal process is in place will be workable with the medical profession and, in particular, psychiatrists who will have to formulate assessments. That is one area where there may be conflicting views by some of the medical people. It would be a shame if this Bill failed to work in certain areas because of professional differences between lawyers and medical experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">Senator Henry referred to the person treating the patient. One has to consider the interests of the person treating a mentally ill patient from a medical perspective as opposed to a person assessing a patient from a legal perspective and the scope for a conflict of interest. It is important to maintain independence in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">In an effort to educate myself in this area when I am neither a medical nor a legal expert, I came across a ruling in the third district court of appeal in Sacramento, which upheld a judge's right to order mental health experts to videotape their face-to-face evaluations of criminal defendants. The judge went on to say that psychiatrists are not oracles to whom courts submit questions and then retire to await their divine pronouncements. It was an interesting ruling and, apparently, it is still ongoing in the US. The judge is now insisting that the interviews between the patient and the assessor be videotaped and presented to court. It is being appealed to the various courts. It is of interest to us, as we are bringing forward this new Bill, regarding the access the courts or a judge may have in making a decision on the assessment that took place and how that assessment was reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I compliment the Minister. I look forward to the teasing out of the Bill on Committee Stage. I hope it can be brought to a workable conclusion by ensuring the medical and legal professions will not come into conflict on the merits of the Bill. There is no doubt there was a great need to modernise and bring forward legislation in line with new medical and legal thinking. There are many other legislative areas where we should do this also.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I avail of the opportunity to highlight the need to modernise the whole area of mental health, not only in the legal area but in the treatment and provision of the necessary facilities and services. I join Senator Henry in congratulating the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy O'Malley, who made a commitment here recently to visit the Central Mental Hospital, and who has approached his ministry in a serious and committed manner. I hope the Government can give him the resources he needs to bring about the changes required in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_303">I thank the Minister for his Second Stage contribution. I agree with him that the Bill which is long-awaited is badly needed. Much of relates to a 1978 report. I welcome broadly the provisions to address the limits in the present law. It is important to modernise the legislation. I welcome the fitness to be tried provision and, in particular, the "not guilty, by reason of insanity" verdict to replace "guilty but insane", and also the new provision for diminished responsibility. It is important that judges are not left in a position where they have to send a defendant to an inappropriate place because of limitations in the law. There are examples of where the judges' options are limited as regards defendants and they are actually sending them to inappropriate centres of detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">I welcome sections 6 and 7. The appeal provisions are welcome. That the new mental health review board will be independent is also welcome. The whole area of criminal insanity law needs to be addressed more comprehensively than in this Bill. The Bill still leaves on the Statute Bill legislation from the 19th century, including the Lunacy (Ireland) Act 1821, the provisions of which are merely repealed. There is a need to update insanity law, both criminal and civil, in a comprehensive way. Nonetheless, the Bill is welcome in that it modernises the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">When in Government, the Labour Party introduced legislation on the civil side dealing with the power of attorney, which was also important in this area. We need to look at our civil legislation as many of the procedures are unsatisfactory and the gap needs to be addressed speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">As mentioned by other Senators, the Minister for Health and Children has failed to implement the Mental Health Act 2001. That we are still operating under the 1945 Act is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I welcome the Bill. We will seek to assist the Minister with amendments on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_308">I too welcome the Minister to the House. As I have said on many occasions, he is willing to come to the House. We look forward to the question and answer session on the general issue of crime and its proliferation. Like a previous speaker, I do not have any expertise in medicine or legal affairs but I am interested in the Bill, because I am always interested in legislation which updates, albeit after a lengthy period, and brings together legislation of an earlier period.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The Minister said the main purpose of the legislation is to clarify, modernise and reform the law on criminal insanity and fitness to be tried and to bring it into line with the jurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights. On this morning's Order of Business, I was asked about the Human Rights Bill. I will be well versed tomorrow and I will be able to say it is at Committee Stage in the other House. I hope the Bill will pass speedily through the Dáil to enable it to be brought before this House. We are behind in terms of its introduction, particularly in light of our commitments under the Good Friday Agreement. Its delay should not be seen as being due to a lack of enthusiasm for the bringing forward of the Bill; it is a complex area which requires much debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">While I do not have medical or legal expertise, I have reasonable expertise in history although, of course, everybody is an historian in their own right. I was interested to see for how long we have governed these activities in criminal law. It is amazing to think that many of the judgments and provisions date back to the 1800s and even to the 13th century. Clearly, there has always been a need in society for justice to be administered according to the norms and tenets of the time. Working a modern system against the background of the 13th and 18th centuries shows the gradual approach to criminal activity. No matter how advanced a country is in terms of infrastructure, commercial and social activity or financial obligations, the wheels, as the Minister said, grind slowly.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">In the case of justice, it may well be correct that the mills grind slowly. Who wants to rush to judgment in making fundamental changes? I do not know whether the esteemed Justice Henchy, when he produced his report in 1978, envisaged that it would take 25 years to bring this matter before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is not to say there have not been changes in other areas of the legal system. These changes, however, are fundamental and, as such, deserve considerable scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I am pleased that our spokesman, Senator Kett, has devoted much attention to this Bill, as have other speakers. We are all appreciative of Senator Henry in matters such as this because she brings a common sense approach to the issue, combined with her medical knowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">I wish to focus on two new concepts – first, diminished responsibility and, second, fitness to be tried as distinct from fitness to plead. The concept of diminished responsibility has enormous potential in the administration of justice in a court. The jury system will apply in such cases. The good men and true and the good women and true who will make a judgment on a case put forward by the experts in the court and on the plea of diminished responsibility face a huge responsibility. A plea of diminished responsibility is a call for careful consideration of the penalty imposed, which may be up to life if the case involves manslaughter. The jury's consideration will be based on professional reports brought before the court, the legal expertise of those making the case and those who are defending it.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I have often wondered about the jury system. I was never called to do jury service because I was in public life and could not be called. It is based on the practical application of common sense whereby one is tried by one's fellow citizens who will make a decision. I have also often wondered about the training of jurors and whether they should have knowledge of a subject. That takes away the spontaneity of the act of citizenship on being called to administer justice for one's country and the other citizens of the land. It is a huge responsibility to do jury service and to administer justice to a fellow citizen. Perhaps we do not think about that often enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The plea of diminished responsibility will bring a sort of graduated approach to the passing of a sentence. I am sure that will bring with it the need for precision in a judgment which can sometimes be difficult to ascertain and to articulate. Precision is not often a feature of judgments, although one can apply the norm, the precedent or otherwise in such cases. We have had much debate on that recently in that people want norms to be imposed. That is quite ridiculous because one submits oneself to a judge who is unique. The judge makes a decision based on his or her knowledge and on the evidence before them. One cannot have judges all over the land giving judgment by bobbing their heads like black babies on a box who bob when offerings are put into it. That defeats the whole purpose. One is not allowed to refer to black babies nowadays. We cannot have regularity of judgments, although people often look for that. The plea of diminished responsibility will require considerable intellectual ability on the part of all concerned in terms of a decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I agree with the closing remarks of the Minister in that in all things legal and judicial, it is a matter of balance. This Bill is an important step in the development of statutory rules and guidelines in a difficult and complex area. As does most criminal legislation, it strives to achieve a balance between two opposing objectives. On the one hand, in common with all criminal law, it seeks to protect society at large. We are all prey to whatever criminal activity is taking place around us. There is much worry and concern about the random nature of criminal activity in terms of where it can strike, what it can do, the fear it can induce and the acts which can follow from it. On the other hand, the Bill seeks to protect members of our society who suffer from mental disorder so that they will not be answerable for crimes where they have not got the mental capacity to commit those crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">There will be periodic review of the cases of those detained. I strongly approve of that because an independent review body, which can return at periodic intervals to review a case, is hugely important in cases such as this. I am sure the teasing out of the Bill on Committee Stage will be enormously productive. This has been an interesting debate and I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward the legislation, even if it has taken so long to do so.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_70">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_319">The Leader's enforced brevity causes me a somewhat of a problem because I did not realise the debate was so well advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Great credit is due for even attempting to deal with this issue because I believe a satisfactory resolution is not possible, it is a case of just making one's best guess. I must declare that I am married to a psychiatrist, therefore, my judgment on many issues relating to psychiatry and incarceration, whether in a psychiatric hospital or prison, is influenced by someone else's considerable experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">We must avoid transferring social problems to the medical profession because this is not a solution. I suspect the law has elaborated well on the Roman Catholic moral distinction between an evil act and guilt. Whatever one thinks about the church as an institution, the thought processes by which it worked out positions is often awesomely impressive. The distinction between guilt of the individual and the wrongness of the act is well worth considering. It is easier for a moral theologian, however, to make that distinction in terms of theology than it is for the law to put it into practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Given the time I spent with the Simon Community, I would have serious reservations about the culpability of 90% of the people I knew there. Issues of culpability arise also in the case of someone who is suffering from multiple deprivations, was brought up in institutions and who, almost with shocking inevitably, ends up with a dependence on alcohol. That was mostly the substance involved in my time with the Simon Community, but it has probably moved on to more exotic mind-altering substances. These issues go well beyond the scope of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">In terms of the way the law deals with crime, there are people who appear in droves before the courts who never had a chance. I refer here to people who come from a particular type of background which involved multiple forms of deprivation. These individuals never had any stability in their lives. Psychiatrists take great exception when society decides the psychiatric service should look after these people and others take great exception if they end up in prison. I say this by way of being in a dilemma, because I do not believe anyone has a unique magic wand.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">In terms of the rhetoric we sometimes use about crime, we should reflect on the fact that some of the people about whom we use the rhetoric are, in many ways, as much victims as are the victims of their crimes. That is not to justify or attempt to minimise anything they might do. Most of the people I knew in the Simon Community were a nuisance to society, but they were the least troublesome. The people I knew only ever murdered others in Simon as a result of rows that erupted among themselves. By the time I met these people, they were incapable of hurting anyone else because most of them were damaged physically. However, they were capable of hurting each other because they were all quite vulnerable. Some people were killed, others were charged with murder and, almost inevitably, found not guilty and, at worst, they were convicted of manslaughter.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">We must be extremely careful because, in cases of murder, in particular, there are victims. I do not want to go into individual cases, but there was a spectacular case recently in which two people were murdered. The family of the victims felt extremely let down when someone who was pronounced insane made what seemed to people outside the system a miraculous recovery. It was almost as wonderful as the recovery from Alzheimer's disease of the one-time chief executive of Guinness in the United Kingdom. As far as I am aware, this is the only known case of someone being cured of Alzheimer's disease. I say this in defence of the medical profession, in spite of what I have just said. What else can I do but defend the medical profession? I am not in a position to do anything else.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_72">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_327">That is precisely what I am saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">As the Minister will be aware, I would be more than capable of blaming him if I thought he was responsible. However, the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, is not an institution of which we can be proud. The people who work there are exceptional professionals. I know some of the psychiatrists who work there and they are extraordinarily good professionals. However, as many of those who work there – including many of the inspectors of mental hospitals – have stated it is an old building. We should consider replacing or completely renovating the hospital. Members will agree that anyone who ends up in Dundrum by reason of being found unfit to plead, of being insane or of having diminished responsibility, is not a guilty person. The degree of their guilt should not be reflected in the primitive conditions under which people must operate in Dundrum. The corollary of the legislation is the onus on society. By society I mean a succession of Governments that have left Dundrum in place, because, to a large extent, it is invisible to society.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The second issue I would like the Minister to address is whether we are liable to end up with people who can manage to get a different verdict because they can afford to pay for the very best psychiatric opinions, including employing international experts. I would be concerned about this aspect, given that psychiatry, by its nature, is not a precise science. I presume this happens in many other areas. The Supreme Court decision today which overturns the procedures on drink driving had much to do with people's ability to employ clever lawyers. Without a doubt, people were able to employ good lawyers and it is the job of such lawyers to win cases. I am sure the Minister knows something about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">I welcome the Bill. Given that the Minister is responsible for dealing with crime and its many manifestations in society and in light of the fact that political pressure from all sides, including that exerted by me, will become greater, I believe various aspects of crime and the criminal law need to be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">I am always astonished, when a person is convicted of an awful offence, to see a succession of people appear before the court to say he or she comes from a good family. Somebody who comes from a good family is more deserving of punishment than somebody from a bad family. The idea that people will advise the judge not to send a person to jail because he or she comes from a good family is a contradictory one. People from such families have less reason to expect sympathy. Those who come from backgrounds that gave them no hope and no chance deserve to be given positive references. Society will have to examine the idea of diminished responsibility in cases where people, quite visibly, never had a chance and in cases where there is a medical consensus that the person involved suffers from insanity.</p>

I am glad that he mentioned the victims of crime near the end of his contribution as his comments when in full flight reminded me of the modern version of the parable of the good Samaritan. In the modern version two social workers on the road from Jerusalem to Jericho got off their horses because they saw a man in the ditch.

          <p eId="para_338">Their ideas were almost right and lasted for a long time. Like Senator Ryan, I think it is a shame that we are updating Victorian law but not the Victorian edifices in which people are required to carry out treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Senators Ryan and Kett touched on an important point. I would be happier if the Mental Health Act 2001 had been fully implemented after we dealt with it, although I appreciate that it is not fully the responsibility of the Minister's Department. The treatment received by people after they have been assessed is hugely important, as is the work of the Mental Health Commission. There is a real danger that certain people could as easily end up in either a mental hospital, a prison or the gutter. It is almost a lottery. Different professional groups and agencies solve their problems by defining people in different ways. An effort should be made to remove limbo in the system where people can be placed because they are deemed untreatable. As Senator Ryan said, this is a grey area and there is no perfect solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The categories suggested in the Bill are very sensible and many Senators will want to discuss them on Committee Stage. The Bill is highly commendable as it represents a large advance in the certainty of the law. It is important that provision is made for diminished responsibility. I agree with Senator Henry's suggestion that we consider providing for incapacity or diminished responsibility through brain damage or neurological problems. I am glad to see that the Minister has excluded alcohol as a factor in determining diminished responsibility and, like other Senators, would include drugs also. Perhaps a distinction can be made for drugs which are self-administered. We are all concerned about those who choose to get high and use this as an excuse for their misbehaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Senator Henry mentioned that the Bill concentrated on in-patient treatment, about which she expressed her concerns. It might be sensible to think in terms of day treatment, given the state of modern psychiatric medicine. In the case of a person released conditionally, the relevant conditions should include the acceptance of a treatment regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I agree with Senator Henry that there should be two psychiatrists on the review board in order that a decision on the state of a patient cannot be made during a meeting in which a consultant psychiatrist is not a participant. It is important to stress the independence of the tribunal established by the Minister, although he was required to do so and make it manifest by the European convention. There are always difficulties when other groups control expenditure and funding. Patrick Kavanagh wrote of "a lonely lecher whom the fates by a financial trick castrate". Departments and treasuries have a great capacity for frustrating the activities of watchdog bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">I do not agree with Senator Henry in so far as I do not think it is a good idea to combine the Mental Health Commission and the tribunal as they have two quite distinct functions. One makes specific decisions and the other ensures there is quality control. We should be reluctant, except in an emergency and as a temporary expedient, to designate part of a prison as a treatment centre. Our objective should be to remove these matters from the prison environment. I notice that the Bill allows temporary movements to be made without having to return to the tribunal. That is sensible. The tribunal will be reviewing cases on a rolling basis. I presume that it will pick up on all cases. We should avoid the possibility that somebody could move around the system ahead of the posse.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The Bill represents a great advance on existing legislation and I thank the Minister for bringing it forward. I am sure it will have the full support of the Seanad. I look forward to further discussion of it on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_345">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. I am pleased to speak on Second Stage of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002. It would be an understatement to say it represents a step forward as it is comparable to jumping the Grand Canyon. While I acknowledge the great impact of the Mental Treatment Act 1945 in the delivery of psychiatric services, it had shortcomings in many respects. Given the circumstances that this Bill attempts to address, it is difficult to give a textbook example of what we are talking about. A number of things will naturally come to the fore such as the rights of the individual, the rights of this Legislature and its obligations to society, and the rights of individuals who may have committed the most heinous crimes, albeit that they may be deemed insane or not responsible for their actions. Nevertheless, we must recognise the position of the victim.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The purpose of the Bill is to clarify, modernise and reform the law on criminal insanity and fitness to be tried, and on related issues. I regret that it has been said that the psychiatric services are the Cinderella services – that is partly true but not totally so. The Bill will also bring into line the jurisprudence of the European Convention on Human Rights which will soon be given further effect in domestic law in accordance with the provisions of the European Convention on the Human Rights Bill 2001. At present, the convention is law for Ireland on the international plane but it is not part of domestic law in Ireland, which is a nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">The Bill provides for extensive new provisions dealing with fitness to be tried, which term will now apply rather than fitness to plead. The Bill also provides for new rules regarding appeals against such findings, a statutory definition and restatement of the text for criminal insanity based on the existing rules at common law as developed in Ireland. A new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity will replace the existing guilty but insane, and there is a new plea of guilty but with diminished responsibility in the case of murder.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Bill implements certain recommendations made in the third interim report of the inter-departmental committee on mentally ill and maladjusted persons, the Henchy committee – referred to by Senator Henry and others – which was published in 1978. The Bill accommodates criminal justice elements and the need to have regard to the treatment aspect of mental health legislation. At present, if there is any question arising as to the competence or fitness of an accused person to be tried – this is the core of the Bill and makes a nonsense of what existed heretofore – the Lunacy (Ireland) Act 1821 applies, despite there being no definition of fitness. This addresses that anomaly. As Senator Kett said, applying a Bill from the Dark Ages in 2003 is not to be countenanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">Planning for the Future of the Psychiatric Service, A Policy Document, brought forward the concept of psychiatric patients or people suffering from psychiatric illnesses and the concept of devolving the service into the community. It must be acknowledged that major resources have been moved into that area and, though much remains to be done, a lot has been done to date. I compliment Senator Henry who made a very practical reference to people who find themselves in various situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">While devolving services from institutions or hospitals to the community, it must be recognised that greater resources are needed. While it would not be fair to refer to the Minister for Health in the mid-1980s as he is no longer in public life, it was said then that community service was a better and cheaper option. An eminent health economist from the University of York, Professor Alan Maynard, in giving a lecture at a conference I attended, said that hospital services were cheaper, contrary to the views of the then Minister and his advisers. Hospital services are cheaper but they do not provide the best service. If optimum service is wanted, it must be paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">With regard to what has been said about those who find themselves in different conditions and predicaments in the community, those people have not been given the benefit of appropriate resources devolved to community level. I am talking of community psychiatric nurses who visit patients in community residences and those who have gone a step beyond that and have been discharged into the home. It is well known that psychiatric patients often believe that medication will make them worse. Because they are feeling well, they do not feel they should take their medication. They do not appreciate that they are feeling well because they are taking the medication. They have all sorts of problems and find themselves on the wrong side of the law and availing of the services that Senator Ryan would have been associated with over the years. Many situations must be taken into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">A ridiculous situation evolved in the mid-1980s when a number of centres were discontinued and a number of psychiatric nursing schools closed. I have to compliment my area health board and if I am being political, I am only doing so because it is fair. Deputy Cowen, when Minister for Health and Children some years ago, gave the Midlands Health Board the funding to set up a college of nursing. I am thankful that there is a third level institution in the Leader's town, Athlone, which is linked to that. I am pleased that psychiatric nurse training has recommenced in the Midlands Health Board area and, as chairman of the board, I was pleased to welcome 30 new students to St. Fintan's Hospital and St. Loman's Hospital where they will receive their practical training. Their academic training will be provided in the Athlone Institute of Technology and at the College of Nursing, Tullamore. A range of factors have contributed to this development and the Minister is to be congratulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">To pick up on a point made by Senator Maurice Hayes, the victim is a central figure in this legislation as well as the perpetrator of the act. Victims will benefit from the legislation because they will get a fair crack of the whip. I worked in the area of psychiatry for many years and know that even long stay patients are reviewed on a regular basis. There is a six month review but I assure the House that patients are reviewed more regularly and that was the case in the hospital in which I worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I will conclude by referring to what has been said about the Central Mental Hospital and other hospitals. Many, if not all, are listed buildings and beautiful in an architectural context, but it stops there. They have no relevance to modern psychiatry, were not built for the treatment of patients and do not have the facilities or requisite physical features. They should be closed down.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">I am pleased that the Midlands Health Board has completed a new acute psychiatric unit at St. Fintan's Hospital, Portlaoise, and I thank the Government for providing the funding. In addition, a new 36 bed unit will be provided at the regional hospital in Mullingar. I am also pleased that there is a department of later life psychiatry and that the new phase 2B will contain a department of adolescent psychiatry.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">I may propose amendments on Committee Stage and also communicate recommendations to the Minister who is to be commended for this legislation. Where clinical directors or consultants responsible for the mental welfare of those who commit serious crime deem, after observation, that they are fit to plead relevant to the crime they have committed, they may do so. I have dealt with many such people and, regrettably, many did not receive justice. The relatives of their victims were of the same view. The Minister is to be commended for addressing this aspect and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_81">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_357">I thank Senators for what has been a thoughtful debate. Every contribution was well thought through and has given me pause to reflect on what is contained in the Bill. The fact that it has been a long time in gestation should not be a reason for not getting it right and making improvements if needed at this late stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the delays in implementing the Mental Health Act. While that is a matter for the Minister for Health and Children, I was anxious that this Bill should not become entangled in that process. It is 25 years since Mr. Justice Henchy wrote his first report on the subject and although they have much in common, the Bill is not identical to what he then proposed. Nevertheless, it would be unforgivable to allow another ministerial term of office to elapse without addressing the issues raised in the Bill. If difficulties arise with the implementation of the Mental Health Act, they should not be used as an excuse for not proceeding with this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">This must be common sense legislation that can be understood by all. It may not approximate to how psychiatrists would write their ideal law. That is not the issue because, for better or worse, we do not give them the function of writing our laws. Psychiatry is an evolving science and the professionals involved in it hold different views of the human beings with whom they deal. They also hold different theories and views on the material at their disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Criminal law of the kind contained in the Bill must be robust enough to be used in the courts on a daily basis, from the District Court to the Supreme Court. It must be something that jurors understand and categorise matters in ways that will be understood by those who administer justice. Perhaps even more importantly, it must be understood by the public. It must be clear enough to enable members of the public have faith in it. If it was to be rendered an incomprehensible muddle by the use of qualifications and evasions to accommodate all possible psychiatric or psychological theories, it would amount to unworkable law. In view of this I compliment the Parliamentary Counsel because, subject to later amendments by the Oireachtas, this is rigorous and clear legislation. While that does not mean it cannot be improved, it is admirably drafted because it is easy to understand and follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Mr. Justice Henchy was a fine jurist. He was probably one of the best, if not the best mind to sit on the Supreme Court. I apologise to him that 25 years after he commenced work in this area, the relevant legislation is only beginning its passage through the Oireachtas. I will reflect on many of the points made, especially those by Senator Henry, on how the Bill might be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Senator Terry expressed concern that the use of the term intoxication might imply intoxication by alcohol only. That would be unfortunate because the Parliamentary Counsel was concerned to also provide for intoxication by other drugs. That can be made clear. On a related aspect, Senator Maurice Hayes wondered if it would be legitimate for the legislation to take account of cases where a victim was given a date rape drug or similar concoction. We will have to give this serious consideration before Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The Bill does not encompass the issue of diminished responsibility for homicide dealt with in the legislation on infanticide. If they consult that legislation, the women Members of the House will be surprised to find that it effectively provides for a manslaughter rather than a murder conviction for a mother who kills her child. The excusing circumstance provided for is that the balance of the woman's mind was affected by the process of lactation. I understand the legislation was enacted in 1949. Even so, it is surprising that this was accepted as the psychiatric orthodoxy of the time. It may need to be looked at because there could be situations involving older children who would not come within the remit of the legislation. In such circumstances mothers suffering from aggravated depression might seek to avail of the relevant provisions of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I take Senator Ryan's point regarding those at the bottom of the ladder such as those cared for by the Simon Community and others. Since nobody is above the law, nobody is beneath it. The law must be fair and humane to people in such circumstances and should not simply regard them as problems. However, at the same time the scales of justice must be held evenly because families of victims suddenly deprived of their loved ones cannot be told it was due to a medical mishap. They need justice to be administered from their perspective in a full and comprehensive manner. We should not forget this.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Senator O'Rourke referred to the jury system, of which I am passionately in favour. The Senator wondered about the kind of training available to members of juries who bring to their task a common sense approach derived from their life experiences. The jury system is not a hangover of medieval English law. The great strength of the common law system, on which our system is founded, is that it is based on arbitration between the individual and the State in which both are equal.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The civil law system is deficient in that the State apparatus acts as an investigator and the scales are not held evenly. The strength of the common law system, of which the jury represents the high point, is that the State brings its case against an accused person and puts it to 12 people who have no vested interest at all, save for the vested interest of a citizen in upholding the law. Both State and the accused are regarded as equals before the court. We must do everything not only to preserve this system but to strengthen it.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">There are many threats to trial by jury, not least from the European direction in the case of the <i>corpus juris</i> project. We have to be very careful to protect our system. We share in the common law heritage whether we like it or not. Our system has been more robust and strong in combating tyranny than any civil law system ever, and 200 years of common law have shown that it is inherently more fair and durable than its counterpart. All the great tyrannies of the world have popped up in the civil law system. I often point that out to people who get impatient with our system, which is not all that bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Senator Ryan raised the question of the Catholic distinction between the guilty act and the guilty mind. We were taught the Latin phrase "<i>Actus non reum facit, nisi mens sit rea</i>” in law school, which means that the act does not make one guilty unless one's mind is guilty. This is an important distinction. Many people are now pressing for things to be done in respect of corporate manslaughter, for example, and pressing for our courts to be made into areas of social theatre where the guilty mind is not relevant. The principle that the existence of a victim requires the prosecution of a perpetrator is not at the heart of our system, and I sometimes think we ignore that at our peril.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">Senator Henry raised the issue of the District Court, where many of the relevant issues arise. As she spoke, I was reminded of a particular case presided over by a female district judge. I was engaged in another case, but was watching what happened in hers one lazy afternoon in the Bridewell in Dublin. A woman was being prosecuted for shoplifting who was clearly suffering from depression. There were tears coming from her eyes and she looked catatonic. I was wondering what would happen and I was very impressed when the judge said she was stopping the case immediately. The garda involved said he had found tablets in the woman's possession and the judge said, "I am taking money from the poor box and directing that the woman be given a taxi home. As to things in her shopping bag, I think she needs them more than the store."</p>

        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_86">
          <from>Ms O'Meara</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_376">I move:</p>
          <p eId="para_377">That Seanad Éireann, recognising that Ireland has one of the highest death rates from breast cancer in Europe, condemns the failure to extend the operation of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, nationwide, as promised by the Government; and calls on the Government immediately to commit the funding necessary to ensure that women all over the country have access to free, regular breast screening in their own area within two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">While it pleases me to move this motion and ask the House for its support, the issue under consideration is a matter of life and death. BreastCheck must extend urgently the national breast screening programme to women everywhere. Ireland has a very high mortality rate from breast cancer, which causes the death 650 women each year. An organised screening programme, such as the BreastCheck programme, can reduce the number of deaths by 20% to 30% among targeted groups. BreastCheck targets women in the 50 to 65 age group.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I congratulate the staff of BreastCheck on the excellent work they have done so far to produce a high quality screening programme run by the best of personnel. It is an excellent programme which provides very good feedback to those who avail of it. Last year, BreastCheck was commended for having one of the best such screening programmes in Europe. That is why everyone wants to benefit from it and it is also the reason everybody should have access to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I will cite some other figures for the benefit of the Minister, although I am sure he is already aware of them. Up to September 2002, BreastCheck had detected 634 early cancers and last year 30 early cancers per month were being detected by the programme. This represents a detection rate of 8.9 per 1,000 women screened, aged from 50 to 64.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I have held discussions with the BreastCheck organisation about rolling out the screening programme. In the context of those discussions we extrapolated figures showing that there are currently 45 undetected early cancers among the female population of north Tipperary aged beteen 50 and 64. The figure could possibly be higher because north Tipperary has one of the highest rates of breast cancer in the mid-west region and nationally. The failure to extend the breast screening programme has implications on that scale for that area alone. At the moment, therefore, there are 45 women in north Tipperary who have breast cancer but are unaware of it. The only way they will find out is if they are screened for early cancer diagnosis by a programme like BreastCheck. Indeed, it is the only programme that could detect such early cancers.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Last week's announcement that the programme is to be extended to a small number of additional counties caused widespread disappointment. Advertising and the feedback from the programme have created an expectation among women that not only are they entitled to such screening but that they will have it soon. The reality is very different, however. I have a simple question for the Minister – why is the programme not being extended?</p>
          <p eId="para_383">From my discussions with BreastCheck I am aware that problems have arisen over the recruitment of radiographers and other specialist staff specifically for this programme. I appreciate that certain infrastructure is needed, as well as trained specialist staff. Despite that, however, the BreastCheck organisation has done the necessary groundwork and it could roll out its programme to the southern and western areas within 22 months of receipt of the required funding. Any delay in providing that funding means an inevitable delay in delivering the service to those who need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I estimate that women in north Tipperary and other areas will have to wait for many years before they can avail of such a screening programme, even though for many of them it could prove to be the difference between life and death. Is lack of money the reason? We can only assume that it is. Let us examine the costs. According to figures supplied as recently as last week to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, by the chief executive of BreastCheck, Mr. Tony O'Brien, the capital cost of extending the programme would be €13 million, rising to €21 million. That cost is not excessive, considering the excellent quality of the service and the implications of its availability for reducing deaths from breast cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Let us examine the matter from a comparative point of view. How much are we currently spending on the national roads programme? I am not saying such spending should be reduced, but it runs into billions. I understand we are spending €60 million a year on animal disease eradication. Can we not afford €21 million to save the lives of women across the country? It seems that we either cannot or will not do so. I want to know who is responsible for that decision. Is it the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister for Finance? The women of Ireland demand to know who is behind this.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I want to discuss briefly the implications for people in areas where breast cancer screening services are not available. Last autumn, it emerged that the mammography unit at Nenagh General Hospital in north Tipperary was not being replaced by the Mid-Western Health Board, although this news did not come as a big surprise. There had been a breast and smear clinic in the hospital which was staffed entirely by female nurses. It was a popular local clinic run on an out-patient basis and it had a high reputation in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The smear clinic closed down following the establishment of the national cervical smear testing programme. I commend that national programme and, as such programmes go, it is far easier to implement than the breast screening programme. There was much anger in the community, however, when it emerged that the mammography machine was not to be replaced. I had rarely experienced such a reaction to any issue in my work as a public representative.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">In response, I organised a public meeting which was attended by a large number of women from the area. My colleague, Senator Noel Coonan, was present and he would probably agree that it was a very emotional event. Anger was expressed by those women who felt that issues affecting their personal health and that of their families were not being recognised or acknowledged. Arising from that meeting there was a demand for action. While it is understandable that the operation of a mammography unit in a hospital such as Nenagh General Hospital demands resources which might not be available at present, people could not understand why the services at Limerick Regional Hospital could not be linked to Nenagh by way of an outreach centre from the breast clinic and cancer centre in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Following the meeting, we received an invitation from Limerick Regional Hospital to look at the cancer centre there, which is a symptomatic cancer treatment unit. We travelled to examine the unit which is impressive. Given its current staffing levels, it is very good. However, as has been pointed out quite rightly, women can only get access to that clinic if they are showing symptoms of breast cancer. In other words, it is no longer possible to obtain a routine mammogram in the north Tipperary area.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Interestingly, while it was decided not to replace the mammography machine at Nenagh General Hospital, it was decided last year to replace the mammography machine at Ennis General Hospital which, as the Minister knows, is in the same health board area. I have received two conflicting reports as to the reasons behind that decision. Perhaps the Minister would like to clarify this matter. One reason is that a directive was sent last year by the Minister to the health board to replace the machine at Ennis General Hospital. If that is the case, we in north Tipperary cannot understand why the machine in Nenagh hospital was not replaced. Ennis General Hospital is similar in status to Nenagh, although the population may be slightly higher. The reasons we were given for the non-replacement of the machine in Nenagh would appear to apply to Ennis also. There seems to be an inconsistency in the approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Routine mammograms are not now available at the hospitals in question. Women with a family history of breast cancer and whose sisters have died from the disease have been refused a mammogram at Limerick Regional Hospital because they were not considered to be at risk or did not have signs or symptoms of cancer. Naturally, this has been the cause of much anger and outrage. Such behaviour is not acceptable is not acceptable. The failure to extend the breast screening programme means that a woman with concerns about her health cannot have them assuaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I reiterate my case by saying that this is a matter of life and death. Lives are being saved thanks to the BreastCheck screening programme, where it is in operation. The women of Ireland cannot see what is preventing the extension of the programme. The Minister needs to make a decision now, particularly in view of the fact that it will take a minimum of 22 months to roll out the programme. He needs to find the money to extend the BreastCheck programme nationwide. Many lives will be saved as a result.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_393">I second the motion. It is sad when the Upper House of the national Parliament has to debate an issue of this magnitude. The failure to extend the BreastCheck service nationwide, as per the commitments given at different stages by various Ministers, is a shocking indictment of how money is being expended by the Government. I am not being flippant about expenditure in essential areas, but the Government places greater emphasis on animal health than it does on women's health.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">The Book of Estimates for 2003 states that €60 million will be spent on the eradication of bovine TB and that €70 million in total will be spent on the eradication of animal disease. It would only cost €25 million to extend the BreastCheck scheme nationwide and that could be achieved within a period of 22 months. I find it difficult to accept any excuse as to why this has not already been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">The success of the BreastCheck programme speaks for itself. By the end of August last year, over 91,000 women were invited for screening and 74% took up the offer. Up to June of last year, over 544 cancers were detected. That statistic, while in its way is sad, speaks volumes about the success of BreastCheck. The recent announcement that the scheme was to be extended to Carlow, Kilkenny and other places is welcome. Any assistance provided to women who may be carrying this deadly disease is a welcome development. However, the failure of the Government to extend this service to places such as Cork and Kerry and areas in Connacht is absolutely unforgivable. As already stated, the fact that the Government spends more on animal health is an affront to people's integrity and to democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Progressive Democrats stated in their manifesto that no person would have to travel 100 miles for radiotherapy treatment, but this aim has not yet been achieved. The Celtic tiger roared loud and often enough for many years and the Government should have been in a position to divert funding into this area and uphold commitments such as that made by the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">In west Cork, the reality is that many people have to travel over 100 miles to obtain this essential service. I cannot think of any credible reason that this service has not been extended nationwide and why it is not available to people in urban centres such as Cork. Is this because the Minister for Finance has refused to give him €22.5 million to extend the service? Is it because the Department of Health and Children, which has so much money in its budget, is unwilling to increase the funding for the service? Who really runs the Department of Health and Children or the Department of the Environment and Local Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_398">In recent days it was indicated to the House that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government expects the ordinary Joe and Mary Soap to finance benchmarking in his Department by paying exorbitant increases in refuse collection charges. This is mainly due to the fact that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has refused to provide the necessary funding. Is the situation the same in the Department of Health and Children which requires €22.5 million to finance a service relating to such a serious and life-threatening disease? For some strange and obscene reason that money is not available or is not being given to the Department of Health and Children to allow it to extend this essential service. Who is running the country? Is it the apostle of fiscal rectitude in Kildare – the Minister for Finance – or is it the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Cabinet? I can find no plausible, logical reason that €22.5 million cannot be spent on such an essential service. People's lives are at risk. I ask the Minister to answer the questions I have raised. I hope and pray that in the coming days and weeks the reality and seriousness of this situation will come home to some people who sit at the Cabinet table.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_404">The Senator will discover the reason I believe they are so important in a moment. The Opposition had the opportunity to do something about this matter and I will also refer to that later.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 – the Senator knows who was in power at that time – with phase one covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">The BreastCheck initiative has most certainly been a success since its commencement. By the end of August 2002, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened. This represents an uptake of 74%. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recently announced that BreastCheck will begin the next stage of the national extension of the programme by rolling it out in Counties Carlow, Wexford and Kilkenny. Approximately 19,000 women in the 50 to 64 age bracket in these counties will be invited for screening. It is expected that approximately 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed and treated annually as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The board of BreastCheck recently submitted a business plan to the Department of Health and Children for the national expansion of the programme. The Department is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion of the programme and, in particular, the linkages with the existing symptomatic services. The Government is completely committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and has invested substantially in the development of symptomatic services. Further development is still required, but we will continue to commit our efforts to BreastCheck and we will ensure that the national extension programme will be completed as soon as is humanly possible. We must proceed on a phased basis in order to take into account the complexities involved in the screening process.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Cumulative additional investment in cancer services since 1997, when we took over the implementation of a national strategy, is in excess of €400 million which represents an average increase of almost €60 million annually well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in 1996 to implement the national cancer strategy when the Opposition was in power. An additional sum of €29 million has been allocated in 2003 for cancer services.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">A research programme has been launched under the Ireland-Northern Ireland Institute cancer consortium which will allow hospitals throughout Ireland to participate in high quality clinical trials of new therapies for cancer, helping to ensure new and effective treatments are made available more quickly. The esteemed National Cancer Institute in the United States provides access to cutting edge research, prestigious clinical expertise and ground-breaking technologies. Our cancer services and cancer patients are the principal beneficiaries. Significant resources have been invested in the programme in order to establish an effective infrastructure for clinical cancer trials. To date, awards to the value of €3.5 million have been made available through the Health Research Board to allow hospitals to recruit and train staff, improve facilities and take part in world class clinical trials.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">It is amusing that the motion was raised by the Labour Party because during the financial crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s Ireland did not have the funds to create the world class health service we all deserve. By the mid-1990s, however, the money was certainly available. The Labour Party was then in government but failed to put money into cutting waiting lists and providing new nurse training places or to provide the funding which the health service desperately needed. As everybody knows, there are necessary run-in times in the health sector. It takes years to train doctors and nurses, build wards and put programmes in place. Had Fine Gael and the Labour Party started the job of reforming the health service in the mid-1990s our problems today would be greatly reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The Labour Party's record in government was disastrous. In the years 1995 to 1997 a Labour Party Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, raised the health spend by just £400 million. Two years ago he made the startling admission that his failure to heed concerns expressed regarding the future of our health service had led to many of the difficulties which we now face. Just over six years ago, when there was a different Government in office, concerns about the future of the medical professions, particularly nursing, were communicated to both the Government and the Opposition. Certain predictions were made about the changes that would occur, especially with regard to the number who would enter the nursing profession and the availability of well motivated and qualified people. A college of nursing was established in my health board area and I had the honour of presenting a second group of graduates with their certificates last Thursday. On 21 March 2001 Deputy Quinn said about the concerns expressed, "I confess I did not listen to those voices at the time as well as I might have, and the problems the Minister for Health and Children now has are, in part, related to that." He was not alone. His colleague in government, Deputy Noonan, then Minister for Health—</p>

          <p eId="para_413">Not alone do we talk about them, we look after them. The Opposition did nothing when in office. If it had, we would not have the problems we have today. We have done a lot and accept there is more to do, about which Senators will hear from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The then Minister for Health, at a time of relative fiscal prosperity, cut the funding allocated for the reduction of waiting lists in 1997. This decision was taken at a time when the numbers on the lists had increased by 27 %. This bizarre reaction of addressing a 27% increase by cutting spending by 20% says it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The future plans for cancer services must be taken seriously. The national cancer forum, under the chairmanship of Professor Paul Redmond, is developing a new cancer strategy in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. The national cancer strategy 2003 will set out the key areas to be targeted for investment in the coming years. As part of this work, the existing strategy is being evaluated to assess its success and the gaps in cancer services which need to be prioritised.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">We have a caring and compassionate Minister. I assure the Opposition we will finish what we have started in regard to BreastCheck. While the job is well advanced, I accept there is more to do. I am not being patronising in saying I appreciate the women of this country to whom I pay tribute.</p>

        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_93">
          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_417">I support the Labour Party motion and congratulate BreastCheck on the excellence and high standard of its service and data. We were promised that the BreastCheck screening service would be available nationwide by 1999. That promise was then extended to 2002. Now we have to wait another 22 months before it will be extended to the south and west. That is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Women not covered by the BreastCheck programme are at risk and live in fear of breast cancer. A modest amount, just over €13 million, is all that is required for the roll-out of the service. This expenditure would represent good value. When I see how the Government throws money around, for example, €250,000 was spent yesterday on photographs, I know the money could be found. Some have said the problem is a shortage of radiographers but my belief is that it all comes down to money. The service is overdue. What drug could cut the cancer mortality rate by 20%? What we need is money and a dedicated plan to ensure the west and south get the same treatment as other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">There is strong evidence for extending the programme to women aged between 65 and 70 years provided they have already attended. More cancers would be picked up and there would be a better chance of securing a reduction in mortality. In America some women avail of breast checks through an insurance based system. There is a cancer epidemic worldwide and in Ireland the situation seems to be particularly bad. The World Health Organisation has stated 80% of cancers are linked to environmental causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Mention was made of offering the service to women aged between 30 and 50 years. There is an alarming incidence of breast cancer among women in that age group. This needs to be investigated. I urge the Minister to commence a roll-out programme immediately. Why is the high detection rate related to the start-up of the programme? Why do 650 women die each year from breast cancer? If the mortality rate was cut by 20%, 130 women nationally would be saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">Given that only half of the country is covered by BreastCheck and the screening programme has been in place since 2000, 195 women could be alive today if the service was extended to the west and south. It is unforgivable that those women might have been saved if breast screening had been introduced to these areas. There is a major disparity in the health provisions made for the east coast area in comparison with the south and west.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Last July the board of BreastCheck made its report to the Minister, yet he acknowledged receipt of it only in December. What happened to it in the intervening five months? I support the Labour Party motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">I was outraged by the remarks of Senator McCarthy. It is an insult to women everywhere that he should suggest more is spent on animal welfare than on women's health. I suggest that the Senator does not hold women in high regard. Is the Labour Party trying to score a cheap point on the backs of sick and vulnerable women? Putting publicity before patients is not on. I wish to bring a sense of balance to the debate. Unlike the Labour Party, I think it is wonderful that we have the opportunity to debate the issue of breast cancer and its treatment services.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">There are two levels of diagnosis available to women in detecting breast cancer; screening is one and symptomatic diagnosis is the other. Everyone knows that it is possible to detect a lump by self-examination. Nipple discharge is also an indicator that something is not quite right with one's breast and a woman should then go and have that checked.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">We are all very familiar with the O'Higgins report on a cancer strategy. Professor O'Higgins promoted the idea of centres of excellence. Under the previous Government, which was also a Fianna Fáil-led administration, 13 such centres of excellence were set up. Three of these are based in Dublin; one in the Mater Hospital, one in St. Vincent's Hospital and one in St. James's Hospital; there are two in Cork and one each in Waterford, Portlaoise, Limerick, Galway, Drogheda and Letterkenny. These locations were chosen to provide optimal coverage throughout the country. Because of the nature of these centres, their staff is of the highest calibre. I take my hat off to the Minister for his decision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">We have the best oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, haematologists and related medical support staff to go with the multidisciplinary teams. Heretofore, we never saw the like of this. General surgeons treated women who presented with lumps or breast cancer. We now have multidisciplinary teams delivering the appropriate treatment in these centres of excellence. It is an accepted principle that to sustain such a centre one must have adequate case volumes, that is, in excess of 100 individual cases presenting per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">There is an enormous amount of research ongoing in this area. In preparation for this debate I took the trouble to ring two friends of mine who have both been unfortunate enough to develop breast cancer. One of them was picked up through the screening process, while the other detected a lump herself. Both said that, regardless of the method of diagnosis, the most important element was the service provided to them. Each of them spoke about how excellent the service was and the great care they received, particularly the lady who was picked up through screening who had a team of seven medical experts available to her and, at any time, two or three of them might be dealing with her problem. She did not particularly wish to know how advanced her case was and there is an argument both for and against having this knowledge. Ultimately she had to be told but she is delighted with all the care she is receiving.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I do not agree with Senator Feighan's allegation that women's lives are being put at risk. There is an alternative to breast screening, which I have outlined. However, there is a huge amount to be gained by screening. Even if the Minister had money at his disposal to extend the scheme, the medical expertise is not there to provide it. It is, therefore, virtually impossible for us to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I commend the Minister for extending screening to the areas of Carlow, Wicklow and Kilkenny. Such places could almost be considered as outreach elements of the Dublin programmes as they are within easy reach of the capital. In commending the Minister, I should point out to the House that, to date, since 1997 some €400 million has been spent on cancer care, which is far in excess of what was envisaged at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I also took the trouble to talk to some medical experts who are caring for women with breast cancer. They are some of the most highly qualified medical practitioners in the country. The Minster will be delighted to hear that they take their hats off to him also. They commend the way he is directing the Department, as well as his caring, understanding and approachable manner, in addition to his grasp of the problems that face the Department and his ability to move them on.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">As a member of Fianna Fáil I am delighted the Minister is in the House to talk to us on the issue of screening for breast cancer. We must not forget that there are other ways of detecting breast cancer and it is wrong of the Opposition to hammer us on this one. It is an attempt to get cheap publicity.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_433">I also welcome the Minister to the House. I am very glad he has been able to visit the Central Mental Hospital. I asked the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to go there and the fact that the Minister also went is marvellous. I am quite sure he will have been as horrified as I was by the conditions there.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">To return to the subject in hand, I speak as a satisfied customer of BreastCheck. I was called back at the right time and got reports very quickly. A friend of mine who was not so fortunate, in that her mammograms were not clear, was also very well treated when it was detected that she had early breast cancer and she has made a very successful recovery from operative treatment. However, it is the Minister for Finance who should be here tonight to hear what we are saying. I am quite sure that if the Minister for Health and Children had the money he would roll out the programme all over the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">I know there have been staffing problems, particularly with radiographers, but they seem to have been solved. I particularly salute those radiographers who decided to come back for retraining so that the scheme could be expanded to other places.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Those who are getting involved in BreastCheck are receiving excellent treatment. What is distressing for women in the rest of the country is the fact that they know some of us have had excellent treatment and they are not getting it. BreastCheck had a radio advertisement in which women were encouraged to take up their appointment and told how much better the level of survival is if breast cancer is detected early on. All over the country people's expectations were raised, but they were then not offered the opportunity to come forward and be screened.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I take Senator Feeney's point that one can have a symptomatic diagnosis. However, the success rate of treatment is much lower then. The value of screening is that, if one manages to catch people very early, small tumours can be diagnosed before a lump appears. If the cancer has got to the stage of nipple discharge the success rate is not good.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The Minister has made great efforts to get centres of excellence going, with little help from some members of my own profession. This is not to mention local politicians, who are sometimes not satisfied unless there is to be a centre of excellence at every corner. I have great sympathy for the Minister in this respect. Nevertheless, there are areas where women are significantly disadvantaged due to the lack of such services as radiotherapy. I do not blame the Minister for this problem. This is why I believe the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, should be taking this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">We must take seriously the need for a better spread of radiotherapy services around the country. Galway, Waterford and Limerick are the most obvious instances. The Minister already knows this to be the case and I am not telling him something he has not heard before. It is very difficult to get a centre of excellence with surgeons, oncologists, breast treatment nurses, psychologists and other professionals all working together if one knows that women in the west of Ireland will need more extensive operative treatment simply because there is not a radiotherapy unit nearby.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">A friend of mine told me that one of the most distressing things she found about going to the unit in Cork was to hear people asking for a lift to Sneem or Dungarvan or some other place. Could we even try to make transport for patients a little easier? These are not necessarily the Minister's problems but there are very big problems of logistics, particularly for people getting radiotherapy services.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">When are we going to get a national register for breast screening? I have been talking about this need for too long in this House. BreastCheck still gets its register from four different sources. This is a terrible waste of time and money. I believe we now have registration numbers for people up to the ages of four or five. However, we must extend them because we cannot wait another 45 years to call 50 year old women. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children the other day I heard representatives of BreastCheck complain that one of their major problems is the lack of a national register. BreastCheck is having to bear the cost of this, which the Minister's Department should not be doing. The Minister should pass this problem to the Department of the Environment and Local Government and tell them to get on with it. It must be possible to extend the register more rapidly.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I am disappointed that we are falling behind in the testing of women who have a genetic predisposition towards breast cancer. That is very important because there are obviously some families where there is a greater hereditary predisposition towards breast and ovarian cancers, which are caused by the same gene. Ovarian cancer is even more difficult to diagnose early and is more deadly. It is important, therefore, that the national genetic centre in Crumlin gets proper funding. The centre never seems to know what its budget is. Professor Peter Harper's report, which was produced by the centre last year and was sent to the Minister's Department, referred to the importance of a clinic and laboratory genetic service for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and stressed the value of the four year pilot scheme which the Department has funded through the health research board. However, the centre has been funded ever since in jumps of €80,000, which is not much good. The Department accepted the Harper report so the value of it is known. A huge amount of money is not involved but programmes of this sort cannot be run on a stop-go basis because clinical scientists must be employed to do this research. We know the value of these genetic tests regarding the programming of treatment and we must make progress in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">Within Europe there is huge resentment at the fact that patenting of human genes, particularly of the BRCA1 which is the most common human gene, has been granted to Myriad Genetics of the United States. Virtually every Government in Europe has made representations about this matter but Ireland has not. I raised this matter in the House on a previous occasion and I ask the Minister to request officials in his Department to look at this again. This will cost us a fortune because some of the best work in the development of these diagnostic tests is done in places like Ireland and we pay Myriad Genetics in Utah every time a test is done in this country. It is immoral that the human genetic profile should be patented. I am not the only one who thinks this. The Minister probably agrees.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I would like to see the Government supporting the other European Governments which have brought this matter before the European Parliament and the World Trade Organisation to say it is wrong. Our voice would matter in this and it is particularly important. It will cost us a fortune because we will be using quite a lot of tests.</p>

          <p eId="para_446">When I read the motion proposed by Senator O'Meara I looked back at how far we have come. Since 1997 the Government has committed a considerable amount of money, while very little was committed before that.

          <p eId="para_452">The Minister's heart is in the right place, as everyone's heart is. There is no one in this Chamber who does not know colleagues and friends who have gone through the trauma of breast cancer, either personally or in their families. The Minister is aware that we must have access to screening and would like to see a screening unit in every health board area. That is the forward strategy and funding is being committed to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Let us take things one step at a time. We have got phase 1 which is very successful and are now on phase 2 in respect of counties Kilkenny, Carlow and Wexford. I have no doubt it will be up and running in a short period. I congratulate the Minister on taking a special interest in this area, providing €400 million since 1997 and having reports and research carried out to ensure we have the expertise available. We were short of radiographers and consultants in oncology whom we are now getting but it cannot happen over night. One cannot snap one's fingers and say everything is in place. It takes a while to get everything in motion. It is a serious matter. We are concerned about women who discover they have breast cancer. It is important that all backup supports are in place and that the women concerned have access to the nearest unit. The Minister is committed to this area and will do the right thing in the next few years. I have great faith in him. I am here to endorse what has been done and know the Minister has a programme <i>in situ</i> which will provide us with a national programme in the next three years.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I can understand that certain services have to be delayed but when it comes to peoples' lives, the Government should introduce a service to ensure lives are saved. For example, Deputy Cowley who comes from County Mayo has said screening is known to reduce the number of deaths by 20% to 30%. Each year we fail to implement a nationwide screening programme lives will be lost that need not be lost. Will the Minister inform my colleagues and me when he intends to implement his party's policy? It is not a good enough excuse that the administration has to be put in place first. He should provide the necessary resources to put a nationwide programme in place as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the House on this important issue. I have listened very carefully to the views of Senators in relation to the extension of the BreastCheck screening programme. I hope to deal with some of the issues they have raised. I have no disagreement with the essential tenet of what is being said in relation to the need for an extension of the breast screening programme. I have publicly expressed my commitment to the extension of BreastCheck and did so at the launch of the BreastCheck annual report.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">My commitment is based on principles of equity. Women in the 50-64 age group should have access to the same level and quality of service, regardless of geography. The BreastCheck programme is for women aged between 50 and 64 years. This applies equally to breast screening services, access to breast surgery and oncology drug therapies which combined are essential elements in an effective breast cancer programme. It is the combination of these modalities of care, with radiotherapy, which are required if we are to reduce mortality rates from breast cancer. That is the reason we take issue with the nature of the debate so far on BreastCheck in that there has been an attempt to almost isolate it from every other component part of a breast care programme. That is a huge mistake. Let us remember also that women who present with symptomatic breast disease are entitled to as rapid access to care as those who go through the BreastCheck programme. The combined nature of the different modalities of care coming together is the key point. I will flesh this out later.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">I accept that Irish mortality rates are out of line with European data and need to be reduced. It is important to state the vast majority of women with breast cancer will be diagnosed and treated outside the national screening programme. Judging from the debate in recent weeks one would imagine BreastCheck was the be all and end all of saving lives. It is not. I argue that prior to 1997 – I do not mean this in any political sense – we were not treating cancer properly and not responding to it in any sophisticated focused programme in line with international best practice which would guarantee better survival rates and a better outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">While incidences of breast cancer rise dramatically in older women, breast cancers still make up a high proportion of all cancers in younger women. National Cancer Registry data show that 35% of breast cancer cases occur in women in the 50-64 year age group. Because the screening programme deals only with women in the 50 to 64 year old age range and only those who have no symptoms, the great majority of women with breast cancer will continue to be diagnosed and treated outside the screening programme. For this reason and because of the need to investigate and treat the large and increasing number of women with breast symptoms due to benign conditions, it is necessary to develop and support both the symptomatic and screening services to ensure a comprehensive cancer service for women.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the Government motion which concerns a broadly based cancer programme within which breast and cervical screening are important components. The significant progress made in terms of the growth in funding available for the sector in recent years is indicative of the Government commitment and mine, as Minister for Health and Children, to the ongoing development of cancer services.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Since 1997 there has been an unprecedented level of investment in cancer services. Since the implementation of the national cancer strategy a cumulative figure of approximately €400 million has been invested in the development of cancer services. That represents an average increase of almost €60 million annually, well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in 1996 when the national cancer strategy was devised. It was thought that £25 million per year would cover the strategy but that would have gone nowhere near meeting the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">This investment has enabled the funding of 80 additional consultant posts, with support staff, in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. Up to quite recently in many cities outside Dublin there were no oncologists. In the major urban centres there were no oncologists. Senator McCarthy spoke about how the people had to travel from west Cork. There was no oncologist in what was meant to be a super regional hospital, Cork University Hospital, up to two years ago. I was in Waterford last Friday where a third oncologist post will be approved shortly. Up to three years ago there were no oncologists in Waterford. This is all about care for women with breast and other forms of cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">I acknowledge the sincere commitment to try to expand the service. Let us acknowledge what has happened which represents a sea-change and a transformation in the quality of care for those with cancer. While we have a long way to go, we have achieved a significant amount. It is important to work collectively to get home the concept of combined modalities of care in centres of excellence. I accept Senator O'Meara's genuine concern about the issue of the mammography machine in Nenagh or Ennis but we have got to tell people that a comprehensive cancer programme is not light years away and is ahead of a mammography machine. Some still hold the view that if we have a mammography machine, we have a cancer service. We do not. Keeping in line with best international practice will give us the outcomes we desire and which we envy the capacity of countries such as the United States and others to achieve. This is emanating from people who have been abroad, worked in other centres and who have returned and want the best configuration of services, etc., for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">The most recent report of the National Cancer Registry, Cancer in Ireland 1994-1998 – Incidence, Mortality, Treatment and Survival, indicates that there is a significant upward trend in breast cancer incidence in women under 65 years. Importantly, there is also a downward trend in mortality rates in all age groups combined, reflecting the fact that survival from breast cancer is good. We are currently carrying out an evaluation of the national cancer strategy. The initial finding is that the original objective of reducing mortality rates is well on target. It is gratifying to see that because we would not like see services and facilities being provided if we were not getting some results in terms of better survival rates and reduced mortality rates. That is the key issue. These trends were evident prior to the initiation of the breast screening programme and I expect them to continue as a result of the continued improvements in treatments and also as a result of the national breast screening programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Breast cancer is the individual site specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years. Since the implementation of the strategy, approval has been granted for an additional 39 consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease. That is a phenomenal increase by any standards in any specialty or area at consultant level.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">All women with symptomatic breast disease should have prompt access to high quality multidisciplinary care. Although services should be delivered as close to the patient's home as is feasible, the overriding priority should be to provide the best, safest and most effective treatment for women and in so doing, provide the best opportunity for long-term survival to those who are found to have breast cancer.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The report of the subgroup on the development of services for symptomatic breast disease contains recommendations for the establishment of a network of specialist breast units throughout the country and the appropriate infrastructure, personnel and equipment needed for such specialist units. The report also makes recommendations regarding the siting of such units in each health board area.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">The report recommends that specialist breast units should be based on a population of 250,000 to 300,000 from which it is expected that there will be a minimum of 100 new primary breast cancers per annum. The modern management of breast cancer entails triple assessment, a concept which those expert in the field constantly assert as being the key. It involves the surgeon, pathologist and radiologist working as an integrated team.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">Since the publication of the O'Higgins report, my Department has been in consultation with the health boards in relation to the development of services for symptomatic breast disease in their respective regions. Since 2001 there has been a cumulative investment of approximately €30 million in these services. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity which has occurred with in-patient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,336 in 1997 to 1,839 in 2001. This is an increase of 37% nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">BreastCheck currently provides breast screening services to women in the 50 to 64 age group in the Eastern Regional Health Authority, North Eastern Health Board and Midland Health Board areas. It has proved extremely successful in identifying breast cancer among women in this age group and it also provides for the necessary surgical care of women who require breast surgery. To the end of November last year, the programme had invited over 100,000 eligible women for screening and screened nearly 80,000, with an uptake rate of 75%.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Since the pilot phase commenced in 1989, quality assurance has been an integral feature of the design and implementation of BreastCheck. An effective multidisciplinary structure is in place to advise on quality and ensure that it is sustained at the key interface with women presenting for screening or who require treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">BreastCheck has ensured that its programme is externally reviewed and validated. Last year a team from the European Reference Centre for Quality visited the programme. The key strengths of the programme identified by the reference centre are: outstandingly high levels of professional expertise; team working; and commitment to the programme with all disciplines working to an internationally recognised standard. The report also congratulates the programme on its investment in high quality and internationally recognised professional staff. This is high praise from an international visiting team and, at the launch of its annual report last October, I congratulated the board of BreastCheck and its staff, who have contributed at all levels to such an impressive result.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">My commitment and that of my Department is evidenced by the significant funding that has been provided. There has been cumulative investment of €40 million to date in this programme. In addition, I have also made available approximately €6 million for the construction of a new state-of-the-art screening unit at St. Vincent's Hospital to replace the current Merrion unit. In 2000 we had problems getting enough radiographers and that slowed up phase one to a certain degree. We had to go overseas and do our own in-house education to try to increase the number of radiographers as quickly as possible for the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan and there are three geographic elements to the expansion in that plan. Three further counties – Carlow, Wexford and Kilkenny – are part of the eastern region. Women from those counties who require treatment will be referred to the static units in Dublin, which are already in place. In regard to the west and south, we have selected where the static units will go – the South Infirmary in Cork and UCH in Galway. We must build those static units before anything can happen in those counties. I recently announced that, as part of the next stage of the programme, BreastCheck will roll out the programme in Carlow, Wexford and Kilkenny. Approximately 19,000 women will be covered and about 60 additional cancers will be diagnosed.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I am fully committed to the further extension of the programme to the remaining counties in the west and the south. I will meet representatives of BreastCheck shortly in this regard. The objective is to prepare an effective and cohesive model which is in the best interest of the women concerned and which builds on the quality standards applied by BreastCheck and by the symptomatic services. Any woman with concerns, regardless of age, should attend her GP who will, where appropriate, refer her to the symptomatic services.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Senator O'Meara and others asked about the rollout and why we are meeting representatives of BreastCheck in advance. When I launched BreastCheck in 2000 I did not say it would be available throughout the country in two years. I know this because I re-read the speech I made in Dublin Castle on the evening in question. We said phase one would inform the rollout of phase two because it was very much a learning experience in terms of getting the external evaluation from Europe to make sure the quality assurance was right and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">When BreastCheck was launched in 2000 we did not have the Niall O'Higgins report on symptomatic services and the centres of excellence had not been developed. That is important for the following reason. It is the considered opinion of the BreastCheck board that we should roll out BreastCheck in accordance with phase one. Cork will be the static centre for the south and Galway for the west. We have funded and approved 13 centres of excellence and we believe there should be a synergy between the centres of excellence and the BreastCheck model. BreastCheck does not accept that, although it is prepared to discuss it with us and I am prepared to listen to the views of its representatives on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The practical implication of this is that we could roll out two different strands of a service. We would have 13 centres of excellence with teams of surgeons, radiologists and pathologists while the BreastCheck model would be in these areas as well with separate teams of surgeons and so on. There is an important issue here in terms of the rollout. If a woman from Letterkenny was attending the BreastCheck programme in the east, even though we had developed a centre of excellence in Letterkenny, would she have to travel to Dublin for surgery and for post-diagnostic care if she was diagnosed through breast screening? BreastCheck states that she would have to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">We are investing in centres of excellence in Limerick and Waterford, but BreastCheck has said that if women between the ages of 50 and 64 in those regions are identified in Cork, they will continue their treatment in Cork. We have, however, built centres of excellence and employed people in those regions. This is an issue we need to address before the service is rolled out. Funding will then be an issue, but we must resolve the matter to which I refer in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Medical professionals have different perspectives on this. I will meet the BreastCheck board, particularly the medical people thereon, because I want to hear why they believe, despite the fact that we have centres of excellence, there should be a ring-fenced continuum in regard to BreastCheck. One would expect that the centres of excellence should be capable of doing some of the work and that those presenting would be given a choice. From BreastCheck's perspective, I can see that there is an issue of quality assurance involved and that it must see matters through to the end of the process. Most people looking at this objectively would say that if we have centres of excellence around the country and have provided significant funding and investment and recruited top class people, surely there should be some synergy between the two, particularly at the treatment phase. That is an issue which is up for discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The cost is approximately €26 million over a two year period. It takes approximately two years to roll out a programme in terms of recruiting specialist staff for a multidisciplinary team and the building and equipping of units. The roll-out will happen on a phased basis in terms of the mobile units which must be put in place. This is a very exact and high quality service. The BreastCheck board received tremendous recognition and validation at a European level and is very anxious that the level of quality is maintained and continued.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">The cervical screening programme is a valuable preventive health measure when delivered as an organised programme. Phase 1 commenced in the Mid-Western Health Board area in October 2000. Approximately 67,000 women in the 25 to 60 year age group will be screened at five yearly intervals free of charge. Funding allocated to the board to cover the annual cost of running phase 1 is in the region of almost €4 million. As part of an examination of the feasibility and implications of a roll-out of the national programme, the chief executive officers of the health boards are making arrangements to have an external review of phase 1 carried out during 2003. Other issues relating to the management of the national programme, in particular in the sphere of governance, are also being examined by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">To meet the additional demand for cervical cytology laboratory services, additional resources have been made available in recent years to develop both laboratory and colposcopy services. These resources have resulted in the employment of additional staff, the purchase of new equipment and the introduction of new technology. In 2002 additional ongoing funding in the region of €2.5 million was provided. This year a further €1.4 million has been allocated to health boards for ongoing development of the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The developments I have outlined describe an overall framework through which cancer services can be developed and provided in the most co-ordinated and effective manner. I am pleased I had the opportunity to outline the substantial developments that have taken place in cancer services in respect of which we have made substantial progress across a broad range. We are evaluating the national cancer strategy with a view to formulating a new strategy for the next five years which the national cancer forum is undertaking in consultation with the Department. It is important to bring all services along together to make sure women who present with symptomatic breast cancer have as rapid access to quality of care as those involved in the screening programme. That is the reason we have put so much emphasis, particularly in the last two years, on investment in symptomatic breast cancer facilities and appointed the relevant consultants and so on.</p>

        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_111">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_491">I thank the Minister for coming and his presentation. The screening programme for breast cancer provides diagnosis and primary treatment for women between the ages of 50 and 64 years. I have benefited from such screening and have an appointment shortly for a second screening. While I appreciate what has been done and do not want to criticise Fianna Fáil and the Government, I fully support the Labour Party motion. I would like more co-operation from the Minister's side of the House because we are trying to impress on him how seriously we take the BreastCheck programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">While I accept much has been done in recent years in regard to the treatment of cancer, more can be done. International studies show that an organised screening programme can result in a 20% to 30% reduction in mortality rates. The Minister said that by rolling out the programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford he expects approximately 60 detections. If it was not rolled out, what would happen to the 60 women concerned? The fact that he is not rolling out the programme to other areas means cases will not be detected, and people may die. What is the cost of a life? The Minister should make rolling out the programme to the rest of the country a priority. I hope he has got a flavour of what we are saying – that this is an urgent matter. He can point to the money spent during the years but we expect that and more. This is about women's lives and the cost of a life.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">I am in a privileged position because I live in Dublin. Senator O'Meara, who lives in County Tipperary, does not have access to that level of service. How can we deny women this? Why should women living in Dublin be in a privileged position? Women living in counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford will now be lucky to have access to the service. The Minister said it takes 22 months to roll out the programme. Therefore, when will the rest of the country have access to it? Is he now beginning to establish units in the BMW region and the south? We are afraid it could take up to five years before the other units are in place. How many lives will be lost in the meantime? We cannot afford to wait.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">We must ensure the necessary clinicians are in place to provide the service, including radiographers, surgeons and pathologists. The fact that they were not available was a problem in recent years. We must ensure they are trained and appointed in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I support the motion and ask the Government parties to do likewise. We want to extend the service to every woman in the country. I do not understand the reason the Government parties will not support and work with us on the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">It is good to have an opportunity to debate this Labour Party motion. I was very interested in the earlier contributions, including that of the Minister. I would like to disabuse anyone of the idea that there are women in other parties and none in Fianna Fáil.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_499">I know that. However, I got the impression that other parties were peopled with caring women and that Fianna Fáil had uncaring men and no caring women.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The debate has been interesting because we all want the best of everything immediately, including in the health service. It would be ideal if every woman in the land could be screened immediately to the highest standard. However, we do not operate in an ideal world. We must work within a health budget which has doubled since 1987 and within resources which must be applied to various areas. I was amazed when I discovered how much was spent on cancer services since 1997 and how much continues to be spent. We must acknowledge this fact. BreastCheck is one of a range of services being provided. The Minister listed others which are very worthwhile. He is aiming towards the introduction of BreastCheck in different areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The fact that we cannot rub a magic lamp to make these services appear in every part of Ireland tomorrow does not mean that the Minister, Deputy Martin, is not concerned about the health of women, which is at the centre of this debate. What Minister for Health and Children – male or female – would deliberately withhold a cancer service if it could be made available? That is a stark way of putting it, but the motion tabled by the Labour Party leads one to believe that the Minister or the Government decided not to extend BreastCheck facilities, which is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Government is committed to providing a comprehensive range of health services, including BreastCheck facilities, centres of excellence and GPs throughout the country available for consultation. I admit that the provision of health services is not ideal and that further facilities could be made available, but the Government's policy is to increase the level of service and expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I welcome this debate. We may not have heard the facts given to us by the Minister if it had not been held. I appreciate that many of the statistics he detailed are available elsewhere, but it is good they have been correlated.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_509">It is my fault because, as Senator O'Toole said on a previous occasion, I am inviting interruptions.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The Minister said that although 13 centres of excellence exist, public representatives want one in their local areas. I want one in Athlone, where there is no hospital, and others want them in Tuam and Nenagh. Everybody is keen for their own area to be designated as a centre of excellence. It is to be hoped that the various health reports will be published soon so they can debated in the House. The leaks that have emerged from the reports make clear that we cannot have centres of excellence everywhere if we want better diagnosis, the latest technology and the best professionals to care for and cure those who present themselves at hospitals. I do not refer to the diagnosis of cancer in particular. We will face an enormous decision about that dilemma in five or ten years. Innovations in the health system lead to things that help to prolong and enhance life, such as better drugs, a superior quality of care and new technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">We will invest in the highest quality facilities, but we cannot do so in every parish. No sudden shining light will cause Senators to agree that centres of excellence are needed and admit that the services provided by certain hospitals need to be curtailed, but such ideas will be gradually accepted. Patients are not being well served by demands that the highest levels of treatment should be available at every crossroads. People often say that they would be fine if there was an accident and emergency department in their local hospital. It would be fine until there was a severe accident and they realised that the hospital did not have the back-up expertise to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">I welcome the Labour Party's motion in so far as it has provided an occasion for debate, which is useful in itself. I commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, for the proper steps they have taken to bring cancer care to men and women. I particularly welcome the Government's emphasis on the BreastCheck programme and I hope it will be continued and expanded in the years to come.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_513">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley. I acknowledge the fact that some progress is being made, that additional consultants have been recruited and that centres of excellence have been established.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Quick diagnosis and treatment is vital after a woman discovers a lump on her breast. I have heard women say that waiting for diagnosis is absolute hell and that waiting for treatment after detection is no better. Many speakers referred to the BreastCheck service, which exists in some parts of the country but not in others. The service was recently extended to three counties, but I do not understand why it was not extended to the entire health board area. It is ludicrous that we have moved from making progress in relation to BreastCheck on the basis of health boards, to doing so on the basis of individual counties. It should have been extended to the entire health board area in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The Minister for Health and Children mentioned that there are 13 centres of excellence and pointed out that the BreastCheck system is in operation. He suggested that there may be duplication and said that arrangements to remedy it would have to be arrived at. The Minister's job is to resolve these matters. We all know that there is a great deal of politics in the medical profession and that doctors are not averse to protecting their own patches. Patients – women in this instance – should be a priority, however. It has been proven that lives can be saved if there is early detection of breast cancer and that BreastCheck has a high success rate in this regard. Money should be found for these services, as lives are it risk if it is not provided. The statistics are there for everyone to see and they show that my argument is valid. Surely the money that is needed to save the lives of women can be found. It is of paramount importance that the Government should appreciate this.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">Senator Henry mentioned the regionalisation of radiotherapy services. Recent leaks suggest that the facilities in Dublin, Cork and Galway will be extended and that services will be provided in those locations only. I hope these rumours are incorrect because every Fianna Fáil politician in Waterford and the south-east vowed during the general election campaign that a radiotherapy unit would be provided at Waterford Regional Hospital within three years. Movement is needed now if this promise is to be kept because it will take two or three years to put linear accelerators in place and to establish a full radiotherapy unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">It is fine to make promises before an election, but it is wrong that people who are very ill should have to travel to Dublin from Waterford, south Kilkenny and the Minister of State's home city of Limerick, where people are pressing for radiotherapy facilities. Many difficulties are faced by the families of people who have to travel to and from Dublin, or pay to stay there, for two or three minutes' treatment per day. It is traumatic for all concerned that people who are ill have to travel great distances.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I understand that there are problems in relation to radiotherapy units, but I appeal that the BreastCheck service be extended to the entire country. I urge that radiotherapy units be delivered in Waterford Regional Hospital and regional centres of excellence. The promises made prior to the general election should be honoured as people voted for certain politicians because of the promises they made. Dealing with the sick and those with cancer should be above politics. I appeal to the Minister to deliver on the promises made.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_520">I am glad the House is having this debate and that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, was present to discuss the issue. I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Senator Terry made a very relevant point about screening services being available in Dublin only. It is a subject about which I have spoken when dealing with other issues with regard to the west. There has been a strong campaign to have cardiac and cancer services provided in the west and for the regionalisation of health services. The investment of £140 million by the Government in University College Hospital, Galway, showed the investment needed for cardiac and cancer treatment services. Senator Terry's point could also be made about other services. For example, neurological services are badly needed in the west as it is important to have a unit close by when serious injuries occur.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">In addition to the services provided in Galway, the Minister provided £11 million to purchase Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, from the Franciscan Sisters. He gave over £3 million to the local health board to purchase the hospital from the Bon Secours order in Tuam where there are now plans submitted by the Western Health Board for a community hospital. I would like the Minister of State to look at this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I am concerned about recent leaks to the media. There was a typical leak to <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> last Sunday regarding the closure of a number of hospitals, when Ballinasloe received particular mention with regard to the loss of maternity and accident and emergency services. It is hard to understand how that could be as the hospital has recently been purchased from the Franciscan Sisters and it would cost millions of euro to try to relocate services. Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe, also provides cancer treatment services.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Minister made an interesting point when he referred to the €400 million spent since 1997 on cancer services and the fact that 39 additional consultant posts had been approved in the context of breast screening. Three positions are to be made available in the Western Health Board region. There will be interviews for one position in March while advertisements are to be placed in the newspapers for the positions of breast radiologist and breast pathologist in Galway who will also serve Mayo County Hospital, which is important. Screening should be provided nationwide and the sooner the announcements are made, the better, because it takes time to provide a service. Buildings and personnel must be provided. It is important the matter is dealt with for each region.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Minister also made an interesting point regarding issues to be resolved between BreastCheck and the centres of excellence. He told the House he would be meeting with representatives of BreastCheck shortly and I wish him well in his discussions. Before funding, buildings and personnel are provided, what is to happen with regard to the centres of excellence? This must be sorted out. The Minister outlined what could be a difficult situation for women if they had to travel around the country, going from certain centres to BreastCheck. It is an important issue on which he must decide.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The health boards are under threat. As a member of a health board, I may be under threat also. However, the health boards have done a good job. I am concerned in regard to the closure of hospitals if the boards are abolished. Some new agency may undertake rationalisation. For the same reason, I ask what will happen with breast screening. The Minister got it right when he talked about phase 1 and the other phases he wants to put in place. While he said a lot more work would have to be done to bring breast screening to the remaining counties, he also announced that counties Carlow, Wexford and Kilkenny would get this service.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">A serious attempt is being made by the Minister and the Department to deal with the symptoms of the disease. It is hoped he can provide a start-up date in order that, in years to come, the service will be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">The motion gives us a great opportunity to discuss these issues and get the views of the Minister, especially on the relationship between the centres of excellence and BreastCheck, and his discussions to ensure the service is extended to the whole country. It is very unfair that services are concentrated in just one part of the country but this is true for many services. I hope this debate serves to ensure they will be provided throughout the country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_532">However, I have listened to the debate and the Minister, Deputy Martin. Cancer and I lived together for a while and I had three attacks. When I look back at my time as a patient and when I see the huge investment and strides made in general care for cancer, I acknowledge a number of facts. I am glad Senator Cummins said this issue was above politics because I commend Deputy Michael Noonan for setting up the health strategy and directing £25 million in that direction when Minister for Health. However, since 1997 in excess of €400 million has been spent by the Government. I welcome this and the advances made in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">No matter what is done or will be done, those who have been down this path will say not enough is done. That would be case with any medical problem. Those whose life is challenged will always say this, and that money should, ought and has to be found. However, the issue is not about money alone. There have been many developments to ensure experts are available.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Care, treatment and attention are hugely important in terms of overcoming the problem. I say this as one who was challenged and overcame. Funding for research should be provided. The incidence of cancer in this country is far greater today than it was ten or 20 years ago. I cannot even pretend to guess what has gone wrong. This week I attended the funeral of a friend six weeks after they were diagnosed and yesterday evening I received a telephone call from another friend who has also been diagnosed. We all attend funerals of friends who die of cancer and know people who have survived.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Research is needed because science has a role to play. God forgive the scientists who are engaged in cloning. They are not doing a service to natural law. We could overcome the scourge of cancer if we applied ourselves. I call on scientists to stop their extravagant thoughts and concentrate on what human beings require.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_536">Most of this debate has been conducted in a reasonably constructive spirit. The voters of Westmeath decisively answered the Senator who commented on the role of the Labour Party by coming down on the side of my party chairman, particularly in Mullingar. That argument in Westmeath is over and it is time it ended here because we wish to engage in serious political debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Much of the time I disagree with the Minister, who is especially clever at casting clouds of obfuscation while leaving his listeners wondering what he is talking about. However, he at least addresses the issues. The opening words of the motion call on the House to recognise that Ireland has one of the highest death rates from breast cancer in Europe. In its amendment, Fianna Fáil has removed those words, yet the Minister indicated his acceptance that cancer mortality rates in this country are out of line with European data. That is why I and my colleagues on this side of the House have good reason to respect him. He is capable of addressing real arguments and he avoids play-acting about what the Labour Party or the rainbow coalition Government did five, six or seven years ago when the country was half as rich as it is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">I want to address issues. When Senator O'Meara referred to the need for mammography services in Nenagh and elsewhere she did not advocate that every town in the country should be able to provide some kind of health service. We know that is not possible. Her point was that two towns of approximately the same size – Nenagh and Ennis – required the replacement of mammography equipment. The authorities in Nenagh were informed that this could not be done because of the dangers involved. There may be a technical argument in favour of that approach. By contrast, the authorities in Ennis were given a different answer, probably because the then Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, was considered to be a more dangerous adversary than the Minister for Defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">What is wrong here is political play-acting dressed up behind objective scientific evidence. This debate is not served by that approach. I am glad Senator Feeney has returned to the House because it must be said that Senator McCarthy did not trivialise women.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_541">He was referring to a situation where money is scarce. I do not accept that it is. The Government is constrained by ideology from using the funding at its disposal because it will not act in a sensible manner. That would require it to prioritise and borrow sensibly and intelligently for capital projects that are economic while using current resources to fund current problems, among them the inadequacies in the BreastCheck service.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">This is a rich country and it is not short of resources; it is short of the political will to make choices and those that are made are conservative and backward looking. The greatest of all economists, John Maynard Keynes, observed that whenever he heard prominent people talk about life in simple terms, such as stating that money was short, they were inevitably harking back to some out of date economist. This is not the 1980s and Ireland is not a poor country. The question is one of choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The Government made choices about utilising our resources and one such choice was to slow down the implementation of the BreastCheck programme. The Minister outlined all the issues that needed to be addressed concerning the rollout of the programme. He is superb at that kind of presentation. However, he failed to tell us that when the decision was taken to extend the programme to three counties, those in BreastCheck, as the informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children last week, were the last to be informed. The Minister engaged in his usual nonsense of making a small gesture. The fundamental problem is that it will cost money to extend the BreastCheck programme. The Minister has failed to get the Government's sanction and he has dressed up this failure in a cloud of pseudo-scientific argument which is nonsense.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Crime Levels.</heading>
        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_131">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_550">Attacks on churches of all denominations are a growing problem. Over the past week to ten days the media have reported attacks at Glasnevin cemetery, at Leamlara, Dungourney and Inch churches in east Cork, at Mellifont, County Kildare, and at Fethard, Moyglass, Lisronagh and Mullinahone in Tipperary. This is a frightening list. Churches are still places of great importance to which the vast majority of community members are attached. What matters when a chalice which predates Catholic emancipation is stolen is not its monetary value, it is the emotion and history attached to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">I visited the church in Mellifont within the past 12 months at the request of the Minister for Finance and I was distressed to see that extensive damage had been done to a building with fine stained glass windows and unusual stonework. Restoration has had to be undertaken because a fire was started there maliciously. As Archbishop Dr. Dermot Clifford said recently, the fact that nothing is sacred anymore is a reflection of the times in which we live. One is reminded of Belshazzar's feast for which he had brought before him all the gold and silver vessels from the temple in Jerusalem. That parable gives us the phrase "the writing is on the wall" and the idea of people being weighed in the balances and found wanting. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that those who have undertaken the recent attacks will undergo the sort of visitation experienced by Belshazzar.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Attention must be drawn to these matters because it is distressing to parish priests, clergymen and communities to wake up to find their church smashed or burnt. Insurance will not compensate them for the Sisyphusian feeling of having to roll the stone up the hill another time. The Garda should be available to communities or should actively advise the clergy with regard to the improvement of the security of religious premises. I appreciate that budgets are tight, but I hope the State develops a policy of co-funding or supports for community funding where necessary and appropriate to furnish security cameras and other measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">While punishment is always a last resort, penalties should reflect the fact something of special value to many people in the community is being attacked. It is time we and some of the journalists who are never slow to write anti-clerical tracts showed more sympathy for the churches in the midst of their problems. They continue to occupy a special place in most of our hearts and we should recognise this problem and provide assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Serial attacks involving three or four churches are taking place at night. Church premises are vacant and easy to assail. During troubled times these churches were left alone, but today they are subject to attack. In a previous existence, I found the Minister for Finance to be very sympathetic and willing to help with problems. He recognises that churches are part of our heritage and has provided funds for projects which, after all, are of public benefit. I bring the matter to the attention of the Government in the hope that some thought will be given to ways in which we can help. Churches and communities have to deal with this problem.</p>

        <speech by="#SiledeValera" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_132">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Miss de Valera)</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I thank the Senator for bringing this matter to the attention of the House. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who wishes to thank the Senator for raising the matter on the Adjournment. He is pleased to respond, through me, on behalf of his Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">It is an unfortunate fact that in today's society not only is the incidence of vandalism higher than it used to be, but its targets are also wider. With changing social mores, the restraints which would have protected some targets in the past have weakened. Regrettably, buildings such as churches, which would have been spared in the past, are now seen as no different from other targets. This affects churches of all denominations. Places of worship belonging to religions other than Christianity have also suffered in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">The most recent criminal statistics available are for 2001. In that year some 111 burglary offences and 114 offences of criminal damage were recorded where the location was a church. The detection rates were 33% for burglary offences and 30% for criminal damage offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Churches are vulnerable because they were seldom designed with security in mind and they are, by and large, unoccupied most of the time. In addition, many are located in rural or sparsely populated areas. Furthermore, the congregations of a growing number of churches are becoming smaller and the average age of their members is increasing. Another relevant factor is that because the congregations of many rural churches are relatively small, the numbers of people in a position to keep an eye on them are few.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">In mentioning these factors, I do not wish to underplay the valuable role that many people fulfil in keeping an eye on churches which belong to a different denomination from theirs. When a church has been vandalised or robbed, it is not only that church's congregation which feels attacked – all the people of the affected area, regardless of their own religious affiliation, feel similarly injured.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">We are all aware that at times when political feelings were running high as a result of events in the North, churches of the Protestant tradition, in particular, were attacked in this part of the country. All right-minded people condemn such actions. Often, those political feelings were used as a cloak to carry out acts of pure vandalism. Thankfully, the number of such incidents has been decreasing significantly. I might add that Senator Mansergh himself has contributed significantly to creating a situation where events in the North which caused such feelings to develop are now much fewer and of less intensity than they used to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Although the Garda Síochána follow up on acts of vandalism against churches, as with other acts of vandalism, it is an unfortunate fact that it is not possible for them to prevent all such acts. It is therefore important that local congregations and communities take appropriate steps to ensure that such acts do not take place, in so far as it is possible to prevent them.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Advice is available within each Garda division from a designated crime prevention officer who can provide information on security needs. These officers carry out crime prevention surveys of public and private properties on request. Further support is available from the Garda national crime prevention unit at Harcourt Square, Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">Although this subject comes within the remit of another Department, it is of great personal interest to me because of my obligations as Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in the last Administration. Looking at the matter in terms of the national heritage, churches say so much about our communities and society as a whole. It is dreadful to see the damage caused by vandalism to such wonderful buildings that belong to all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I will convey the Senator's views to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is taking a particular interest in this matter.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Youth Work Act 2001.</heading>
        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_133">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_565">The Youth Work Bill came before this House as a result of effective lobbying by the youth work sector, including youth work providers throughout the country. The legislation represented an acknowledgement of the role of youth workers in rural and urban centres. It is now 2003, yet we are still awaiting the full implementation of the legislation through the VEC structures. It is imperative to establish those mechanisms now. I call on the Minister of State to use whatever resources are available to her to start the ball rolling.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Neither the present Government nor its predecessors has recognised the usefulness of youth work, which involves intervention to help children who leave school early and have domestic problems. They may have been bullied, suffer from depression and may even have suicidal tendencies. Children who feel isolated and marginalised need to be helped through the holistic approach of youth work. Such intervention can prevent many problems, such as solvent and drug abuse, suicide, non-violent and violent crime, mental illness and apathy among young people. These are matters which we will continue to debate in the House. Sometimes we may be angry with young people's attitudes, but many of them feel they are unable to participate in a society which provides them with no useful role. If youth workers are provided with the proper mechanisms, they can begin to make progress in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Preventative action is needed by the Legislature to avoid our taking a solely reactive stance to social difficulties, including violent crime and over indulgence in alcohol. We should become proactive by providing solutions, rather than wondering what has gone wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Voluntary work is on the decline, not because people are becoming more selfish, but because they have less time in modern society. We do not have sufficient voluntary groups because parents cannot give their free time to youth clubs due to work commitments, longer commuting periods and other factors. We will have to introduce an effective, professional youth structure within which youth workers will be paid for their services. We must take this matter seriously and demonstrate that we are willing to work with young people. In that way, society will reap the rewards and will be able to move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">We should seek the creation of a department of youth affairs to concentrate on that large segment of the community below 25 years of age. Intervention during young people's formative years can help them to avoid taking the wrong road in life. I appreciate the Minister's presence in the House and I know her heart is in the right place concerning youth work. Hopefully, we will be able to make progress on this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SiledeValera" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Miss de Valera</from>
          <p eId="para_570">I would like to thank Senator McHugh for having raised this issue on the Adjournment. As I have specific responsibility for youth affairs, this debate gives me an opportunity of outlining the position with regard to the Youth Work Act 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">This legislation was enacted on 1 December 2001 and provides a statutory basis for the development of youth work in Ireland. The Act followed a widespread consultation process and provides a legal framework for the provision of youth work programmes and services to be organised by the Minister for Education and Science, vocational education committees, and national and regional youth work organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">The strength of the Act lies in the fact that there has been such widespread consultation. Rather than taking a top-down approach to the matter, we tried to elicit from individuals and groups already involved in youth work what the immediate issues were, before addressing them in a practical way. The Act defines the functions of the Minister in the provision of a youth work programme or service, including the development, co-ordination and assessment of youth work programmes and services. It also defines the functions of vocational education committees regarding youth work, the role of the assessor of youth work, the composition and functions of the national youth work advisory committee. It further provides for the establishment of a youth work committee and local voluntary youth councils for each VEC area as well as the preparation by each VEC of a three year development plan for its administrative area.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">It was never the intention that the Act would be implemented in one fell swoop; on the contrary, section 1 provides for sections to be commenced at various stages. To date, sections 2 to 7, inclusive, 17, 18 and 24 have been commenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Sections 17 and 18 provide for the establishment of a new national youth work advisory committee, NYWAC. This is a key provision of the Act. The committee was appointed on 22 April 2002 and is made up equally of representatives from voluntary youth work organisations and statutory authorities. In addition to the Department, the committee is providing advice for me on an ongoing basis on relevant aspects of the Act and I have ongoing contact with it. It is an extremely hard working body. Its views are very representative and useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">A sub-committee was established to make recommendations on the requirements necessary for implementation of the various sections of the Act. It comprises representatives of both statutory and voluntary sectors, as well as the Department. Two reports prepared by it and approved by the NYWAC on the first two areas of action necessary to put in place the arrangements for the designation of local youth work organisations and the establishment of local voluntary youth councils were recently furnished to me and I have approved them in principle. It is intended to have them circulated to the appropriate interest groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The sub-committee's work is continuing while work on the criteria for the approval of national youth work organisations is nearing completion. The sub-committee will continue to report to the NYWAC on this and other aspects of the implementation process of the Act. Furthermore, the Department will, as appropriate and necessary, hold further discussions with statutory and voluntary youth work interests such as the IVEA, the chief executive officer association and the major national youth work organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">I am firmly of the belief that it is highly desirable, if not essential, to have agreement between all the interested parties in order that implementation of the Act can take place in a logical and structured manner. When the discussions are complete, it will be necessary to consult the Minister for Finance as to the human and financial resources required for the implementation of further sections of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">I have listened carefully to the Senator's contribution and agree with much of what he said. He spoke, in particular, about young people in disadvantaged areas and the need to ensure the Act was implemented as quickly as possible in order that appropriate intervention could take place. This would ensure less crime and fewer health problems among young people and promote inclusiveness. I agree with the Senator's views on the importance of voluntary work. We should praise and recognise those who give of their time to voluntary activities despite the many calls on them. They do the State and young people, in particular, a great service. I do not agree, however, with the Senator's request that a specific Department for youth affairs be set up. It is a very specific issue which needs particular attention and in respect of which the Government has allocated responsibility to a Minister of State. This puts a definite emphasis on the need for particular attention to be paid to this sector of society. I hope to do my best in that regard.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Water and Sewerage Schemes.</heading>
        <speech by="#MichaelPKitt" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_580">I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this issue and the Minister of State for coming to the House. I raise the matter of the Milltown sewerage scheme in north Galway. Milltown has the honour of being the tidiest village in County Galway in recent years. Funding has been allocated for water schemes in the village and surrounding areas. However, there will be a threat of pollution if a sewerage scheme is not provided. Fisheries have expressed concern because they have spent money on the river.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">It is very frustrating for the community of Milltown that the growth of the village has been stopped by the lack of a sewerage scheme which is costed at €1 million. Other villages have considered low cost schemes and systems. I ask the Department of the Environment and Local Government to approve a suitable system. Infrastructure is very important for villages and towns, particularly in the case of Milltown. The village has a restaurant, five public houses, a community centre and a football pitch. It is, therefore, very important that a sewerage scheme is provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I have raised this issue on many occasions with Galway County Council and was told last October that the council's consulting engineers were preparing documentation requested by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. While the October deadline for the completion of the documentation by the engineers was not met, I understand the documentation has now been completed. It is very important that the Department approves the sewerage scheme in order that it can progress to the next stage. I ask the Minister of State to impress on her colleague the importance of the scheme.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SiledeValera" eId="spk_137">
          <from>Miss de Valera</from>
          <p eId="para_583">I am answering on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and thank the Senator for raising the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The provision of modern environmental infrastructure to support social and economic objectives is and continues to be a major focus of Government spending. The unprecedented increase in investment by the Department of the Environment and Local Government in water and sewerage schemes under the current and previous national development plans has made a key contribution to economic growth that benefited every part of Ireland. Total investment in water and sewerage facilities over the period of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will amount to almost €4.4 billion, of which over €3.8 billion is earmarked for major public schemes. This investment is aimed at supporting economic and social development, employment generation and the achievement of high environmental standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">In April 2002, the second phase of the water services investment programme under the current NDP was announced. This phase covers the years 2002 to 2004 and is a continuation of a rolling strategy that will be progressively advanced up to the end of the NDP in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The total allocated for Galway city and county under the current phase of the programme comes to almost €350 million in respect of some 46 schemes. The approved schemes include major sewerage projects for Galway city, soon to be completed, and for Clifden, Headford, Barna, Athenry, Tuam, Ballinasloe, and Kilronan. There are also major water supply schemes for Galway city, Carna-Kilkieran, Tuam regional water supply scheme, phase two, as well as regional water supply schemes for Clifden, Costelloe, Loughrea and Ballinasloe. These are the biggest of the schemes, but many more towns and villages in the county, including Milltown, are also covered and will benefit from the major push to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to modern standards. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional serviced residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a number of key locations around Galway city and county.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">With regard to the Milltown sewerage scheme, I am pleased to say that it has been approved to advance through planning in the current water services investment programme. The estimated cost of the scheme is some €2 million and I understand that Galway County Council is now finalising an updated preliminary report which it hopes to be in a position to submit to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for approval in the near future. When the preliminary report has been cleared, it will be open to the council to proceed with the preparation of contract documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I assure the Senator that the Minister is listening carefully to what he is saying this evening and that the Department will give prompt attention to the updated preliminary report once it is received. The Minister is keen to see schemes like this advance quickly so that the benefits that will follow for local communities are brought on stream in the shortest possible timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Seanad adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 25 February 2003.</p>
