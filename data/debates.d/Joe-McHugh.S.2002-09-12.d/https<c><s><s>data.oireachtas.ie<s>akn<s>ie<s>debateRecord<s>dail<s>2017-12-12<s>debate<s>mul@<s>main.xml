        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T12:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">The objective of this legislation is to make our roads safer by encouraging safer driving by motorists and ensuring, in so far as we can, that alcohol is no longer a factor in road deaths. It is not, as some speakers have claimed, an attack on rural or urban life or any group of persons. The purpose of the proposals is to make our roads safer for us all. Whether one is driving in west Kerry or north Louth, the same rules apply. As it stands, it is against the law to drive with a blood alcohol level above 50 mg per 100 ml. Where the level is between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml, the motorist will, on conviction, have penalty points imposed on his or her licence. This Bill proposes not to change the amount of alcohol motorists may have in their system but to change the penalty for the offence in question such that there will, for a first offence, be an automatic disqualification from driving for three months.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> The question is whether this provision is reasonable and right and, if so, what argument can we make to sustain that position. Road death statistics last year show that, sadly, seven people were killed in County Kerry, which is the same number as died in County Louth. Those two counties are quite different. Louth is the smallest county in the State but has a large urban population and a huge volume of traffic and a motorway running through it. Kerry is a much larger county with an entirely different geography, road network and spread of population. Unfortunately, we saw the same number of deaths on the roads in the two counties in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> Studies carried out by the Road Safety Authority show that over a period of years, an average of seven motorists driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml die on our roads every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">Consider if the people who died in Kerry last year had not died and were saved, or if the seven people who died in Louth had been saved. That is what we must measure by, but we are measuring by the lives that are being saved against the disadvantage, or the perceived disadvantage, of the regulation. Is it better to save lives? The answer, clearly and absolutely, is "Yes".</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> I live in County Louth and the regulation affects the drivers in my county as much as it affects people anywhere else. Sadly, more than 12 people have lost their lives on the roads in County Louth to date this year. This is very sad and it is unacceptable. Anything we can do to save lives should be done, and we must do it. This is why I believe this legislation is important and that Deputies should support its passage.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> As I said in an earlier contribution, in County Louth in November during the world day of remembrance for road traffic victims, more than 600 people attended our local church. They lit candles for the family members they had lost through road traffic accidents in the previous year. Sadly, that list grows every year. I am happy that my vote will be used in the Dáil - whenever the vote is called - to do our very best to reduce that death and carnage on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> The question arises about travel. If a person lives in a rural area, he or she has further to travel for their recreation, be it a pub or whatever. What assistance is proposed for people who live in disparate, distant rural areas where population is of low density and in more remote areas where people are clearly isolated? I believe the proposal for the rural link transport network, which is activated currently during the day, to be made available at certain times at night and at weekends is a socially positive policy. It makes sense that we help people in rural areas to travel in the evening and at night. If it means that more people can go out using public transport in the evening or at night, I do not have a problem with that, especially in areas where people would not otherwise have an opportunity to travel because of the remoteness of where they live. This proposal is excellent and I fully support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> The issues that arise as a result of people going to court was widely broadcast last night on "RTÉ Investigates". When people are brought to court, it is quite shocking that only 48% of those charged with exceeding the blood alcohol level actually get a conviction. I welcome the work done by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charles Flanagan, in meeting with the Attorney General to look at the way the courts deal with the huge volume of business they have to process. In the past year, for example, 382,000 criminal offences, 134,000 civil cases and 36,000 family law cases were brought before the courts. The courts also had to deal with some 60,000 fines and a total of 284 District Court orders were made. A huge volume of work is going through our Courts Service. I welcome the fact that funding for the Courts Service has increased by €20 million this year to bring it to a total of €132 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Within that context, there are disparate policies in respect of sentencing, specifically for drink driving. On last night's RTÉ programme, we found out the statistics that are available by District Court number. We can see why some areas have a much higher rate of convictions for drink driving than other areas. I do not believe that this disparity or difference is acceptable to the public. I understand that 60% of business going through our District Courts is road traffic related. Obviously they are not all drink-driving cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">We need to ensure that the Judicial Council Bill, which was introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality in the Seanad on 22 November, deals with reform of our independent judiciary, will promote excellence, investigate complaints and establish greater accountability from our judicial colleagues. I will not be critical of any judge, which would be improper and it is not the role of a politician to become directly involved in these matters. However, it is our role to ensure judges have continuing education and training and that there is proper sentencing across the country. One issue which we examined last night was that of the poor box. There are places such as Roscommon where the total contribution to the poor box last year was €200, whereas in the wonderful county of Kerry it was €384,000. </p>

          <p eId="para_11">We have a wonderful county as well.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O'Dowd<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T12:25:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">It is wrong that there should be such a huge disparity. Those counties are the two extremes, with most counties in between. If it is mandatory that someone gets penalty points for speeding or other offences, it is wrong that the poor box is used by a judge when he or she is not allowed to do so. I ask the Minister that when the next case comes to his attention, it is appealed to the High Court and it should be overturned. That would be an example of immediate action by the Minister to ensure that the law applies fairly and universally to everybody. It is very important that we increase public confidence in our judicial system and in our courts system. I welcome that under the Judicial Council Bill there can be informal or formal inquiries and that not only judges but also lay people will sit on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The issue around drunk driving is exceptionally clear. I understand the feelings of people in rural areas and the initiative that hopefully the Government will take regarding Rural Link, but ultimately when one sits behind the wheel of one's car, one has to be able to say that one does not have alcohol in one's system, which is a good and positive thing, but one also wants to make sure that the person coming towards the car from the other direction does not have alcohol on him or her either. The only way of ensuring that is by a strict legislative code, which is there. It has been proven that the number of road deaths is falling as a result of our activity against drunken driving. It is good, proper and right that this legislation passes. Anyone can have an accident but I would hate to think that I would be responsible for someone being injured by my car if I had drink on me, even if it was only one drink. I would find it very hard to forgive myself, if I had a choice to drink or not to drink, or to drive or not to drive. The only message we should give is that one cannot drink and drive. Even a small amount of alcohol does affect people according to research conducted in Ireland and internationally. For safer, better, more effective driving, we must do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I am also very concerned that our roads are fit for purpose. I would be concerned if there was any reduction in the moneys made available for the improvement of road junctions and road maintenance. Our secondary roads and small rural roads need much more attention than they often receive. Sadly, we have too many dangerous corners and junctions which continue to cause problems with accidents and sometimes deaths. We must have policies not only regarding the levels of alcohol when driving but also of improving road safety and increasing investment in our rural road network. I constantly receive complaints in my county regarding jobs that need to be done. The council will say it does not have the money and is unable to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I support this legislation. The Minister is acting wisely.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">The Road Safety Authority has done its work well. It acts impartially and the research it produces does not just apply in Ireland - it has a universal application.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I acknowledge that this legislation causes difficulties for some people but the efforts to improve public transport links, particularly in remote rural areas, are very welcome. Fewer people will die on our roads this year and saving lives is the only game in town - everything else is secondary to that.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackieCahill" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Jackie Cahill<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T12:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">I am sharing time with Deputy Eugene Murphy. I have listened to the statistics given by Members on the Government benches but, as a former Taoiseach once said, one can prove anything one likes with statistics. The Government just does not understand how rural Ireland operates or the damage it is going to do to rural Ireland. No one condones drunk driving and I will not stand in this Chamber and say anyone should get behind the wheel of a car when drunk. However, the changes the Government is making to legislation will make it impossible for people to go to a rural pub which, in an awful lot of cases, is their only social outlet. They have to get behind the wheel of a car to go to work the morning after but the new focus on testing in the morning time will make it impossible for them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I enjoy a game of cards and I enjoy the social aspect of pubs in rural areas and rural towns. There is great craic in playing a game of 25, which is described by the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> as a game played by the peasant Irish. I have enjoyed playing it for long hours in country pubs but, unfortunately, that social fabric is becoming a thing of the past. This legislation will cause rural isolation and social isolation of this nature causes mental issues. The legislation will send tremors down the backs of people who enjoy one or two drinks in their local hostelry. If there is no company when one goes into a local pub it is a waste of time but that is what is happening in rural pubs. They are closing in huge numbers and rural publicans now say it is not worth their while opening on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday night. That is a cancer because if one goes to a pub and there is nobody there, one will not go again the next night.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> We are not here to discuss mental health services but this will cause immense mental health issues and I represent a county where no psychiatric bed is available at this moment. We have no Luas in rural Ireland, no taxis, no buses passing the door, no DART and no train service. Even in provincial towns you will not, most nights of the week, get a taxi to take you home. Last night I was at a cumann meeting in a pub in my home town of Thurles. When I came downstairs at 10.30 p.m. there were two people in the pub and this is two weeks before Christmas. I went out to go home at the same time and the town was deserted. There is a taxi rank outside the door but there was no taxi and one would not get one at that time as it is not economic for taxis to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Minister represents south County Dublin and he does not understand what this legislation will do to rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I am very disappointed with rural Deputies on the Government side who have not got the message through to the Minister on the damage and depredation this will do. This legislation will compound an already extremely difficult situation. The social structure in rural communities is under major pressure. This legislation will be the final nail in the coffin of rural areas and rural towns. It will destroy a social fabric we have had for generations. The current legislation makes it illegal for people to drink more than certain prohibited limits. Fianna Fáil introduced mandatory testing and supported legislation which decreased the alcohol limit to one of the lowest in Europe. This is a point on which we need to have some emphasis.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The latest proposal from the Minister, Deputy Ross, is to introduce automatic disqualification for three months for those found driving with a blood alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg. Automatic disqualification for a person in rural Ireland in most cases means the loss of their employment also. At present, this offence is punishable by three penalty points provided the driver is not a learner or a professional driver and has not been found guilty of the same offence within the previous three years. The Minister is portraying the Bill as a catch-all Bill that would prevent more people from drinking and driving. As I said at the outset, no one condones drink-driving, but in our view if the existing legislation was properly enforced, it would be more than adequate.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> There needs to be stronger enforcement of existing laws as well as ways to address the full range of causes of deaths on roads. Research confirms that drivers with a blood alcohol content of between 51 mg and 80 mg make up a very small proportion of the number of fatal collisions. Obviously, none of us want to see any fatal collision. Even one is too many. A report by the RSA on the years from 2008 to 2012 showed 4.6% of cases involved a level of alcohol. Overall, only 11% of cases cited alcohol as a contributory factor. In half of the cases covered in the report, drivers had a blood alcohol content of more than 200 mg per 100 ml, which is four times the legal limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Education and enforcement of existing laws combined is where progress on the issue can be made. In this regard, Ireland is a long way behind. We do not have a mandatory module in schools on the dangers of drink-driving, despite the fact a disproportionate number of fatal collisions involving alcohol involve drivers under the age of 25. In 44% of cases in the RSA report, drivers were not wearing seatbelts, highlighting the need for stronger enforcement and awareness. The Government has proposals on increasing the number of Garda checkpoints. Given the recent breathalyser test issue, the public needs to know the Government is serious about a Garda presence on our roads to prevent and detect drink-driving and decrease speeding, which is a major contributory factor in collisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Most fatal collisions where alcohol is a contributory factor involved drivers whose blood alcohol level is higher than 100 mg. These drivers should face much higher sanctions. Evidence suggests that closing these loopholes and strengthening provisions would be a far more effective means of saving lives. We propose the current penalty points sanction be increased from three to five and that the fine be doubled to €500. We also support increasing penalties for those found driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of 100 mg, as these drivers are responsible for eight out of ten fatal road collisions involving alcohol. We also support increasing penalties for those breaking a driving disqualification who account for approximately one fifth of fatal road collisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Clearly, we need to do more to reduce the incidence of drink-driving on our roads. Increasing the number of gardaí doing checkpoints must be part of this. The real issue is those who are well over the legal limit of 50 mg. In the in-depth study conducted by the RSA on the role of alcohol in fatal collisions between 2008 and 2012, it found alcohol was a factor in approximately 29% of fatal collisions. In eight of out ten of these cases, the blood alcohol content was more than 100 mg per 100 ml. In five out of ten cases, the blood alcohol level was more than 200 mg per 100 ml.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">These are the drivers the Minister must pursue if he really wishes to reduce the number of people killed on our roads. Our penalties for driving with blood alcohol levels above 100 mg are low compared with those in the rest of Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> At present, a condition for a learner driver permit is that the driver must be accompanied by a qualified driver. When a learner driver is identified as unaccompanied, he or she will receive, in the first instance, a fixed charge notice with a fine of €80 and two penalty points. If the learner driver does not pay the fixed charge and is subsequently convicted in court, he or she faces a fine of €2,000 for a first offence, €2,000 for a second or subsequent offence and €2,000 and up to three months in prison for a third or subsequent offence within a 12-month period. He or she will also receive four penalty points. In December 2016, the Road Traffic Act was amended to make it an offence for the owner of a car to allow a learner driver to drive his or her car without a qualified driver present. The Minister is now seeking to commence this part of the Act under the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017, which we will support. Of 100 fatalities on Irish roads up to October 2017, 13 were learner drivers and 11 of them were unaccompanied. Over the five years of 2012 to 2016, an average of 30 learner drivers were involved in serious or fatal road collisions. Unfortunately, 42 of these were fatal road crashes.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> There are many reasons for fatal crashes on our roads. Putting people who are found to have blood alcohol levels of between 50 mg and 80 mg off the road will not reduce the number of fatal crashes on roads, but it will destroy the social fabric of rural Ireland. As I said, nobody wishes to see a fatal road crash. Arriving at the scene of a serious crash is something that lives with a person for a long time. However, the Minister is not taking the correct route. This will do untold damage to the social fabric of rural Ireland. The mental health issues that will arise after its enactment are immense. Unfortunately, when we lose that rural social fabric, it will be gone forever. I plead with the Government to think carefully about the damage this legislation will do to rural areas.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T12:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">Deputy Cahill has said most of what I wished to say. I wish to make it clear, and this point has been missed by many, that Fianna Fáil has always taken a strong line on drink-driving. As my colleague said, we introduced mandatory testing and supported the legislation that decreased the blood alcohol limit to one of the lowest in Europe. When I hear some people say that Fianna Fáil will not support legislation because it is in the hands of the publicans or that we are weak on this issue and do not wish to get involved in this debate in case it would annoy publicans and so forth, they could not be further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I will describe the lobbying in my constituency. Two publicans mentioned this issue to me, and the Minister will be aware that I represent a very big constituency. I have known one of the publicans all of his life. Either he or members of his family always brought people home at night if they thought they were even one sip over the limit. That point has been forgotten. In many respects, rural publicans looked after their customers in a significant way. I worked in my cousin's bar when I was a youngster. The policy at that time, which is a number of years ago and before there was any legislation such as this, was to get people home safely at night and to take their car keys from them where that was necessary. I saw that happen on many occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> This legislation is a huge issue for the fabric of society in rural Ireland. The Minister should examine the drinking habits in rural areas and compare them with those in major urban areas. There is a distinct difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I could safely say there is a higher level of drinking in the major urban areas than in rural areas and I will tell Members why. There is a social issue with many of those rural pubs and small businesses in towns. It is a gathering or meeting place. In most circumstances, it does not involve people who want to get plastered every night of the week, although one will always get one or two. As Deputy Cahill said here, it may involve a game of cards or a meeting. I attend a lot of those meetings, political and otherwise. The pub might be the only place in the local area where one can have a meeting. As there may not be a hall or centre, people might use a room in the pub to have a meeting. Again, I would say that the level of alcohol consumption is quite limited. </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> I will dwell on the issue of enforcement because punishment means little to people if they feel they will not be caught. If they feel they will get away with it, they will not be too concerned. I emphasise we must go back to checkpoints. The introduction of the speed van to catch motorists who were breaking the speed limit was great but a speed van will not catch the drunken driver. This is why we must have more checkpoints if we want to start stamping this out. Our enforcement mechanisms are very poor. </p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Poor roads constitute another issue that sometimes is not addressed at all in respect of many accidents. Anyone living in a rural constituency like mine will see many roads in a desperate state of repair with bad, sharp bends and with no action being taken to address them. I accept that some have been addressed but in general, it is a matter of concern in many parts of rural Ireland. </p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I came across a figure while researching this issue that showed that as of this year, the number of gardaí in the traffic corps was just 663, which is a decrease of 400 gardaí. In many respects, people will use the speed van as a way of saying we do not need them but I return to the point I made earlier. We certainly need checkpoints because speed vans will not in any way detect drunken drivers. </p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Another factor relating to enforcement is the fact that 98% of disqualified drivers fail to return their licences to the Road Safety Authority, RSA, despite being so obliged. As 98% of disqualified drivers still have their licences, if such people are stopped along the roadside and have their licence, they are getting away with it even though they have been disqualified. This can only be described as a disgrace. Fianna Fáil supports increasing the penalties for driving while disqualified. We support increasing the maximum prison sentence from six months to two years and increasing the maximum fine from €5,000 to €15,000. My party believes this will be proper punishment and that we must deal with repeat offenders and have in place strong rules and regulations in this area so they are punished for what they do. </p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Between 2008 and 2012, 39% of drivers involved in fatal collisions where alcohol was a factor were aged between 15 and 24 years of age. We fail young people by not tackling this issue. We are not getting the message about the dangers of drink-driving through to some young people. I always have been a believer in the education system. If we want to get a message through to young people about drink-driving, we need to get into schools - even national schools - as well as secondary schools. We need to get the message across there. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> There are many other things I could say in this regard but Deputy Cahill has covered many of them. </p>
          <p eId="para_41">The legislation creates a challenge for rural Ireland. The Minister has spoken in recent times about the Local Link service, which, I acknowledge, is a good system. However, the Local Link service will not leave everyone home up every little highway or byway in rural Ireland because many of those buses cannot get up and down particular roads. That is the immediate problem. While it may solve part of the problem, it will not solve all of it. Will the Minister take into consideration the challenge this creates for rural Ireland? Those of us on this side of the House who genuinely want to stamp out drink-driving, as I am sure all Members do, are making the case that we do not want the total fabric of rural society completely destroyed.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnHalligan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Skills" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy John Halligan)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T12:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_42">During the course of the debate, we heard a lot of statistics on the rise in drink-driving cases and the level of impairment that can be caused by drink-driving even after consuming low amounts of alcohol. Statistically, it has absolutely been proven. Medical science has proven it and all the indications are that it is absolutely correct. We have also heard concerns that the Bill is too extreme, that it will have a negative effect on rural Ireland and that there will be a financial cost. Since I mentioned statistics, our current laws are definitely not sufficient to deter drink-drivers. That is acknowledged right across the social sphere, even by drivers. It is obvious that our current laws are not sufficient. An average of 740 people were arrested every month in 2017 for drink-driving according to the Road Safety Authority. Research suggests that in the past 12 months, 10% of motorists have driven a vehicle after consuming alcohol. These are staggering statistics. The vast majority of Irish drivers believe that having no alcohol before driving is the only way to be safe. Having read all the statistics and gone through the facts and figures on deaths and injuries as a result of drink-driving, it is the only way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Behind the drink-driving statistics there are tragedies and devastated families. During Leaders' Questions a number of months ago, Christina Donnelly from Waterford was present in the Gallery. Her son was killed by a drink-driver and his friend was also killed in the collision. It was not about politics for her. There are indications from some people that this is about politics - us versus the Opposition or rural versus urban - but that is not the case. It is interesting that we talk about statistics in rural and urban areas and mention things such as checkpoints, enforcement, the Garda traffic corps and poor roads. I accept that Deputies were not saying poor roads are responsible for people drink-driving. If I had my way - I have said this to the Minister - people with any alcohol in their systems would not be allowed to drive. If legislation in this regard could prevent just one death and the devastation of one family once a year, it would be well worth it. It is not beyond the realms of possibility for people who have a drink - and I have a drink - to get a taxi or to arrange something similar in rural areas. I understand the difficulties in such areas. When I go on holidays, I come across nice pubs that are isolated. I might like to go to one and have a drink and have to get a taxi. If all statistics show it is not working, then we have to change it. In all of these statistics, there are indications that many people who may intend to go for one drink do not stop at one.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">They do not intentionally say, "I'm going to have one drink and then drink-drive". The genuinely do not mean that, but very many people end up having an extra drink. There are indications that if someone is ill with the flu or has a heavy cold, one pint can affect their system and how they drive. It all comes back to drinking and then driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> In Ireland, we have developed a culture that is now unacceptable but in the past was deemed all right for someone to say, "I can take two or three pints and I can drive". That is not the case; everybody knows that. Scientists and health officials will tell us the effects of one pint or so many particles of alcohol in one's system. If we are ever to move from the drink-driving culture of our past, we need so send a clear message to motorists that alcohol and driving cannot be tolerated in society. It just does not add up. I am not a member of the medical profession, but I have listened to what they have had to say; I have listened to the debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> I have great sympathy for people in rural areas who might like to have a drink and find themselves enclosed in a small area unable to reach the pub. There must be other ways of doing it rather than allowing them to go to the pub, drink and then drive home. A person can be killed on a rural road, as can happen in an urban centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Some of the criticism that has been levelled at the Minister, Deputy Ross, is unfair and unwarranted. It is a genuine attempt to deal with this issue. Having met groups from all over the country from all walks of life whose families had been affected by drink-drivers or drunk drivers - call it what one likes - he felt there was an onus and responsibility on him. I met those families with him. They were all devastated, having lost loved ones through drink-driving. The Minister, Deputy Ross, felt this was the correct thing to do. It was not politics because he has probably got more criticism than support from politicians. Interestingly, the support he has got from the general public has been completely overwhelming. Radio stations, including those in my area, have been overwhelmingly in their support.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> This is why I support the Bill. I do not support it because it is sponsored by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and he is a comrade and friend of mine. Those of us in the Independent Alliance have differences on it. It would be interesting if other people had sat in the room where I sat with the Minister and 40 or 50 people who had all been affected by someone who was driving having had alcohol. It did not matter if it was four, one, six or ten pints. They all lost loved ones and their families were devastated. People would probably change their minds ever so slightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I am sorry I do not have much more time to talk about this because I am sharing time with my comrade. In consideration of the medical facts and of the statistics from the Road Safety Authority and other groups, this Bill is well worthwhile and will prove beneficial over the next number of years. If everything in the Bill is implemented, it will reduce fatalities and critical injuries on our roads, and will justify what the Minister, Deputy Ross, is trying to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T12:55:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_50">A man when he was asked for directions in a rural area said, "Well, if was going there, I wouldn't start from here". Likewise, if I had been talking about this Bill before it was introduced, I might have taken a different attitude. It has been introduced and is in the public arena for debate. No matter what way we look at it, a decision has to be made. The decision, in turn, will have an impact on our attitude as elected representatives to the issue of drink-driving. In those circumstances, we are running out of options.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Many years ago I repeatedly raised the need for statistics on traffic accidents, in particular on roads with recurring incidents involving deaths over ten, 15 or 20 years. In one location in my constituency, more than 25 fatal accidents have taken place at the same junction or the same part of the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">That draws people's attention to the cause of such accidents. I am not aware of the cause in that particular area. I do not believe that any one of the people involved was over the limit or had any drink taken. It is simply one of those things that happen. We cannot eliminate accidents entirely but we can eliminate some of the causes and it is our duty to so do to the best of our ability. In this instance, it affects rural life to a greater extent than city life mainly because of transport issues but also because of rural depopulation. The transport facilities are not available. Taxis and late night buses are not available in rural Ireland because there is not the population to justify providing them. That population has been decreasing for many years. The Opposition Members will say the current Government or the previous one depopulated rural areas. That is not the case and the former Minister opposite knows well that the population has been decreasing for many years. Planners had an impact on it also because as we all know, and we must criticise them from time to time, planning policy in rural Ireland has been to limit to a huge extent the number of people who wish to live in rural Ireland. I refer to the indigenous local population, which has been scaled down gradually over many years to the extent that we have arrived in a situation where the economics of providing the ancillary services we normally expect and enjoy in towns and cities no longer obtain and it is no longer viable to present that. We should keep that at the back of our minds as we talk about this particular subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> We need to examine the problems that make life more difficult in rural Ireland and the difficulties that this or other legislation creates in rural Ireland. Transport is one of those. My colleague, Deputy Heydon, has set up an initiative to co-ordinate a number of Rural Link services in such a way as to provide transport - not necessarily for socialising but for necessary travel - that people in rural Ireland are as entitled to expect to be able to avail of as are their colleagues in the city areas. It is not easy to do that but it is possible and it must be done independently of the subject under discussion. If not, it will be seen as a means of continuing to support what is known now as a drink culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> That said, we must also accept that all people, tourists included, like to enjoy the hospitality of the country and the cities but there is no question but that it is easier to do so in the cities than it is in rural areas. Whether we want to support the development of the tourism industry and other industries in rural parts of the country is a matter for ourselves. We can turn our backs on that or we can do something about it. I believe we have to do something about improving the social fabric and the quality and level of services such as co-ordination of the Rural Link transport system and any other means whereby we can affect positively the attractiveness of rural Ireland and its services that, within reason, must be on a par with those available elsewhere. That is a challenge but, nonetheless, it must be done. If we do not do it, we will have a continued erosion of the quality of life in rural Ireland. It was stated that the Garda stations have closed down. That is the case in both urban and rural Ireland. That is not a point for the Minister but a fact of life that they have closed.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">I stand corrected by my colleague. It happened during the term of office of a previous Government. I will refrain from mentioning which Government happened to be in power at the time, but I do remember it. My memory is not that bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> There was a large list of closures of facilities all over the country. The Opposition nowadays is jumping up and down, howling with indignation about the closure of post offices, schools, libraries and other services in rural Ireland. They were identified, pursued and closed then and nothing at all was said about it. It does no harm occasionally to review where we came from, where we were, and who made the proposals at that particular time. We can revisit that subject at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> We have to move on from there, however, and improve ourselves and we are in the throes of doing that now. We have options when it comes to this legislation. We can walk away from it, but what is the message then? The message to the young people of the country would be wrong. The message to people who dare to drink and drive irresponsibly and recklessly would also be wrong. I would not be happy to give that message now, because by doing so we would be contributing to the sorrow and hardship caused to families in urban and rural Ireland by someone driving while over the limit. In those circumstances, we as legislators have no option other than to support the legislation. We have to balance the issues and decide of what we are in favour. </p>
          <p eId="para_62"> On the totality of the issues that affect rural Ireland and the country in general and how this legislation is likely to impact on it, there is no doubt that it will have a different impact on rural Ireland compared to the cities. There is no question about that. Members have said that things are different in the country, and that is true. There are longer distances to travel and a greater degree of isolation. It is possible to be isolated in urban settings as well, but the difference is fundamental. On the one hand, we have the legislation and, on the other, we can say that we are not in favour of curtailing drink-driving. That would be a very strange message. If we send that message from this House, we would be doing ourselves a great disservice, notwithstanding all of the things that need to be dealt with or the issues that people on the opposite side of the House and some on this side have spoken about. </p>
          <p eId="para_63"> Regardless of the outcome, we need to look very carefully at the issues which affect rural Ireland, including transport, culture, social life and the need to ensure that people are attracted to living in rural Ireland in the future. We cannot just draw a line on the map and say that one will be fine if he or she is fortunate enough to live inside that line, or that if one lives in a city, he or she will be fine and, if not, things will be different. Incidentally, we all hear from time to time about how the Government has neglected rural Ireland. Rural Ireland has been on the decline for quite a long time, and it is up to us to realise that, de-politicise that situation and attempt to do something about it by way of providing Garda stations and post offices, dealing with the decline of the population, and dealing with the area of planning. The issue in greatest need of improvement is planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">We can legislate in this area so that there will be a population in rural Ireland in the future and people will wish to live there because the services they need will be there and will be on par with the services available elsewhere in the country and overseas.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">The fact is that if one wants to go to Carraroe, or to Dingle in Kerry I presume, after 6 p.m., one has to take a taxi, walk or drive because the Minister has done nothing to provide commuter services late into the evening out of the any of the major towns or cities, not to mention the very rural areas of Ireland. There are 20,000 people living in south Connemara. Does the Minister imagine that all the young people are expected to go home at 6 p.m. or to use a car? The Minister, Deputy Ross, is the most ineffective Minister so I am sorry that I must take back my congratulations on the Luas. That was all decided long before the Minister came along. He was just the lucky man who was there with the Taoiseach to pull the ribbon the other day.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> This issue goes to the nub of this Bill. I believe that any death on the road is one death too many. I am sure the Minister agrees with me. However there are places we will not go to stop road deaths. We would not set a speed limiter to 5 km/h or 10 km/h in every car to ensure that no car could go faster than that. Technically speaking, it would be very effective, but in the real world we would not go there because it would be disproportionate when measured against the convenience of a car. It is an exaggerated example, but such examples are quite good for pointing out fundamental principles, in this case the principle of proportionality, which we all accept in our day-to-day lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> The reality is that, if we want to cut down on road accidents, the first thing we should look at is the vehicles themselves. One thing has greatly decreased the level of mortality caused by cars in the past 30 or 40 years. There were twice the number dying of people every year 20 or 30 years ago when there were far fewer cars on the road. The reason for the decrease is not really that people have become safer or slower drivers. We should not cod ourselves that all of these driving tests have made drivers much more skilful. The safety features of the vehicles have had the biggest impact on road mortality. Crumple zones, seat belts, airbags and all of these things mean that, thankfully, people survive accidents they would not have survived 30 or 40 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The Minister and I come from the same part of the world so he will know Raglan Road. He will know the song of the same name which goes, "On Raglan Road on an autumn day." When I was a child, there was a winking willy on Raglan Road and Elgin Road. In other words, there was a traffic light which showed a red light in one direction and an orange light in the other and which winked. It was one of the few roads in Dublin at the time which had such a device. It was put there because there had been a car accident there at some time in the 1950s in which somebody had been killed because both the person coming from Elgin Road and the person coming from Raglan Road thought they had the right of way. It would be fair to say an equivalent type of accident happening nowadays would be very unlikely to kill anybody. Neither car would have been doing more than 25 mph, 30 km/h or 35 km/h. </p>
          <p eId="para_77"> The first thing we should look at is technology. It is very important that we examine the possibilities for reducing accidents using technology in cars. The Minister will point to all of the changes which have taken place, including others which I have not mentioned. There are two very obvious changes which could be introduced, however. The first is that a device could be built into every car which would prevent ignition if the driver was over the legal blood-alcohol limit. That could be mandatory for all new cars. It might add a little bit to the cost of a car but it would reduce the insurance considerably. The second measure would be to link a governor in a car to a GPS system, as is done with trucks. This system would have all the speed limits in the country recorded within it. This would make it impossible for a car to exceed the speed limit. </p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Sometimes, however, I think people do not like such solutions because they do not get to punish anybody. It would be not much fun if the problem was solved without punishing people. I think that people sometimes have a sadistic wish to punish people, rather than solving problems and making things safe. If the Minister really wants to cut down the number of car accidents, let us look to technology first of all.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> It is very interesting that one of the safest ways to travel is by aeroplane. One of the reasons that aeroplanes are so safe is that most of the time the pilots are not flying the planes. They are not even landing the planes nowadays. It is done by computer because the computer does not take days off, it does not get tired and it tends to be consistent. The Minister will point to the occasional accident in which the computer might have been the problem, but in more than 99% of cases it is much more reliable than a human being. Therefore, all the precedents are there to show that if we want to cut down accidents, the first thing that should be looked to is technology and enforced technology. </p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The next issue we must look at is the number of fatal accidents, or of accidents in which there was serious injury, which occur because people do not wear seat belts. Is it more than the number of accidents which occur because people have a blood-alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml? If it is a higher figure, that issue should be dealt with. Again, there is a technological solution. A car should not be able to move off unless all the people sitting in it are wearing seat belts. I have personal reason to appreciate the importance of seat belts. As was well reported at the time, I was in a car which was involved in a serious head-on collision. I have no doubt that the technical knowledge, experience and training of the driver saved our lives. He did something which not many lesser trained drivers would have. This particular driver was top of the range. When the car went straight for him, he took it on the nose. I queried him afterwards and he said that he was trained to do so because cars are designed to crumple from the front. Notwithstanding my experience, a head-on accident is potentially fatal.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">In spite of the fact that he had braked and was almost stationary, the other car hit us at a significant speed. I have no doubt that the fact that each of the three people in the car was wearing a seat belt saved our lives. This House should deal with the issue of the non-usage of seat belts, which accounts for far more fatalities than the people targeted by the Bill, those driving with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml. There are many things on which we agree and on which we would like the Minister to act. </p>
          <p eId="para_82"> I do not agree with drink-driving. I was part of a Government that introduced the 50 mg to 80 mg limit. I have no problem with the principle of it being totally unacceptable for a person to drive with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml in their blood. That is not the issue. It is no more acceptable to do that having left a rural pub than it is to do so having left an urban pub. That is not the issue because if it is illegal, it is illegal. Nobody has proposed that it should be made legal; all Members agree it should be illegal. The issue is the proportionality of the penalty. Speeding results in three penalty points and using one's mobile phone incurs four. A driver is not disqualified for using his or her phone even though it is highly dangerous but we are not saying it is legal. A person is not automatically disqualified for speeding. Perhaps that should be the case for those driving at higher speeds because that is a massive cause of accidents, as can be seen from the statistics. However, that has not been done. Perhaps there should be a differentiation and a driver should receive two points for being less than 10 km/h over the speed limit but three points for being between 10 km/h and 20 km/h over the limit and so on. It sometimes seems ridiculous that a driver would receive the same fixed charge notice for driving at 90 km/h or 120 km/h in an 80 km/h zone. That is disproportionately weighted in favour of a person driving far in excess of the limit compared to a person who might have slid over the limit. All Members know of people who have received a sanction while driving on quiet rural roads through small, sleepy villages with no pub. I know a village that has no pub or shop but, rather, only a primary school that I assure the Minister does not open at night. I have seen a Gatso van in that village and good luck to them. It will catch people doing 59 km/h. If one is caught, one is caught. </p>
          <p eId="para_83"> Let us take the example of a person who is caught driving with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml and put off the road. That person may live and work in the city and not need his or her car for work and his or her children may go to a local school or a location to which there is a bus or train, as is standard in the city. If the person is disqualified for the appropriate period, it is an inconvenience to him or her but not a huge cost. It might be a cause of embarrassment but life goes on. When I come to Dublin, I often leave the car in the Oireachtas, whether I am staying in the city centre or in south County Dublin. I use shank's mare or the DART. It is far quicker and more convenient and I can get anywhere in the city that I wish. If all else fails, I can get a taxi at 2 a.m. at a modest cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> Proportionality of penalty is a fundamental principle. Let us now take an example of a person who lives in west Kerry or west Galway and is similarly caught driving with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg and put off the road. I note that unfortunately Deputy Danny Healy-Rae has left the Chamber. We could take the example of a person working in Galway. That reminds me of the night a television compère complained that I had been driven home to Cornamona. He asked me why I had not taken the train and I told him there is no train to Cornamona. He asked me why I had not taken the bus and I explained that there is no bus to Cornamona. How the hell was I meant to get there? If one takes the licence of a person living in my area of Galway, as opposed to a person in the city, he or she would have to pay to be driven to and from work and for their children to be driven to and from school because the Government has cut the school transport system and if ten children do not live on the road on which one travels to school, a bus will not be provided. Many schools in rural Ireland have no school bus service. A driving ban would make day-to-day life impossible for such a person in terms of work and ferrying his or her children to all the events that children must attend. The Minister should start doing the sums. If such a person has to pay a driver every day, how much would it cost per week? Our argument is not against the offence being illegal but, rather, against the disproportionality of the penalties in terms of the impact on different communities. If a penalty were to be introduced that would disproportionately impact upon those living in cities and who have access to transport, we would never hear the end of it because we are told that a system cannot disproportionately penalise one group of people over another.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> To show our good faith and intentions on the issue, Fianna Fáil believes the Minister should accept the compromise we have suggested, which is that five penalty points should be given to a person with an alcohol level of between 50 mg and 80 mg per 100 ml. A person with seven penalty points would be disqualified on receiving such a sanction. Habitually risk-taking drivers would be disqualified. Most people in rural Ireland would become very careful in order not to get caught again if they had received five penalty points for drink-driving because a speeding infraction would add another three penalty points and it would not take many more points to accumulate 12 and be disqualified. The Minister must be rational and appreciate that I am not justifying drunk driving but that the penalties are disproportionate in terms of the impact on rural and urban dwellers. There is a good proposal here. We should see if it will have an effect and we should do all we can to reduce fatalities on the road, rather than become obsessed with one tiny little cohort of the causes of fatal accidents. An easy issue to address is that of seat belts. It should not be possible to drive a car without all occupants' seat belts being fastened. That would save many lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> It is time to think it out again. Nobody in their right mind condones a person driving while impaired through alcohol. It is also fair to acknowledge that a person can inadvertently be caught with a blood-alcohol limit of between 50 mg and 80 mg. It is an uncertain science and results are affected by body weight and so on. A person may have had a night out and could be caught the next day with a level of 50 mg or 55 mg despite thinking he or she was safe to drive. That could affect people with families, jobs and so on who would find their lives tumbling apart not because of the fine or social inconvenience, but because they could not do their daily tasks without a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> Finally, in my last 40 seconds, I wish to say I cannot understand why the Minister has not yet moved on the funding imbalance in favour of urban bus services as against rural bus services or why he has not modernised bus services in rural Ireland if he really wants to provide for a better quality of life. He has been totally inactive on policy. Every time we ask him about policy, all he says is that it is a matter for the National Transport Authority, NTA, or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, or someone else. The Minister is the Minister. Policy is his remit and only his. Will he start making policy?</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_88">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill. At first, to be honest, I grappled with the Bill, but I stand here as a parliamentarian faced with a very simple choice. There has probably been an element of muddying of the waters in this debate, particularly on the part of the Opposition, and I will touch on those points in a while. We have a simple choice. Do we support a Bill that does not change the blood alcohol concentration limit at which someone who is driving breaks the law but instead changes the penalty in respect of this offence, or do we vote against the Bill and potentially send out a message that we as a Parliament are saying drink-driving - people driving on our roads while impaired and not in full possession of their senses and who could meet me, a loved one of mine or someone else close to me on those roads - is okay in this country? This is a very stark choice. Broken down in these simple terms, I will support the Bill. We should consider the message we would send nationally and internationally if we were to choose the latter option. Internationally, we think of our tourists, who want to come here on holiday and drive the Wild Atlantic Way. The message could come out that they could meet people who drink and drive home from pubs and that they should be careful when on our roads. These are the very simple messages. We are all about simple messages here and this is how a decision to oppose the Bill could be translated. If the Bill saves just one life, that is one whole family and extended circle of friends that will be saved the anguish and horror of a death on our roads which, particularly when caused by a drink-driver, is so avoidable. Therefore, I stand here with an absolutely clear conscience in the belief that supporting the Bill is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> I referred to muddying of the waters. There has been talk of old men in their 90s who live in isolated rural areas and travel to the local pub three nights a week for two pints at a time and leave it at that. The focus of this debate has been all on the right of that man to have his couple of pints and then drive his car home. The question has been asked, what harm is it. We have been told such people have done so for years, that we should let them go and that they will never cause an accident. There are a number of parts to this argument. Fair play to the old man who is that disciplined because I, for one, have been in situations in which I have gone for one, but one was actually one round because I was with a friend, which makes two, and then all of a sudden someone buys a third pint. The car has been out of the equation since the first pint but there is a second. This pressure rolls on and if one does not have a backup plan as to how one gets home, if one lives in an area in which taxis are not available, all of a sudden one is in that spot because it was not planned for accordingly. An awful lot of this is about planning and preparation. Instead of the focus being on that man being entitled to drink his few pints and drive home, we should get to the nub of the problem that the man is living on his own, is lonely and is suffering in social isolation.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I am delighted that the Bill has brought forward into the House this discussion about the challenges we face in rural Ireland. This debate should be about the fact that there are plenty of people living in rural Ireland who cannot access taxis or easily get about and the majority of whom do not want to have a drink. My mother is a retired woman in her 70s. She is very active and loves to play whist and bridge. That is her thing. She is never out later than 11 o'clock at night, but she and her friends, particularly at this time of the year, are out playing for turkeys every night of the week. Luckily enough, she is able to drive to such events, but sometimes she will bring friends and neighbours who do not have lifts. Not everyone is always lucky enough to have someone who can pick them up and bring them home. I welcome that this issue of social isolation is being brought to the fore. However, when we talk about rural transport, something about which I am passionate, as the Minister is aware, we allow the debate get sucked into the topic of what the people will use the bus for and, when they get to the rural destination on the rural bus, what they will do. We never ask this question when Dublin Bus announces additional routes or when Bus Éireann runs extra routes from Limerick to Galway but somehow we get fixated on what these people will do in this regard. I will tell the House what they will do. We should consider where the Local Link rural bus services are working really well, such as in south Kildare with the Athy-Newbridge route that goes through small rural areas such as Kildangan, Kilberry and Nurney. We should consider the very extensive list of routes in the Kerry area, with which I have become very familiar in recent times. I refer to Carmel Walsh and the great Local Link team down there. They offer such a wide array of services and access for people in rural areas. Our problem currently is that most of these routes finish at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the day and that there is no access in the evenings. In the summertime, if there were more routes operational in the evenings, people could go down into their villages to see the local GAA club play a match and get that bus back home afterwards. They might go for a pint and they are free to do so if they want - it is a free country - or they might want to go play bingo or cards or just call on other elderly relatives and friends who also live alone. What we want to do, and what we should be focused on as a Government, is to improve this access in order that people can move around their areas as best they can. That is why I am trying to move the conversation on from what is a very narrow debate here to what is a much more important and much broader one.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> In ten, 15 or 20 years' time, I think we will look back on this debate and be shocked by some of the arguments made, in the same way as we look back 20 years and see the adverts that say "don't drive with five" because it was fine to drive after having drunk four pints back then. We laugh now to think that was so acceptable. Similarly, people will look back on this debate we are having about how much drink-driving is okay. It will not be socially acceptable. It is probably already not socially acceptable in large parts of the country, even though Members of this House are making that argument now. In time we will see that debate move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> This is why, as chairman of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party, I engage with the Minister on the issue of social isolation. I accept in our dealings that he definitely wants to bring about improvements to this in rural Ireland and I have been impressed by his response to the issue and the engagement I know he has had with a number of rural groups. He has taken on board their points and concerns about the Bill. The Bill has opened up a conversation about a much bigger issue. I engage with the Local Link rural bus transport network to see how we can take what is a very good model with huge potential and make it better. Working with Local Link, we came up with an initial proposal of 38 routes across 12 Local Link companies in 15 counties. Donegal, Tipperary and Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon - there is one Local Link for the latter three counties - also have proposals for consideration to be submitted to the Minister and the NTA. This is not a silver bullet; it is a very significant pilot proposal that, were it to be funded and enacted, would provide more than 11,000 additional trips around rural Ireland per annum. This would allow people go play cards or bingo, carry out visitations, go to the pub or do whatever else they want to do and would increase flexibility. So much of what is at the heart of rural transport is that it ends up being community-led, so why are we here saying there is no point in putting on buses in certain areas because there is no activity in those areas? It is a chicken-and-egg scenario. There is no activity in the village because no one who lives in the rural hinterland surrounding it can get into the village. However, Carmel Walsh in Kerry Local Link or Alan Kerry in Kildare will say that once this discussion came about, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, in parts of Kerry became involved. There was a group from Valentia Island that wanted to go dancing in Killarney. They inquired about the proposal of a late evening bus from Valentia to Portmagee that would then link them up with a bigger bus that would bring them into Ireland's National Event Centre, the INEC, in Killarney. If a man nearby wants to get on that bus and go for a pint, more luck to him, or if a couple want to go out for a meal or to the cinema, who cares? The fact is we have provided for accessibility into a remote part of rural Ireland, probably one of the remotest any of us could think of. These are lovely places to visit during the summer, but at this time of the year, with long, dark evenings, they are lonely places to live on one's own. These are the kinds of ideas we should consider. We have a co-funded HSE rural community project that does visitations to people who live on their own. The group was considering organising an event whereby 12 or 14 people would come together in Ballylongford in north Kerry and improve accessibility for these people. This happens already in Lyracrumpane, where about 15 people get together once a week for a game of cards, facilitated by the rural transport network. This brings a flexibility to their activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I was on local radio in Kerry recently because I was the subject of some criticism in respect of this proposal. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, unfortunately, ran to a journalist to attack the proposal, presumably before he realised that his constituency in Kerry would be the biggest beneficiary of the proposal, with 15 of the 38 routes. While he was critical in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, the Minister will be happy to hear that he clarified on Radio Kerry in a debate with me that he was very supportive of the proposal and I am sure he will put that support on the record of the House in the not too distant future.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">He was keen to tell the people of Kerry how much he supports rural transport, which I am sure is the case. Meanwhile, his brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, had a pop at me in the House last week, claiming that I do not understand rural Ireland and that no part of County Kildare can be described as rural. In fairness to him, he invited me to visit the Ring of Kerry and other rural parts of the county. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said on a previous occasion that this Government does not recognise anything outside the M50. Perhaps Danny Healy-Rae is under the confused impression that all of Kildare is inside the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> As a member of a rural community in south Kildare and having been a farmer before I was a Deputy, as chairman of Fine Gael's agriculture committee for five years and a member of the Oireachtas joint committee dealing with rural affairs for the past two years, I assure the Deputy that we do have rural areas in south Kildare. Indeed, the challenges for people in Bigstone, Carbury, Levitstown and Ballymore Eustace are every bit as real as those facing people in Kerry, Mayo or Donegal. I do not need to take the Deputy up on of his offer to visit Kerry as I have holidayed there several times and hope to go again next August with my family. If I am driving around Kerry with my wife in the passenger seat and my two children in the back, I do not want to encounter a driver who has had three, four or five pints, no matter how large a dinner he or she might have had. I return Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's offer by inviting him to visit south Kildare. I understand Kerry but he does not seem to have much understanding of my county. If he takes up my offer, he will see that we share many of the same struggles and hold the same position on many issues. The problem is that the debate has become skewed and there is political point-scoring going on in some quarters.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> I am passionate about rural transport and the potential it has to improve the quality of life of people living in rural areas. In many ways, we are only scratching the surface with the existing provision. Of the 17 Local Link companies in operation, I am the first to acknowledge that some are more proactive and better developed than others. If the pilot scheme I have proposed is given a chance, over the course of six months or a year we will see passenger numbers matching those on the Athy to Newbridge route in south Kildare and other successful routes across the country. By opening up access to rural transport in the evenings, we offer whole communities a new lease of life. This is not about getting people to and from the pub but, rather, connecting communities. A previous speaker noted that an bord snip nua, which was established during the recession under the chairmanship of Mr. Colm McCarthy, recommended that the then allocation of €11 million for rural transport should be reduced. I was one of the advocates arguing that rural transport was, in fact, one of the national programmes that offered best value for money. I remain convinced of that and, as such, welcome the increase in funding to €17 million. That investment is coming back to us fourfold.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> There remains a great deal more to be done. In Kildare we are fortunate to have a very good director of services for transport as well as supportive councillors. Next year, local property tax revenues will be used to put branding on Local Link buses and develop bus shelters in designated locations. The National Transport Authority has given the go-ahead to the Kildare-South Dublin Local Link service to install 41 lollipop-sign bus stops and advertise the timetables. These sound like simple things but, as it stands, the service is too <i>ad hoc</i> to be as successful as it can be. Some €15,000 has been put aside to trial a system next year, which will engage a number of local hackney drivers to provide an extended service to rural areas in County Kildare. People often complain about the difficulty of getting a taxi, but the problem is that everybody wants to avail of the service at the same time of the week, usually a Friday or Saturday night. The local hackney driver in my area, Donie King, is often subjected to complaints because, at the most popular times, it can take him two hours to get to a job, if he can do it at all. However, he has a much smaller workload during the week. Under the trial arrangement, drivers like Donie King will be paid a retainer to remain on stand-by to accommodate people in rural areas who cannot otherwise access rural transport. This means that Mrs. Murphy, who does not live on the linear route from Athy to Newbridge but is within 5 km of it, can telephone Local Link to say she needs to get to Newbridge the next day. The hackney driver will call to her house and take her to the Local Link bus. Her business might be in Newbridge, in Naas General Hospital or in Dublin, but the connectivity is now there to allow her to make her journey via public transport. If we invest adequately in the services, there is great potential there for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_98"> As I said, we have only scraped the surface of what can be achieved. Enhancing transport services is the single greatest action we can take to address quality of life issues in rural areas. Colleagues will recall that The Gathering initiative was successful not because people in Dublin issued instructions about it but because rural communities across the length and breadth of the country embraced it as the great idea it was. I recall that I was driving to a meeting in Kilcullen the same day we had the media reports of how Gabriel Byrne had ridiculed the whole idea of The Gathering. Expecting to encounter a cool response at the meeting, I instead found great enthusiasm among members of the local community and a determination to get involved in encouraging expatriates who were born in the area to return for a visit. That initiative worked because people all over the country bought into it and the same can be achieved in the area of rural transport. Enabling groups of people to travel to a central point and engage in social activities together is good for communities. The Government will never fix all the problems of rural areas and the Opposition will always attack it on that basis. It is our job to enable rural communities to become more self-sufficient by helping themselves. One way of doing so is to address the deficit in public transport that exists in rural Ireland. I hope my proposal receives a positive hearing because it has huge merit as an extensive pilot. If it proves successful, it can be rolled out throughout the country. I thank the Minister for his engagement on this matter and look forward to further engagement with him in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Lowry<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T13:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_99">I do not support or encourage drink-driving. Everyone can enjoy alcohol if it is consumed responsibly, as the vast majority of people do, and there is personal responsibility for one's actions and behaviour. Nobody in this House or outside it condones a situation where a driver who has taken excessive alcohol causes an accident or fatality. I have met the various representative groups advocating on this matter, some of which support the Government proposals and some of which oppose them. I have supported the Government on several important matters since its establishment. In this instance, however, I cannot and will not support the legislation that has been presented to the House. The Minister's priorities are wrong in this matter and he has brought forward measures that are unnecessary and excessive and which target the wrong cohort of people. In particular, the Bill will impact on people living in isolated rural parishes that are far removed from public transport services. The Minister is fortunate that in his constituency one can choose between the DART, Luas and bus. Alternatively, a taxi will arrive to one's home within ten to 15 minutes. We in Tipperary, as elsewhere in rural Ireland, do not have any of those transport options. I was in Thurles last weekend and it proved impossible to get a taxi to my home in Holycross. There are insufficient numbers of taxi vehicles and, in addition, demand tends to peak at certain times.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> My main concern regarding these proposals is that the penalties it sets out are totally disproportionate. This will particularly affect young people who need to travel to work after having enjoyed a few drinks the night before as part of a social occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">We are hearing about people who get up in the morning to go to work. I have great admiration for the young person who is able and capable of working, who gets up in the morning, does a day's work, goes out to socialise and does the right thing by leaving the car behind and then gets a taxi home. However, perhaps because of his or her body mass or as a result of a misunderstanding regarding how fast the body can eliminate the after-effects of alcohol, he or she is busted the following morning at a checkpoint. The person might fail the test by the slightest margin and yet, as a result, he or she is put off the road completely. This is totally disproportionate. That person's job is impacted. He or she is willing to make his or her contribution to society, earn his or her keep and not be a burden on anybody. That person is penalised to an extent that is unfair, unjust and disproportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> Gardaí operating in our communities need the support and must enjoy the confidence of the public. The Garda should show a lot more discretion with morning-after breathalysing, which has terrorised rural Ireland. In many areas, people have a bunker-down attitude. They are afraid to do the normal things one would expect, especially from young people. If young people do the right thing and obey the law, and the day after they find they are disqualified from driving due to being a minimal amount over the limit, it means the repercussions of the legislation are excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> I represent the constituency of Tipperary North. Tipperary is a rural, inland county that has suffered all the negative effects of being situated away from the coast and major cities. It is split into two large, sprawling constituencies that are home to numerous small to medium-sized rural towns and villages. Over the years, I have witnessed the gradual decline of all these towns and villages. Towns such as Thurles, Templemore, Nenagh, Tipperary town, Cahir, Cashel and Carrick-on-Suir, which were once lively, vibrant places to work and live have struggled over time and, despite all, have still managed to survive. This is due in no small measure to the strong sense of community spirit and belonging that pervades these places. Most have managed to survive, not as a result of Government grants or subsidies, but from a huge volunteering effort on the part of many locals and groups in activities such as Tidy Towns competition, local festivals, etc. We should salute these people for the wonderful efforts they continue to make in order to ensure that future generations will be able to remain in these rural towns and villages that are such a part of our history. The towns and villages in question are hurting badly. This hurt is increasing on a daily basis. If we drive through any of them, we will see far too many signs proclaiming "For Sale" or "For Rent". We also have too many boarded-up shopfronts. The principal and often only activities in many of these places relate to local primary and second-level schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> In recent years, all of these towns and villages have witnessed the closure of small factories, Garda stations, post offices and many small retail outlets. If this legislation is to pass, we will witness the closure of numerous small rural pubs that are already desperately struggling to survive. Since time immemorial, the pub has been a focal point of social life in rural Ireland. We only need look at television series such as "The Riordans" in the 1960s and 1970s, "Glenroe", "Fair City" and "Ros na Rún" to see the role the pub plays in Irish social life. They are often described as friendly and homely places. Many people believe they foster social relationships among residents, strengthen the level of cohesion in villages and positively contribute to communal well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Many elderly people who live alone in very isolated areas often use the pub as often their only weekly social outing when they can meet friends in a relaxed environment to play a game of cards or simply have a chat. Many Members of this House, myself included, use the pub for political clinics, meetings or simply to meet constituents and be informed on local and personal topical issues. Recent studies, including one published in the <i>International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality, </i>have found that in the UK, for example, pubs have a very positive and significant impact on social engagement and involvement among residents living in the English countryside. Significantly, the study in question also found that this positive effect increased threefold between the years 2000 and 2010, possibly because pubs have become increasingly important because, as in Ireland, other essential services, such as post offices and village shops, have closed. The study also highlights the fact that parishes with pubs have more community events, such as sports matches, charity events and social clubs, than those which do not have pubs. Put simply, opportunities for community initiatives would be vastly reduced or non-existent in these parishes without the presence of a pub. The same applies to Ireland, if not more so.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Local Garda stations - in the days before a number of them were closed - were not just places where somebody could go to get assistance with some aspect of State administration. Very often, a person would use the opportunity of his or her visit to keep gardaí informed of any suspicious activity of which he or she might be aware. To a great degree, the pub is now the only place where members of a local community can share information and concerns and, by so doing, help to support and protect each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> Nor should we forget the key role pubs, including those in rural areas, play in the context of the tourism industry. Research shows that more than 80% of tourists frequent pubs to get food or for entertainment purposes. The pub is the number one tourism attraction for many people who visit Ireland. Let us also not forget that the Irish pub was previously voted as the number one tourist attraction in Ireland by the <i>Lonely Planet </i>guide.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> There is a jobs aspect to rural pubs. Current figures indicate that more than 90,000 people are dependent on the drinks industry for employment. The majority of these individuals work in the pub trade. The reality is that pubs create badly-needed jobs - often part-time in nature - in rural areas where there is not much other employment. The closure of huge numbers of these rural pubs, which is the inevitable outcome if this legislation is passed, will mark the end of these rural villages in all but name. In many of these villages, the picture is usually the same: the creamery closed long ago; the local meal store is closed; the hardware shop is closed; the post office is closed; the petrol station is closed; and the comer shop is either closed or on the brink of closure. The local pub is often the only survivor, even though it probably only opens at night or on weekends. Through this proposed legislation, we are now threatening to close that too. The closure of these pubs will have very significant effects on rural areas and those who live there. Already cut off from society, this final straw will further isolate these people. The consequential results will manifest themselves in ever-increasing mental health issues, including depression and a rising rate of suicide. Those living alone go to the local pub to meet friends, have a drink or two and then go home. This is the highlight of their week apart, perhaps, from attending mass in the local church.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_111">A nation and a society must hold certain values and qualities, of which one is to nurture and protect its artists, and particularly its musicians. The RTÉ symphony and concert orchestras have been an essential and acclaimed part of our national cultural life over many decades. Founded in 1948, they have become the biggest employers of musicians throughout the country. The orchestras are a key component of our musical ecosystem. Many of our graduates from Ireland's music schools, academies and colleges gain employment in them and others aspire to become members. Standards of excellence in performance are set by the orchestras for others to emulate. Many of their members engage in education, many teach in higher education and many perform across the country. Their reach is far and wide. In the words of Aodán Ó Dubhgaill, the orchestras have a singular place in the Irish musical heritage. They have nurtured through performance and education generations of world-class musicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> RTÉ has announced a review of its two orchestras amid challenging financial circumstances - that is code for RTÉ being in deep financial trouble. The orchestras are already short of 30 musicians, there have been suggestions that they will be 40 musicians short next year. Some fear that there might be an amalgamation leading to the loss of the entire concert orchestra. Other managers are talking about one fifth of orchestral musicians being lost to the system. There is no sense of future planning or vision for these orchestras.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> The Government cannot wash its hands of this and cannot stand idly by. The orchestras are a national treasure. They have developed a tradition of musical excellence that has been built up painstakingly over decades and are a key part of our national cultural life. I ask the Taoiseach to intervene to ensure that the allocation for orchestras be ring fenced and not fall victim to RTÉ's genuine financial difficulties. It cannot become a victim in the ongoing tug of war between RTÉ and the Government regarding the licence fee. The Government, through the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment should intervene and I ask the Taoiseach to ask them to do so and to do what is necessary. If that requires further Exchequer funds in addition to their revenue from the RTÉ licence fee allocation, then so be it, that should be done. The two orchestras could then plan with a degree of certainty and excitement for the future instead of being at the whim of various reviews every year. There was one such review in 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Is it the Taoiseach's intention to intervene to guarantee that ring fenced funding for the two orchestras?</p>

          <p eId="para_115">I share the Deputy's sentiments on the orchestras. I would not like to see either being lost, or the two being merged. I read a letter in the newspaper recently - I cannot remember who wrote it - which pointed out that Finland, which is a similar sized country to ours, has many orchestras while we have only two. In the past the Army had bands and orchestras, but it no longer does, and we now have only two orchestras. I would like to see both retained and for both to prosper.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I will ask the two Ministers who have some line responsibility for the matter to come together to examine the issue and see what can be done about it. The two Ministers are Deputy Josepha Madigan, as Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Minister, Deputy Denis Naughten, who is currently in Paris, has responsibility for RTÉ through his Department. I will ask them to examine the issues to see if anything can be done to secure the future of the two orchestras. The Deputy has my commitment on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> However, it is important that orchestras do not get caught up-----</p>

          <p eId="para_119">It is important that orchestras do not get caught up or find themselves used as part of any attempt to campaign for an increase in the licence fee. RTÉ receives considerable revenues from the licence fee, from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and it also receives commercial revenues. That gives it an income - I cannot give an exact figure but it must be some €200 or €300 million, it is certainly more than €100 million - and I wonder how much of that is dedicated to the orchestra. I would not like to see orchestras or other important cultural assets being caught up in any way in an exercise related to cost saving. I will ask the two Ministers to come together to examine the issues and see what can be done to secure the future of the two orchestras.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">The orchestras are being caught up in the RTÉ financial challenges. The allocation to the orchestras from the licence fee revenue is around 7% or 7.5%. I do not want the Taoiseach's analysis, I only want a commitment to intervene on the matter to see if something can be done. Something can be done. Look at the Creative Ireland budget. We have asked several parliamentary questions and put in requests under freedom of information and of the €5 million allocated to Creative Ireland last year, almost a million was allocated to citizen engagement. What is that about?</p>
          <p eId="para_121">It involved a full-page spread in the <i>The Irish Times</i> supplement magazine for 12 weeks and two supplements in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, with a weekly and ongoing double spread. In Saturday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, there was a regional print and media campaign, costing €900,000, and €400,000 was spent on web and digital content, €145,000 on a director, €50,000 on an event co-ordinator and €205,000 on two contract staff. Out of the €5 million, we have already accounted for €1.5 million on what seems to be a very determined effort to keep the media onside by doshing out lots of advertising. I have no problem with supporting the media but it should be done on a stand-alone basis, separate from Government and from its political arms. The orchestra could have done with that €1.5 million. Let us at least support that which has depth, solidity and tradition. The RTÉ orchestras are the jewel in the crown of our cultural life but they are losing positions and those positions are not being replaced, yet we get these fantastic press releases, gatherings and announcements on money being frittered away. That money could have gone to the orchestras or to consolidate what we have in our artistic infrastructure, while keeping it at arm's length from political patronage, which is the wrong way to fund arts and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> The Arts Council was set up as an independent arm, separate from politics, to fund the arts. I do not like what is happening and I am principally making a plea for the orchestras because they are going to continue to be the victim of what is going on with RTÉ as a result of the fact that the station is in deep financial trouble. We cannot wash our hands of that either, but it is another day's work. We should not pretend it is all RTÉ's problem - the Government has to intervene to save the orchestras.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">As temperatures fall below freezing this week, the plight of our homeless citizens, particularly those forced to sleep on the streets, takes on an even sharper focus. Today, there is a day-long protest outside the Dáil organised by My Name Is, and I commend all those involved. They are holding this protest because they care and because the Government is refusing to take the necessary actions to end this scourge on our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> Homelessness in this State is now at emergency levels. It is an alarming reality that over 8,000 of our citizens, including in excess of 3,000 children, are homeless as Christmas approaches. Eight people have died on our streets since August and that is not acceptable by any standard, any measure or statistic or any report - national or international - that the Taoiseach may reference. Imagine being without a home at any time. Níl aon tinteán mar do thinteán féin, mar a deirtear sa Ghaeilge, go háirithe le linn aimsir na Nollag. Imagine not having a home or even a stable at Christmas. There are parts of this State where there are no emergency beds and no facilities that are suitable for some of our citizens who are forced to sleep on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> The Taoiseach often claims that no one in this Dáil has a monopoly on compassion and that is true. There are also complexities to all of this. However, there is nothing as complex as the issues a homeless person faces in the struggles of his or her daily life. Results count, Taoiseach. The Taoiseach leads the Government. A truly compassionate Government would implement compassionate policies that would make a real difference to the lives of homeless citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> The Housing Agency has been offered 1,800 vacant, turnkey-condition homes to purchase in the past year by banks, funds and other sources. They could be bought and families could move into them immediately but, of these 1,800 homes, the Government has agreed to buy only 600. I accept that perhaps not all of the homes are suitable but it is hard to believe that 1,200 are unsuitable. I do not believe the Government thinks that there is a housing emergency. If it did believe it, it would not waste any opportunity to house citizens. People are dying on the streets and children are spending their childhoods in emergency accommodation, while families are losing hope on housing waiting lists. Can the Taoiseach explain to the Dáil why the Government is purchasing only 600 of the 1,800 homes on offer? Can he also explain why it has taken so long to purchase and allocate to families the homes it has bought? What is he going to do to ensure that no citizen is forced to sleep on the streets?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_130">I will have to come back to the Deputy on the detailed numbers relating to those homes. I think they were some time ago and, if I recall correctly, a number of them were not in areas where there was a high level of demand for social housing. As a result, they were not all suitable for social housing. I will certainly get the details on that and give the Deputy a detailed answer by correspondence.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> The Government cares a lot about homelessness, not just at this time of the year but at all times of the year. As Taoiseach, I care a lot about it too and, as I have said before, I consider homelessness to be a stain on our society. We need to do everything we can to reduce it - and eliminate it if possible - in the months and years ahead. In the past week or two, I visited a family hub to meet some of the homeless families who live there. I also met some rough sleepers to try to understand a bit better their experience and what they face. Among the actions the Government is taking is an €18 million increase in the budget for homelessness services next year, bringing the total up to €118 million. The number of families in bed and breakfast establishments and hotels is down substantially from when it peaked last spring as a result of the development of family hubs, of which there are many more coming on stream. An additional 200 emergency beds for rough sleepers are being put in place in the coming weeks to ensure that there will be a bed available for everyone who needs one - not just at Christmas but into the new year, over the winter period and into spring and summer. A particular effort is being made to encourage people to use these new beds, which are in single and double rooms and not dormitories.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> On Sunday night, which was very cold, an analysis was carried out and major efforts were made in the Dublin region by the staff of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and others to make sure all rough sleepers had the option of emergency beds and ten beds for females were unused, while there was one male bed vacancy. No one was not placed. As recently as Sunday night, there was adequate capacity in the system to provide an emergency bed in Dublin for every man or woman who wanted one.</p>

          <p eId="para_135">The fact that the Taoiseach is not able to answer my question underlines the case I made, which is that the Government does not believe there is an emergency in the context of homelessness. This is the second week in a row the Taoiseach has not been able to answer a question. Last week, I asked about services for citizens with mental health problems. The figures I gave him are absolutely up to date. In the past year the Government was offered 1,800 homes. Fact. It only took up 600 of them. Fact. I asserted that over 8,000 people are homeless and that 3,194 of them are children. There are 300 more children in emergency accommodation than there were when Deputy Varadkar became Taoiseach. The situation has not got better; it has become worse. Can the Taoiseach explain to the Dáil why the Government is purchasing only 600 of the 1,800 homes on offer? If he cannot do it now, will he make a point of coming back into the House to do so? Can he also explain why it has taken so long for the Government to allocate to families the homes it has bought?</p>

          <p eId="para_159">Seven weeks ago during Leaders' Questions, I raised the shocking treatment of the elderly in this country. Little did I know then the can of worms I would open. John Patrick Harrington, a 90-year-old man, left Bantry for a 1,000 km round trip to Kingsbridge Hospital in Belfast for a cataract operation, which was arranged in three weeks, whereas had he waited in Ireland, he would have had to wait three to four years. Since the story broke we have heard of consultants working 13 hours per week, and of women forced to sell jewellery and personal belongings to have a 20-minute simple cataract procedure. More than 8,000 people are seeking that simple procedure. Next Saturday, a bus full of older people will leave west Cork and Kerry for Belfast for cataract operations under the cross-border directive. The 13 people who will have operations on Sunday morning range in age from 65 to 90 years. Their greatest worry is they will go blind, as many getting the bus have waited for three years and cannot wait any longer. This is the first of many buses organised from Cork and Kerry. The next bus will be in early January and another will follow at the end of January.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> I ask the Taoiseach whether this is the right way to treat some of the most vulnerable people in our society, who did get up early in the morning, who paid PRSI all of their lives and who, sadly, now realise it was all for nothing as the State would let them go blind rather than perform a 20-minute procedure. These law-abiding taxpayers, who contributed all of their lives to their community and the tax system, now realise it is a choice of going to Belfast this weekend or going blind.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> Recently, a constituent contacted me regarding the situation whereby the person's father has been cared for by the person 24-7 for 11.5 years following a devastating major stroke. The person's father recently transferred to a long-term care facility. It has now come to light that he is 100% blind in one eye and has only 30% sight in the other. This gentleman has lost his speech and ability to walk. Does he now have to face losing his sight also? He worked all of his life, paid PRSI and contributed greatly to his community. He is not well enough to be able to travel to Belfast. He has a medical card and private health insurance but there is nowhere for him to have this simple procedure urgently in County Cork. Does this seem fair to the Taoiseach?</p>
          <p eId="para_162"> Since my previous contribution on Leaders' Questions, I mentioned Bantry General Hospital and the major concerns the public had regarding the retirement of a surgical consultant. Thanks to raising the issue on the floor of the Chamber, the issue has been resolved. Bantry General Hospital is renowned for the excellent service it provides to the population it serves. Why must a bus leave Bantry at 9 a.m. on Saturday morning when a state-of-the-art theatre, which only recently received a major upgrade, is only partially used? Why can these simple procedures not be carried out in Bantry instead of inflicting this long and hard journey on older people? The theatre capacity available at present could be constructively used to address the backlog of cataract procedures in County Cork and parts of Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> Since I spoke on this issue seven weeks ago, I have met credit union managers all over west Cork to secure loans for those who need them and who are travelling to Belfast. I have also met the Cork University Hospital group managers. These meetings have all helped me to progress this matter. What has the Taoiseach done to help the 8,000 vulnerable Irish people who face the bleak prospect of going blind on his watch? Has he met and engaged with the ophthalmologists who can work towards resolving the situation? Has he spoken to the HSE regarding a funding allocation for other hospitals similar to Bantry General Hospital throughout the country, which could provide theatre time to address the national backlog of cataract procedures?</p>

          <p eId="para_164">I thank Deputy Collins. To answer his question, it is not the right way to treat our citizens. Nobody should have to wait for long periods for any procedure and certainly not a cataract procedure which, as the Deputy knows, can save people's sight, allowing them to maintain their independence and, in many cases, avoid further injuries that can occur because of sight loss.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> What are we doing about it? We are doing quite a lot when it comes to cataracts. The Deputy mentioned that people are travelling to Northern Ireland and other countries. That is not happening by chance. It is part of the cross-border directive, a European law to which we signed up as a Government whereby we fund people to have their treatment in Belfast, Derry and Enniskillen in the United Kingdom so they can have their treatment done more quickly overseas, even if it means us paying another Government or another health administration to do so. That is something we have signed up to and something we now fund. In addition to this, we have been increasing funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Funding has increased from approximately €20 million this year and will rise to €50 million next year. This is already showing considerable results. The Deputy may have noticed from the figures released on Friday that for four months in row, the number of people waiting for a hospital procedure, operation or scope has decreased. The number of people waiting has fallen from a high of 86,000 earlier this year to 80,595 now, at the end of November. More than 56% of patients are now waiting less than six months for their procedure. That is four months in a row during which the number of people waiting for operations and procedures has fallen and we will continue to resource both the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund in order that we keep seeing the number of people waiting for hips, knees, cataracts and other operations falling. It will not be done like it was in the past. We will not just throw money at it for a few months and knock a bunch of people off the waiting list and then see it rise again.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">I thank the Taoiseach and I appreciate his honesty in saying it is not right. It certainly is not right for people to be travelling in bus loads out of the Republic, and out of places such as west Cork and up to Belfast. It is truly scandalous treatment of our elderly. I ask the Taoiseach to address this serious issue and grave situation regarding 8,000 Irish citizens accessing a cataract procedure. This is such a serious and urgent issue I ask the Taoiseach kindly to address the areas of concern for so many vulnerable people in the country. Do they have to continue to undertake the stressful long journey to Belfast to have this procedure carried out? Can we not find provision in our HSE service delivery plans to factor in addressing the lengthy waiting list for this procedure? This procedure does not block beds and is a simple day procedure that could be carried out in some of the theatres that are available in Ireland where capacity for theatre time exists. This 15 to 20-minute procedure should be made simple to access for those people who require a basic cataract procedure urgently to save them from going blind and being further isolated from society.</p>

          <p eId="para_171">We are at a situation now, at long last, when it comes to operations, procedures and scopes - not outpatients admittedly because we are still not making much progress there - where we have seen a fall for four months in a row in the number of people waiting for operations and procedures. We are at a situation now where one third of people wait less than three months and more than half of people wait less than six months. I would like to get to the point where we are a normal country with a normal public health service and we do not have very many people at all waiting more than three months. There will often be people waiting six, eight or 12 weeks, even people with the best and most expensive private health insurance packages, but I would like to get to the point where the number of people waiting more than three months really starts to fall dramatically. That is what we are aiming to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">In terms of resourcing cataracts ophthalmology in particular, a new theatre was opened in July in the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital, which is not far from here. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, carried out the opening. I mentioned what we are doing with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and on paying for treatment overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> I do not know the details about Bantry. The availability of a theatre is not necessarily a solution in itself as it is necessary to have ophthalmologists and ophthalmic surgeons who can carry out the procedure and nurses and other personnel who are trained in aftercare. The last thing one wants is to have a procedure carried out by somebody who is not qualified and the patient then being nursed by somebody who is not used to recognising when something has gone wrong in somebody's eye. There can be serious issues when one tries to do things like that. However, the Government is focusing on people who have to wait more than three months and six months for operations and procedures. We are starting to see results and we will see more in the coming year.</p>

          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_174">On 28 November last, while announcing the resignation of the former Tánaiste, the Taoiseach stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_175">The events of the past few days have exposed major problems once again within a dysfunctional Department of Justice and Equality, including the way important emails were not found and therefore not sent on to the Charleton tribunal during discovery. I am therefore directing that there will be an external inquiry into that to report before Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Later that afternoon, the Taoiseach said: "As of today, I am ordering an external inquiry into why the Department of Justice and Equality did not find those emails and why they were not sent on to the tribunal." The Taoiseach suggested that the Secretary General to the Government would carry out that review, but after concerns were raised by me and others he agreed that somebody from outside the Civil Service would be more appropriate. He confirmed that he was in the process of appointing a senior counsel to carry out a review "as a matter of urgency".</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I have a number of questions arising from that. First, is it still the Taoiseach's intention that this report would be completed before Christmas? Second, has the senior counsel been appointed and, if so, who is it? Third, have the terms of reference been agreed and will the Taoiseach publish them? The last question is important because there are still many unanswered questions as to how the trawl was carried out. Given that the country spent a week watching the Government and Fianna Fáil tie themselves in knots over what the then Minister knew and when she knew it, obviously the accounts of the then Minister and her advisers should have been examined and searched as part of this trawl. However, it was confirmed to me in a recent email from the current Minister that, inexplicably, those three accounts were not searched. Can the Taoiseach provide an assurance that the failure to search these accounts in the trawl will be examined as part of the senior counsel's review? If so, will he direct the Department to check these accounts for correspondence relevant to the disclosures tribunal?</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> I ask the Taoiseach to reply to my three direct questions. Also, will he include the failure to search those email accounts?</p>

          <p eId="para_179">To follow up briefly on the last Deputy's question, the number of people currently waiting for a cataract operation in Ireland is 8,667. That is down from 10,304 in April, so there has been a 25% reduction already in the number of people waiting for cataract procedures. We anticipate that continuing to fall in the months ahead. The 8,667 people are waiting for any amount of time. In some cases they might be waiting for a long period while some might only be waiting a few weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> On the questions put by Deputy Shortall, following our interaction and the Deputy's correspondence to me, I took the decision that it would be more appropriate to have an independent person, a senior counsel, rather than a civil servant carry out the investigation of why certain documents were not discovered and provided to the Charleton tribunal. I am advised by the Minister for Justice and Equality that the senior counsel has been asked to do the work but has not yet confirmed his acceptance of that offer or request. As soon as the person gets back to us and tells us whether he will do it, I will be happy to provide the name to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I do not have the terms of reference with me. Generally, they would be agreed with the senior counsel. It would be appropriate for the person carrying out the investigation to determine why these emails were not discovered and provided to the tribunal, and also to determine if there are any other emails or documents that ought to have been discovered and were not and should now be provided to the tribunal as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">Can the Taoiseach confirm the timescale he hopes the senior counsel will be working to now? Is it still Christmas or what is the timescale? Also, will the Taoiseach commit to publishing the terms of reference? There has been considerable slippage on this issue and there is much public concern about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> We know the tribunal made three discovery orders. One of them related to records of the O'Higgins commission of investigation held in the Department of Justice and Equality. We have since learned that two critical pages of that report went missing. Will the disappearance of those two pages be included in the terms of reference? Obviously that was a critical issue when it came to complying with the discovery orders. We also know that the Department made a number of voluntary disclosures. Will the Taoiseach confirm again that those accounts which should have been searched will now be searched, and will he confirm that the reason for not searching them will be included in the terms of reference?</p>

          <p eId="para_184">I am told the documents the Deputy referred to have been provided to the tribunal. The Minister for Justice and Equality expects to make the appointment of the senior counsel in the coming days. The original intention was that it would all be done by Christmas but there has been a delay in securing a senior counsel to carry out the work. As a result it will be difficult to get the work done by Christmas. Certainly, the instruction from the Government will be to have it done within a matter of weeks if that is possible. Members will understand that if one commissions somebody to carry out an investigation, it is right and proper to give that person enough time to do it and not set a deadline that might prevent the person from carrying out a thorough and comprehensive job, which must be the priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> Regarding the terms of reference, it is not possible for me to give a commitment in the House to publish them. I would not have an objection to it but there might be legal or other reasons I am not aware of which would prevent that from happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">Last night's edition of "RTÉ Investigates" outlined how the criminal justice system, particularly in the District Court, is very poor in terms of dealing with drink-driving offences, particularly regarding the progressing of warrants and summonses, the number of loopholes that are contained in the 22 different Road Traffic Acts and the number of people who get off completely and people who were never prosecuted, fined and so on. More particularly, the number of people who have been murdered or killed by people who are out on bail is growing alarmingly. I can think of people like Manuela Riedo, Sylvia Roche Kelly, Garda Tony Golden, Shane O'Farrell and more who were either killed in hit-and-run accidents or murdered by people who were out on bail and not just out on bail once. There is a fundamental malaise at the heart of our system. If one goes through the O'Higgins report, one will see further examples of people on bail continuing to commit crime. When we can anticipate the tabling before the House of the consolidated road traffic Bill? In the interim, will the Government accept Deputy O'Callaghan's legislation, which he will bring forward tomorrow, concerning our bail laws?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">The Deputy posed a number of questions. In respect of the bail laws, I remind Members of the recent introduction of the Criminal Justice Act 2017, which, again, has broadened the factors the court will be required to take into account before the granting of bail and which is already having an effect. I believe it is fair to say that all of the cases cited by the Deputy happened prior to the introduction of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">In the event this legislation does not deal with the issue in the manner in which it is intended, I assure the Deputy we will continue to review the matter of our bail laws. It was the subject matter of a constitutional amendment some 20 years ago. I am concerned by the ease with which bail is being granted by the courts. I assure the House the new legislation will deal with many of the matters raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">My question is on the health (transport support) Bill. In February 2013 the Government scrapped the mobility allowance scheme and the motorised transport grants because they were not in compliance with the Equal Status Act and the Disability Act. That was done despite a recommendation by the Ombudsman that the schemes be widened. I remember it very well. The Ombudsman ruled they were discriminating because some people would not be given the grants. Instead of people being given those grants, the grants were stopped. The then Minister of State, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, said it was because it cost too much. Other Deputies and I have raised this very often since then. A replacement scheme was promised but it has not been delivered. Those who are excluded are being caused much extra hardship. The health (transport support) Bill has been in the legislative programme for five years now. According to the current legislative programme, the Bill is now priority legislation for publication. However, a date for pre-legislative scrutiny is still to be determined. Does the Taoiseach have a date for the publication of the health (transport support) Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">To correct the Deputy, those grants were not stopped. They are still being paid. The schemes were not scrapped; they were just closed to new entrants. People who were availing of them up until then still are. We now need to put in place, on a statutory footing, a new transport support scheme. It is intended to have that legislation published next year and to have it through the Dáil and Seanad so we can fund it for the budgetary cycle beginning in October. There is still some work to do on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_227"> To answer Deputy Adams's question from Leaders' Questions, 1,600 homes were offered to the Housing Agency, not 1,800. Of those 1,600, 600 were purchased and 1,000 were not purchased for the following reasons: they were unsuitable for social housing, they were not in an area where there was social housing demand, they were bad value for taxpayers' money due to excessive cost, they were withdrawn from sale or there were legal complications related to the property due to title or planning issues.</p>

This is because contracts being used by developers no longer have old fashioned protective clauses. For example, a subject-to-loan-closure clause used to be standard in contracts. Now somebody who has made a deposit but for some reason cannot raise the loan will lose the deposit. Will the courts and land conveyancing (amendment) Bill deal with that loophole? When will see that Bill?</p>

          <p eId="para_233">I attended a meeting this morning in the Mansion House at which trade unions, political parties and housing NGOs gathered to express their frustration at the failure of Government policies to live up to the programme for Government commitments to provide affordable, quality and accessible housing for all as a priority and to work with others with good ideas. The gathering, which included some of the leading NGOs, some of the biggest trade unions and many of the political parties announced a major national demonstration on 7 April to try to pressure the Government to abandon failed policies of relying on the private sector. What I and everyone at that meeting wants to know is when will the Government deliver on its commitment in the programme for Government to work with others. People across the spectrum of groups working with housing have consistently said that the policy of relying on the private market, which the Government is depending on, is not working. CSO figures today show an 86% increase in property prices accompanied by an 80% rise in rents.</p>

We do not rely on the private sector. This year we will support more than 21,000 new social housing tenancies. We will well outstrip the targets we have for this year. A portion of that will come from housing assistance payments, thereby relying on the private rental market but we will see a dramatic increase in the number of houses built, acquired or long-term leased into social housing stock by the Government. If we look at the last two years of the Rebuilding Ireland action plan, 2020 and 2021, more houses will be built, bought or long-term leased by the State into State stock. We will not be relying on HAP to meet the social housing needs of people who need our help. We are not relying wholly on the private sector. We have a mix of solutions. The most important thing is to get people into secure tenancies and that is what we are doing as a Government.</p>

I am inundated with questions from people in County Kerry who are suffering sore and painful ill-health as a result of the removal of these patches from the scheme. They cannot afford to buy them themselves. I am the same as everyone else here so I presume other Deputies and councillors throughout the country are being asked the same question.

          <p eId="para_255">Section 31 of the Road Traffic Act 2016 relates to the regulation of rickshaws in cities and towns and amends the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 to cover them. However, the section has never been implemented. We are a full year on and rickshaws remain unregulated, although the National Transport Authority is conducting a painfully slow consultation process. The considerable frustration with this issue is being added to by the delay. Initially, we were told that it was due to seeking and preparing legal advice. Now there is a consultation process. These appear to be stalling tactics. We now know that some rickshaws are facilitating drug dealing across our towns and cities. Rickshaws remain unregulated, are uninsured and are not subject to checks. What is the Government doing to close this gap in the legislation one year on?</p>

          <p eId="para_257">Early last year, many small businesses across various counties, Longford and Westmeath being two, received rates revaluation bills. In some cases, the revalued rates were in excess of 400% higher. At the time, if the Taoiseach would care to listen, the Government and many Deputies on the Government side reassured small businesses and told them that a new valuation Bill would be introduced before these bills kicked in. The new bills will kick in on 1 January 2018 but, as a result of a parliamentary question I asked last week, I have learned that the new valuation legislation is still in the Attorney General's office, where it has been since last April. When are struggling businesses going to see the new valuation Bill introduced in the House in order to ensure that they pay affordable commercial rates? If something is not done-----</p>

          <p eId="para_264">In the programme for Government, a colossal €15 billion is laid out for the Department of Health. Despite this, and as no one knows better than the Taoiseach, who is a medical doctor, we have the most extraordinary waiting list of up to 700,000 people. According to comments attributed to him in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, the Taoiseach is hoping to arrive at a situation where at least two patients per week will not be referred by their GPs to hospital. With 2,500 GPs, that would amount to 20,000 patients per month, which would be a great way of reducing the waiting list. How does the Taoiseach propose to do this? Does he realise that most of our GPs are overstretched, overworked and deeply stressed? I cannot see this working. Perhaps the Taoiseach might reveal to the House how he proposes to turn this situation around in the way suggested in <i>The Irish Times</i>.</p>

          <p eId="para_265">I did not read the article, but I know what I said. What I said was that if the average GP referred two fewer people to specialists each week, that would be 5,000 fewer referrals a week and 20,000 fewer referrals a month and, without any additional capacity at all in our hospitals, we would see waiting lists fall. How could that be done? In two ways. First, provide GPs with better access to investigations so that they do not need to send somebody to a specialist who then sends him or her for a scan, scope or whatever. They could have direct access to investigations. We are starting to make that happen, but it is happening far too slowly. The other aspect, of course, is to allow and fund more GPs to perform more procedures themselves, for example, minor surgeries. When I was the Minister for Health, I started that - allowing GPs to do minor operations and be paid for them rather than referring patients to specialists.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> The second way is accountability. We do not actually monitor referral rates by GPs, so we do not know who are the ones who refer too many patients and we do not know who are the ones who are appropriate and efficient in their referrals. Other countries do, and they can identify GPs who are over-referring and take action to encourage them to be more appropriate in their referrals. They can identify the GPs who refer appropriately and do not refer very often. They actually get fast-track access to specialists. That is what is done in other countries and we should do it here.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">Last night's "Prime Time" programme was shocking in a number of respects. It reflected how our District Court system is in something of a state of chaos, particularly as regards the striking out of cases due to summonses not being served as well as the over-reliance on the poor box. The inconsistencies and discrepancies in sentencing and the approaches taken by judges were trends. In the context of that programme and what was revealed, will the Government consider the Sinn Féin Bill on a sentencing council to provide clear sentencing guidelines? Alternatively, will the Minister for Justice and Equality consider favourably an amendment to the Judicial Council Bill 2017 to put in place such a sentencing council with sentencing guidelines?</p>

          <p eId="para_271"> I acknowledge certain pressures on the District Court system, which, by and large, has remained unreformed since the 1920s. I am looking at a number of options in terms of a review of the District Court jurisdiction and the form of the District Court so that there are certain structures within the District Court that ensure the confidence of the people in what is effectively the court of first instance, which deals with hundreds of thousands of our citizens annually. I take seriously the outcomes of last night's RTÉ programme and will advise the House accordingly in the new year of options available to me in terms of review.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_275">That leave be given to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the law relating to the Comptroller and Auditor General; to allow for certain supervisory powers in relation to infrastructure spending within the State; and to provide for related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">This legislation follows on from the recent IMF report on infrastructural spending in Ireland, which found that, while we generally managed public infrastructure relatively well, there were a number of issues. For example, the proliferation of sectoral strategies for infrastructure spending generated weak results and limited information on cost estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">It also concluded there is room to improve the methodological rigour, sequencing and the effectiveness of project appraisal. In light of the forthcoming capital plan and the extra expenditure that it will unleash, as well as conclusion within the plan that current infrastructure blockages are holding Ireland back, this Bill will give extra powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which, if properly resourced, will give confidence to taxpayers that their money is being spent well.</p>
          <p eId="para_278"> I welcome the conclusion of the Luas cross-city project and particularly that it came in on budget. The lessons from that project must be learned by other sectors of the State as we prepare for a new capital plan. This Bill would give extra powers to the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate all infrastructure projects when they have been completed. Specifically, were a budget to increase by more than 20% during construction, an automatic review would be triggered under this legislation. Were demand for the infrastructure project to fall by more than 30%, an automatic review would be triggered under this Bill. It is appropriate that we move it to the next Stage to tease out the issues. It is even more appropriate that we send a message that we will not stand for cost overruns in infrastructure projects.</p>

            <p eId="para_318"> As outlined in the strategy statement, my Department provides support services for the Taoiseach and the Government. As part of this service, the parliamentary liaison unit was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of new responsibilities and procedures of the Thirty-second Dáil.</p>

The parliamentary liaison unit provides detailed information on upcoming matters in the Dáil and Seanad and highlights any new Oireachtas reform issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_321">We have tabled several parliamentary questions on the parliamentary liaison unit to find out exactly what it is supposed to do. According to the Government website, <i>whodoeswhat.gov.ie</i>, "The Parliamentary Liaison Unit facilitates the enhanced relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas with a view to ensuring the timely implementation of the Government's legislative programme." However, the website does not refer to certain Members of the Oireachtas. According to replies to parliamentary questions, as repeated by the Taoiseach today, its purpose is to support Ministers and their Departments on Oireachtas matters with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members’ business.</p>
            <p eId="para_322"> The Taoiseach is telling us that the purpose of the unit is to support Independent members of Government in understanding Oireachtas procedures. I am somewhat confused about who exactly it is aimed at. Let us suppose we are to believe what has been published and that the purpose of the unit is to liaise between the Government and the Oireachtas. I have not had any contact with the parliamentary liaison unit. Will the Taoiseach identify the individual Deputies who have been liaised with, and to what end? Is there any interaction between Members who are not supporters of the Government and the parliamentary liaison unit?</p>

            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T15:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_323">In September last year, the then Taoiseach, Teachta Kenny, spoke in the Dáil about the need to improve communications between Ministers and their Departments. He outlined how, to facilitate this approach, a parliamentary liaison unit was established. He specifically said that it was to facilitate an enhanced relationship between the Government and the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_324">More recently this role of improving communications between the Ministers and the Opposition spokespersons has disappeared completely, as it did today, from any definition of the unit. Can the Taoiseach explain if the parliamentary liaison unit has any role in engaging with the Opposition parties or Members on the preparation of legislation as set out by his predecessor?</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> Could he also outline to the Dáil his current thinking on Seanad reform? The Manning report was published in April 2015. The former Taoiseach wrote to party leaders last year seeking nominations. We nominated Seanadóir Rose Conway-Walsh. There has been no contact with her since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> The programme for Government, which is now 18 months old, contains a commitment to pursue the implementation of the Manning report as a priority. I wrote to the Taoiseach on this issue in August and in a reply to me in October he said he would be contacting party leaders with a view to having the group up and running as soon as possible. He also said the implementation group would be up in the next few weeks. Two months later, no one has been in touch with me and neither have I seen any evidence of the implementation group being established or the chairperson being identified. Will the Taoiseach undertake to liaise with Opposition parties to expedite this matter early in the new year? He also said in his response earlier that the parliamentary liaison unit was communicating with the chief strategist of the Independent Alliance. Does the Taoiseach know the name of this strategist and if so could he give it to the Dáil?</p>

            <p eId="para_327">In an answer to me last week the Taoiseach said there were 24 staff assigned to the Government secretariat, protocol division and parliamentary liaison unit. How many of these 24 are assigned to the parliamentary liaison unit? What is their rank? Are they deputy secretaries, assistant secretaries or principal officers? Rather like the strategic communications unit, this appears to be something which could have a lot of mission creep. When it was first introduced the indication, as now, was that it was to deal with minority members of the Government. It is worth reminding the Taoiseach that Parliament is made up of a variety of different parties and Independents, not all of whom are either in or supporting the Government with confidence and supply. If there is an information structure for liaison, explanation and information about initiatives being undertaken by the Government it is right that, as with the strategic communications unit, that kind of information is available on an equal basis to all the parties and all the Members of the Oireachtas. Otherwise, it smacks of more resources being devoted to Government for information purposes in the context of Government information services with many staff, as the Taoiseach said in his reply of last week.</p>

            <p eId="para_330">The Taoiseach's notes will probably tell him that last year his predecessor informed the Seanad that the parliamentary liaison unit had been established as a "catalyst" for improved communication between Ministers and Opposition spokespersons and their teams. That was the original idea of the parliamentary liaison unit and the Taoiseach's predecessor, in the context of the confidence and supply agreement and the facilitation of Oireachtas reform, made it clear that he wanted improved relationships between the Executive and the rest of the House on various issues and communications between Ministers and Deputies. We have learned over the past year or so that the unit has been diverted into working with Independent Members and helping Ministers prepare for Private Members' Business. That was never the original intention. It seems that more and more, the architecture of Government is being turned into a prop for the political parties which make up the Government. We have to be extremely careful about the trends that are emerging.</p>
            <p eId="para_331"> The Taoiseach said he was reviewing his Department. Could he indicate whether the review has informed him what he will do in respect of this unit? Will he make a statement available on the number of queries handled for each Independent Deputy? What Independent Deputies are on the inside track, those who vote with the Government, such as Deputy Lowry who regularly does that, or Deputy Mattie McGrath-----</p>

            <p eId="para_333">Deputy Harty. Are they the Independent Members who are being helped or assisted by the liaison unit? We know that in recent weeks other Deputies did not get the information they looked for in parliamentary questions. If this parliamentary liaison unit was working effectively, as originally intended, to help communications between the House and the Executive we might not have had all the difficulties and challenges we have faced in recent weeks. For full transparency it would be useful if the Taoiseach could outline what Deputies are being assisted by this liaison unit.</p>

            <p eId="para_334">The make-up of this Dáil and the new procedures that have come into place as a result of Dáil reform have resulted in the Government doing its business in a very different way from previous Governments. It has also meant an increased workload for Departments, particularly in respect of the volume of Private Members' business. The parliamentary liaison unit, which is based in my Department, was set up to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of their new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The parliamentary liaison unit was established 18 months ago, in May 2016. It is staffed by three people, a principal officer, a higher executive officer and a clerical officer, all of whom are civil servants. The chief strategist for the Independent Alliance is Mr. Tony Williams.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> I am not reviewing my Department. Structures and staffing are entirely a matter for the Secretary General. I intend to leave that to him as the best person-----</p>

            <p eId="para_337">I also announced that I had taken wise counsel on that and decided to leave all these matters involving staffing and structure to my Secretary General. That is my decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_338"> As I have said previously, the unit performs a liaison function to help ensure that Members and Departments are properly informed of the new responsibilities and procedures of the Thirty-second Dáil. If one takes, for example, Private Members' business, the make-up of the current Dáil and the new procedures that have come into place as a result of Dáil reform have resulted in Government doing its business in a different way from previous Governments. It has also meant a dramatically increased workload for Departments, particularly in respect of the volume of Private Members' business. Currently, for example, there are 105 Private Members' Bills awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil and 40 awaiting Committee Stage. Departments can sometimes have several Bills, both Government and Private Members', relative to their area on the Order Paper in either House in any given week. The unit is continuously in contact with the Departments about the progress of these Bills and to assist officials with procedures and any issues that may arise. </p>
            <p eId="para_339"> The unit was established to perform a liaison function to help ensure that Ministers and Departments are properly informed of new responsibilities and procedures in the Thirty-second Dáil. The main focus of the unit is to liaise with Departments and advisers on Oireachtas matters with a particular emphasis on assisting Departments with Private Members' business. In performing this function the unit has been happy to engage with any member of the Opposition, where appropriate. It is not the function of the unit to ensure the support of Deputies in the House. That is a political function. The parliamentary liaison unit's role is to provide information on Dáil and Seanad issues and on Dáil reform and primarily, the unit assists Departments and advisers on Oireachtas matters. </p>

            <p eId="para_365">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 17, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_366"> I spoke by phone with Prime Minister May most recently on Wednesday, 6 December and again on Thursday, 7 December. </p>
            <p eId="para_367"> On both occasions we had good conversations as we took stock of the situation that unfolded on Monday, 4 December and the prospects of getting back to a point of satisfactory progress. I reiterated the firm Irish position regarding the text that had been agreed on Monday, 4 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_368">On Friday morning, I was pleased to announce that, following further intensive negotiations, we had reached a satisfactory conclusion which did not involve any change to the guarantee regarding the Border we had secured earlier in the negotiations. In my statement on Friday, I said we had achieved all we set out to achieve in phase 1 of these negotiations, that we had the assurances and guarantees we needed from the United Kingdom and support for them from the European Union. I am satisfied sufficient progress has been made on the Irish issues. The parameters have been set and they are good.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> It remains a matter for the European Council, however, to decide later this week whether it is satisfied to accept the recommendation of the European Commission that sufficient progress has been achieved on all three phase 1 issues. Assuming that happens, we can move on to the work necessary to convert the commitments made last week into the necessary provisions in the withdrawal agreement, which will be an international agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom. We also want to begin discussions about transition arrangements and the new relationship between the EU and the UK in phase 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_370"> We will remain fully engaged and vigilant throughout the next period of work. As I stated last Friday, this is not the end; it is the beginning of the end and there is much to be done in respect of Brexit. Throughout, we participated in these discussions as part of the EU 27. I have also spoken with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, on several occasions. Irish officials were also in contact with the EU task force over the intensive period of negotiations in recent weeks, as well as engaging with other EU institutions like the European Parliament and member states for support. We were also in bilateral contact with the UK at political and official level. While these contacts were focused primarily on finding a way forward in the negotiations, the UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, and I remain in agreement on the importance of ensuring close ongoing bilateral Ireland-UK relations. I was not party to any discussions between the UK Prime Minister and the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, MLA, in respect of the EU-UK negotiations, nor did I speak directly with the DUP leader over the course of the intensive negotiation period of the past two weeks. We last spoke on 12 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_371"> The Article 50 process is a negotiation between the EU 27 on the one hand and the UK Government on the other. As such, it is a process that involves sovereign Governments rather than individual political parties in any of the relevant jurisdictions. In the same way, neither I nor my officials had a role in any decision made about sharing a draft text with the DUP. Given the nature of the negotiation structure, that was entirely a matter for the UK Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_372">Tomorrow there will be statements on Europe and we can go into the issue in more detail then. However, as the Council President, Donald Tusk, noted, the first phase was the easy part and those who say the key issues are definitely settled are clearly fooling themselves as there is much work to be done in phase 2.</p>
            <p eId="para_373"> Does a definition of "frictionless border" exist? Will the Taoiseach indicate what exactly his definition of a frictionless border is? Obviously, it involves no physical barriers. Will it, however, involve no payments or costs of trade? We know the objective is for there to be no change. However, if there is change, how much it fits with the Taoiseach's understanding of what is possible? The UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, and others have spoken about a Canada-plus type of trade agreement. Where do services stand in all of this? Merchandise goods are straightforward enough. What is the outlook for services, as well as for different standards and approaches?</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> The Taoiseach must acknowledge there are profoundly different views on what the agreement involves, its status and its implications between Dublin and Westminster. The commitment to an open border is contradicted by the statement that the UK as a whole will leave the customs union and the Single Market. On Ireland, the agreement states that regulatory alignment will be maintained if there is no overall deal. If there is no overall deal, however, the UK's membership of the customs union and the Single Market would automatically lapse, which will include Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_375"> While I accept it is as far as we possibly could get at this particular stage, there are still irreconcilables in the text. Has the Taoiseach received assurances from Europe as to what happens in such circumstances? I hope such circumstances do not happen but I believe part of the evidence suggests Britain is heading towards a soft Brexit if it can bring its politics around to that. That is in the best interests of the British people and Britain itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> Northern Ireland will also be a topic for statements tomorrow and there is much more to be said. However, I want to point to statements made by the Taoiseach last Friday and again in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> that his Government has decided that no Irish Government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind. I regard that as an offensive comment on many levels. It suggests the Taoiseach is more eager to promote his Government than respect the consensus that has operated among democratic parties here for 40 years. I do not believe anyone can look at the enormous effort and political commitment placed by Irish Governments of different parties into Northern Ireland, from the Anglo-Irish Agreement right through to the Good Friday Agreement, and say that they were leaving anybody behind. At such a moment, it was an offensive comment to make and I ask the Taoiseach to withdraw it. The Good Friday Agreement and a decade of hard negotiations after it never saw an Irish Government leave Northern nationalists or unionists behind because of parity of esteem. That is the whole basis on which citizenship emerged in terms of Irish citizenship and European citizenship.</p>

            <p eId="para_378">Yes, but the Good Friday Agreement underpinned the rights of people to Irish citizenship, which in turn underpinned their European citizenship rights, which facilitates what was agreed last Friday.</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> It could be argued that had the Governments in which the Taoiseach served showed half as much interest in Northern Ireland, then we might not have the deadlock and lack of co-operation we currently have.</p>
            <p eId="para_380"> In future, will the Taoiseach show a bigger approach to this issue, which used to be defined by the greater recognition of the work of others? Will he agree that the absence of the Northern Assembly and Executive is causing long-term damage while major cuts in vital services are being implemented? There has been a deep regression in the rhetoric from London on Northern Ireland. It is an issue to which the Government and the Oireachtas must pay significant attention. I will comment more on that tomorrow.</p>

            <p eId="para_381">The joint report between the UK and the European Union, as agreed and published, was welcomed by all of us last Friday. It contained three levels of safeguards to avoid the so-called "hard-border" option. Obviously, the first two were negotiated and are dependent on the outcome of negotiations. The third was the so-called "backstop" or fall-back position that in the event of there being no agreement, there will be full alignment on the island of Ireland to avoid any reinstatement of the need for customs or any other checks for goods, people or services moving between North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_382"> That has been fundamentally resiled from by several members of the British Cabinet since. We are now told that all the paper is subject to full agreement and nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. The backstop, accordingly, does not exist, if that interpretation is to stand. This morning, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's co-ordinator on Brexit, said the comments by the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, in particular, undermined confidence in the trust that the European Parliament can have in the British Government. The European Parliament is to vote on a draft resolution tomorrow. This will be subject to amendments to condemn comments made by several members of the British Government and to demand swift legal assurances from the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p eId="para_383"> Will the Taoiseach put the draft report agreed last week to this Parliament in order that we can formally adopt it as a position and strengthen his hand in future negotiations? Will he seek stronger support from the British Government to get its own Parliament to approve it and to confirm an agreed interpretation of the words? In the discussions I had with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in advance of the welcome agreement reached last week, we agreed that on these matters, there could not be what used to be called "constructive ambiguity", namely, an agreement of language that we often had in Northern discussions to ensure a slightly different interpretation could be placed to bring everybody along the path.</p>
            <p eId="para_384">These are fundamental issues for us and we cannot have either fudge or ambiguity with them. Will the Taoiseach set out for us today the measures he intends to take to ensure that our understanding of the words agreed and the words written down and circulated will be honoured in full by all parties to the report last week?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_161">
            <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_385">Last week, the Taoiseach used quite strong language about the nature of the deal struck when he said that it was bulletproof, yet we are all aware of and concerned by the rather definitive comments given by Secretary Davis from the British Cabinet. Anybody who knows Irish history would be particularly worried and, at this time of year, I am sure the Taoiseach may recall the Roman god Janus, the god of openings and beginnings, but also the god that is two-faced. Looking at Irish history, people are understandably concerned and worried, notwithstanding the subsequent retraction and rather stronger statements in the British House of Commons in the debate when Ms May gave her take on events yesterday. Is the Taoiseach concerned that this tacking backwards and forwards, in a very long British tradition where Ireland is concerned, is significant, and perhaps understandable? What does the Taoiseach feel he needs to do tactically and strategically to address that?</p>
            <p eId="para_386"> There has been a great deal of positive goodwill for Ireland which is very important for future negotiations. What needs to be done to restore trust in that indication, if not a solid agreement, that the Taoiseach himself said was bulletproof? What does he want now in the structure of the negotiations which seem like they will only really commence after the meeting in March? What does he require? Do we now require a significant and specific Irish presence attached to the Barnier task force? It is now going to move into the minutiae under a number of key headings of negotiation and while being one of 27 has been a great strength and I have no difficulty with that, we also have to be able to explicitly look after Irish interests and border interests to ensure that there is no hard border. The statements at the weekend were contradictory.</p>

          <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_162">
            <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_387">Following the publication of the communiqué last Friday, Sinn Féin warned that the devil would be in the detail and in recent days, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Taoiseach have had to reject British Government efforts to water down the implications of that communiqué. The issue of whether it is legally binding or simply a statement of intent is still not resolved. I appreciate the difficulties the Irish Government has had in this negotiation. Sinn Féin's experience over many years of negotiating with British Governments and, if I may say so, with Irish Governments, is that agreements reached do not always translate into actions or subsequent legislation. For example, after almost 20 years, with the Good Friday Agreement turning 20 years old next year, there is still no bill of rights for the North or charter of rights for the island. This issue of rights is at the heart of the current difficulties. The refusal by the British Government and by the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, to embrace rights is at the heart of the ongoing difficulties in the Northern Assembly, contrary to the Fianna Fáil leader's untruthful claims about two problem parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_388"> The letter recently sent by over 200 citizens from civic society in the North, mainly nationalists, to the Taoiseach, identifies these issues and concerns. The human rights lawyer, Niall Murphy, one of the signatories, identified rights as critical to the future stability of institutions in the North. He asked why there should be a right in Donegal and not the same right in Derry. The communiqué sheds no light on the future role of the European Court of Justice and in particular the right of European citizens in the North to have access to the courts in the EU. I first asked this question on Monday a few weeks ago, after the aborted press conference, and the Taoiseach did not answer it. Will he tell us how he squares the circle of the British Government saying it is going to end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, to withdraw from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and to repeal the Human Rights Act when that threatens the very human rights elements and safeguards of the Good Friday Agreement?</p>
            <p eId="para_389"> Finally, I dislike the term "Northern nationalist". One never hears of western, southern or eastern nationalists but I welcome the Taoiseach's assertion that no Irish Government will ever leave Northern nationalists behind again, not least because it acknowledges since partition the reality of life for most nationalists in the North.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RichardBoydBarrett" eId="spk_163">
            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_390">There has been consensus in this House about the need, whatever negotiations and disputes may be happening between the United Kingdom and the European Union, to maintain the position of having no hard border and to get those commitments. We saw from David Davis' comments that the British Government cannot be fully trusted and the constant repetition of "nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" is still a slightly worrying backdoor out of commitments. That being said, I think everybody in this House has held fast to the key issue of having no hard border and should continue to do so but the pressure is undoubtedly going to intensify in the second phase as the trade discussions unfold between Britain and the European Union. We can see that Britain cannot entirely be trusted, given the elements that exist in the Tory party that have a hard Brexit perspective and do not really care about the consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_391"> Has the Taoiseach had any indication from the EU about its attitude towards those trade negotiations? It seems to me that it makes no sense for anybody to have tariff barriers or borders, not just on a North-South basis but on an east-west basis. I worry, in the same way that there are fairly rotten politics from the Tories, that there is an element in the EU that wants to punish Britain for political reasons and may also be tempted in that regard when it comes to wider negotiations. We have to say that not only do we want no border between east, north and south, but it does not make any sense for anybody to play politics with getting a good deal which is good for everybody. That means ensuring we do not have custom barriers, tariff barriers or any other kind of barriers in as far as it is at all possible for everybody's best interests.</p>

            <p eId="para_392">Many questions have been posed to the Taoiseach and I look forward to receiving the answers. We need to acknowledge the strong support given to the Irish position by the other EU 26 and key personnel such as Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt. I have a technical question about the legal status of the text agreed between the UK Government and the EU last Friday. Different interpretations have been put forward. We heard one interpretation by the EU, others from spokespersons for the European Commission and others from spokespersons for the UK Government. Has the Attorney General been consulted on the process leading up to the agreement?</p>
            <p eId="para_393">Has the Attorney General given any advice to the Government on the final text agreed? I seek clarification on the legalities of the text agreed. I accept the European Council has to consider the matter further at this week's meeting. I ask the Taoiseach to give some legal clarification regarding the text agreed last Friday.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_165" as="#Taoiseach">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_394">I will try to answer as many of the questions asked as I can. The joint report agreed by the EU and the UK - Ireland is of course part of the European Union team - was agreed on Friday last. It is my intention to endorse it in Brussels at the European Council on Thursday. It is a political agreement so it is more than a statement of intent. It is politically binding. As a political agreement, it sets the parameters for the UK withdrawal agreement, which is legally binding. Therefore, this is a political agreement between the EU on the one hand and the UK on the other. It informs the content of the UK withdrawal agreement which will be a legally binding international instrument.</p>
            <p eId="para_395"> It is worth recalling two important sentences from the joint report. The last sentence in paragraph 43 states: "The United Kingdom also recalls its commitment to the avoidance of a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls." That is the definition the EU and UK have made of a hard border - no physical infrastructure, no related checks or controls. Paragraph 46 states: "[The commitments] are made and must be upheld in all circumstances, irrespective of the nature of any future agreement between the European Union and United Kingdom." Therefore these are commitments which must be upheld in all circumstances irrespective of the nature of the final agreement between the EU and the UK. While people in different places for all sorts of reasons will put their own complexion on what this report means and does not, I will quote from the black and white text because that was hard negotiated and very much defends our position.</p>
            <p eId="para_396"> However, as I said on Monday, this is not the end; it is only the beginning of the end. I said on Friday that it would be very important for us as a Government to be fully engaged and vigilant when it comes to phase two. That involves the withdrawal agreement, phase two, new treaties, the drafting thereof and the ratification thereof. Brexit is not sorted; it is just starting. There is a long way to go yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_397"> If the schedule is adhered to - it may not be but I think it will be - the United Kingdom will leave the European Union in March 2019. There will then be a transition period for roughly two years. There will then be a new relationship. This is something that will go on at least until 2021. During that period it will require from this Government the same level of engagement and vigilance we have shown in the past year. It will take a lot of politicians' time, civil service time and Government resources. However, it is something we have to do and very much intend to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_398"> I was asked about the EU-UK new relationship, the final status relationship if one likes, after 2021. I was interested to learn that the United Kingdom Cabinet is meeting this week to consider that and I will be interested to know the outcome of its deliberations as to what the United Kingdom would like to see its new relationship with the EU look like. Our view is very much that the relationship that exists between the European Union and the UK should be much as it is now. We never agreed with Brexit as a policy; we do not think it is a good thing. Therefore, of course, we would like a new status, a new relationship between the EU and the UK, resembling as much as is possible what we have now. That is very much the position we will feed into in determining the EU position, which has yet to be done. We will have to agree guidelines for the second phase of negotiations and that has not been done yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_399"> Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct on one level: there will be different views across European capitals on this. Some people in other European capitals will be less enthusiastic than we are about maintaining the status quo. We also cannot ignore the fact that they might have a point. Some of those countries will say it is not right that Britain should continue to have all the benefits of the customs union and all the benefits of the Single Market while leaving it and having none of the responsibilities, costs or obligations. We have to listen to that argument because that is a fair point. The European Union will fall apart - or may fall apart - if countries can pick and choose, if they can have the benefits of membership but none of the responsibilities, obligations or costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_400"> While I absolutely want to retain free trade as it exists now between Britain and Ireland and between Britain and the EU, crucial to making free trade happen within a free-trade bloc is that free trade must be fair. I do not think we can have unfettered free trade with a neighbouring country or a third country that has lower labour standards, lower health and safety standards, inferior animal welfare standards, reduced environmental standards or engages in state aid. The European Union happened in the first place to ensure we could have free trade across Europe, but also so that we could have the same harmonised basic and minimum standard to ensure that trade was fair.</p>
            <p eId="para_401"> These are all things we will have to consider as 27 member states in developing guidelines for the final status agreement. That is where the whole concept of maintaining full regulatory alignment is at its strongest. "Maintain" means to keep as it is now, full and not partial alignment, making sure that our rules and regulations are line with each other. While I have heard some comment on alignment, we sought legal advice from the Attorney General on it. Alignment is a term used in European law and European treaties. It is the specific term used in accession treaties. When countries apply to join the European Union, they have to align their rules and regulations with the <i>acquis communautaire</i>, with European law, before they join. Maintaining full alignment after a country leaves is in many ways something similar but, of course, that is the backstop option and there are two other options as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_402"> In terms of the ongoing negotiations, as part of the joint report we have agreed that we will retain a dedicated Irish stream throughout phase two because of the unique issues that Ireland faces that have not gone away. They are still relevant and that is why we have that written into the joint report.</p>

            <p eId="para_404">I do not know for certain. That is something I will be talking to Michel Barnier, Jean-Claude Junker and Donal Tusk about on Thursday. I imagine it will be something similar to what we have had in the last number of months where no member state was a member of the task force, but Ireland was, if one likes, behind the door in the next room when it came to any issues pertaining to and specific to Ireland - not general issues. I suspect it will be something on those lines, but I will have an opportunity to meet Mr. Junker, Mr. Tusk and Mr. Barnier at the EPP summit before the Council. That is one of the things we will discuss there and thereafter also.</p>
            <p eId="para_405"> Deputy Micheál Martin picked up on a remark I made about no future Irish Government leaving Irish citizens in Northern Ireland behind. Certainly I did not mean any offence by that. I was not referring to governments that existed over the past 20 years. Good work was done by the Government of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern. Deputy Martin's work as Minister for Foreign Affairs during some of that period was sterling work and something of which he should be very proud. I was not trying in any way to disparage or make any offensive remarks about any Government over the past 20 years, not least the ones that succeeded in putting together the Good Friday Agreement. I was making a more historical point, referring to the fact that in the 1920s we were forced to accept partition. We were weak as a country; we were a fledgling country and had to accept partition. As a consequence we left behind hundreds of thousands of people who consider themselves to be Irish and were, in fact, then and remain Irish citizens. Then through the 1920s and 1930s let us not forget that it was governments in this State and this Oireachtas that put up the customs posts in the first place that then through in the 1930s engaged in an economic war that divided us further from Britain and from Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_406"> Looking back historically in the 1950s and 1960s, Irish Governments at that time could perhaps have done more to vindicate and stand up for the civil rights of Catholics in Northern Ireland at that time. That is what I was referring to and not the past ten or 20 years. Certainly it was not-----</p>

            <p eId="para_426">My first question is to ask the Minister of State to give an update to the House on any discussions he has had with the Defence Forces representative organisations on the issue of mandatory retirement, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_427">Military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals. It is necessary that members of the Defence Forces are physically and mentally capable of meeting the challenges of all military operations and to undertake duties on deployments at home and overseas.  To this end, it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way.</p>
            <p eId="para_428"> The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990s and was the subject of severe criticism by a series of external reports, mainly PricewaterhouseCoopers Consultants and the Efficiency Audit Group, EAG. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by this audit group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. A range of policies was introduced to ensure an appropriate age profile and levels of fitness, including fixed term contracts for enlisted personnel of certain ranks. These are kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_429"> My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, announced last week that he had secured Government approval for an increase in the compulsory retirement age from 65 to 70 for public servants recruited before 1 April 2004. The uniformed pension accrual group, including gardaí, members of the Permanent Defence Force, fire fighters and prison officers, who are currently required to retire early due to the nature of their work, will not be covered by the new arrangements. The retirement ages for these groups will be best dealt with at sectoral level where the detailed policy, operational and manpower issues relevant to those groups can be appropriately considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> A claim to increase the mandatory retirement age for all officers has been received from the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force. The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are confidential to the parties involved, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_431">Retirement benefits for the Defence Forces were designed to align and factor in the payment of the contributory State pension into final benefits. Mandatory retirement ages in the Defence Forces kick in well ahead of eligibility for the contributory State pension, which is currently 66, and, as the Minister of State said, will increase to 70. Before 2013, it was factored in that there was a unique situation within the military in the requirement that they require earlier than other public servants. The Minister of State will be aware that in the Conciliation Council Report, CCR, No. 421, the agreement between the parties noted that the Department of Defence acknowledged that the compulsory early retirement regime applicable to military officers sets their occupation apart from other occupations in the public service, so there is an anomaly. However, the current position is that the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012 does not allow for a supplementary pension for those persons who are forced to retire early. There is no bridging gap until they get the State pension and they are at a considerable disadvantage if they come in after 2013. Does the Minister of State not accept that this particular anomaly needs to be addressed?</p>

            <p eId="para_432">I thank the Deputy. At the recent Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, conference, similar concerns to those the Deputy has raised were raised with me in speeches by the president and the general secretary and also in a private capacity in one of the meetings I had with members of RACO. I took their concerns on board. I spoke to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, specifically on this issue. I am aware that members of my Department and members of the representative association, RACO, had meetings with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform specifically on this issue in which they raised their concerns. The Deputy is aware that this does not immediately affect any person who retires post-2013 but the officials from the Department of Defence and RACO met with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure Reform specifically on this issue after I approached the Minister, Deputy Donohoe's Department on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_433">The negotiations on the single pension scheme in 2012 did not reference or include from any side this accepted agreement that was in place prior to that. In fact, at no point was it outlined by the Department that the agreement would be compromised in any way and the representative associations clearly understood that the supplementary arrangement already in place would remain a key element of the integrated model. The expectation, therefore, was that this would continue and there were no discussions of any sort with the representative associations to the effect that it would not continue. Pre-2012 officer entrants had an entitlement to the State pension when they retired but since then the new entrants do not have such an entitlement. Does the Minister of State not agree that is unfair and is yet another example of the reason the Department is failing to retain officers? We have a retention issue. This is one element of that; it is certainly contributing to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_434"> In short, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform did not acknowledge the flawed nature of the Defence Forces new entrants superannuation scheme. Will the Minister of State agree that the Department has potentially breached the CCR agreement No. 421? The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform states that the Minister of State, as the Minister for Defence, has the authority to recommend and provide for unique conditions of service where mandatory early retirement in advance of the payment of the State pension, contributory, is to continue. Will the Minister of State take it upon himself to address that anomaly? I accept it has been raised many times with him and similarly with me. It does not affect a huge number of people but it is vitally important that we fix the problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">I do not have the powers to do that. That accusation has been put to me previously. This only affects people who retire early and are on permanent retirement. If an officer of member of the Defence Forces retires at 50 or 55 years of age and he or she continues to work for ten years, up to the official retirement age, they do not get the supplementary pension. It only affects a small number of officers rather than enlisted personnel. The Deputy would accept that. </p>
            <p eId="para_436"> The Deputy is right to say that the Defence Forces are different to other areas of the public service. As I stated, it is about both physical and psychological fitness to meet the unique demands placed on members of the Defence Forces. The Deputy mentioned that this is a retention issue. I would encourage the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, when it is making submissions to the pay commission, to highlight this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">Rates of pay and conditions of employment in the Defence Forces have traditionally been set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various sectors of the Irish public sector. Like other areas within the public service, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced during the financial crisis. The Government appreciates the contribution made by all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis and is taking measures to restore pay across all sectors. The focus of the increases are weighted in favour of those on lower pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_440"> The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts 2009 to 2015, otherwise known as the FEMPI legislation, and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2018 - the Lansdowne Road agreement - define current pay policy. Successful negotiations with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations have provided for pay increases to Permanent Defence Force personnel under the Lansdowne Road agreement. The Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_441"> An increase of 2.5% from 1 January 2016, for annualised salaries up to €24,000 and 1% for annualised salaries between €24,001 and €31,000 was paid in July 2017. An increase of €1,000 from 1 April 2017, on annualised salaries up to €65,000 per annum, was also paid in July 2017. In addition, improved payscales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post 1 January 2013, were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_442"> The Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for a series of pay increases over the three years of the agreement ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% with the benefits to different income groups weighted towards those on lower pay. The agreement also provides for the restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances under FEMPI from 1 October 2020. The proposals have been presented for consideration to the Permanent Defence Force representative associations that participated in the negotiation process on the agreement. They are subject to ballot by members of the associations. The agreement will bring undoubted benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force.</p>

            <p eId="para_443">Does the Minister of State accept the pay is so low that one in five members rely on social welfare payments to cover food and living costs? Does he accept that there has been a dramatic increase in the number of Defence Forces members qualifying for the family income supplement payments and that some Defence Forces members sleep in their cars because they cannot afford to get petrol to allow them to travel to and from work? Is he aware that last week, one mother told the public and the media how she chose food for her children over medication for her depression and that in another case, a child was heard to say, "It's okay, mammy, we will get dinner when daddy gets paid"? Does the Minister of State understand that there is a need to address this problem quickly? If that does not happen there will be an even greater outflow of members from the Defence Forces, thus creating a greater crisis?</p>
            <p eId="para_444"> The Minister of State read out proposals. Proposals are not good enough, considering the approach that has been taken by the Government in recent years, continuously targeting those who provide vital service to the State. Most of the concerns that PDFORRA, the Defence Forces members and the WPDF group have outlined thus far have not been addressed.</p>

            <p eId="para_445">There has been a decrease in the number of people in receipt of family income supplement. The latest figure is 117, but it has decreased since the pay increases came into being.</p>
            <p eId="para_446"> I have heard reports of Defence Forces members having to sleep in cars. I do not dispute it but if it is the case and the Deputy has examples, I would appreciate it if he would bring those cases to my attention.

Has the Minister of State committed to a review of the Defence Forces pay and conditions, in particular the allowances, to ascertain whether they are appropriate for this day and age? Has the Minister of State managed to meet the WPDF group? They are in a much better position than I am to explain exactly how the families of the Defence Forces members have to survive when their loved one is at sea or deployed overseas. </p>

            <p eId="para_449">I will make sure that nobody is victimised, nor should they be victimised, if they approach either association because they have fallen on hard times. I find it unbelievable to think that people would be victimised in such a way. The Deputy spoke about the 24-hour duty allowance. I met the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, two weeks ago to discuss this matter. The officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my own officials will have further negotiations on this. The rest of the allowances are covered under the public service stability agreement to 2021. I understand that one of the biggest concerns of the associations and members of the Defence Forces is the issue of the 24-hour allowance and that is one of the reasons I approached the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and asked him for a meeting. I understand the frustrations of members of the Defence Forces on this specific issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_452">The 2015 White Paper on Defence commits to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising of 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service personnel. The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 October 2017 stood at 9,219, whole-time equivalent, which is 97% of the establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_453">This comprises 7,417 member of the Army, 744 members of the Air Corps and 1,058 members of the Naval Service. The establishment strength of 9,500 provides for the full staffing of each unit within the Defence Forces organisational structures. The ratio of strength to establishment for each unit is determined by the extent to which vacancies within the establishment for each unit are filled. There are vacancies across most units and recruitment efforts are under way to address those vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_454"> In this context, personnel deployed from units or engaged in development training should not be confused with vacancies. Units are maintained in order that personnel can be deployed, not in order to remain fully manned in barracks. The Defence Forces have always drawn personnel from units for overseas service and other deployments. Personnel also engage in training on an ongoing basis. This is to be welcomed and any decisions regarding scaling back on overseas deployments, deployments at home or training will be informed by the advice of the general staff. I can confirm that I have not received any such advice. </p>
            <p eId="para_455"> Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is, understandably, a significant annual turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces. However, in recent years the levels of departures have exceeded intakes and this has limited the Defence Forces' ability to meet their establishment strength. To counteract this, ongoing targeted recruitment has taken place with the objective of returning to, and maintaining, the stated establishment figure of 9,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> As I have previously outlined, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts, such as those relating to pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians. These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-State sector job opportunities. The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. </p>
            <p eId="para_457"> The number of officers as of 31 October 2017 was 1,056 out of an establishment of 1,233. The suggestion that there are vacancies in 50% of officer posts in units is clearly at variance with these figures. The number of cadets in training has substantially increased recently, with approximately 100 cadets having been recruited in each of the years 2016 and 2017. Approximately 70 cadets will be commissioned as officers in January 2018.</p>

            </p>
            <p eId="para_459"> On foot of issues raised in the climate survey, I have brought forward a White Paper project to examine skills gaps across the Defence Forces. This will provide an opportunity to examine any gaps arising across the Defence Forces and to bring forward recommendations having regard to work practices, training practices and other issues arising.</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_461"> With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake both the home and overseas tasks laid down by Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_462">My question relates to the number of units in which the strength in station for officers is running at less than 50%. When replying to that point, the Minister of State referenced cadets and training. That is not the same as officers in station. When questions are put to the Minister of State and his Department about the strength of the Permanent Defence Force, his response always makes reference to the establishment and the strength of the Defence Forces. On the previous occasion on which I put that question to him, like today, he confirmed that the Defence Forces are at 97% of their establishment strength. Does the Minister of State acknowledge that the Defence Forces establishment only factors in trained personnel and does not account for personnel in training? They are not the same. Is it not the case that this figure of 97% misrepresents the actual number of trained personnel while also failing to factor in the complete numbers deployed on operational duty?</p>
            <p eId="para_463"> I know that the Minister of State was presented with certain figures on officer numbers and on strength in station at the RACO conference. That is the basis of my question to him today. Some of the figures with which I was presented showed that many units are operating with less than 50% of their establishment officer strength. The ordnance unit, that is the bomb disposal unit, has an establishment figure of 21 officers but has eight in station. One battalion has only five officers out of an establishment figure of 25 in station. In another, there are seven out of 25 and in one case there is only one fifth of the establishment strength. Why does the Minister of State fail to factor in the number of lieutenants and captains who are unavailable because they are on permanent postings to overseas units into Defence Forces establishment figures? Clearly, there are units operating with less than 50% of their establishment officer strength in station.</p>

            <p eId="para_464">First, I recognise that we do have challenges at officer level, specifically at the ranks of lieutenant and captain. There were, however, increases in the cadet classes in 2016 and 2017 and I am committed to continuing to have large intakes of cadets because it is the only way in which we can address the challenges we have at officer level. I do not want to stop officers going overseas or availing of further education. It is very important that they upskill themselves in that way. There are a number of areas in which we are trying to address challenges through the Public Sector Pay Commission next year. Civil staff, the military and the representative associations will be looking at specialist pay. That was highlighted in the report of the Public Service Pay Commission in May 2017. It highlighted that there were challenges in the Defence Forces. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has stated that specialist pay negotiations with the Public Service Pay Commission will include certain areas in the health sector and the Defence Forces. They are two priority areas for the Minister and for the commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_465">The reason we asked the question about strength in station is so that we can ascertain the level of officer numbers. This is the management level of the Defence Forces. I know for a fact that the Minister of State was presented with figures at the RACO conference which showed that a number of units including ordnance bomb disposal, transport and engineering are currently operating at below 50% of their establishment strength in station. They do not have the requisite number of officers. The engineering corps is operating at 50%, the ordnance unit at 38%, and the transport corps is operating at 20% strength in station. When the Minister of State is asked the question about the level of officers in each station and references those who are in training or overseas, it does not give us an accurate picture of what is happening. I am not for a second saying that we should restrict the numbers of those going overseas, in training or undertaking further education. We need to allow that in order to maintain standards. However, we also need openness and transparency when it comes to painting the picture of what is happening operationally. When the Minister tells me that we are at 97%, we know that is not the case. That figure includes those in training and those not available to carry out duties. That matters. The figures need to accurately reflect the numbers in station and available for duty. The figures provided by the Minister of State's Department are inaccurate.</p>

            <p eId="para_466">The figures I gave are accurate. I got them from my Department. The current officer strength level is 86%. I absolutely recognise that we have challenges in specific areas. I have stated this on numerous occasions. I am trying to come up with proposals and ideas on how to surmount those challenges. One of the things I have asked for is direct entry and re-entry. A number of officers, specifically those who were in engineering posts, pilots and those who were serving with the European Defence Agency, EDA, want to come back into the organisation. I do not disagree with the Deputy and I will not say that we do not have challenges. I do not believe, however, that the figures she has highlighted are the real figures. I would be the first to state that there are challenges at junior officer level. That is one of the reasons we have increased the number of cadets coming in.</p>

            <p eId="para_468">For too long, members of the Defence Forces have been treated like second-class citizens in the context of our public service workers. The Defence Forces have always been our last line in service provision. If the weather is too bad for commuting, the Army will be called in. In times past, the Army even cleared rubbish off our streets when industrial action led to environmental damage. The Defence Forces have never been treated on par with the rest of the public sector. That must change.</p>

            <p eId="para_469">As I stated in an earlier reply, the rates of pay and conditions of employment in the Defence Forces have traditionally been set by reference to relative levels of pay across the various parts of the public sector. Arising from the serious financial crisis the country faced, the pay of members of the Permanent Defence Force was reduced in a similar way to that of staff in other areas of the public service. The reductions in pay were on a graduated scale with higher percentages being deducted from those on higher earnings.</p>
            <p eId="para_470"> Under current and proposed public service pay agreements, pay is being restored to public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force. Successful negotiations with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations have provided for pay increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement, the most recent of which were paid to members of PDFORRA in July, together with arrears dating back to 1 January 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_471">The Government is prioritising legislation to provide for further pay increases to all public servants, including members of the Defence Forces, under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020. Under the provisions of the Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017, it is anticipated that between 2018 and 2020 the pay of members of the Defence Forces and other public servants earning less than €70,000 will be restored to pre-FEMPI levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_472"> The timetable for the restoration of pay as set out in the agreement is as follows: from 1 January 2018 annualised salaries will increase by 1%; from 1 October 2018 annualised salaries will increase by 1%; from 1 January 2019 annualised salaries up to €30,000 will increase by 1%; from 1 September 2019 annualised salaries will increase by 1.75%; from 1 January 2020 annualised salaries up to €32,000 will increase by 0.5%; and from 1 October 2020 annualised salaries will increase by 2%. The agreement also provides for the restoration of the 5% reduction in allowances under FEMPI from 1 October 2020. The proposals have been presented for consideration to the Permanent Defence Forces representative associations and acceptance will be subject to ballot by their members.</p>

            <p eId="para_473">I thank the Minister of State. Those provisions are not good enough and a special arrangement for the Defence Forces is needed. The Minister is aware of the 24-hour demonstration by wives and partners of Defence Forces members that took place on 30 November outside Leinster House. Those spouses highlighted that members of the Defence Forces are still the poorest-paid public servants and some struggle to meet food and living costs, with many depending on family income supplement, as has previously been raised in the House. The lowest-rank of Defence Forces officer is paid a little under €300 per week. How can anyone sustain themselves on such a wage, let alone a family, when housing costs alone are taken into consideration, not to mention utilities and basic life needs? Some members of the Defence Forces who have 15 years' service are struggling to make ends meet. The Defence Forces representative bodies, including Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, are currently unable to access the industrial relations mechanisms of the State. It is up to the Minister of State to put in place a mechanism and timetable to ensure members of the Defence Forces are paid a professional wage that will afford them a standard of living equivalent to that of other public servants and which will reflect the great work they do on behalf of the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_474">The Deputy was in government with me from 2011 to 2016 and saw at first hand the challenges faced by the country and the decisions that had to be taken. Now that we are in better economic times, there is an opportunity to give back to all public servants what was taken from them during the recession. That is why the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, has set out a clear timetable for pay restoration for anyone earning less than €70,000. As the Deputy is aware, all public servants who signed up to the Lansdowne Road Agreement received an increase. The Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, signed up very early to that agreement and PDFORRA signed up earlier this year and received back payments thereunder. As the Deputy is aware, further pay increases will be paid under the Lansdowne Road agreement. The Public Service Pay and Pensions Bill 2017, which addresses FEMPI measures, passed through the Dáil last week and is currently making its way through the Senate. As I stated, it will be a matter for both associations to ballot on that and I encourage them to return a positive outcome in that regard. There has also been provision for a €5,000 increase for all members of the Defence Forces who joined since 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_475">It is time for the Defence Forces to be recognised in the industrial relations sphere in order that its members be protected from the working poverty that many currently experience. If the Garda Representative Association can be negotiated with, why can the same not be done with the Defence Forces representative associations? The Minister of State rightly said that there were difficult times in the past but as the economy improves we cannot let what happened before happen again. Sectors of society, including parts of the public sector, cannot be left behind. The Government cannot continue to preside over a body of personnel of whom up to 20% are in receipt of family income supplement. That is immoral. The Minister of State needs to get his hands around the issue and prioritise decent wages and conditions for the men and women of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> The leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Howlin, last month called for a special review of the Defence Forces. The Minister of State referred to the general, across-the-board review but there is a need for a special review of the Defence Forces and I again call for that to be done. It is urgently required and there would be no opposition in the House to it but, rather, there would be agreement from all sides in view of the situation in respect of pay in the Defence Forces. All Members would support it and there would be no opposition from other public servants. I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge that he might consider or push for that.</p>

            <p eId="para_477">The Deputy stated that 20% of members of the Permanent Defence Forces are in receipt of family income supplement. I ask him to check his figures. Fewer than 117 members of the Defence Forces out of a total personnel of a little over 9,200 are in receipt of family income supplement. To state that 20% are in receipt of family income supplement is untrue. That myth has been peddled in recent times. The correct figures are available from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection for anybody to check.</p>

I have put in place a full review of the conciliation and arbitration scheme as both PDFORRA and RACO have sought for many years and will soon be announcing a chairperson in that regard. I heard Deputy Howlin's proposal last week regarding taking out members of the Defence Forces. It would be great to do that but how long would it last? One would then want every other public sector worker to be taken out. All Members saw what happened prior to 2011. We must act in an appropriate manner with public finances.</p>

            <p eId="para_482">The White Paper on Defence confirms that the primary role of the Reserve is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in times of crisis. In non-crisis situations, the main focus is on training to prepare for that role. The Government has also assigned a formal role to the Reserve in respect of contributing to State ceremonial events. The Government appreciates the service of the members of the Reserve and the White Paper on Defence is clear that there is a continued requirement to retain and develop the Reserve Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_483"> As of 31 October 2017, there were 1,733 effective personnel in the Army Reserve and 123 effective personnel in the Naval Service Reserve. I am aware that there is a shortfall between those figures and those of the establishment. The most recent recruitment campaign for the Army Reserve and Naval Service began in July 2017 and attracted 1,221 applications. A total of 128 personnel have been inducted to the Reserve Defence Force in 2017, which is an increase of some 60% compared to the 80 personnel inducted in 2016. The recruitment process has been streamlined so as to make it more efficient.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> Given the competing recruitment demands at present, whereby Permanent Defence Force recruitment is and should remain a priority, recruitment to the Reserve is continuing but it should be noted that the same personnel and resources are utilised for both Permanent and Reserve Defence Force recruitment and the recruitment of up to 800 Permanent Defence Force personnel this year obviously impacted on resource allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_485"> Two of the current phases of the White Paper actions to be implemented specifically relate to the RDF. One addresses the issue of improving the strength of the Reserve by attracting recruits from all backgrounds, while the other involves conducting a skills survey with a view to establishing a specialist Reserve. Both are well advanced. In the medium term, over the ten year lifespan of the White Paper other projects relating to the development of the Reserve will be examined and developed by the organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_486"> I assure the Deputy that I remain committed to the ongoing development of the RDF within the framework set out in the White Paper on Defence and having regard to resource availability.</p>

            <p eId="para_487">The Reserve has been in decline for some time. While it had 2,280 effective members at the end of 2015, this decreased to 2,049 at the end of 2016 and to 1,975 at the end of March 2017, and figures given to me last month show that the current total strength of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, is now 1,856. There is therefore a downward trajectory all the time. Recruitment is the lifeblood of the Reserve, and without a steady flow of new recruits the organisation is doomed to erode away to nothing. Many reservists believe the decline in numbers is due not to a lack of interest on the part of people looking to join but due to the lack of importance with which the Reserve is viewed by elements within the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence. It is now clear to me, to many in the Reserve Defence Force and, I assume, the Minister of State that the single force concept does not benefit the Reserve. Will the Minister of State make a commitment that the Reserve Defence Force will be given a defined role, which is essential for both its future development and the morale of the organisation; that reservists will be allowed to play a meaningful and worthwhile role in support of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF; and that members of the RDF will become an integral part of the decision-making process surrounding their activities in order that they be involved? Until we address these key issues, the strength figures will go down and down again and we will back here in six weeks' time discussing the same issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_488">I am determined to ensure that the Reserve Defence Force does not go into decline, but my number one priority must be recruitment to the PDF and getting its strength back up to 9,500 personnel. As I stated in my reply, the Reserve and the Naval Service Reserve began their recruitment campaign in July 2017 and attracted 1,221 applications, and 128 personnel have been inducted so far in 2017. I have asked for the reasons for the shortfall between the figures I have outlined and whether ensuring the medical and fitness tests take place on weekends has an effect. Most of these people are in full-time employment and are given the opportunity to sit their medical and fitness tests on weekends. A huge number of these people do not turn up on the date fixed for them. They have been given every opportunity. I have asked the Chief of Staff and the general staff to ensure applicants are given every opportunity to sit their fitness test and so on on weekends. I met representatives of the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association, RDFRA, a number of weeks ago. One of the areas we discussed was recruitment, and I have put both civil and military-----</p>

            <p eId="para_490">I accept that the Minister of State is committed to the Reserve Defence Force but the figures are going down all the time. While we are standing here saying how committed we are, there needs to be action to address the fall in the numbers. I believe the Reserve Defence Force is being strangled when it comes to recruitment and the recruitment process. I have outlined to the Minister of State on a number of occasions the difficulties inherent in the medical and fitness tests and the timing of same. Garda clearance, specifically getting it back on time, is also a major issue, as is the lack of communication to people looking to join the Reserve Defence Force. There are issues here, and devolving the matter to the Reserve Defence Force itself might help address some of them. We need to examine the possibility of RDF members going overseas. This was mooted a number of years ago and needs to be put back on the table. We need legislation to ensure that members of the Reserve do not face any employment barriers, a review of legislation, Defence Forces regulations governing the RDF, regular recruitment campaigns for the RDF and new retention initiatives. I appreciate the PDF is a priority in the Minister of State's Department, but we can do both at the same time. We have that capability. It is not rocket science. Renewed efforts must be made. The Reserve Defence Force is meant to have a strength of more than 4,000 but we are now at 1,800, so these are dire straits. If we continue the way we are going, we will have no RDF left - the organisation will not exist.</p>

            <p eId="para_491">One of the areas the Deputy referred to was recruitment. I had a long conversation with the RDFRA about this and I have asked my Department, the Defence Forces and RDFRA to discuss what RDFRA wants out of the recruitment process, the way in which it wants it run and, if it has any ideas in this regard, to bring them to both the relevant civil and military bodies and ensure RDFRA knows the ways and means by which it wants to bring them to fruition. I am very open to that. I have stated on numerous occasions that if there are people who have specialisations in RDFRA, they should be given the opportunity to go overseas. This came under the single force concept as well. However, it is difficult for people to get time off work and so on. These people are normally in permanent full-time employment and for them to get five or six months off work can be quite difficult at times. I hope the decisions we made this year on the streamlining of security checks will make a difference for 2018. It is totally unacceptable that someone wishing to join the Reserve Defence Force is left hanging for five, six, seven, eight or nine months before he or she is notified of the decision as to whether he or she is being taken on, and I have stated this on numerous occasions. This is one of the reasons I have streamlined-----</p>

            <p eId="para_494">There has correctly been much talk recently about the pay and conditions of Defence Forces personnel, but I wish to raise the issue of the Defence Forces pension system, which is a total mess. Rules which have been changed over the austerity years are simply having a brutal impact on retired members. Those who entered the Defence Forces as officers from 2013 and who will have no choice but to retire at age 58 or 60, will face the loss of the value of their contributory pensions. Meanwhile, there is the issue of pension abatement, which also consistently has a major impact.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_495">I take it that the Deputy is referring to the absence of the concept of "supplementary pensions" from the provisions of the single public service pension scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_496"> The occupational pension scheme terms of post-1 January 2013 new entrants to the public service, including the PDF, are governed by the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme and Other Provisions) Act 2012. All first-time new entrants to pensionable public service employment on or after that date are members of the single scheme. Under the 2012 Act, overall statutory responsibility for the single scheme pension terms and rules rests with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> The single scheme was one of the key structural fiscal reform commitments agreed by Government with the EU and the IMF in 2010 under the programme of financial support for Ireland. In the context of the Government's decision to introduce the single scheme, a stated primary objective is to help significantly reduce the cost of public service pensions in the long term through reform of the public service pension system.</p>
            <p eId="para_498"> The new scheme will be fairer, particularly for those on low and moderate earnings and, above all, the public service will be better able to manage the costs associated with the demographic and other changes which are under way. These policy objectives and the underlying rationale for them were well publicised in advance of the enactment of the 2012 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> The terms and rules of the single scheme, however, make no provision for the concept or award of supplementary pensions for any new entrants joining any public service group on or after 1 January 2013. This position has been confirmed to the PDF representative associations.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> However, there are many other established features of the pre-1 January 2013 public service occupational pension schemes that have been discontinued or fundamentally changed under the single scheme. Among the most notable of these changes is the introduction of career-average pension accrual under the single scheme. This is in place of the more costly final salary pension accrual applicable in the earlier "pre-existing" public service pension schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_502"> I should also mention that, notwithstanding the distinguishing features of the single scheme, members of the PDF in that scheme retain the minimum pension age of 50 to reflect operational needs, as already applies to new entrant military personnel recruited since April 2004. Importantly, the single scheme also retains "fast accrual" pension terms for groups such as the Defence Forces, given that for operational and HR policy reasons they are required to retire earlier than the norm, and on that account they retain early-paid pensions and accelerated pension accrual.</p>

            <p eId="para_503">I ask the Minister of State to take a look at this issue. Defence Forces pensions are not like Civil Service pensions; they are a completely different category altogether. Subjecting them to the same rules and regulations, which are being applied in a very slapdash manner, is not helpful for people who loyally serve this State. We are talking about people retiring - being forced to retire - at, say, age 58 or 60, not being able to get their State pension until they are age 66 or 67 and then, when they perhaps seek employment to make up the shortfall, are subject to the pension abatement criteria, which are being applied in a completely slapdash manner. This means that people who have been trained and are highly qualified cannot in essence get jobs in the public sector at present or they will see the value of their pension deducted from their employment. We therefore have the ridiculous scenario whereby officers and highly skilled people who have left the Army are working in low-pay jobs as shelf-packers in Tesco, where they can keep their pensions, instead of getting jobs in the public sector. It is an absolute joke, and I appeal to the Minister of State to examine how this is being applied.</p>

            <p eId="para_504">This issue was raised on numerous occasions at meetings of the representative associations. As a consequence, officials in my Department and association delegates met with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to discuss it. I take Deputy Daly's point that if a member who was recruited before 1 January 2013 retires from the Permanent Defence Force at a specific age and does not take up other employment, he or she is entitled to the supplementary pension, but persons recruited after 2013 do not have the same entitlement. This change will not affect any members in the short term, but after the associations raised it with me, I spoke to people in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and a meeting was set up with my officials and the association delegates. I understand the matter is under negotiation.</p>

            <p eId="para_505">I welcome the Minister of State's acknowledgment that there is a problem. In fact, it is a substantial problem and the whole system seems to be in complete disarray. If the meetings to which he referred are meaningful at all, they will uncover the scope of the problem. Looking at the abatement position, it is not even applied evenly across Departments. Nobody seems to know what the rules are for Defence Forces members or how to apply them. Some members who move to certain State agencies and Departments are seeing their pensions cut while others are not. Members going to work in semi-State agencies do not see their pensions at all but members going into Departments do. It is not even clear whether the policy is being applied evenly within Departments. The more than 1,000 highly skilled and trained people who left the service between 2016 and 2017 and who cannot see out their remaining years without working are being severely impacted by this. I am glad the Minister of State is looking at the issue, but I urge him to ensure it is addressed urgently and that a substantial overhaul of the system is undertaken. While I recognise that some of the measures he referred to were introduced for the Civil Service for good reasons, the Defence Forces are a different category entirely.</p>

The Deputy may be aware that I have undertaken to review the contracts of recruits from 1994 and 2006. The change we are discussing will not affect anybody immediately, being applicable only to those who joined after 1 January 2013. This means it will be 2040 or perhaps the mid-2040s before there is an impact on personnel. As I said, the matter is under consideration by officials in my Department, and they and the representative associations have met with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. I am not sure how those negotiations are going on, but it is a matter for the latter Department to find an acceptable solution to this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_512">I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 59, 79 and 82 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> As part of a whole-of-government approach, my Department is engaged in forward planning with the other Departments involved in addressing all issues relevant to the United Kingdom decision to exit the European Union. </p>
            <p eId="para_514"> Recruitment to the Defence Forces is at an historically high level. By the end of October, 702 personnel had been inducted into the forces in 2017. Investment in new equipment in respect of land, air and maritime capabilities is being pursued. A maintenance and upgrade programme has been entered into for 80 armoured personnel carrier, APC, vehicles at a cost of €55 million, exclusive of VAT, and contracts for a small number of armoured logistic and utility vehicles for force protection have been entered into this year at a cost of €11 million, exclusive of VAT. A tender competition is ongoing to replace the Cessna aircraft with three fixed-wing utility aircraft. The ship replacement programme has seen three new ships enter service since 2014 and a contract for a fourth ship due to enter service in 2018 has been placed, at a total cost of more than €250 million. </p>
            <p eId="para_515"> The UK's decision to leave the EU does not in itself give rise to additional Border control requirements at this time and, therefore, there is no reason to revisit earlier decisions on the closure of barracks. Those closures enhanced the operational readiness and deployability of Defence Forces personnel and, along with other measures, involved the redeployment of personnel from barracks, headquarters and administrative posts into front-line operational units. The recent progress on the first phase of Brexit negotiations gives encouragement regarding the resolution of Border issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_516"> Primary responsibility for the internal security of the State rests with the Minister for Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána. Responsibility for the security aspect of Border control rests with An Garda Síochána, while the Revenue Commissioners have responsibilities relating to their particular mandate. As the Deputy noted, among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of aid to the civil power, which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda Síochána when requested to do so. The Defence Forces also provide support to the Revenue Commissioners. </p>
            <p eId="para_517"> I am satisfied that the Defence Forces have the resources available to them to fulfil all roles assigned by Government as set out in the White Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_518">The Minister of State is missing the point of the question I am asking. Nobody is seeking a militarised or nanny state. What I am proposing is that we have an Army presence along the Border which would leave communities feeling safer. We hear constantly in this House about the lack of resources in the Army and the Garda Síochána. It is about presence, visibility and a deterrent to crime. I referred specifically to smuggling in my question but this is also about the ongoing illegal activity that goes on in the Border region. We need an Army presence there to make people feel safer. That is what people want to see in terms of aid to their communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">It is a matter for An Garda Síochána to request the assistance of the Defence Forces. Following the successful talks last week on the European stage and between the Government and its British counterpart, I do not foresee a need for members of the Defence Forces to be stationed once again along the Border. Nobody in this House wants to see that. If the support of the Defence Forces is required by An Garda Síochána, along the Border or anywhere else, it will be provided under the aid to the civil power function. The Garda Síochána and the Minister for Justice and Equality have responsibility for the security of the State. The Defence Forces work hand in hand with the Garda, whether in training exercises or otherwise, to assist in any eventuality that might arise. Everybody will be happy not to see the hard border that was being predicted prior to the successful negotiations last week.</p>

            <p eId="para_520">Again, the Minister of State is wholly missing the point. I am not for one minute advocating militarisation or using the Army as a back-up to the State. I am talking about having a presence in communities. I am advocating for this in the context of barrack closures, including in Castleblayney and Cavan.</p>
            <p eId="para_521">Bringing units of the Army into community facilities on a regular basis, even as part of the training process, would allow people to feel safer. I am satisfied that if a poll was taken on the issue of getting people out into the communities - not in an armed capacity, but as a back-up to the Army - we would solve a lot of the issues relating to burglaries and crime because when there is a such a back-up in place, it acts as a deterrent.</p>

            <p eId="para_522">There are no plans to reopen any of the barracks that were closed during the recent reorganisation of the Defence Forces. I absolutely take the Deputy's comments on board but while the purpose of the Defence Forces is to protect the security of the State, it would be totally irresponsible to say that they have a role to play such as that suggested by the Deputy. The role of Defence Forces is to aid the civil power and assist An Garda Síochána. I do not believe that bringing members of the Defence Forces out on to the streets for security reasons would help in that regard; it would do quite the opposite. An Garda Síochána is doing a very fine job.</p>

            <p eId="para_523">My colleague, Deputy Breathnach, has made a very reasonable suggestion. He is not for one second suggesting that we have total militarisation on our streets. Deputy Breathnach is merely suggesting a visibility and a presence against the backdrop of Brexit. Along the Cavan- Monaghan-Louth stretch of the 500 km long Border, businesses are especially vulnerable in the context of their exposure to smuggling. Our Defence Forces are truly missed in Cavan, Monaghan, Castleblaney and Cootehill, where, previously, troops had been stationed. The Minister of State referred to An Garda Síochána's duty and remit in this regard. In the Border region, the Garda Síochána is working against the backdrop of depleted resources. Gardaí do not have the capacity to do their job. There is also a lack of supervisory capacity. The Minister of State spoke about the Defence Forces not being needed in the area because An Garda Síochána can do its job. I am sorry to tell him that the reality in the Border area is very different.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">It was the Minister of State who referred to the role of An Garda Síochána in this regard, not me. In light of the potential for smuggling along the Border, it would be wrong to say that An Garda Síochána can pick up the slack, particularly if there is to be no reinstatement of troops in the area. The reality is that the Garda is under-resourced and does not have the necessary manpower in place. Local Garda stations have closed all across the Border region, especially in counties Cavan and Monaghan. It is unfair of the Minister of State to say that I should raise the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality. It was the Minister of State who referred to the role of An Garda Síochána. We have seen the closure of Army barracks and we have seen troops being obliged to leave their families and homes to work further afield. This is not just for normal work shifts; it is to stay further afield for longer periods.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> I am disappointed to hear the Minister of State say that he does not have any specific plans to consider the reinstatement of troops. Deputy Breathnach quite rightly suggested that troops be deployed to community resource centres or other centres to show a visibility or a presence. That is a fair point. An Garda Síochána cannot do it alone - it would be the first to admit that - so why not deploy troops to do that job also?</p>

            <p eId="para_531">I absolutely disagree with Deputy Niamh Smyth. If members of the Defence Forces were patrolling local communities across the Border region, it would totally send out the wrong message. Such a deployment would be absolutely and completely inappropriate. I am personally opposed to it. As already stated, if An Garda Síochána requests that members of the Defence Forces be deployed in order to aid the civil power, such a request would - like all requests - be considered. After the successful Brexit negotiations last week, I genuinely feel that we are in a space that I thought would be difficult to get to whereby there is not going to be a hard border and people, North and South, will be able to continue doing business in the way they have done in recent years. I remember when members of the Defence Forces were stationed on the southern side of the Border and British forces stationed on the northern side. It was not a pretty sight.</p>

            <p eId="para_537">From the most recent figures available, as of 31 October 2017, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force stood at 9,219 whole-time equivalent, WTE, personnel. In recent years, the levels of departures have exceeded intakes and this has presented challenges in meeting the establishment strength of 9,500 personnel. To fill vacancies, there is significant ongoing recruitment at both enlisted and officer level and it is anticipated that approximately 800 new personnel will have been inducted into the Permanent Defence Force during 2017. This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> In addition, a range of recruitment methods are being employed including direct entry competitions for specialist positions and the scope to further expand direct entry is being considered. I have also directed civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former personnel with appropriate skill sets to re-enter the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> As I have previously outlined, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts, such as those relating to pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians. These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-State sector job opportunities. I understand that the retention of such specialists has proved challenging for many military forces internationally and it is not unique to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> The strength figure of 9,219 personnel includes 604 WTE female personnel, broken down as follows: Army - 496 female personnel; Air Corps - 34 female personnel; and Naval Service - 74 female personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_541"> Currently, females represent approximately 6% of Defence Forces personnel. The programme for Government contains a commitment to increasing this rate over the five years of the programme's duration.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_543"> A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase the level of female participation. These include the targeting of female websites as part of recruitment campaigns and visits to female schools by Defence Forces personnel to promote a career in the Defence Forces to women. I remain committed to maximising recruitment to the Defence Forces and ensuring that, where possible, the terms and conditions of service are appropriate to the needs of the organisation and as favourable as they can be within the current budgetary parameters.</p>
            <p eId="para_544"> With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, the Government is committed to retaining the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_545">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. Perhaps he will indicate the degree to which it is anticipated that means can be found to encourage more interest in careers in the Defence Forces. What research has been done to ascertain the reasons for a reduction in the number of young people taking up careers in the Defence Forces? How is the gender balance measured against the rest of the inductions in to the Defence Forces? For example, is there a distinct difference between the level at which women are prepared to enter the Defence Forces compared with that at which men are prepared to enter?</p>

            <p eId="para_546">I would be the first to state we have faced challenges in fulfilling our gender targets. I have asked civil and military management to look at recent recruitment campaigns and to establish the number of female applicants for the Permanent Defence Force, and how many may have fallen off by the time of interview or around the time of the medical and fitness test. This is very important information for us to have. Recruitment is a matter for the Defence Forces but I have regular meetings with them and one area in which they are very involved is focusing on women's sports and women in sport and in targeting those women.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> I am conscious of the number of people who have left the Permanent Defence Force over the past two years. It was for a range of reasons but one important reason is a stronger private economy than had been the case.</p>

Over the past two to three years we have been losing young, fit men and women who have the capability and capacity to give another ten years or more to the Permanent Defence Force. I announced this review at the recent PDFORRA conference. The review of contracts is something PDFORRA has sought for some time and it welcomed my decision. Those joining the Army, in particular, want to serve overseas and to do so as soon as possible after training having done two or three years back home. We are doing everything to give them the opportunity to do that.</p>

            <p eId="para_557">I am pleased to inform the House that yesterday, at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels, Ireland joined the other 24 EU partners in collectively launching PESCO. Joining PESCO does not involve an additional cost to the Exchequer. Additional costs may arise in respect of participation in specific PESCO projects similar to the case where the Defence Forces participate in European Defence Agency projects. As the projects will relate to the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for peace support and crisis management operations, such costs would be incurred in the normal course and will therefore be met from within the Defence Vote. </p>
            <p eId="para_558"> The Deputy will be aware that the allocations for defence announced in the budget means that Ireland’s total defence expenditure will increase in real terms over the coming three years. It is also expected that sharing the costs of capability development across a number of member states should provide for greater economies of scale in terms of overall defence investment expenditure. </p>
            <p eId="para_559"> PESCO has been presented to the Council by means of a notification. This notification clearly states that it does not prejudice the security and defence policy of the member states. The notification also states that the member states remain sovereign and that the commitments will be implemented fully in accordance with the treaty, its protocols and the constitutional provisions of the member states. As such the budgetary process and role of Oireachtas in determining the Defence Vote remains untouched. </p>
            <p eId="para_560"> The European Defence Fund, EDF, and PESCO are separate but complementary initiatives. The EDF will be funded from the EU budget and will not therefore impact on the Defence Vote. The EDF aims to co-ordinate, supplement and amplify national investments in defence. </p>

            <p eId="para_562">By pooling resources, it is proposed that individual member states can achieve greater output and develop defence technology and equipment that may not be feasible on their own. The fund will also foster innovation and promote a more efficient market within the defence sector, eliminating duplication and fostering greater competitiveness. </p>
            <p eId="para_563"> Ireland has strongly supported the continued development of the capacity of the EU to contribute to international peace and security through the deployment of capabilities on peace support and crisis management operations under the common security and defence policy, CSDP. Both PESCO and the EDF will enhance and contribute to that EU capacity.</p>

            <p eId="para_564">There is a contradiction in the Minister of State's answer. On the one hand, he states the budget will not increase but then he states it will be increasing anyway and it will be covered as part of that. It is a simple fact that the notification to which we signed up last week, thanks to Fine Gael and its friends in the Independent Alliance and Fianna Fáil specifically has the commitment to "regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms in order to reach agreed objectives". As PESCO commitments are binding, we have to increase that expenditure. There is no solace to be had by saying it might have increased anyway because the type of increased expenditure Members would seek are improvements to the pay, conditions and pension entitlements of Defence Forces personnel, not expenditure on a project that is clearly driven by the arms industry across Europe. It is uncontested that PESCO, along with the European Defence Fund, is driven by arms manufacturers sitting at the heart of the European Commission. We are talking about €6 billion a year in grants to the arms industry from EU member states under PESCO. The Minister of State needs to explain it a little more.</p>

            <p eId="para_565">The White Paper on Defence clearly states there will be ongoing investment in the Defence Forces. I have stated this on numerous occasions, here in the Chamber last week, before the select committee last Wednesday evening and in replies to parliamentary questions over the past 12 to 18 months. PESCO is provided for in the Treaty on European Union in Articles 42.6 and 46 and Protocol 10, which were introduced by the Lisbon treaty. PESCO was comprehensively discussed in the context of the Lisbon treaty, which was approved by the Irish people by referendum in October 2009. It is not the case that PESCO just appeared in this House last week. It has been debated at European level, it has been debated here at national level as part of the Lisbon treaty. I have heard some outrageous comments about us entering a European army, that we are giving away our sovereignty on neutrality. It could not be further from the truth.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">The Minister of State is completely wrong. The Irish people voted again in the Lisbon treaty when they got the answer wrong the first time. To baldly state that this issue has been discussed in Irish society is simply wrong. There has hardly been a single article in the press or any coverage in the media at all. If one were to randomly stop people on the street, even people who are usually very well informed have an incredibly low level of knowledge about PESCO, what it means and our involvement in it. It is not an exaggeration to say that the reason it was rushed through in such an unorthodox way was to avoid that type of public scrutiny because the Minister of State knows well that Irish people do not want to be part of a European army. The Minister of State is correct to refer back to the White Paper on Defence. It explicitly urges steps towards the creation of an EU army, such as integration of military capabilities and defence industries but it is not something that the Irish people have had the chance to address.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">I think that is one of the reasons the Minister would not let us address it.</p>

We already have an opt in-opt out facility so why do we need to join a group to have more opt-in and opt-out? We are not opting in but joining. Ireland's neutrality is a matter of Government policy rather than a requirement of statute law as it is not in the Constitution. An exception to this is Article 29.4.9°. Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív played his part in ensuring this was in the Nice and Lisbon treaties. Following an amendment, it states: "The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State." We are not supposed to be joining this but only yesterday Jean-Claude Juncker boasted:</p>

I answered written questions on the matter on 16 December 2016, 17 May 2017, 12 July 2017 and 22 November 2017, and I answered oral questions in July 2017, as well as a topical issue in November 2017.

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_585">I propose to take Questions Nos. 51, 57, 64, 70 and 83 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_586"> As I said earlier in reply to a previous question, the pay of the Permanent Defence Force, similar to other areas within the public service, was reduced during the financial crisis. The reductions in pay were on a graduated scale with higher percentages being deducted from those on higher earnings. This action was one of the measures that it was necessary to take to stabilise the financial situation which faced the country at the beginning of this decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> The Government appreciates the contribution made by all public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force, during the economic crisis. Under public service pay agreements, pay is being restored to public servants, including members of the Permanent Defence Force. Successful negotiations with the Permanent Defence Force representative associations have provided for pay increases under the Lansdowne Road agreement. These pay increases were weighted in favour of the lower paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> PDFORRA signed up to the Lansdowne Road agreement in March 2017. The finalisation of negotiations under the agreement allowed for the commencement of the process for the implementation of pay increases and arrears, which have now been applied to the Permanent Defence Force. In addition, improved pay scales for general service recruits and privates who joined the Permanent Defence Force post-1 January 2013 were backdated to 1 July 2016 and paid in August 2017. Gross annual earnings for this cohort is €27,000, inclusive of military service allowance. This is a significant increase in pay, which was approximately €21,800 per annum prior to this agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_589"> Family income supplement provides a means to supplement a family’s income, be its members employed in the public or private sector, having regard to combined family income and the number of dependent children. Pay levels in the public service, including the Defence Forces, are determined on an individual basis and are not weighted in accordance with family circumstances. Going forward, there is potential for further increases arising from the recent negotiations on the extension to the Lansdowne Road agreement. The public service stability agreement 2018-2020 contains proposals for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement. The proposals have been presented for consideration to the Permanent Defence Force representative associations which participated in the negotiation process. They are subject to ballot by members of the associations. The agreement will bring undoubted benefits to members of the Permanent Defence Force. I encourage members of the Permanent Defence Force to ballot for acceptance, so that they may start to feel the benefits of the increases in pay arising from the agreement in early 2018.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_590">My question was on what steps the Minister was taking to reduce the number of persons in the Defence Forces in receipt of family income supplement. If the Minister tells me he is happy that our Army is dependent on family income supplement, we are in serious trouble. In previous questions, he has repeatedly said he is committed to increasing the expenditure on defence and he acknowledges there is a crisis, with more people leaving the services than going into them. I understand that approximately 580 leave every year so when I ask what steps he is taking, the Minister might say what the Government is doing to address the crisis in addition to what has been agreed with unions or representative bodies. It seems to have any amount of money to spend on a European basis but not on basic salaries to lift basic conditions in the forces.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_591">I remind the Deputy that fewer than 117 people, out of a total of 9,219 or 9,220 whole-time equivalent members, are in receipt of family income supplement in the Defence Forces. It is totally untrue to say there is a large number, or a high percentage, of people in the Defence Forces in receipt of family income supplement. This information is also in the public domain.</p>
            <p eId="para_592"> The Deputy referred to the large number of people leaving. The number is above average for the past number of years but there is always a high turnover in the Permanent Defence Force and it is nothing new in the Defence Forces. There is a budget for 9,500 personnel and I spelled out the increases we have given. I am not sure if the Deputy was listening but we went through a recession from 2011 to 2016. On this side of the House, we have to mind the pounds, shillings and pence and to act in a prudent way.</p>

            <p eId="para_593">One thing I do is listen very carefully. My question related to family income supplement and other welfare supports. It is an absolute scandal that members of our Army have to resort to family income supplement and other welfare supports, at a time when there is no shortage of money to commit to the militarisation of Europe. I do not think people stood outside the Dáil last week, in the coldest of weather, just for the fun of it. They did so to tell us how difficult it was to survive on the money they are getting. Can the Minister stand over the fact that they are on minimum pay?</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> The Minister's answer referred to "117 customers" but it is unacceptable to refer to them as customers. They are households, families and people who are on family income supplement, not customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">I outlined to the Deputy the pay increases. All elements of the public service were subjected to pay cuts during the financial crisis. On completion of recruit and three star training, newly qualified three star privates and their Naval Service equivalents can expect minimum gross annual earnings of €27,000, up from €21,800 last year. A newly qualified non-graduate entry second lieutenant can expect a minimum of €34,915 per annum after 15 months training, while a graduate entry lieutenant can expect a minimum of €39,860 per annum after 15 months training. The first point on the payscale for a corporal, including military service allowance, is €37,000. The first point on the payscale for a sergeant, including military service allowance, is €39,600.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> With regard to family income supplement, fewer than 117 families are in receipt of family income supplement in the Defence Forces.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_599">The Minister of State will recall that my colleague, Deputy Lisa Chambers, and myself at each meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence when defence issues have been discussed have raised the need to improve the pay and conditions of members of the Permanent Defence Force. I cited examples of real hardship to families directly to the Minister of State where, unfortunately, the previous Government closed Dún Uí Neill Barracks in Cavan, which was the most modern army barracks in Europe and the only purpose-built barracks in Ireland. Those members were transferred initially to Athlone to Custume Barracks, but subsequently most of them have ended up serving in barracks in Dublin. </p>
            <p eId="para_600"> There is a cost on individual members travelling to their place of work. In many instances there may not be a second motor car in the household and there are extra costs when the member of the Permanent Defence Force is away at work and the spouse, wife or partner is at home caring for children. Real hardship has been inflicted on these people. There is a need for them to get an improvement in pay and conditions. They do not want to have their spouses or partners out on the streets. They want to be rewarded for the work they do in a very professional way. I come from two counties in the south of Ulster where we had the benefit of the protection of the Permanent Defence Force when paramilitary organisations were trying to bring down the State. They have always done us proud and we should reward those people for their work on behalf of all of us.</p>

            <p eId="para_601">I am the first to recognise that when barracks closed during the reorganisation extra costs were incurred by members of the Defence Forces and I am not disputing this. Since I was appointed to this position in May 2016 I have asked that members of the Defence Forces are located as closely as possible to their homes and this is happening. A number of family initiatives have been introduced by the Chief of Staff and the general staff to comfort members of the Defence Forces. I am the first to recognise this. There have been real salary increases which I have stated and I do not want to state them again, during the Lansdowne Road agreement and the extended Lansdowne Road agreement and for post-2013 members of the Defence Forces whereby they received a €5,000 increase which was backdated. There has been a huge amount of increases.</p>

            <p eId="para_602">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I urge him to continue to engage with PDFORRA and other representative organisations to ensure the areas of conciliation and arbitration are dealt with. There are other issues apart from pay and conditions. I emphasise the need to ensure members doing us proud in their work on behalf of the State go home with a decent wage packet every week to meet the needs of their families so they do not have to have people out on the streets protesting on their behalf and seeking proper remuneration for a job they do very well in the most difficult circumstances. When there are difficulties in this country and abroad we call upon those people to rise to the task ahead. They work in difficult circumstances. They are away from home a lot of the time. All of us would pay quite rightly our commendation for the work they do abroad championing Irish foreign policy in awfully difficult circumstances. Those people should be properly rewarded for their work.</p>

            <p eId="para_603">In pay restoration for all public servants anybody on less than €70,000 per year will have their pay fully restored and this is part of the legislation going through the Seanad at present and which went through the House last week. I engage regularly with the representative organisations PDFORRA and RACO. The report of the Public Service Pay Commission published in May 2017 highlighted the Defence Forces. There are areas in the Public Service Pay Commission that will sit next year on specialist pay. The health care sector and the Defence Forces are recognised as needing urgent attention. The Deputy can be absolutely assured I will continue to push that we show appreciation to members of the Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">From the most recent figures available, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force is currently 9,219 personnel, or 97% of the establishment of 9,500 personnel. To return to and maintain the agreed strength levels, significant targeted recruitment has taken place in 2017 which resulted to date in 702 personnel being inducted, comprising general service recruits, cadets and specialists for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service. Similar recruitment campaigns are being planned for 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> As I have previously outlined, there are particular challenges with vacancies in certain specialist posts, such as pilots, air traffic controllers and certain technicians. These specialists can prove difficult to retain where, as in the current economic circumstances, there are ongoing private sector and commercial semi-State sector job opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> The number of officers as at 31 October 2017 is 1,056 out of an establishment of 1,233. The number of cadets in training has substantially increased recently, with 100 cadets having been recruited in each of the years 2016 and 2017. Approximately 70 Army cadets will be commissioned in January 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> To address these difficulties, a range of recruitment methods are being employed, including direct entry competitions for specialist positions. I have directed the civil and military management to develop proposals for expanding such direct entry recruitment of specialists and a scheme to facilitate former members of the Permanent Defence Force with appropriate skill sets to re-enter the Defence Forces. The Public Service Pay Commission will further examine the issue of retention of specialist personnel in accordance with the provisions of the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_610"> In tandem with these actions, my Department is also engaged in planning on a longer-term basis. Projects arising from the White Paper on Defence around topics such as medium-term manpower planning and encouraging as wide a pool as possible for recruitment are already under way. Further projects, scheduled to begin in the new year, will address issues such as age profiles and a gap analysis of skill sets within the Permanent Defence Force. The gap analysis will help to identify the frequency of such gaps and identify appropriate measures to address them.</p>

            <p eId="para_611">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who was kind to allow me to come in. The other side of the very poor pay and conditions are the huge gaps in the establishment figure of Defence Forces. The Minister of State told me recently there are only seven crews to man eight ships in the Naval Service. The bomb disposal unit workload has doubled but there are major gaps in that unit. The most serious of all is the Air Corps. A few months ago, the Minister of State told me there were 132 vacancies in the establishment figure. We saw the serious impact of this in March 2017, in the tragedy off the Mayo coast when an Air Corps plane was not able to be brought into use.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Clearly, there are major gaps across the Defence Forces. I voted against PESCO. I believe that a strongly neutral country should have an effective defence force that is well paid, well looked after and available to serve the nation.

            <p eId="para_617"> There was a big occasion in the House earlier this year when Travellers were declared an ethnically distinct group in our society. The real question is whether this will translate into a change in their status and well-being. The Traveller community survey that was carried out is extremely informative. It shows the serious challenges faced by the Traveller community. I compliment the Traveller organisations and the Community Foundation for Ireland for commissioning this analysis. It follows many other analyses. I recall a study carried out, as part of a far bigger analysis of social attitudes, by an tAthair Micheál MacGréil in which he tracked this issue over many decades. The standing of many groups changes but, as he said at the time, the standing of Travellers is the great apartheid in Irish society.</p>
            <p eId="para_618"> The highlights from the survey are quite scary. Some 62% said that accommodation issues are worse than they were five years ago and 72% said that mental health issues are worse than they were five years ago. Unemployment, at 50%, is worse than five years ago. The survey states that 60% are not working but when one adds to that the number who are on schemes or in Traveller community work, we find that it is over 90%. This means only 10% are in commercial employment. More seriously, 0% of Travellers are in State employment. This is an issue I tried to deal with when I served as a Minister. We looked at ways of ensuring that people from the Traveller community would be brought into the public service. Another pertinent factor is the fact that only 30% of Travellers who get training end up in employment. That is a very low progression rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> Some 36% of Travellers state that they have very poor health, which is way above the national average. We are aware of the suicide rate and, in particular, there is a high rate of mental health issues among men, as well as low self-esteem. Unfortunately, 48% say that they have experienced discrimination at the hands of the Garda and 25% say they have experienced it with housing authorities. Unlike their counterparts in the settled community, a very high percentage of Travellers must interact with housing authorities for public housing. A much higher percentage of the rest of the community provides its own housing and would not have day-to-day contact with housing authorities. The figure in respect of pub staff, shop staff and so forth is approximately 30%. A figure that those of us who work consistently with Travellers can testify to is the 90% who say that they have been the subject of discrimination by the public at large at some time in their lives. It is interesting that, in this survey and the one last year, the figure for Connacht-Ulster is 10% to 20% lower, which shows there is more social acceptance in that province.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_620">I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this important matter. We both acknowledge that the Traveller Community National Survey is a timely and valuable resource. I have read it a number of times. It covers a range of important issues affecting the Traveller community.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> As the Deputy will be aware, last June I launched the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy for the period from 2017 to 2021. I am sure the Deputy has a copy of it. If he does not, I will arrange for a copy to be sent to him. The steering group, which I chair, was established to oversee the development and implementation of the strategy. This group is made up of officials representing relevant Departments and agencies, as well as representatives from the national Traveller non-governmental organisations, NGOs. The strategy contains ten themes. Grouped under these, 149 actions were identified as necessary to help to advance the betterment of the lives of Travellers and Roma in Ireland. To date, work has begun on approximately 100 of the actions. Accommodation is highlighted as a priority for Travellers in both the strategy and the survey. The 2018 capital provision for Traveller-specific accommodation is €12 million, an increase of €3 million on 2017. Further funding may be considered throughout the year, also on a case-by-case basis, in light of progress across the programme generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> Regarding education, the national strategy contains 14 key education-related actions. While improvements on education outcomes for Travellers as opposed to five years ago are reflected in the 2017 national survey, I am well aware that much more needs to be done, and is being done, in this regard. In fact, a sub-committee of the national strategy steering group has been established to deal with the issue of retention of Traveller and Roma children in education. At its most recent meeting, a proposal was jointly agreed by my Department, the Department of Education and Skills and Tusla to implement a pilot project on this issue in four locations with high Traveller and-or Roma populations. Tusla's education welfare service, comprising the statutory Education Welfare Service, the school completion programme and the home-school community liaison scheme, are key supports for Traveller children.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> Earlier this year, the Department of Education and Skills published the DEIS Plan 2017. The plan includes specific actions relating to Traveller and Roma education to promote improvements in school attendance and completion. It should be noted that the Department of Education and Skills continues to provide a number of specific additional resources to support Traveller and Roma children in the school system, including: 141 alleviation resource teacher posts for schools with significant numbers of Travellers and Roma at a cost of €8.46 million; and additional pupil capitation for Travellers and Roma, at a rate of €70 per pupil for primary level and €201 per pupil for post-primary level, at a cost of €1.11 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> The outcome of the first strand of the programme for access to higher education, PATH, funding was announced by the Minister for Education and Skills in April 2017 and €2.7 million will be allocated through PATH 1 over the next three years to support initiatives by centres of teaching excellence to increase diversity in the teaching profession. Through the PATH 2 1916 bursaries fund, €6 million will be invested in bursaries for students from target groups, including Travellers, over the next three years. Each bursary will be worth €5,000 per year and may be held in addition to a Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant. The PATH 3 higher education access fund is intended to support regional clusters of higher education institutions to attract 2,000 additional students, full-time or part-time, from groups currently under-represented in higher education, including Travellers. A total of €7.5 million will be allocated over the next three years through the PATH 3 fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_625"> Turning to access to employment, the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection operates a wide range of employment supports. While, in general, the Department's measures are available to Travellers on the same basis as the rest of the population, community employment has special provision for members of the Traveller community.</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> Traveller health is also a priority area under the national strategy. Examples of targeted support programmes include funding of a range of Traveller agencies and groups to implement priority programmes and actions via service level agreements, such as primary health care projects, counselling services, family support programmes, men's health projects and so forth. In addition to funding to agencies for the delivery of Traveller health programmes, the HSE employs a number of public health nurses and related staff to address priority health needs of members of the Traveller community. In addition, the National Office for Suicide Prevention funds Exchange House Ireland to address the mental health promotion and suicide prevention needs of the Traveller community. Nine mental health service co-ordinators are currently being recruited by the mental health division of the HSE with the aim of driving, managing and supporting implementation of agreed Traveller programmes and actions in respect of Traveller mental health.</p>
            <p eId="para_627"> The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has allocated approximately €500,000 to support several projects specific to Travellers nationwide on the basis of proposals received from local authorities regarding developing facilities for the urban Traveller horse population.</p>
            <p eId="para_628"> A great deal more is being done, and it needs to be done.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_629">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. In the limited time available, I wish to focus on two important issues. The first is that we provide money for Traveller-specific accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">The problem is that under our current system, we can bring the horse to water but we cannot make it drink. The reality is that in many local authority areas, including one very close to me, the local authority is not drawing the money down despite it being available and is not making the hard decisions because there is local opposition. It is very hard to get a Part 8 and where it involves voluntary housing, they stop it because they will not sell the land. </p>
            <p eId="para_631"> One thing that could be done in 2018 is to change the law if necessary to take responsibility for making decisions about Traveller-specific housing away from local authority members and give it to An Bord Pleanála, where most issues wind up anyway. The Minister of State knows that when it involves the local authority, the reality is that members must vote and that just does not happen in some local authorities. It is non-functional.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> The other issue is employment. It is interesting when we look at education because it is one place where significant improvement was made between 2000 and 2017. The percentage of those with the junior certificate has gone from 9% to 39% while the percentage with the leaving certificate has gone from virtually 0% to 16%. The percentage at third level is 5% between postgraduate, undergraduate degree, diploma and other third level. That is a great improvement from nothing. It is small but it is an improvement. However, we are not translating that into the workplace. The State should ensure that quotas are put aside to ensure that Travellers are incorporated in the public service and Civil Service. The social change that would bring about would be immense because the more we integrate people into the mainframe of society, the more the pace of change will accelerate, everybody will have a better life and the community will feel more included in Irish society.</p>

            <from>Deputy David Stanton<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_633">I acknowledge the Deputy's point that the recognition last March by the Government and indeed by all parties here of Travellers as an ethnic minority represented a crucial step forward in the relationship between the Government, the Traveller community and the settled community. It is my aim that the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy will build on this landmark decision and we will work to bring about concrete improvements in the lives of Travellers across the country. The national strategy is a work in progress. I ask everybody to support and become aware of it to ensure it works.</p>
            <p eId="para_634"> Again, I note the Deputy's understandable concerns about the issues affecting the Traveller community, which have been covered by this survey. My Department and I are ensuring that progress continues to be made regarding tackling each of the areas of concern raised in the national Traveller community survey. Implementing the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy is a key objective of mine in co-operation with other key stakeholders. Again, I ask councillors around the country to row in behind this strategy and support it. They have a responsibility as councillors to do that. </p>
            <p eId="para_635"> In line with the objectives of the national strategy, the programme that is of real benefit to Travellers is the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which has the aim of reducing poverty and promoting social inclusion and equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration. The SICAP funding allocation for front-line delivery for 2017 is €37.5 million, which includes an allocation of €3 million under the European Social Fund's programme for employability, inclusion and learning programme 2014-20. It is a key priority of Government and as a key intervention for the hard to reach in society, the Deputy will be pleased to know that the programme's target groups include Travellers in particular. From 1 January to 21 March 2017, SICAP supported 22,105 individuals, of which 385 self-identified as Irish Travellers with 147 local community groups supported under SICAP where Travellers are a named target group. </p>
            <p eId="para_636"> I note the Deputy's desire for more Travellers to be included and employed by the State, including Government Departments. Again, this is also part of the strategy. The strategy is very new, having been launched in June. I look forward to everybody supporting it and working through it. Everybody agrees that the challenges are enormous. There is a lot to be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and other Members of the House for facilitating this debate. It is hugely important that carers are recognised and supported. It is a fact that there has been a crisis in respite services in County Louth. I welcome the interest shown by all my colleagues in Leinster House both in the Dáil and Seanad in resolving this issue. I acknowledge the intent and commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in respect of dealing with this issue not just in County Louth, but around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> It is shameful that families have been left in this appalling situation for too long. When one sees how people like Jacinta and May in Dundalk and others - I am just using first names - look after their families and care for them and their total commitment, one sees how all their lives are devoted to their family members. They look after them at home but when they need urgent care and respite, it is not available in County Louth. I know a recent edition of "Prime Time" identified what we need to do. I welcome the Minister of State's commitment to solving this problem and that he came to Drumcar to see an issue there in a school for children with disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> It is very important that, as our economy improves, the funding, services and support are put in behind those who care most and who have the least amount of help. I know that in CHO8, in which the HSE operates in our area, over 100 people are waiting for respite care, which is a huge number. It is unacceptable. We have gone through a very difficult period economically. Now that our economy is restored, the funding must be found and I hope the Minister of State has good news for us today. I will hand over to my good friend and colleague, Deputy Breathnach.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DeclanBreathnach" eId="spk_286">
            <from>Deputy Declan Breathnach<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_640">Yet again, we are here highlighting the plight of the families in Louth looking for respite care for their loved ones. When I came into this House, I gave a commitment that I would champion the cause of people with disabilities collaboratively with my colleagues in the Dáil and Seanad. We have continued to highlight that issue to the Minister of State. Like Deputy O'Dowd, I thank the Minister of State for his interest in trying to solve the problem not just in Louth, but across the country. In respect of Louth, it took the "Prime Time" programme entitled "Carers in Crisis" for many of us to realise the difficulty faced by these families due to the lack of respite care, which is clearly not just a crisis in Louth, but across the country. These families have been left alone to cope.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> Despite all the parliamentary questions we have put and all the opportunities to raise the matter under the Order of Business or Questions on Promised Legislation, this is the second, if not the third, Topical Issue on this matter. A resolution can be found. We have put a series of proposals to the Minister of State over a period of time and I am sure Department officials have looked at them. Praxis Care has recently purchased a property in Dundalk and the Talbot Group has an ideal property in Balbriggan. I am sure that with the Minister of State's help and encouragement, a resolution can, it is to be hoped, be found in my constituency. The figures in County Louth have always been skewed because of the St. John of God operation in Drumcar and the funding it receives, which covers a lot of people across the country. I would welcome a statement from the Minister of State that these facilities, which are badly needed in Louth, will be provided urgently.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">I thank Deputies Breathnach and O'Dowd for lobbying me for many months on this important issue. I also thank the Deputies for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the provision of respite services in County Louth. Let me make it clear at the outset that the Government's ongoing priority is the safeguarding of vulnerable people in the care of the health service.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">We are committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities that will empower them to live independent lives. In recent months, I have spoken to many people with disabilities and their families and carers. The same point has been raised again and again on the absolutely urgent need for increased respite care throughout the country. I accept it as a valid argument and that is why I appeared on "Prime Time" last week to face the music and deal with the issue. I have made it very clear to my colleagues in government and after much discussion, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and I have secured an additional €10 million for the HSE, specifically to enhance respite care in the disability sector. We agreed that extra €10 million at Cabinet.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> Many people with disabilities are being cared for by very elderly parents who are finding it very hard to cope. Other carers simply do not have the hours in the day to look after other members of their families and, just as importantly, their own health and well-being. The full details of the services to be provided with the additional €10 million will be contained in the HSE’s detailed operational plan. I have made it clear that this money must be ring-fenced for respite services within the disability sector and that it must be targeted at those who are most in need. I am pleased to inform the House that €8 million will be provided for nine new dedicated houses for respite in each community health area, plus an additional three houses in the greater Dublin area to respond to the very high demand for respite in this area. These additional 12 respite houses will provide approximately 19,000 respite nights yearly to the people living in those areas. In addition, a further €2 million extra funding will be used for innovative respite solutions, such as home sharing and extended day services, to provide assistance where people need it most. I will be keeping a very close eye on how this additional funding is put to work and I will be requiring the HSE to give the utmost priority to putting these new facilities and services in place without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> I accept that the provision of respite services has come under additional pressure in the past number of years. More children and adults are now seeking access to respite and the changing needs of people with a disability are also having an impact, as they, along with the rest of the population, live longer lives. A Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the need for respite services to be developed further and I am fully committed to ensuring this happens.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> In the context of respite services in County Louth, discussions are ongoing at CHO area 8 level regarding the emerging need for additional respite services and the options to be developed to meet these needs. The HSE continues to work with agencies to explore various ways of responding to this need in line with the budget available. The additional funding I have announced today will include the development of respite services in CHO area 8, including County Louth. The officials in CHO area 8 are familiar with the TaIbot Bower House proposal for respite services. Scoping out the most efficient way of commissioning respite services with this new money will be an immediate priority for the HSE to ensure services are brought on stream without delay. The Deputies will appreciate that any proposals can only be considered within the funding available to the HSE and must adhere to a rigorous procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> I warmly welcome the extra €10 million for respite services because it is urgently required.</p>

            <p eId="para_648">I welcome the Minister of State's announcement. It will be music to the ears of the many families and disability groups who have encouraged us to harass and harry the Minister of State over the past number of months. I had no doubt of the Minister of State's concern to have this matter resolved. I welcome his commitment to the allocation of €10 million and his commitment to make sure one of these facilities will be based in Louth. Further to that, it is most important that with the age profile of families and the growing numbers who will need these services that we continue to enhance them in the years to come. With that in mind, the issue of the funding of the St. John of God in Drumcar, which came to almost €32 million, needs to be examined in terms of whether we are getting value for money in delivering those services. I will speak on that matter later. I thank and commend the Minister of State for bringing some respite to a very difficult situation in Louth.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I agree absolutely with the Minister of State and my colleague opposite that this is really good news for everybody who needs respite care. It is a start but it is not the final answer. It is a way of finding a reasonable solution. There is nothing reasonable about people who are on their own who cannot cope. There is nothing reasonable about a person bringing a family member to a house in the middle of the night, only to be refused entry and having to go to an acute hospital instead to take up an acute bed with a security person outside the door and all sorts of other issues. It is an unacceptable situation. This will definitely help to resolve it. There is no doubt about that and I welcome it. I welcome the commitment to ongoing discussions and the Talbot Bower House proposal, which I visited. It is a very fine place.</p>
            <p eId="para_650"> This is an issue on which all political parties stood together. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and the Labour Party stood together to push for something and we got it. It is a positive result for a community that needs 100% support.</p>

            <p eId="para_651">I thank Deputies Declan Breathnach and Fergus O'Dowd for repeatedly raising this issue. I am very much aware of the importance of access to planned respite which ensures that people with disabilities receive opportunities to socialise separately. It facilitates families having a break from caring because it is very difficult. Respite services may vary according to the excess needs of the individuals and their carer. The model of respite is changing and although some require overnight respite, others prefer to benefit from day respite. The number of overnight respite places has been reducing as persons with disabilities seek alternative models such as day respite or extended day care. We will also look at those areas. For example, 42,552 day respite services were provided in 2017. Personally, and throughout my political career, I have always advocated for the rights of people with disabilities. I understand and acknowledge the value and importance of respite care for people with disabilities and their families. I hope this funding will enable people to get a well-deserved break and to maintain their own health and well-being.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> As I said earlier, I will keep a very close eye on how the additional funding is put to work. I will require the HSE to give the utmost priority to putting these new facilities and services in place without delay because it is a very important part of our disability services. We put €1.763 billion into the social care plan in 2017 and we have to ensure it goes to people with disabilities and their families and carers. That is where our priority should be. The 2017 plan deals with 5,720 people with a disability who avail of day-based respite services. We have another 2,500 who avail of respite services, such as holiday respite or occasional respite and we also have other respite services. We have 128 new emergency residential places, which is a priority issue for me.</p>
            <p eId="para_653"> I thank my colleagues for their support. We will fight on and develop the services but above all the services will operate in the interests of the person with the disability.</p>

            <p eId="para_654">I want to address the lack of psychologists in our health service. Often when I or other Deputies highlight service gaps in mental health services provision or the fact that CAMHS staffing levels are barely more than half that recommended in A Vision for Change, the response by the Government is to cite difficulties in recruitment as a key cause of the difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">However, some of these difficulties could well be self-inflicted. I am speaking in particular to the recruitment of psychologists by the HSE. There has been an issue with this for a number of years especially related to whether they were clinical or counselling psychologists. In 2009 the HSE established a working group of psychology managers to review recruitment procedures for psychologists. Criteria were developed that clearly favoured clinical psychologists for employment in the HSE. Counselling psychologists were deemed eligible to work with only one care group despite already working in the areas from which they were suddenly deemed ineligible.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> As a consequence of this, counselling psychologists were excluded entirely from child and adolescent mental health, CAMH, services between 2009 and June 2016. A review process was conducted resulting in some progress being made with regard to the opening up in principle of HSE posts to psychologists other than clinical psychologists. Ultimately it made some helpful and some unhelpful recommendations. The major concern is the stipulation that psychologists who have completed training programmes that do not map neatly to specific criteria around placements were deemed as ineligible for particular care areas in 2016 and 2017 recruitment campaigns and could potentially never be able to work in the HSE after October 2019.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> The effect of the recommendations in the period since the issuing of the report has been that trainee psychologists other than trainee clinical psychologists do not know whether they will be eligible to work in the HSE after they graduate. They may be faced with an effective lifetime ban on working in the HSE if the October 2019 stipulation stands.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> After the issuing of the review report in June 2016, the HSE convened an implementation group to look at the issue emerging from the report but it seems its terms of reference were extremely narrow. The report of that group was, as I understand it, issued in June 2017 but remained with the national director and was not released until 22 November 2017 despite repeated requests from multiple interested stakeholders. Trinity College Dublin has sought and is still seeking a response from the HSE about the problems that are being caused for the current doctorate in counselling psychology programme. IMPACT and the Psychological Society of Ireland have made attempts to engage with the HSE but the executive has still not responded.</p>
            <p eId="para_659"> The exclusionary recruitment practices used by the HSE for psychologists do not exist in other countries, including the United Kingdom. Its practices are also in direct contravention of the recruitment policy of the Psychological Society of Ireland. As long as the HSE continues to make inadequate use of high-quality psychologists because of its demonstrated preference for clinical psychologists only, will we not continue to face what the HSE terms recruitment challenges?</p>

            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. The Minister, Deputy Harris, sends his apologies. I have a particular interest in the area of psychology and I keep a close eye on it in my role as Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> I thank the Acting Chairman for allowing me the opportunity to set out the current criteria and practices for recruiting HSE psychologists. Over the years, there have been ongoing issues with the eligibility criteria for recruitment to HSE psychologist positions. In particular, a change to the eligibility criteria in 2009 made it more difficult for counselling and educational psychologists to obtain employment in the HSE. This change led to the development of eight care groups. Clinical psychologists were eligible for employment in all eight care groups. Counselling and educational psychologists were eligible for employment in one of these care groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> In order to address these issues, a review commenced in 2015 to examine the eligibility criteria and to make recommendations. The purpose for the review was to ensure the availability of a good supply of candidates with the appropriate skills and experience to meet the needs of service users. The 2016 report of the review group made a number of recommendations, which were accepted. It recommended revised eligibility for entry into competitions for psychology posts, both at basic and senior level. The review group also recommended that the number of care group areas be reduced from eight care groups to four.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> It also recommended changes in eligibility. These changes mean that counselling psychologists are now eligible to apply for psychologist positions in all four care group areas. Educational psychologists are eligible for two. The HSE advises that the new care group criteria have been implemented since 1 March 2016 and applied to basic grade and senior psychology competitions held throughout 2016 and 2017. In addition, the review group also looked at the qualification requirements. It has recommended a broadening of these requirements. Instead of named psychology qualifications only, eligibility will be made up of a combination of qualifications and placement or supervised work experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> An implementation group, chaired by an independent chairperson, has been established to map out the practical steps necessary to implement the revised eligibility requirements. On conclusion of its work, I am advised that the implementation group submitted its report and recommendations to the HSE leadership team for consideration. After its consideration, the HSE accepted all the recommendations in full. I understand that the implementation date has been deferred, for operational reasons, until October 2019. This means that the current criteria for placements remain in effect until then.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> I understand that four of the other recommendations made by the implementation group can be implemented without delay. One of these is the formation of a group composed of recruitment managers and principal psychology managers. This group will consider any new definitions to be used in advance of recruitment competitions. It will also deal with unforeseen or difficult decisions that may arise during competitions. This will ensure that fairness and consistency can be protected.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> Another important recommendation approved by the leadership team is the creation of a national psychology placement office. In order to prepare for this, a project team will be established to advance this recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> I am confident that the implementation of the recommendations as outlined will significantly improve the role of the psychology services in supporting vulnerable service users and their families.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_668">The Minister of State mentioned the placement criteria several times. The concern is that the HSE may be trying to compel a large number of existing employees to complete very extensive in-service training in order to maintain eligibility for their own jobs for promotion or transfer. This would severely affect service capacity and the opportunity for service development, as well as the career opportunities available to those employees. It is likely that this will not apply to clinical psychologist employees but only to counselling and educational psychologists. There is no clear rationale for the requirement other than an attempt to implement criteria which have already been shown to lead to multiple problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> IMPACT has notified the HSE of this numerous times but it has failed to account for it. There are no such requirements, for example, for counselling psychologists employed in the NHS in the UK. The bottom line is that although the recent report is positive in tone, the threat of placements not being recognised and thus graduates being ineligible still stands as the new definitions of appropriate placement are potentially as ambiguous as in the past and could be used to exclude some graduates on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, as has occurred in the past. As written, they seem to exclude HSE adult primary care services. We still urgently need somebody in the HSE with authority to pre-approve a placement as eligible and help to secure such a placement. There are enough senior psychologists in the system to cater for it.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> Although there are enough high-quality psychologists who are appropriately qualified, as would be recognised in the UK, HSE placement requirements, in particular undefined and <i>ad hoc</i> requirements, are excluding those highly qualified psychologists. This is the concern that has been raised by Trinity College, the Psychological Society of Ireland and IMPACT. The issue needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> We are constantly being told we have a severe shortage of psychologists, but the bodies that know their stuff maintain that the psychologists are there but the HSE is blocking them for <i>ad hoc</i> reasons.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">I again thank the Deputy for raising this very important matter. I will bring his comments and views back to the Minister, Deputy Harris.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> As of October 2017, there are 954 psychologists employed in the HSE, of whom 925 are clinical psychologists. That is the up-to-date situation. We must not create unnecessary delays in attracting the right health-care professionals to the right positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_674">It is clear that there is a vital role for all psychologists, clinical, counselling and educational, in our health service. That is the reason we must all do what we can to employ those individuals to ensure that our health service is as good as it can be.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> I am confident that the new framework, as recommended by the review and which is fully under way, will be more than fit for purpose. I am pleased that the Health Service Executive, HSE, is putting in place the necessary supports to enable that. For example, the national psychology placement office will ensure that psychology students of all disciplines have equal access to the placements they need to pursue their chosen careers.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> This will go a long way towards protecting our most vulnerable patients by ensuring that services are in place where they are needed the most. On the other issues, I will relay the Deputy's views to the Minister, Deputy Harris.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_678">I want to protest at the outset, and no harm to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, about the fact that the Minister, Deputy Harris, has not come into the House to take this Topical Issue. Members do not get many opportunities to make a case on significant issues of health in their own counties and when they do, they like to ask questions and tease out issues. The Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, however, will only be able to read a script on this issue. That is not good enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> Eighteen thousand patients visited the emergency department in Navan hospital in the past year, with 5,500 of those staying overnight in the medical unit in the hospital. Those figures are increasing. Our hospital is a great hospital and we have great staff in Meath. It has proven to be successful in reducing the length of time patients have to stay in the hospital and it has also been successful in reducing the level of readmissions to our hospital. It is one of the best hospitals in the country for dealing with people who have had heart attacks and strokes. It has also taken on a massive amount of new elective surgery from the Mater Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> The hospital serves the whole of the county of Meath, which has a population that is growing radically. When I was a child, approximately 100,000 people lived in County Meath. There are now 200,000 of us and quarter of a million people will be living in the county within the next 20 years, making it one of the most populous counties in the country by far.</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> Not all the news is good, however. Last September, we saw the near collapse of the accident and emergency department in County Meath due to unofficial industrial action by agency doctors. Navan is more exposed than any other hospital to agency doctors and to this type of strike action because all of the doctors in the accident and emergency department are agency doctors. That means that the HSE does not want to give a full, decent contract to doctors working in the accident and emergency department in Navan because it does not expect there to be an accident and emergency department in Navan for long. Also, I have asked the Minister, Deputy Harris, a number of times by way of parliamentary questions the number of agency doctors and other agency staff working within the health service and I have been told by his Department that it does not know, which is a shocking indictment in terms of the way that service is being currently managed.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> Navan used to have a great record with regard to trolley counts. It used to have one of the lowest trolley counts in the country. From January to the beginning of November this year, more than 2,200 people have been on trolleys in Navan. The numbers on trolleys have quadrupled in the space of one year. Why has that happened? Why is it the case that there are four times more people on trolleys so far this year than in the entirety of last year? What does the Minister of State intend to do about that? If a situation arises where there are delayed diagnoses there will be delayed treatment and if there is delayed treatment, there will be sub-optimum outcomes for patients, which is not good enough. I imagine one of the reasons for that is the fact that on a given day this year there were 20 people in Navan hospital who were clinically discharged, that is, 20 people for whom the doctors could do no more but who had nowhere else to go within the health service. Their pathway to further treatment was blocked. There are two State nursing homes in Meath and both of them have equally as many people waiting to get into them as are residents. It means that many people are in hospital beds in Navan because they have nowhere else to go. That is reducing the opportunity for people to access decent accident and emergency health services in County Meath.</p>

            <p eId="para_684">I first apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Harris. I will deal with this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> I thank Deputy Tóibín for raising this important issue because for many years he has been a strong advocate for developing our health services and putting forward sensible suggestions. I strongly take his views on board. I am grateful to Deputy Tóibín for giving me the opportunity to update the House on accident and emergency services in County Meath. Tackling the challenges in emergency departments generally is a key commitment of the Government and I am delighted that €40 million in additional funding has been made available in 2017 as part of the 2018 budget to address winter pressures and waiting lists. That funding will be aimed at reducing overcrowding in our hospitals in this period through the provision of extra capacity and additional supports.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> Our Lady’s Hospital, Navan provides a general acute hospital service to the catchment area of Meath and currently provides accident and emergency services in County Meath. Since 2013, the hospital has been part of the Ireland East Hospital Group. Every hospital in that group, large or small, has a vital role to play, with the smaller hospitals such as Navan managing routine, urgent or planned care locally, while more complex care is managed in the larger hospitals and with better linkages with primary, continuing and social care. As a smaller hospital, the challenge is to make sure that Navan provides more of the right type of services for the people of Meath, which can be safely be delivered in order that we maximise the benefit to all patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> To ensure that the hospital continues to play a significant role in the Ireland East Hospital Group in providing sustainable, safe and effective care at the appropriate level of complexity, a number of developments already have been funded at Navan hospital in recent years. In addition to the refurbishment of the emergency department, there has been an upgrade of general theatres, an upgrade of the sterile services unit, the addition of new end-of-life care family rooms and a garden within the hospital, as well as an allocation of capital funding of €755,000 for the replacement of various equipment. There has also been an increase in day surgical activity, with surgeons from the Mater Hospital carrying out day surgery in Navan. Further developments regarding surgery and other clinical services at Navan are being considered by Ireland East Hospital Group.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> The HSE has advised that there are no immediate plans to change the current emergency service configuration of services at Navan. The Ireland East Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of redesign work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan hospital as a constituent hospital within the hospital group. The hospital group is continuing to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff and the local and wider community are addressed. Any changes to the emergency department services in Meath would only occur following consultation with key stakeholders, including health professionals at the hospital and other hospitals in the hospital groups, the National Ambulance Service, and community and public representatives.</p>

            <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_689">The Minister talks about creating extra resources within the health service but the small hospital framework document states that Our Lady's Hospital will lose accident and emergency, intensive care and coronary care services, as well as 24-hour anaesthesia. How is that increasing the resources within the hospital? I love this; this is rule by euphemism. We have a situation where redesign effectively means the downgrading of a level 3 hospital to a level 2 hospital. That is at a time when 94,764 people spent time on hospital trolleys last year in this State. Such is the pressure in Navan it is forced to open escalation wards that the Minister of State's Government will not even fund currently.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> The Minister of State might be able to answer this question. I understand that the Minister, Deputy Harris, met the Ireland East Hospital Group very shortly after the budget. That group asked him if they could close the accident and emergency department in Navan. The Minister stated that it could close the accident and emergency department in Navan if it convinced the people of Meath that it was a good idea. I understand the Ireland East Hospital Group is working to try to convince local doctors that it is a good idea but how can it be a good idea? We only have to look at what happened in Cavan and Drogheda hospitals when Monaghan and Dundalk hospitals were closed.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">Both of those hospitals were hammered with some of the highest waiting lists the country has ever seen. The contradiction in all of this is that, in 2015, the then Minister for Health visited Navan to open up the shiny new accident and emergency department. That Minister for Health was our current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar. There has been no change in the ability of Navan hospital to provide decent health care services. If it was good enough for Deputy Varadkar in 2015, should it not be good enough for the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the current Minister of Health, Deputy Harris, that this service remains open and safe into the future?</p>

            <p eId="para_692">I will bring the issues raised back to the Minister and will raise the Deputy's points very effectively. The Government has put additional funding into the emergency services this year. The emergency department at Navan hospital has been refurbished and €750,000 was provided for the replacement of various equipment. There has been an increase in day surgical activity. I am informed that, "The HSE has advised that there are no immediate plans to change the current emergency service configuration of services at Navan". That is what I have been told, but I will bring Deputy Tóibín's concerns back to the Minister and also the specific questions he asked about meetings. I am not aware of the meetings he mentioned.</p>

          <p eId="para_693">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time".</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> There is not a huge crowd here, but I would like to do something irregular. I notice a group of my neighbours from south Kilkenny in the Public Gallery and I acknowledge their presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> The purpose of the Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Bill 2017 is to provide for the number of members of Dáil Éireann and for the revision of constituencies and the number of members to be elected for such constituencies in light of the results of census 2016. It also provides for an amendment of the Electoral Act 1997. In broad terms, the Bill provides for the total number of members of Dáil Éireann to be 160 and for the number of constituencies to be 39 in accordance with the recommendations contained in the Constituency Commission Report 2017. In debating and deciding upon this Bill, the Oireachtas will meet its constitutional obligation to review and revise constituencies with due regard to population changes and distribution around the country. To support the Oireachtas in this task, the Electoral Act 1997 provides for the establishment of an independent Constituency Commission and for that commission to report to the Ceann Comhairle on the conclusion of its work. The most recent commission reported to the Ceann Comhairle on 27 June 2017. Since the report’s publication, the Government has given due consideration to the recommendations of the commission and, in accordance with accepted practice since 1980, has agreed to implement those recommendations in full and without change. The Bill now before the House provides for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> Our Constitution sets out, clearly and distinctly, the overarching requirements that apply to the membership of Dáil Éireann. In addition, and complementary to these constitutional provisions, Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 provides for a constituency review following each census of population and establishes, among other things, the terms of reference of a Constituency Commission. By way of summary, the following constitutional provisions are of particular note. The provisions principally relate to Article 16 of the Constitution. Article 16.2.2o states, "The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population." Article 16.2.3o provides that, “The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the some throughout the country." Article 16.2.4o states that, "The Oireachtas shall revise the constituencies at least once in every twelve years, with due regard to changes in distribution of the population". </p>
          <p eId="para_697"> In effect, these constitutional provisions require that Dáil constituencies be revised whenever population change, as ascertained in a census, leads to population to member ratios in individual constituencies that are significantly out of line with the national average or the limits set in the Constitution of one member to every 20,000 to 30,000 of population. It has been four years since the constituencies were last reviewed, by way of the Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2013, which gave legal effect to the recommendations in the Constituency Commission Report 2012, which was, in turn, completed following census 2011. The results of census 2016 show a 3.8% increase in population since 2011 distributed unevenly across the country but largely on the eastern seaboard. The population is such now that the ratio of members to population, at 30,138, is outside the constitutional limit of 1 to 30,000. While this does not make the composition of the 31st Dáil unconstitutional, since it was formed on the basis of total numbers set with reference to census 2011, there is now an imperative to legislate for revised Dáil constituencies to bring them into line with the requirements of Article 16.2 of the Constitution in good time for the next election, whenever that happens. These constitutional provisions were considered by the courts in two cases in 1961, the High Court case of John O’Donovan <i>v</i>. The Attorney General, and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1961. They were considered again in the High Court case taken by Deputies Finian McGrath and Catherine Murphy in 2007 where it was argued that the constituencies on which the general election was being fought at that time did not comply with the requirements in Article 16 of the Constitution. In his judgment of 2007 in the latter case, Mr. Justice Clarke stated that he was satisfied that there is an "urgent burden" on the Oireachtas to review constituencies following a census. In effect, he concluded that the Oireachtas must act promptly to bring constituencies In line with population once a census reveals significant population change. The progression of the proposed Bill will now allow the Oireachtas to so act on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Part II of the Electoral Act 1997 provides for the review of Dáil and European constituencies by an independent Constituency Commission, upon the publication of the census report setting out the preliminary census results. The terms of reference of the commission are specified in the Act. These provisions are, of course, subordinate to the constitutional requirements set out in Article 16.2. Following publication of the preliminary census results on 14 July 2016, a Constituency Commission was established to begin work on the review of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies and to report with recommendations. This was the fifth commission established under the 1997 Act. It was also the second statutory commission established with authority to commence work upon the publication of preliminary census results. This provision was in response to the High Court case taken by Deputies Finian McGrath and Catherine Murphy in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Final results for census 2016 were published on 6 April 2017, with the Constituency Commission Report 2017 subsequently finalised and presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 27 June 2017. The report was also laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on that date. The Constituency Commission recommended that the number of members of Dáil Éireann should be 160. This figure gives a ratio of one member to every 29,762 of population, which is quite close to the constitutional limit of one to every 30,000. While this is the highest ever ratio in the State, it is within the constitutional limit and, in recommending this figure, the Constituency Commission had regard to the maximum number permitted under section 6(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997. The Commission also recommended that there should be 39 constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">It was recommended that 18 constituencies remain unchanged from the previous review completed in 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> The report of the Central Statistics Office on the final results of census 2016 showed the total population of the State to be 4,761,865, an increase of 173,613 people or 3.8% in the population since April 2011. The majority of that change was on the eastern side of the country. The commission had three months after the publication of those results within which to complete its work and report to the Ceann Comhairle with its recommendations. The report of the Constituency Commission was presented to the Ceann Comhairle on 27 June 2017 and was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the same date. In addition, copies were circulated to Members and the report was published on the website of the Constituency Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> By now I am sure that all Members are familiar with its content and its recommendations, but for the information of Deputies and the record of the House, I will outline the main features of the commission’s report on Dáil and European constituencies. The commission recommends that the number of Members of the Dáil should be 160. This is the maximum number permitted under section 6(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997 and provides for a Member to population ratio of 1:29,762. The commission recommended that there should be 13 five-seat constituencies, up from the current 11; some 17 four-seat constituencies, one more than at present; and nine three-seat constituencies, four fewer than at present. This gives a total of 39 constituencies, one less than at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> The commission recommended that 18 constituencies should remain unchanged. These are, as listed in the commission report, Dublin Bay South, Dublin Fingal, Dublin South-Central, Dublin Mid-West, Dublin South-West, Dublin West, Meath West, Louth, Longford-Westmeath, Donegal, Cork East, Cork North-Central, Cork North-West, Cork South-Central, Cork South-West, Kerry, Waterford and Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> Prior to arriving at its recommendations, the commission reported that it gave consideration to the possibilities of adhering to county boundaries in the drawing up of new constituency boundaries. However, the analysis showed that in many cases breaches to county boundaries would be unavoidable, having regard to the uneven distribution of population and to the constitutional requirement in Article 16.2 that the ratio of population to the number of Members should, as far as practicable, be the same throughout the country. In particular, the constitutional requirements could not be fully met at the two points in the range - 159 and 160 members - available to the commission under its terms of reference by adhering to county boundaries alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> To minimise the number of breaches to county boundaries, the commission did, however, adhere to the views and practice of previous commissions in joining two entire counties into a single constituency in respect of Carlow-Kilkenny, Sligo-Leitrim and Cavan-Monaghan. Nevertheless, new breaches of county boundaries were considered necessary in Laois, Meath, Offaly, Roscommon and Tipperary while some breaches already in place by virtue of existing Dáil constituency boundaries have been retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> Overall, the commission reported that it was satisfied, in the light of the constitutional requirements and its terms of reference, that the recommended constituencies meet the constitutional requirements from the point of view of equality of representation. The commission has recommended changes to constituencies in the following areas. It recommends that Dublin Central become a four-seat constituency, with four electoral divisions comprising a population of 12,394 transferred in from Dublin North-West and one electoral division with a population of 5,064 also being transferred in from Dublin Bay North. Dún Laoghaire is to be revised to include part of the electoral division of Glencullen, which has a population of 1,535, which will be taken from Dublin Rathdown. This would improve the balance between the variances in these two constituencies and would comprise the entire administrative area of the local council.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> The commission recommends that the Cavan-Monaghan constituency be revised to include the 36 electoral divisions of County Cavan, comprising a total population of 13,150, that are currently in the existing Sligo-Leitrim constituency and that seven electoral divisions comprising a population of 3,973 be transferred from Meath East. This ensures that all of County Cavan will be included in the new Cavan-Monaghan constituency which will become a five-seat constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> Sligo-Leitrim is to have 18 electoral divisions, representing a total population of 7,806 transferred in from the north of County Roscommon, around Boyle and west of Carrick-on-Shannon, from the Roscommon-Galway constituency. Roscommon-Galway is to receive the transfer of a population of 8,650 from Galway East while Galway East itself is to be revised to include an additional population of 4,547 from Galway West. It is recommended that the Mayo constituency receive the transfer of the population of 4,893 from that part of County Mayo located in the existing Galway West constituency. This reduces the size of the county boundary breach in Mayo.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> The Clare constituency is to be revised to include the electoral division of Ballyglass, which has a population of 5,994 and which is currently in the Limerick City constituency. This will restore the county boundary in Clare. The Tipperary constituency is to receive the transfer of 10,847 population from that part of Tipperary that is currently in the existing Offaly constituency. This will restore the county boundary in that part of Tipperary. However, a transfer of a population of 4,375 from three electoral divisions in Tipperary to Limerick City is recommended to avoid a high variance in the population to Member ratio in the Tipperary constituency. This will create a new county boundary breach in that area - around Newport as I understand it. It is recommended that the Limerick constituency receive the transfer of a population of 2,008 from Limerick City to address the high variance in the Limerick constituency area and to better balance the ratios between the two constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> It is recommended that Laois and Offaly become a single five-seat constituency similar to the arrangements which were in place from 1923 to 2013. However, to avoid a high variance, a population of 11,854 will need to move to the Kildare South constituency. Kildare South is to become a four-seat constituency with the transfer of a population of 7,892 from that part of Kildare that is currently in the existing Laois constituency and a further 3,226 from the constituency of Kildare North. These transfers will ensure that there is no longer a breach to the Kildare county boundary.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> It is recommended that Carlow-Kilkenny receive the transfer of the eight electoral divisions in Carlow, comprising a total population of 4,501, that are currently located in the existing Wicklow constituency, and which have been for the past 20 years. This will eliminate the breach of the Carlow county boundary and ensure that all of that county is now in the same constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> The commission was also required to report on the constituencies for the election of Members to the European Parliament. In its report the commission recommended maintaining the existing arrangement of constituencies for the election of Ireland’s 11 Members of the European Parliament and, therefore, I will not be bringing forward any amendments to the Third Schedule to the European Parliament Elections Act 1997 in which the constituencies for European Parliament elections and the number of Members to be elected for each constituency are specified. Should the number of members to be elected from Ireland change before the next elections to the European Parliament in June 2019, section 5(1A) of the Electoral Act 1997 provides that a committee can be established to make a report in respect of the European Parliament constituencies. This was done in 2013.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> I will now outline the provisions of the Bill before us. It generally mirrors previous Bills providing for the revision of Dáil constituencies following a census of population. Section 1 provides for the definition of Minister and for particular references in the Schedule to the Bill. It is in the Schedule that the geography of each constituency is described or specified. Section 2 provides that once the Act is passed, there will be 160 Members in the next Dáil following its passage, that is to say, the Dáil elected after the dissolution of the current Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> Section 3 provides for those 160 Members to represent the constituencies specified in the Schedule. There will be 39 constituencies of which 13 will have five seats, 17 will have four seats and nine will have three seats. Section 4 provides that each constituency shall return the number of Members specified in relation to it in the Schedule. Section 5 provides for the amendment of section 6(2)(a) of the Electoral Act 1997 to provide for the total number of Members of the Dáil to be no less than 166 and no more than 172 following the next review of Dáil constituencies. That would be due after census 2021. The maximum number that the Constituency Commission could recommend is 160 and that is what is provided for in the Bill. Having regard to projected increases in the population, it is likely that the limit of 160 Members provided for in the Electoral Act 1997 would not provide for the total number of Members to be within the constitutional limits at the next constituency review following census 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Section 6 provides for the 2013 Act to be repealed on the dissolution of Dáil Éireann that next occurs after the passing of this Act. This effectively means that the existing constituencies continue in force until the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">For example, the constituencies in the 2013 Act will be in force for the referendums and presidential election to be held in 2018 and for any Dáil by-elections held, unless there is a general election in the interim. Section 7 is a standard provision for the short title and collective citation.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> The Bill continues the long-established practice of implementing the recommendations of independent constituency commissions in full and without amendment, which has been an important factor in supporting the independence of the review process. It is a matter for the Oireachtas to revise the constituencies and I look forward to the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">The Bill affects the constituency of Roscommon-Galway, which I am very privileged to represent. It also affects the constituencies of my colleagues, Deputies MacSharry and Rabbitte, with whom I am sharing time. I welcome the Bill but am unhappy with its implications for my constituency. As the Minister of State probably knows, north Roscommon is a very strong base for me. I feel sorry for the people of Keadue, Ballyfarnon and many other areas in that locality. I have no doubt that the two Fianna Fáil representatives for Sligo-Leitrim, Deputies MacSharry and Scanlon, will be delighted for that part of north Roscommon to be made part of their constituency and they will work for it. However, 7,800 voters have been left in no-man's land. I say that with no disrespect to the excellent representatives for Sligo-Leitrim. However, here we go again. That the Sligo-Leitrim constituency comprised Sligo, Leitrim and parts of Donegal and Cavan was absolutely ridiculous. The commission recognised that having that part of Cavan in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency was neither feasible nor good. However, it has taken a chunk from Roscommon and put it into Sligo-Leitrim and has given back Cavan. We have to get away from treating counties in this manner. It is not acceptable and, in the long term, Members will have to ensure that it is changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> With no disrespect to the people who will be representing the area, north Roscommon has been gutted from top to bottom by the fish knife of the commission. It has been left in no man's land. It needs strong representation, which I have no doubt it will receive, but it is utterly unfair to do that to any community. Such changes have occurred throughout the country on many occasions. The population of County Roscommon is 64,000 but that of the Roscommon-Galway constituency is approximately 84,000 or 85,000, which is a little short of what is stipulated in the legislation. The House must devise a system to ensure that no county is treated in such a manner. It has been done too many times and I am not happy with what has been done in respect of north Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> There are great people coming to my constituency from the Galway East constituency, which is good Fianna Fáil country, and I welcome them. However, I am saddened for the people of north Roscommon, many of whom feel they have been left in no man's land and have had no respect shown to them. I have no doubt that in the future we will seek for Roscommon to become a one-county constituency once again.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">I thank the Minister for his contribution. I take on board that he said to the effect that the long-established practice is for the Bill to be welcomed and accepted without amendment. That is not my style but I will not go against it. We will be supporting the Bill but it would be remiss of me not to speak on it. In a similar manner to Deputy Eugene Murphy or any of my colleagues who may speak on the Bill, I believe it lacks imagination. I made a submission on the Bill because I wanted to offer a little guidance on how not to butcher a county, which is what is being done to Galway. I represent Galway East and, under the Bill, will lose over 8,500 very good voters who substantially contributed to my being elected as a first-time Deputy. I am eternally grateful to them. With the help of God, Deputy Eugene Murphy will benefit from my hard work for them over the past 18 months, as I hope I will benefit from the work done by Deputy Ó Cuív for the 4,500 voters who are being transferred from Galway West.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> On a serious note, I completely agree with what Deputy Eugene Murphy said regarding how the system should be amended such that counties can be kept intact. If I were to have sent out the Galway hurling team in the same manner as the electoral team is being sent out here, it would not have won the All-Ireland this year because it would have been representing counties Roscommon, Galway and Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_725">It does not work at a local level. People feel somewhat disenfranchised as a result of what is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> As regards council boundaries, people will have different Deputies and councillors. There is much confusion in terms of who to support or who is one's representative. Although all Deputies will represent their constituents as best they can, county boundaries are important. Some 18 constituencies are untouched but Galway East has once again been badly affected. We supported and propped up Roscommon in 2011 and we are now giving it more of our good people and propping it up further. I do not understand why Galway East is to lose over 8,500 voters, as is Roscommon-Galway to Sligo-Leitrim, while 4,500 voters are to be transferred to Galway East from Galway West. That appears to be gerrymandering for the sake of it. There must be an easier way to redraw constituencies. I suggested that if the commission did not want to leave the constituencies of Mayo and Galway East as they were, then perhaps four seats should have been allocated to each. That may not have been the most popular measure but it would have kept the county intact, which is very important. County councillors also have concerns as to what will happen to council boundaries because they need to know how their bases will be affected and whether there will be a predominance of city voters or otherwise in their areas. From a rural perspective, a fair balance is needed. Fianna Fáil will be supporting the Bill and I will also reluctantly do so.</p>

        <speech by="#MarcMacSharry" eId="spk_306">

          <p eId="para_727">This is a shambles, as is the case every time a Bill of this nature is published. We are bound by Article 16 of the Constitution and the practice, which is a horrible word often used in the House, is that all Members will say that the Bill is great and accept it and on we go. Will the Minister of State, who I have known for a long time, be the pioneering Minister who facilitates a public consultation in the year ahead on how Article 16 could and should be amended to take cognisance of how the population of Ireland is currently constituted? There is no question that when the Constitution was written in 1937, the population of the country and the migratory patterns that have happened since could not have been envisaged. On foot of that and the failure to amend Article 16, the practice currently applied by the electoral commission, which does the best job it can in very difficult circumstances, is probably as good as it can be. However, the practice has become for the commission to look at where the population is, ensure a minimum of one Deputy per 30,000 people and then try to stuff together whatever voters are left over. It could happen in the Minister of State's constituency. Piltown and Fiddown could be put in with another part of Waterford or Carrick-on-Suir in south Tipperary. That is the kind of thing that could happen. We now have hybrid constituencies such as my own, which is more akin to a constituency for the 1984 European Parliament election than a modern Dáil constituency. People are being disenfranchised. That is not to say that any Deputy would not be exceptionally proud to represent all people, regardless of whether they live in Boyle, Sligo, Donegal or anywhere else.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The fact is that Article 16 of the Constitution is not fit for purpose. We need a constitutional referendum. I am not saying I have the solution, but we need to find a different way. In 30 years' time, no matter who is sitting in these seats, we will have 120 Deputies representing the greater Dublin conurbation from Wexford to Dundalk and a sprinkling of 40 or 45 Deputies representing the rest of the country, which is not on, and at some stage some Minister will suggest considering the matter. I, therefore, ask the Minister of State for a public consultation on this. It would not cost very much. Let us see what innovative, creative ideas are out there that could take cognisance of the fact that we need representation of all parts of Ireland. We can then have a constitutional referendum on Article 16 and make the necessary improvements.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> Regarding the naming of constituencies, and I know there are some proposed amendments in this regard, but to add insult to injury, what are the people of south Donegal or south Roscommon to think when their constituency is called Sligo-Leitrim? The people of west Cavan were rightly indignant that they were moved into that constituency. It was joked around these Houses that some Deputies and Senators from that part of the country would erect signs stating "Welcome to Sligo-Leitrim" in Virginia. Such decisions are an insult to people. If there must be long constituency names in this flawed process, call the constituency South Donegal, Sligo-Leitrim and North Roscommon, because that is what it is. Give people the dignity of acknowledging the place where they live.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to make a few points. I genuinely believe that if we want to prepare a proper vision for the generations that will come to these Houses in the future, we need to reform and have a constitutional referendum on Article 16.</p>

          <p eId="para_731">I welcome this report. I did not welcome the previous one and I was vociferous in my objections to it. I was probably one of the few Deputies to have a right go at the Minister of State, Deputy Phelan's, former colleague, Commissioner Hogan, on Second Stage of the Bill before the House at that time. It was absolutely ludicrous, as my colleague, Deputy MacSharry, said, that parts of west and south Cavan were moved into constituencies with Sligo, Leitrim and south Donegal. If I had to opt to stay in that constituency, rather than in the reduced Cavan-Monaghan constituency, and if I was going to that part of south Donegal that was put in with Cavan, I would travel into and out of Northern Ireland twice, back into the Republic, to get to Donegal. That shows how ludicrous it was, and it was a little like the tourism signs that say,"Welcome to Ireland's Ancient East", which are in Waterford as well as west Cavan.</p>

          <p eId="para_733">We in this House should be cognisant of the fact that the people on this commission have never got a vote in their lives. I honestly believe that former practising politicians should sit on the commission. There is no point in saying nowadays that east Cavan or west Cavan is a great Fianna Fáil area, a great Fine Gael area or a great Sinn Féin area. That is gone now because we know from the results of recent elections that things have changed dramatically. A good case could be made for very distinguished former Members of this House from the main parties as well as Independents serving on the commission. If there had been a former practising politician on the commission in 2012, he or she would never have signed off on the configuration of south Donegal, all of Sligo-Leitrim and west and south Cavan. My colleagues, Deputies Eugene Murphy, Rabbitte and MacSharry made the point in the part of the debate that I have heard that it is a total injustice to so many communities. I am very happy that all of Cavan is back with all of County Monaghan. We have seven electoral divisions coming in from the Meath East constituency, and the people living in those electoral divisions are quite rightly very unhappy. We fully understand that and while the commission had to consider things in general, it did not need to move the people in east Meath into Cavan. I think there was a wrong reading of the tolerance level.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> I made a detailed submission to the commission at the time. This time last year, I was preparing it and, unfortunately, one of my best friends in politics, Brendan Reilly from Ballyjamesduff, who did much of the drafting of my submission, specifically the work on the figures and so on, was killed two weeks ago in a car accident. He was a great and very close friend of mine, and I wish to record the contribution he made to the submission that I submitted to the commission at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> Article 16.2.2° of the Constitution sets out that "the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population." Of Article 16.2.2°, the submission states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_736"> This gives the Commission some scope to give adequate and due tolerance to recognise the particular pressures on rural constituencies vis-à-vis representation and adherence to the population per Dáil Member. The present Cavan/Monaghan constituency [as it is at present] is a totally rural region, yet it is 3.18% above the average ratio. [The constituencies that were meant to be above the average ratio were the urban constituencies, not the very rural constituencies.] This is leaving an area with very specific social and economic problems both underrepresented and badly divided.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_737"> The 5% deviation from the national average is only implied and is by no means set in stone.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_738"> Greater latitude in deviating from the national average, as established by previous Commissions prior to the 2012 Commission, would give the necessary flexibility to reverse the extreme impact of the 2012 revision where [unexpectedly] four counties ended up in the one constituency[, the first time ever in the history of the State this has happened]. From the Commission's own Statement on Relevant Provisions - while the reference to Justice Clarke's judgement leans towards a deviation from the national average lower than 5%, - it is important to note that the Supreme Court clearly studiously avoids setting any such limit and ruled as quoted in the Commission's statement:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_739">The problem of what is practicable is primarily one for the Oireachtas, whose members have knowledge of the problems and difficulties to be solved which this Court cannot have. Its decision could not be reviewed by this Court unless there is a manifest infringement of the Article. This Court cannot, as is suggested, lay down a figure above or below which a variation from what is called the national average is not permitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Commissions in the past allowed a deviation of approximately 5%. It is provided for in the Constitution. I urge the Minister of State to change this, as my colleague, Deputy MacSharry said, in order that we do not disenfranchise large parts of rural communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">I will not argue about what the commission has done in this case. I accept that we have an independent commission, although I do not particularly like it. My constituents in north Meath and east Meath do not particularly like it. The Meath East constituency has been carved out on two occasions at this stage, and people feel disenfranchised and put into areas within which they do not naturally fall. This is particularly the case in east Meath. They feel very left out, and now the people of Drumcondra, Meath Hill, Posseckstown, Carrickleck, Teevurcher and Cormeen will feel left out in Cavan-Monaghan. I have no doubt about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I wish to take this opportunity to thank sincerely the people, the entire constituency, who have voted for me in previous elections, particularly in this area. I have developed a very special relationship with the people in north County Meath as a Teachta Dála. They have been very good to me, and I hope I have been good to them and served them in the way in which they want me to do so. Obviously, I continue to be one of the Deputies for that entire constituency until the next election. This boundary commission does not change our current representation or our current representative function. My constituents are very good, decent, hard-working people and have always been my friend, and I hope I have been their friend. I am still their Teachta Dála, and boundary changes will not change that. We must change the way we do these things. It is not fair to lump, people into different constituencies simply for the sake of maths. Yes, it is one person, one vote, but we also need people to have some connection with their representatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">I recognise the trust that the people in different areas have put in us as politicians. It was 65 miles from where I live to the Cavan area which I try to represent. I thank those people for the support they gave me, considering that I was in a very marginal seat and that there were 18 candidates on the ticket. I saw 13th, 14th and 15th preferences coming in as effective No. 1 votes. Without those people, I would not be here today, and I thank them for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I agree with previous speakers. When one considers Cavan, south Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, we are talking about two provinces, never mind different counties, which is totally ridiculous and quite unfair, and it is very wrong that county boundaries are broken.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">It has been the case for the past 30 or 40 years, or as long as I can remember in politics, that Sligo and Leitrim were combined into one constituency. That is acceptable because we are similar types of people living in adjoining counties. However, it is very wrong when portions of other counties are brought in or where a county is split. If Sligo-Leitrim must be a three-seat constituency, so be it. Let the best man fight the election and win. On this occasion, however, north Roscommon is to be brought into the constituency. I will do whatever I can to help those constituents. In fairness to colleagues on all sides, all Members in this House do the best they can for the people they represent. I will do my absolute best to help and support the people of north Roscommon. However, when boundaries are being drawn up in future, I hope county boundaries will be respected.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eoin Ó Broin<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T19:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_750">There is something a little incongruous about our debating and voting on this legislation in so far as none of us, as elected politicians, can claim complete objectivity when it comes to the redrawing of constituencies. That is not to take away from the legitimacy of the points raised by colleagues. We absolutely have a right to debate the legislation underpinning the establishment of electoral commissions and we certainly should scrutinise their reports to determine whether they adhere to the terms of reference. However, we must be careful about getting into discussions as to whether we agree with and accept the commission's recommendations, because those recommendations may have a direct bearing on how easy or difficult it is for us to get elected on the next occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> There is a very difficult balance for any commission to achieve in terms of getting the ratios right, respecting existing county, local authority and community boundaries and getting the urban-rural balance correct. I do not envy the commission members in tackling any of those matters. If the issues Deputies have raised had not been addressed in they way they were, there would be another group of Deputies complaining about the alternative solution. This is not easy work and I acknowledge the efforts of the commission in preparing the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> While my constituency is not affected on this occasion, a previous local government boundary review brought about some changes on its periphery. While they had no negative impact on my election bid, having spoken to people living in rural Brittas and Saggart, on the divide between the local electoral area, LEA, and the general election boundary, many felt that their local councillors were not necessarily serving them because they were in a neighbouring general election constituency and their Deputies were not necessarily serving them because they are in a neighbouring LEA. These are genuine concerns and I am not arguing that we should be discounted from raising them.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> While it is not pertinent to the legislation before us, I would be open to a consultation on or review of the constitutional limit. However, any such exercise would have to be based on the need to achieve a better balance between the different components of the process, not making it easier for sitting politicians to secure their re-election. I do not in any way suggest that Members who referred to the constitutional limit did so for anything other than genuine purposes. However, for the public to have faith in such a process, we must make that very clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> Sinn Féin is joining other groups in supporting the Bill. It would be wrong for the Oireachtas to set about amending the commission's recommendations. As I said, if Members wish to change the process for determining boundaries, whether in respect of the constitutional limit or the way the terms of reference are set for the commission membership, that is a legitimate matter for us to debate. Today, however, we have a set of recommendations from an independent commission and the right thing to do, notwithstanding the individual difficulties for some of us arising out of those recommendations, is to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> Constituencies with a larger number of seats are more representative because they afford a greater representation of the political views of constituents. While larger parties often prefer constituencies to have a smaller number of seats and Independents and smaller parties usually prefer a larger number, the more important consideration is that having a larger number usually gives a better reflection of the diversity of opinion within the constituency. In future, therefore, we should look to having more constituencies with a larger number of seats, purely for the representational and proportionate balance they offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> There is strong merit in having a standing independent electoral office similar to that which operates in the North so that we do not have to establish <i>ad hoc</i> commissions after every census. There are obvious benefits in having a proper, professional body whose job is not only to maintain a rolling review of constituencies, boundaries and seat numbers but also to deal with issues of electoral registration, centralisation and scrutiny of the register and so on. A body like that would develop experience over time and might include former politicians or former Oireachtas staff among its membership. I urge the Government to look at this issue in a more rounded way in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> To reiterate, I respect the views expressed by Members this evening. However, having set up an independent commission, agreed its terms of reference and let it do its job, we should not necessarily engage in criticism of its decisions, although some of them are difficult for voters and communities in our constituencies or for individual Deputies. We should acknowledge the commission's achievement in doing the job we tasked it do and we should support the report it has produced. For the future, rather than waiting for the next report, we should set about, possibly on an appropriate cross-party basis, finding a way of ensuring the process for setting electoral boundaries is improved in order that we no longer encounter the difficulties colleagues have articulated today.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">The constituency I represent will be changed again as a consequence of the commission's report. I support the proposal by my colleague, Deputy Ó Broin, that we should consider establishing a permanent electoral commission or office to deal with matters concerning the organisation of elections and the changes in constituency boundaries.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> Colleagues will have noticed that a map drawn up by Ordnance Survey Ireland was included along with copies of the commission's report. I was puzzled when I noticed that right beside Donegal on the map is the word "London" followed by the word "Derry". I understood that London is a city of some 10 million people on an offshore island. In fact, I was there earlier this year at a relative's wedding. I was concerned at how that city had somehow made its way across the Irish Sea and landed up somewhere beside Lough Foyle. I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of staff in Ordnance Survey Ireland that the proper name of the city denoted, the last time I was in it, is Derry or, as Gaeilge, Doire Cholmcille. It is additionally troubling that the map includes the strap line: "Ordnance Survey Ireland map, Government of Ireland 2017".</p>

          <p eId="para_761">The people of Derry sought to change the name of their city a long time ago. Will the Minister of State and his officials to bring this error to the attention of Ordnance Survey Ireland and to advise that we should no longer slavishly use that type of colonial language?</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> The commission's report is advisory, it being thereafter a matter for the Oireachtas to settle these matters, in accordance with the commission's terms of reference. Section 6(2)(<i>f</i>) of the Electoral Act 1997 states "Subject to the provisions of this section, the Commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangements of constituencies". In the case of Laois, Offaly and Kildare South, however, that is not the case. Laois-Offaly was the same constituency from 1923 to 2016, with Laurence Brady being the last Sinn Féin Deputy to be elected before I took my seat in February 2011. I thank the people of Laois-Offaly for electing me to what was then a five-seat constituency. In 2012, we received a report like the one we are discussing today indicating that the boundaries would be changed to create a three-seat constituency of Laois, which, in order to have an adequate population, would include a chunk of Kildare South, comprising Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan. The view at the time was that I was unlikely to be returned at the next election, but the good people of Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan gave me a good vote, having worked hard for them in the previous two years. I will continue to represent them until the end of the Thirty-second Dáil. In fact, I have a small office in Monasterevin and although the people there will not be able to vote for me again, I have a duty to continue to represent them.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> It is fair enough that Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan are to be returned to Kildare South.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">There is, however, also a large chunk coming out of Laois and a small bite coming out of Offaly. Some 9,450 people from Laois and 2,404 people from Offaly will go in to make up the new Kildare South constituency, which will be a four seater. That was a three seater. There will be pieces of three counties going to make up one constituency in the bottom half of Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> I understand that sometimes a county boundary has to be broken. We argued this with the Minister of State's predecessor, the former Minister, Phil Hogan. In fact, if I remember correctly, we had arguments about a good few things. Sometimes we agreed on some issues, especially on the boundary of Graiguecullen, an issue that went on for years. Deputy Pat Deering will be familiar with it. Phil Hogan was the one man who did make the change, which I had raised with him in the Dáil, to align the county council boundary in Graiguecullen with the general election boundary, with the GAA boundary and with the county boundary. It is one of the good things the then Minister achieved in that Dáil and I give him credit for it. It was the sensible thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> Moving on to where we are now, as things stand and without the changes, the report states: "While Laois and Kildare constituencies have acceptable variations, it is necessary to alter these to address the high variances in the Offaly constituency." In the last census, Offaly had a population of 77,961 and County Laois had a population of 84,697, and it is growing by the day. Laois is a fast-growing county. The national average of population per Deputy is 29,762. There were better options and there is a problem because not only is the proposal breaking into two counties, but it is also breaching a small area, Gracefield, with a small chunk coming out of east Offaly and into Kildare South. A very large chunk is also being taken out of Laois, with all of Portarlington, Killenard, Ballybrittas and Jamestown going in with Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Turning to what could have happened, a small piece could have been taken out of Tipperary. According to the report, the Laois and Kildare numbers were fine but the problem was with Offaly, which needed some more population. That part of north Tipperary with which people were connected since the last boundary change could have been left with Offaly. A piece of Westmeath or County Meath could also have come into the north of Offaly, as could the piece of east Kildare where the boundary was already moved. Any of those options could have given Offaly sufficient population to retain three seats and would have meant breaching only one county boundary, not two.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> As Deputy Ó Broin said, I understand that the commission does not have an easy job. Every action it takes has a knock-on consequence. We know that most actions have knock-on consequences as when we move one piece of a jigsaw. I can see that, but I have looked at it and there were a number of other options. I am trying to be impartial here, but, being a Deputy, it is hard. One can imagine what it is like to be elected to Laois-Offaly, when one feels one is doing grand, getting to know the people of Offaly and doing the clinics. The next thing one discovers they are gone and one has to keep representing them. I kept representing those people right up to the finish of the Thirty-first Dáil in February 2016. Having had a greater base in Kildare South, I now find myself losing the Kildare South constituency, although I will continue to represent the people there. I now have to go back to Laois-Offaly again.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The consequence of this boundary change is three different constituencies in five years and two county boundaries having changed. I have another consequence for the Minister of State - Kildare has an absolute guarantee of eight Deputies after the next election. It will be four and four, but what is Laois guaranteed? Kildare has a population of some 220,000 but Laois will have a population of almost 90,000 by the next election. Laois is growing faster than Kildare for a number of reasons, which I will not go into here, according to the last two censuses. Laois could possibly wind up with only two Deputies after the next election, with a population of 90,000, whereas neighbouring Kildare, with a population of 220,000, will wind up with an absolute guarantee of eight Deputies. The Deputies who are elected to Kildare South, such as Deputy Fiona MacLoughlin if she is lucky to be elected-----</p>

          <p eId="para_771">She is going to have to deal with three county councils - Kildare County Council; Laois County Council and Offaly County Council. She will need to attend three Oireachtas Members' meetings between the local authority managers and directors of services. She will have to deal with three different administrative staff and three different electoral areas. God help her because that is going to be hard to do. The boundary change is taking pieces of three counties to make one constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> My last point concerns voter turnout. In the last election, voter turnout in Laois was just over 39,000 of a 62,000 population. That was a 60% to 61% turnout. It was slightly higher, at 62%, in Offaly. That is small and it is not good for democracy in any man's book, or any woman's book either. We need to try to increase the turnout in elections. The public in Portarlington, Killenard and Ballybrittas in north Laois are now told they are Lillywhites and that somehow they belong to Kildare, and they are not too happy about it. Many of them are very annoyed and say that they will not vote because they are being tied in with Kildare against their will. Obviously, I would encourage people to vote, even if they cannot vote for me, as they should always use their votes.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> Their county councils, however, will continue to be Laois in the case of that part of north Laois, and the Gracefield end of Portarlington will continue to under Offaly County Council. The natural hinterland of Portlaoise is Portarlington, Killenard, Ballybrittas and Jamestown, which is eight or nine miles away. The natural hinterland is not Naas, which is within a few minutes of Dublin. Laois in particular has been chopped away as if with a blunt axe. The commission should have paid more attention to breaching county boundaries. I understand that one might need to be breached, but the problem is that two county boundaries have been breached. Whoever represents the people within those areas is going to have to deal with three county councils.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> There were other options, which I believe were better options. I do not want to complain too much about it but a better fit could have been achieved, especially for the people of north Laois. Laois could have been left intact. It could have enough population by the day of the next election for three seats, if we were able to sit tight for the rest of this year. If we get through most of 2018, the population of Laois will be more than adequate. Currently, it is constitutionally more than adequate to provide for three Deputies. There was no need for a boundary change on a constitutional basis and it is a pity.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> Some of the other changes have been good. As I said earlier, we need to set up a standing electoral commission or an electoral office to ensure there is an ongoing independent body in place that can develop the expertise and take submissions from people. That is my view of it. I am not saying this for my own sake - I also said this in the last Dáil, when there was no breach of two county boundaries that affected me. It is, however, a bad day's work when three parts of three counties are needed to make up an electoral district. It is a bad day's work that Laois may only have two Deputies but County Kildare is guaranteed eight.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> I thank the people of Laois-Offaly who, in 2011, elected me to represent them. I also thank the people of south Kildare, especially in the Monasterevin, Kilberry and Kildangan area, for electing me the last time out to the three-seater constituency of Laois-Kildare South.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">Like other Deputies, the Labour Party will not be opposing the recommendations, as is the tradition. We will support the recommendations of the independent commission. I also support the idea of having a standing commission, as suggested by Deputies Ó Broin and Stanley. It would make a lot of sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Having listened to Deputy Stanley and the Fianna Fáil Deputies, one must ask where does one start. As the man said when he was asked for directions, "I would not start from here if I were you". When one starts somewhere, however, it ends up having a knock-on effect on the neighbouring constituencies. That is just the way it works. We all understand the difficulty of interpreting the Constitution and the work done by the commission. We should commend the commission on the work it has done. We must deal with the consequences that arise for the various constituencies around the State. The relevant part of the Constitution is Article 16.2 which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_779">16.2 (2) The number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_780">16.2 (3) The ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency, as ascertained at the last preceding census, shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> It is about fair representation and ensuring, in so far as possible, that the county boundaries are not breached, although they have been in several cases. </p>
          <p eId="para_782"> Deputy MacSharry made the point that if we continue on like this and do not change the Constitution, we will end up with more than 100 Deputies for Dublin. A national planning framework is currently in consultation. It behoves us to ensure that Deputy MacSharry's scenario does not happen and we can achieve that by ensuring that we have a proper regional balance and that we rebalance the country, which is over-dependent on the east coast in respect of population, jobs and many other things. We have to build up the rest of the country and that includes ensuring that other cities and large centres of population grow in size. The current draft national planning framework does not go far enough to achieve that. I have put in a submission on my city of Limerick, as well as a submission on behalf of the Labour Party at a national level, urging that we get real action to ensure we get such population balance. There are many consequences of failing to do so, one being that we would have a large number of Deputies around the Dublin area and much fewer in the rest of the country. I do not want to see that appalling vista. The national framework strategy has a significant role to play in ensuring that the country is properly represented and it is very much linked to what we are debating this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> On the constitutional requirements, I wish to briefly defend my colleague, Joe Costello. When there was a threat of an election - it seems like a while ago but it is only recently - he went to the High Court on the basis of his belief that if the election went ahead before Christmas, prior to this legislation being passed, it would have breached the constitutional requirements. Based on the two sections which I read out, I believe he was correct, although I would not second guess the courts. Mr. Costello's senior counsel noted:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_784">arising from the 2016 census and the 2017 Constituency Commission report, the next Dáil must have more members than the current Dáil to stay within the rules as set by Article 16.2.2... The next Dáil must have at least 159 members to comply with article 16.2.2 and the commission has recommended that the next Dáil have 160 ... If an election is held it would return 158 TDs which would breach article 16.2.2 which creates a mandatory obligation not to breach the limits ... An election would mean three TDs being returned for Mr. Costello's Dublin Central Constituency, when that should be four. The kind of issue which was raised in the case has never previously arisen ... Unless the legislation was introduced urgently the next Dáil could have its constitution and authority questioned ... The situation required to be immediately addressed but while there was a Bill in draft stage to act on the commission's recommendations, that had not been put before Cabinet. </p>

In none of those amendments do we question the commission's decisions regarding boundaries and representation but we are questioning the names of the constituencies. Deputy Thomas Byrne referred to how the Louth constituency takes in a significant portion of east Meath but does not name it. There are smaller parts of other constituencies that have also been brought in and not named, but in that area there was concern among the people in the coastal area of Meath that they were not part of the constituency name. We are not questioning the substance of what the commission is recommending but I would like to know who decides the names. </p>

          <p eId="para_791">Names were changed in the Dublin area and there was the case I just mentioned in Louth. I presume it is the commission itself but on what basis? Is it arbitrary? Why does it decide to change names or have particular names for particular constituencies? It is something on which public representatives possibly should have some role because we know our constituencies and people do get upset when their constituency name changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> My next remarks are somewhat similar to those raised by others. My constituency is losing a part of Clare which we had, gaining a piece of Tipperary and we are giving back to County Limerick part of east Limerick which we have had and it had before us. It is a case of "I stepped out and I stepped in again". I particularly feel for people in those types of constituencies who might have moved three or four times in the last 20 years, or a relatively short time. The Cappamore area and its neighbouring parishes in County Limerick is the area particularly affected in my constituency. I have represented them in the past, then not represented them, then represented them and then not represented them, and I have not been in this House for an especially long time. It is particularly difficult for people in those areas whose constituency keeps moving because they are they easiest to move when numbers change.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I also support the idea of there being fewer three-seat constituencies. It is better to have a broader type of representation in order that most people can see somebody in the Oireachtas who represents their point of view. It is right that we have larger constituencies with more individuals representing them. </p>
          <p eId="para_794"> Like others, I was very pleased to represent a piece of County Clare. Part of it is in the parish where I live; it is literally the other side of the bridge over the River Shannon from my home, and I will continue to represent those people until there is an election. I know many of them very well. I will continue to hold my constituency clinic in the area. There are areas such as Shannon Banks, Westbury, Parteen and part of Ardnacrusha, which are very close to Limerick city. I appreciate that Clare has got itself back together as a county and I can understand why this is happening. </p>
          <p eId="para_795"> Deputy Stanley just referred to the northern part of Tipperary coming back into Tipperary but the piece nearest to us is coming into Limerick which would be the Newport-Birdhill area. I would be happy to represent the people in that area and give a continuity of service that had previously been given by Labour Deputies, the most recent one being Deputy Kelly. There is some dissatisfaction that people who have always been represented in a Tipperary constituency are now coming into the Limerick city constituency but we will do our best to represent them. </p>
          <p eId="para_796"> Ideally we would like to see county boundaries unbreached but we are bound by the Constitution, as is the commission. We have to accept that it has to do its best in drawing boundaries. I am more concerned for the people in those areas than their public representatives. We will get on with doing our job as best we can, but there is confusion for people living in areas who find themselves moved from one constituency to another. To return to the national planning framework, what we would like to see is that there would be an effort to stabilise populations and not have migration from the more rural, western parts of the country to the east coast. During discussions on the national planning framework, it emerged that Maynooth is the centre of Ireland by population, because there are roughly as many people living east of Maynooth as there are to its west, although in geographical terms it is nowhere near the centre of Ireland. It is an indication that we need to see national planning work towards a more balanced country which would be better for everyone. We will not oppose this.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Bill 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">This Bill will provide for the implementation of the Constituency Commission Report 2017, the recommendations of which include increasing the number of Deputies from 158 to 160 and reducing the number of constituencies to 39. I am in sympathy with previous speakers who referred to parts of constituencies moving back and forth. In most of my time in this House, my constituency has moved north and south, though it cannot move east because of the sea. Since the 1980s, we have not had an election in which the constituency remained the same. I am also sympathetic to the people in the areas affected. In my case, the Raheny and Edenmore parishes have gone back and forth between constituencies, though they had an advantage in that there would have been up to eight Deputies in the historical Dublin North-East and Dublin North-West constituencies, which were joined together to form Dublin Bay North. The Deputies in question would have represented parts of the two parishes to which I refer. At the prospect of a pre-Christmas general election, my former colleague, Joe Costello, took a case to the High Court claiming that such an election would be unconstitutional given that constituency changes had not taken place. Happily, that election did not materialise and we are dealing with the changes tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> The decision by the Kenny-Gilmore Government to reduce the number of Deputies in the Dáil from 166 to 158 was a typically ill-considered and short-term action from those two politicians and a bad mistake for Irish democracy. In the cut and thrust of constituency and Dáil electoral politics, the 158 serving Deputies are generally good value for their constituents. I have always believed in a larger Dáil- with, perhaps, 180 Members - rather than a smaller one. There could be 20 five-seaters and 20 four-seaters and there could even be bigger constituencies. There is an issue with bigger constituencies, however, with which all of us, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle included, have lived for some time. In Dublin Bay North, there are 152,000 people and 58,000 households, which we have to visit each quarter with our reports to constituents. It is a huge task because, unlike constituencies outside Dublin, anyone in our constituency can ask us to move a representation on his or her behalf. This means that we represent constituencies that are perhaps twice or even three times the size of a Westminster constituency, which is strange in light of the population of England.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> While every Seanad usually has a few good representatives and performers, from my early months in this House - when I visited with schoolchildren and young people from Dublin north east - I have always believed that the Upper House should be abolished, with the savings going to strong local government led by directly-elected executive mayors, especially in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. The Kenny-Gilmore Government decided on a policy of abolishing the Seanad but refused to mount any significant campaign to achieve that objective. Senator Michael McDowell and others talk of reforming the Seanad by giving it a popular mandate but Ireland does not need two Dáileanna, especially in light of the work of the Constitutional Convention and the growing part played by referenda. The people should constitute our second House and we should come back to the agenda of an enhanced Dáil, as a single House, as is the case in New Zealand, Denmark and other countries that have changed from bicameral to unicameral systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> The Minister is bringing a position paper to Cabinet relating to directly-elected executive mayors. I would warmly welcome this because it has been a constant theme among people with whom I entered politics, especially in the case of the greater Dublin region but also in respect of the greater Cork region in light of the changes being made to Cork in order to make it a leading European-sized second city. I hope the Minister's plans will take shape in time for the 2019 elections and that there will be new executives by that time. I have felt for some years that the housing situation is just not being dealt with in the context of the four Dublin counties and we need an overall executive to be able to address such issues. We have seen the success of these positions and of executives and cabinets in London, Liverpool and Manchester, our great neighbouring cities across the sea, each of which now has a person who can speak for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> I made a submission to the Constituency Commission in January as part of its consultation process in the wake of the results of census 2016. I agreed with the increase of two in the overall number of Deputies and called for them to be given to the Dublin and Leinster region, particularly as the population of the latter is heading for 3 million. The region should be properly represented in this House. I also indicated that my first preference would be to return to the previous constituency boundaries relating to Dublin North-East, with Portmarnock, Balgriffin and Kinsealy once again included, and the restoration of the three-seat model. I also proposed that Dublin North Central should be reconstituted as a three-seat constituency, with any necessary additional territory and population returning from the Santry and lower Fairview-North Strand areas. It would be right to have six Deputies for that huge population covering 35 or 40 parishes. My second preference was to leave Dublin Bay North alone and not to lose any territory or population, because the communities and parishes of the constituency have very close social, economic and cultural affinity and civic and political groups and organisations are just beginning to get used to the merged constituency. There is work for six or even seven Deputies there and one could say the same for Laois-Offaly and other constituencies. Increased representation should have been the way forward, rather than what happened under the previous Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> The Schedule sets out the list of constituencies. Dublin Bay North, which I am proud to represent, is remaining as a five-seat constituency, with some boundary changes. If the Bill is approved, it will mean that the electoral division of Drumcondra south, comprising 5,000 people, will be transferred out of my constituency and into Dublin Central. Having represented a constituency which has changed after every electoral commission, I will continue my usual practice of representing the area that elected me right up to the next general election, which includes Drumcondra south in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> Dublin Bay North has a population of 152,943, meaning there are 30,589 citizens per Deputy, which is the basis of the rationale in the report for the reduction of 5,000. North and west Dublin are under-represented and, given the major changes planned in construction and development over the coming years, I have consistently raised the importance of collaborative development on the north fringe of Dublin city and the adjoining south fringe of Fingal county and stressed the need for close co-operation between both local authorities in these areas. A colleague spoke earlier of representing three county councils or three major local authorities and I appreciate the enormous amount of work that goes into that. The north fringe spans a territory from Clonshaugh and Belcamp across to Burnell, Belmayne and Clongriffin and on to Baldoyle and south Portmarnock on the coast. The population is growing and, at long last, construction has begun. As I said to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government a few weeks ago, however, we are laying foundation stones rather than delivering homes for our young population.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Were it not for the crash, we would have had by now a thriving new district in an area that has been lacking in basic infrastructure and resources for the many families who live there. In my submission to the commission, I noted that the division of the region locally between Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council has created problems, month after month and year after year, for the coherent and sustainable development of the new city region.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">I highlighted the importance of local Oireachtas representation invigilating those matters and that the best method to do so would be in one constituency to ensure better accountability for the development of the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> Deputy Cowen has submitted an amendment asking that Dublin Bay North and Dublin Bay South go back to being called Dublin North-East and Dublin South-East. Dublin North-East had been a constituency since the mid-1930s, when it covered roughly the same territory as it does now. When it became more populated it became two constituencies, Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central. It is an interesting proposal, but the population and civic society have got used to the acronym DBN for Dublin Bay North. The general feeling is that maybe we should leave the name of the constituency alone because it expresses the huge affinity we have with the ocean and the bay, with special amenity areas on Bull Island and in Howth and throughout the constituency. I am easy on it, but my preference is to leave Dublin Bay North with its name, which the commission in the 2011 Parliament came up with.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> In general terms I welcome the fact the Dáil is expanding. I would have expanded it much more, with the concomitant impact of having it as a single powerful unicameral Chamber but making sure people on the ground were really well represented with sufficient Deputies. As it is, I will support the commission's report, even with the loss of south Drumcondra.</p>

          <p eId="para_809">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I am glad the constituency of Kerry has remained a five seater with 147,000 people to represent. There are a couple of discrepancies in relation to Rathmore, where part of the parish is on the Cork side, and it would be great if we could get it returned to us as it was taken from us. This comprises six townlands, namely, Rathduane, Knocknaloman, Carrigaline, Nohoval, Caherbarnagh and Hollymount. It is the same story in Ballydesmond. Whatever happened there, more than half of it is in Kerry and we would like the other townlands, including Carriganes, Upper and Lower Glencollins, Tooreenduff, Foyle, Camper and Glenreagh to be returned to their rightful place in the county of Kerry.</p>

We would have no bother in representing those people if they came back to us, and a lot of them are anxious to come back to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The constituency of Kerry is vast. We have three peninsulas, namely, Beara, Iveragh and the Dingle Peninsula. One could say we are nearly surrounded on three sides by water, as at the top of the constituency, along Tarbert and Ballybunion, the Shannon divides us from Clare. I have to say that Kerry is the best county in the country. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae and I are thankful to the people of Kerry because the constituency would not be much good without its people. We are very thankful to the people of Kerry for electing us to represent them, and we hope they will do the same in the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Without a shadow of doubt, back over the history pages, we have had the best footballers and we have had a lot of fine hurlers as well.

It will take a fair effort to stop us from cutting the turf, and anyone who tries will get a rude awakening if they land with any type of army to stop us because we will put up massive resistance. We have been doing it for years and we will continue to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_818">I am very grateful to be able to speak in this debate. It is very important and it is of great concern to us. I would like to make a point before I start talking about Deputies, which is that while Members of this House might be inclined to think of ourselves, there is a very great group of people I want to talk about when we speak about electoral boundaries, and that is our county councillors. Our county council, which I believe to be one of the finest in the Western world, is Kerry County Council. I speak of all of the councillors we have on Kerry County Council at present, but Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I are very proud of how Councillors Maura Healy-Rae and Johnny Healy-Rae are working and they continue to do great work on our local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> Our councillors have an awful job of work in regard to the electoral areas they represent. For instance, Councillor Johnny Healy-Rae, my nephew, covers from Cuhig to Lauragh and all around it and then up through Kenmare, back down into Sneem, over into mid-Kerry, back into Dingle and back out to Ventry and Ballyferriter. It is a massive electoral area for any councillor to represent. He is doing it in an excellent fashion, and I am very glad and proud of the way he is doing his work, as I am proud of all of the other people, whoever they are, be they Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin or whoever. Our county councillors do a great job of work. A lot of the time it goes unrecorded and under the radar. They do not get thanked enough for it. They are not looking for thanks but I appreciate the work our councillors are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">They are on the go day and night, holding their clinics, serving their constituents and attending electoral area meetings, county council meetings and all the other functions involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> Everybody knows my feelings about the abolition of the town councils. It was wrong. If it was attempted now instead of then there would be no hope in the world that it would pass. The arrogance of the previous Government is gone, thankfully. There is no way that the current Government could do away with the town councils. It would not get away with doing what the last Government did. It was a foolish mistake. It was led by a certain former Member. I do not like naming people, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and you know that I will not do so, but we all know who it is.</p>

          <p eId="para_827"> This is similar to the abolition of the dual mandate. I can tell a funny story about that. Some politicians thought it was a good idea to abolish the dual mandate. They did so to hurt independent representatives. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you are a busy politician and you have been in politics for a long time. You know what I am talking about. On many occasions the big political establishments have thought of great ideas to take on and hurt independent politicians. One example is the abolition of the dual mandate. In our case, they thought the abolition of the dual mandate might hurt us. Instead, they left an opening for a person who was not really anxious to get into politics, but who turned out to be one of the finest politicians who ever became a member of Kerry County Council and a Member of the Dáil. In other words, these smart politicians who thought they were hurting us shot themselves in the foot. Smart people should really think about what they are doing before they do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_829">I am glad to be able to speak because I nearly lost most of my constituency in the last ten minutes. I am delighted to speak on this important legislation. Constituencies have undergone significant changes over the past five years with mergers, divisions and reductions in the number of Deputies. My constituency of Cork South-West has been amended in a number of ways. Before I continue, I must point out that I am honoured to have been elected and to work on behalf of my constituents in the Dáil. However, there are only three Deputies for what is probably the longest constituency in Ireland. It should have at least five Deputies representing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> A few years ago my constituency lost many townlands that were, and always will be, considered part of Cork South-West. A section of Dunmanway has been moved into the Cork North-West constituency, which is absolutely disgraceful. It leaves the people of the area in no man's land. I would have tied myself to the gates of Dáil Éireann if I had been a Member of the House at the time to prevent losing that part of Dunmanway. It should never have happened. The same applies to Ballineen and Enniskeane. The two neighbouring small towns are so close they could be considered one. One town has been exiled to the northern half of west Cork. With no disrespect to my colleagues from that constituency, this is a mindless change and the people who have been moved are wholly unhappy about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> The people who made that decision can only be described as pencil pushers. They drew random lines on maps wherever they wished. How could anybody think that splitting a town between constituencies would be productive or sensible? It appears from the way the lines were drawn that it must have been done late at night after a big Christmas party. The new recommendations from the Constituency Commission have done nothing to solve the problems in my constituency. Will the Minister of State ask the commission to examine this as soon as possible? I appreciate that many other constituencies also face such issues when constituents are moved out of the constituency and are left feeling disenfranchised.</p>

          <p eId="para_835">Okay. Local public representatives do not know where to go. In addition, recently I and my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group raised in the Dáil the issue of the Mackinnon report and the local government changes proposed for Cork City Council and Cork County Council. Again, these are senseless changes that are nothing less than power grabs by the city council. There is no democracy in them. The locals on both sides of the city and county border are not happy with these changes. The people in offices who are making these detrimental decisions have no concept of what they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> In addition, I neither support nor agree with the agreement reached between the councils last Monday week. Many people in areas such as Ballincollig, who are now being forced into the city, are not happy either. It is another example of democracy being thrown out the window. Councillors work tirelessly, day and night, for their communities. Councillors such as Kevin Conway, Marcia D'Alton, June Murphy, Danny Collins and many more are totally opposed to the destructive extension of the city boundary in Cork. It appears that the only supporters of this merger are those who back the establishment. If it goes ahead, the decision will have devastating consequences for County Cork. However, I hope common sense will prevail and that those who back the establishment will change and listen to the people who elected them. I am delighted to hear that the Fianna Fáil councillors are now speaking strongly against this, even though a couple of weeks ago when I and the Rural Independent Group brought forward a motion on the issue in the House the silence from that party was deafening. Its Members rejected the motion, which could have led to kicking out the Mackinnon report.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> People in offices who decide on such detrimental changes have no understanding of the areas they are changing. With regard to the new recommendations, I have noted that in many constituencies voters who had been moved from their traditional constituencies for the last election have been moved back in, but in other cases voters have been moved out. This is like robbing Peter to pay Paul. It does not make sense. A number of voters around the country still feel disengaged from local politics and their public representatives. I plead with the Minister of State to listen to the concerns I have raised. If this continues to happen democracy will be thrown out the window.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> I see no provision in the Bill that seeks to amend the blatant errors of taking areas such as north Dunmanway, Enniskeane, Murragh and parts of Newcestown out of Cork South-West. I agree with the Constituency Commission on leaving areas such as Castletownbere, Cahermore, Eyeries, Allihies, Bere Island, Ardgroom, Dursey Island, Adrigole and Glengarriff in the constituency, as they should stay in Cork. Serious consideration should be given to shifting Lauragh to the constituency of Cork South-West, as it surrounds the area and the townlands. If that happened, I would seriously consider supporting the Bill. However, it is another piece of undemocratic work introduced by pencil pushers in offices who do not know the lie of the land.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">I think I will be resigning because I do not know who will keep the peace in the group with all the land grabs that are taking place in Kerry, Cork and elsewhere. Níl a fhios agam cá bhfuil all but I am looking forward to tomorrow, amárach. I am happy to speak on this issue. Is pribhléid mór dom é, a huge privilege, to be elected to serve the people of all of Tipperary, aside for the bit that has been hived off into Limerick. I was also honoured and privileged to represent west Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> I agree with having county boundaries as far as possible but one must also consider a town such as Clonmel. The river divides the town. A sizeable portion of the town that is across the river is in County Waterford. The people there were born in the hospital in Clonmel, they went to school in Clonmel and they work and socialise in Clonmel. They want to vote in Tipperary. I mean no disrespect to Deputy Butler who represents Waterford, but those people are Clonmel people. Such a town should not be divided. My colleagues were speaking about the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> We kept Cromwell out of Clonmel centuries ago but we could not keep out big Phil, the destroyer and enforcer. He banished our town councils. He got rid of 11 borough councils and all the town councils throughout the country. Other Deputies have referred to how he trod on them. I met the Minister of State's supporters earlier and they were not very interested in his move to Europe either. The Minister of State must have hand-picked the crowd he brought here because they were all big supporters of the Minister of State. They have forgotten about the man who has left these shores, although as Kilkenny has no seashore he left the pastures of Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> When we were engaged in talks on a programme for Government we spoke about holding plebiscites in the borough districts to ask the people if they wanted the town councils restored. We can discuss the money afterwards. There would be no cost to the State or the taxpayer. All of the county councillors I knew, be they from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party or Independents, worked tirelessly for the people, not for reward. They were doing that before there ever was remuneration. The council itself was not a cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">The huge cost was due to the county managers, all the staff and the directors of services. What they are getting would pay all the councils and the town council for one year. I am making this point very honestly. They gave dedicated service, looked after their people and supported the Garda and the Neighbourhood Watch. In respect of the 11 councillors in the town of Clonmel, they picked up the phone and rang them to get the lowdown on what was going on the area. It was necessary. They were on the ground and in touch and the Government must try to reinstate that. When the Bill was finally passed, I told the former Minister, Phil Hogan, when I was the last Member to speak that I would meet him in another forum. With my support, former councillor Niall Dennehy from Former Local Authority Members Éire, FLAME, has taken a case to the High Court. We are awaiting answers from the Department to progress that case. The Minister of State might look into why we cannot get relevant answers to our parliamentary questions in order that we can progress that case in the Four Courts. </p>
          <p eId="para_845"> I note Deputy Cassells has produced a Bill that will go before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government tomorrow in a meeting I hope to attend. In fairness, his Private Members' Bill will restore this but we should start by reinstating the borough councils and then look at town councils in a voluntary capacity if necessary because the volunteers are there. It is good political ground for spawning and training young politicians. If we were honest, many of us here would admit that we started there - tús maith, leath na hoibre - so what are we are ashamed of now? Is it a case of pulling up the ladder and to hell with the people behind them? No, we want our town council back in Clonmel. We used to have a budget of €15.1 million in that town. We now have nothing. We also had the town of Carrick-on-Suir, although we never had it in Cahir but we had a block grant. We had the towns of Cashel, Tipperary town and indeed right up into Thurles, Templemore, Nenagh and Roscrea. If we had to, we would go as far as Birr - if they were not able to look after it - because Deputy Cowen did not come in to do much for Tipperary when they were looking after it. We must leave county boundaries alone where possible except when the make-up of a sizeable town, its seed, breed and generation, means it is in a single enclave and so it must be left alone. We need to go back to the drawing board here. Deputy Michael Collins was pulled up by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for criticising the mandarins who drew the lines. They must be held accountable. Retired politicians and retired senior civil servants should be on this commission, along with lay people so that it is not the preserve of the great institution down in the town where all the retired civil servants and county managers are. They have to be rooted out. We should turn off the heating there to see whether they will get out and let us, the elected people, govern. We should bring in lay people and retired politicians who have a wealth of knowledge - no more than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. We need common sense to prevail. We do not need attacks and forays like those affecting south-west Cavan, Sligo-Leitrim and indeed south Donegal. The men who drew that up were crazy. They must be asleep or been out the night before. </p>

          <p eId="para_846">I am sharing time with Deputies Brassil and O'Loughlin. I will take about ten minutes. I thank the boundary commission for completing a very difficult task. I think we will find that after each revision of the boundaries, there will be a very similar kind of debate here with some people happy and others unhappy. Essentially, there can be serious confusion for constituents, particularly on the fringes of electoral boundaries, who often find themselves in and out of constituencies. Accepting that, we must remember what the Constitution says. It talks about the tolerances between 20,000 and 30,000 - no less than 20,000 and no more than 30,000. However, it also says that as far is practicable, it should be equal throughout the country and that it should be reviewed at least once every 12 years. That was put into the Constitution at a time when there was a census of population every ten years. After 1971, the census was reviewed every five years. This change brought into sharp focus the fact that the Constitution said it should be done at least every 12 years. We knew then that there were facts and figures showing that constituencies were out of sync with the results of the census. I saw it as well. I raised the matter continually in the Dáil throughout 2006. I did not get anywhere with it and Deputy Finian McGrath and I took a case to the High Court that was referred to on a number of occasions this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> On that occasion, ten constituencies were seriously out of line. When we look at how tight it can be with regard to who forms a Government, that matters. We can all look at our individual constituencies. It matters who forms a Government. If there is a difference of maybe two or three people on one side or the other side of the House and the boundaries have not been reviewed, one could rightly claim that it has been an undemocratic process. This is the point we must keep in mind. It is not just from rural to urban. During the review at that time, and we had a look at the numbers in some considerable detail, Dún Laoghaire had one seat too many and Dublin West had one seat too few. The irony was that one person was part of the next Government and the other person lost their seat. One should have been elected while there should not have been the extra seat in the other constituency, so it can matter. If we are really talking about democracy in the big sense of the word in terms of representing the country as it stands, we must not lose sight of that. </p>
          <p eId="para_848"> The judge in this case, who is now Chief Justice, reminded us that it was not just a Government obligation but the obligation of the Oireachtas to carry out this revision, although, in practice, we know the work is done by the particular Department, which is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. He also said it should immediately set in train the review of the constituencies and that it was a matter of the utmost importance. We saw just recently that we could have been in the middle of a general election with a revision that should have taken place so we can see the urgency regarding making sure that we are true to the Constitution and that as far as is practicable, we make sure that every citizen in this country is equal. I wanted to make that point because I have listened to many things here that tend to look at it in a fragmented way, which is very frustrating because it is about a bigger principle. I can also feel great sympathy for people on the fringes of constituencies who are in and out and feel very frustrated about that and where one sees a town divided where it should not be divided. </p>
          <p eId="para_849"> I have been hugely frustrated by what we do not do with our census of population. I have seen numerous examples. The advertisement goes out and people are told to fill in the census form on census night, as they should and as I would always encourage them to do, because we need this information so that we can provide services. One then looks at how the census is or is not used. For example, how come Kildare has the lowest ratio of gardaí to population? Meath is pretty similar, as is the likes of Wexford. These are places that have grown very substantially and where there is a policing plan every year that is supposed to look at demographics and crime statistics. However, in fact, up to now, it has been a work of fiction. We look at some of the services that are provided by the HSE. They bear no relationship to that growing population and those needs. I have a huge criticism of the underuse of the census of population in terms of the delivery of service. It fails spectacularly in terms of what it asks people to put in the census form and what it does with the information afterwards. I had a look at the data relating to growth in the country over 20 years. If we start looking at the area around Dublin, we can see that the city centre grew by 13% while Cork city only grew by 1% so the figures are not growing in the right places. I looked at the fringes. Fingal grew by 43% while Meath grew by 44% and Kildare grew by 39%. </p>
          <p eId="para_850">If we look at the delivery of services, we find the areas that have experienced a growth in population are the ones that lag behind in terms of the delivery of services. I use every opportunity to make that point because it drives me nuts. What should ultimately happen in terms of treating our democratic process with a degree of priority, which we have not often done, is the introduction of an overarching, independent statutory body with full operational and regulatory powers over the electoral process such as a chief electoral officer. When we have a referendum we have a referendum commission but a standing organisation could do research into good practice in terms of voter turnout and dealing with the electoral register on an ongoing basis. The present situation is quite confusing to people. If they fill out the form at a particular time of the year it is okay. However, getting onto the supplementary register can involve going to a Garda station and things like that can be off-putting. Such an organisation should look at voter registration and boundary divisions and redraw them. There would be consistency if it was done that way. Political finance, regulation and voter education could be included. There is merit in looking at the health of our democracy from the point of view of how we manage these things. We have not given it the attention it needs. I support the notion of directly elected mayors. It is a very positive thing. I hope when we are looking at boundaries, we are not strict in terms of the county boundaries because functional areas can be very different from the county boundaries. I hope that would be part of the consideration. </p>

          <p eId="para_851">Listening to some of the debate this evening, I began to think that in addition to there being no need for an Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Bill, there is no need for an election. Based on the backslapping that has gone on in the past half hour, I think Members should automatically be re-elected. I jest.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> I have been told by the Whip of my party, Deputy Michael Moynihan, that there is a long-standing tradition, going back 40 years to when Jack Lynch introduced this system of boundary commissions, the purpose of which was to avoid gerrymandering, that no amendments are accepted. I would like to think that through this debate, we could break the tradition. I say that for a specific reason. I come from an area in County Louth that had nothing but confusion for many years. When I was growing up, one polling booth was in County Monaghan and the other one was in County Louth. The parish was totally divided in terms of who one's electoral support should be going to. I refer to that to show that the issue of where people vote is about identity. My constituency includes more than 22,000 voters in the coastal area of Meath. A constituency's name should reflect the area it represents; as boundary commissions change, that creates a problem. Those 22,000 voters in County Meath could almost elect a representative because 30,185 votes is the number required based on Louth's population of 150,924. It is terribly important that the name of the constituency is not just "Louth". Others have tabled other amendments on the issue of what the name should be. There is a constituency called Meath East which is traditionally the area that in Louth has been referred to as east Meath. Meath probably has the shortest county coastline in the country of approximately 13 km. The people of Julianstown, Mornington and Laytown should be able to identify with their area. It is for that reason I wish to contribute this evening. I know we will not deal with amendments until later but I believe there needs to be some thought on that issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_853"> We are a county with a long tradition of service and are very proud to have had Pádraig Faulkner, Séamus Kirk and Rory O'Hanlon, who served the Monaghan constituency, elected as Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil. If we consider the era of Frank Aiken and the various Ministers who served then, we know the electorate identifies with those who work on behalf of their constituents. Deputy Eugene Murphy referred to the issue of other areas coming in. People need to be clear on who their representatives are and in this case the name does not reflect that. I am sure representatives of other counties would say the same. In this case, "Louth Coastal Meath" is an apt name. </p>

          <p eId="para_856">I share a birthday with Christy Moore on 7 May. I wish a happy birthday to both of those fine gentlemen.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> Getting back to the substantive issue, we all know why there was a constituency boundary revision. It is important that everybody is represented fairly and equally. It should not just break down on numbers. When we are talking about democracy in action, whether local or national, we are talking about the sense of meitheal. We are talking about communities that work together. We are talking about the sense of pride of place where there is a strong identity with traditions, the town, the local football team and the county football team. The county boundary in all areas should be respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> When I made a submission to the new boundary revision constituency committee I made that point very strongly and forcibly because in the last general election the people of Monasterevin, rural Athy and Kildangan could not use their vote in their county and had to use it in Laois. My wishes were respected in one respect and the people in those areas came back into Kildare South which is very welcome. However, people from Portarlington, Killenard, Ballybrittas, the Offaly part of Portarlington and parts of north Kildare are now in Kildare South. A total of 12 electoral districts are coming back into my constituency. The people of Portarlington, Killenard and Ballybrittas are very aggrieved and I completely understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> We talk about identity and people working together to attract industry and the necessary infrastructure. There will now be two county councils, Laois County Council and Offaly County Council, and two Dáil constituencies, Kildare South and Laois. Portarlington is the second biggest town in County Laois and it is being taken away from its county, which leads to a loss of morale. I have had a number of meetings with the good people of Portarlington and they all feel very aggrieved by this, which I completely understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> County boundaries should be respected. Having said that, I want to make a commitment here and now to the people of that area. I know they will be losing the services of Deputies Cowen and Fleming but I commit to do everything in my power to represent them as best I can as I have done in the area of Kildare South for the past 20 months. I am delighted we are bringing back in the areas of Monasterevin, rural Athy and Kildangan and also the areas of Carbury and Clogharinka which were in Kildare North.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I hope we bear all that in mind for the local election boundaries. Communities, towns and villages that operate as units should be preserved. That should be considered alongside numbers.</p>

          <p eId="para_864">One big minute, I am told. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I have the distinction of being possibly the only Member of the Dáil who could not vote for myself in the past two general elections. Five years ago I stood here disappointed with the outcome of the Constituency Commission's report. Today I stand here welcoming the report as the part of County Carlow that has been in exile for the past 20 years has been returned to join up with the rest of the county in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency. I thank those who made submissions from that part of Carlow including Rathvilly, Hacketstown, Clonmore, Tiknock, Kineagh and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> It is important that we do not lose sight of the fact that this is not about the politicians, but about the people in the constituencies. Apathy has arisen as a result. The voter turnout in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency in the last general election was 66%. The voter turnout in Wicklow, including east Carlow, was 71%. The voter turnout in Wicklow that excluded east Carlow was 72%. The voter turnout among the 4,500 people in east Carlow who were in exile for the past 20 years was only 56%. It proves the point that people who have been disenfranchised need to be brought back into the system. We continually talk about bringing people in and engaging them, but we must ensure the system is there to engage them so that they have an opportunity to do that. I welcome the report in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> We have listened to people mention the different local authority areas involved. In Carlow, we are dealing with two councils, two different regions and two different ETB regions which has complicated matters considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> I welcome the report and hopefully this will continue for the future. I thank those who voted for me in Carlow-Kilkenny in the last general election. I assure them that even though that part of Carlow will be returning I will be available to supplement the work the Minister of State has been doing in Carlow-Kilkenny for the last period, in particular in Kilkenny. I look forward to them being represented by us in the next period.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">We need to recognise that this report was done by an independent commission. Based on population, the constituencies as laid out should be accepted. The last time a report came in, I tabled an amendment suggesting that the constituency of Galway West be called Galway West-South Mayo because that was the popular choice of the people. My amendment was defeated in the Dáil vote. I was amused to hear some of the Government Deputies of the time continue to call the constituency Galway West-South Mayo even though they had voted against that in Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> There is a fundamental difference between changing anything that relates to population or anything else here and making the names more friendly and what the people on the ground want. Whereas I agree with the principle that the constituencies as laid out here should be adhered to, there is no reason the Dáil cannot change the names of those constituencies as long as that name change is reasonable and reflects the desire on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I have followed this debate with interest. To follow the constitutional provision of as far as is practicable having an equal representation across the country, county boundaries need to be broken. It is just not possible to do it any other way. Solomon or a crew of Solomons would not devise a system to do it any differently. The previous Government made a monumental error in reducing the number of Deputies, which could and should be changed. The reality is that Government Members got their answer. They went on a splurge in trying to reduce democracy because some of their pals in <i>The Irish Times</i> thought there were too many public representatives in the country. Therefore, they reduced the number of local authority public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> I believe there should be equality in the country areas as opposed to towns - I do not know what is so sacrosanct about towns and cities. Throughout the country we need footpaths, streetlights, water and all the other things. We need planning permission and we have to be subject to all these laws. That said, we could have reformed local government but not reduced local democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> The previous Government then proceeded with something it thought would be very popular in trying to abolish the Seanad. However, the reality is that Irish people like public representatives. They give out about us all the time, which is fair game and part of what we are there for, but they love us. They come to us every week and they want us to represent them. They never think they have too many representatives on an individual basis. They think there are too many out there, but they do not think there are half enough in their own constituencies. We should not listen to the gurus all the time; we should listen to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> On top of all these cutbacks, the Government decided to go to the absolute limit of the 30,000. I remember when it was nearer to 20,000 rather than 30,000 and with very rapid rises in population we were very near the 30,000. For some mysterious reason the Government decided to cut the Dáil representation from 166 to 158. If when it was proposing to abolish the Seanad it also proposed increasing Dáil representation from 166 to 188 or 190, it might have got away with abolishing the Seanad. However, people were not going to take that much of a diminution in their public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> We should learn the lesson that people in this country value democracy and value local representation. They believe that it is a good idea not to take all their politics from experts. Of course, we should listen to experts, but the people who should ultimately direct policy in this State are the ordinary people of the country for whom we are meant to guide policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> According to the Government's great national planning framework, the population is projected to increase by 1 million people between now and 2040. That means that because it has gone to the 30,000 limit and it has repeated the mistake this time, with every constituency review the Government will have to review all sorts of areas because it will have to keep increasing the Dáil representation. If we had taken the brave leap and gone back to 166 or 170, the Government would have had to do a little bit of adjusting for population shift, but all things being equal, where the population grew in line with the national trend in population, it would not have had to keep changing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> If the Government's spatial strategy goes the way it is telling it will go, the rural constituencies will get increasingly bigger. The strategy is to push everybody into the cities and the rural area will be denuded. I do not know if people realise how big and complex constituencies can get. I represent Galway West-South Mayo and I could not believe my luck at the last constituency review because where I had lived and fought all elections since I started contesting elections I had a population of 2,000 within 20 miles of my house. It was not much of a home base.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Thankfully, on the previous occasion another 10,000 people were added to that constituency. I was not exactly complaining because the Mayo border is only four miles from my house and literally borders my parish. Half of that constituency will go back into Mayo and I am happy for those people. They were very anxious to go back into Mayo, and I can understand that, but those in the other half are staying with us and since I can give them a great service because I am so local, I am very happy about that. I hope I will continue to give them a good service as a local Deputy but the reality in our constituency is that we must look at the challenges. We have a good slice of area east of the Corrib, nearly as far as Athenry. A little is being shaved off that, half way between Clarinbridge and Kilcolgan. Despite what people think there is a very populous area east of the Corrib, the area in which my colleague, Deputy Grealish, lives. It is a big enough area population wise to elect a Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> We have Galway city, which gives us local authority No. 2. We then have the whole of Connemara, including four offshore islands that pose their own problems in terms of visiting and servicing them. To travel from one end of the constituency to the other, particularly because we did not get the bypass in Galway, could take anything up to two hours. That is going from east to west. If one goes out to the island it will take one a lot longer, although the aeroplane to Arran Island is handy.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> Our constituency then goes into a third local authority, Mayo, so we have three local authorities. To travel from Leitir Mealláin to the furthest end up in County Mayo would take one another hour and a half. That means it is very difficult for representatives to give a good service.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> I hear people talk about the House of Commons, the house of this and the house of that. I recall being in Holland one time doing work for An Bord Bia as a Minister. I attended an event and I thought I would have to go around and shake everybody's hand but they told me that politicians do not do that in Holland. I asked, "What do they not do?" I asked them if I did the right thing and they said I gave the speech and did whatever I had to do but the idea of literally going around getting to know everybody was not part of their politics. That is a grand place. One could represent any number of people that way. I am afraid that would not work too well in the way we operate here.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The second myth is that there are only 600 MPs across the water serving a population that is 12 times bigger than ours but they do not have multi-seat constituencies. The reality is that, on average, in a five seat constituency each one of us represents the entire 150,000. The Minister of State knows that too. In addition, since there are another four representatives chasing around and a few Senators on top of that, one has to be at every dog fight whereas if one is the only person with the word "Deputy" before one's name representing 50,000 or 60,000, one would be under a lot less pressure to be everywhere all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> I am strongly of the view that we should not be shy about high levels of representation in this country. I am sure that if we put it to the people of Mayo, they would love to get the fifth seat back. In fact, they would love to go back to the time of the six seater or the two three seaters, as would Donegal. I can guarantee that the people of Galway West would love it if our constituency contracted and we could spend a lot more time on the ground in a smaller area.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> We will accept this one but I hope whoever is in government the next time does not try to please <i>The Irish Times</i>, which cannot be pleased anyway, and tries to please the people for a change. The next time we should increase the number so that for two or three revisions, allowing for the fact that the population will increase, we will not be forced to increase the number of seats time after time, which is the way we will have to go. If we continue to adjust the 30 at every revision, we will have to increase the seat again and again. We would be better making one jump and having that sustainable for at least three revisions and then, if necessary, making another jump.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> Tuigim go bhfuileadar ag iarraidh ag iarraidh an díospóireacht seo a chríochnú anocht. Ní dhéarfaidh mise níos mó faoi. Glacaim leis an gcinneadh atá déanta. Guím chuile rath ar chuile duine sa Dáil seo a bheas ag seasamh arís. Beidh mise féin ag seasamh.

          <p eId="para_887"> With regard to Deputy Ó Cuív's comments on broadening the terms for future commissions, some of that is partly included in section 5. The other issues principally revolve around the need to keep county boundaries intact. That is a broader question. The Department is currently drafting legislation with regard to an electoral commission and that is something that commission should be charged with examining.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">It is the practice that the commission sets the names. As Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned, this report has so many small parcels of counties in different constituencies. I accept the fact that the case in Louth is larger than other examples but there are numerous constituency names and if they were to be fully reflective of the counties that are included, we could have very strange constituency names as things stand. The broader question is how we try to ensure that county boundaries are kept intact when we are doing work on future commissions. That is a job for the electoral commission and it is hoped that legislation will come before the House next year.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_949">— increase home help hours so that an efficient service can be provided to additional older people.”</p>
          <p eId="para_950">It is my pleasure to introduce this Private Members' motion on behalf of the Rural Independent Group on the issue of home care being placed on a statutory footing. This motion applies to people of all ages, be they children, persons with disabilities, or those who become dependent as they age. It concerns the provision of home care to everyone who needs it. The purpose of home care is to keep people living at home in their community and to maximise their potential to remain as independent as possible. It also seeks to avoid unnecessary institutional care and to defer the entry to institutional care for as long as possible; for a person's entire life, if possible. We want to put home care on a statutory footing to ensure that it is governed by legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_951"> The Minister entered into a period of public consultation which has now concluded. There were over 2,000 submissions to that consultation. Those submissions are being published at the moment, and the delay in introducing a report is due to the number of submissions received. I believe the date was extended for a month or so, and I understand why the delay happened. However, we would expect that when a report is produced that legislation would be provided as speedily as possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_952"> Home care needs to be put on a statutory footing because its provision can be a postcode lottery. It is very patchy throughout the country, and some areas receive care while others do not. It is very uneven. We know there are limited resources, but when it is placed on a statutory footing we would expect that resources would meet demand. It should be primarily based on need, and also the depth of need. I believe that home care on a statutory basis should be provided through the public system. There are private providers, which provides competition for the provision of home care, but it does not necessarily drive down costs. The Minister should consider home care as a public-based system. </p>
          <p eId="para_953"> The debate on whether this should happen is now over. We need to have home care on a statutory basis. How is it going to be delivered, when will it happen, what form will it take and how will it be funded? I hope that the process of consultation and the drawing up of a report and legislation will be done in a speedy fashion. We had a hearing at the Committee on Health a number of weeks ago which suggested that there would be a two to three year process before legislation for statutory home care was finalised. I hope that can be speeded up and that statutory home care can be delivered in a shorter timeframe than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The scheme needs regulation, and we understand that. It must be transparent and there must be integration with other services. We do need to have a home care system, but it must be integrated with other systems. It must be complementary to family carers rather than replacing family carers. It must be flexible and adaptable to individual circumstances, and it must be person-centred. Funding mechanisms must be developed, and this is very important when one considers whether the scheme will be free or whether the recipient will make a contribution. That is a very important element of the statutory basis of home care. </p>
          <p eId="para_955"> We need to look at this from a different perspective. There may be room for a social insurance model rather than a model based entirely on taxation, and there may be a need for ring-fenced funding so that funding cannot be cut on the whim of a government or in circumstances which put pressure on State funds. It is a false economy to limit funding to home care because it only transfers services on to much more expensive nursing home care and hospital care. </p>
          <p eId="para_956"> We should look at home care in an anticipatory way. We should be providing home care to people who are becoming frail but have not had an emergency and have not had to enter hospital because of an illness or a fall. It should be provided so that we can predict and supply services to people before things escalate. One example I have come across recently is that of a man who, as they say in rural Ireland, "Took to the bed", and unfortunately, because he was not receiving home care services or physiotherapy services he became so incapacitated that he needed to access acute services. We should be providing home care to try and prevent those situations from happening. </p>
          <p eId="para_957"> Home care is very important in terms of the social determinants of health. It encompasses not just health but housing, social protection and transport as well. All of these things feed in to supporting our elderly people to stay within their communities. Many areas have developed supported housing for our elderly. When they become isolated, incapacitated and live alone with a lack of family support they can come into a community based housing setting where they get low support but are supported by the community. They can continue to live independently in the community with that level of community and low-level support. There are many examples of housing situations around the country like that, and it is another aspect of home care that we could look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> There is much un-met need, and the changing demographics are against us. Our population is ageing, which will be a huge problem in the future. We need to anticipate its development. It makes economic and social sense to do this, and it makes no sense to ration home care services. That is a false economy. Home care keeps pressure from our accident and emergency departments, from our lengthening trolley queues, and it reduces hospital admissions and hospital referrals if we can support our elderly people or those with disabilities within the community and prevent them from having to go through our secondary services. The answer to our home care problem is in the Sláintecare report, which was produced last May. That includes many hospital avoidance measures which could keep people living within our community. The Taoiseach mentioned this morning that if each GP referred two fewer patients each week and kept them at home instead the multiples of patients going on our waiting lists would be reduced by thousands. This can only happen if there are GP services, public health nursing services, properly staffed primary care teams and community intervention teams. These would all be very important in providing support for our community of dependent people. That aspect of home care should also be included in the Minister's deliberations. </p>
          <p eId="para_959"> It is important to provide respite care for carers. Many carers are working 24-7, 365 days of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">There is a huge deficiency in respect of providing respite care so that they too can get a break and do not burn out. We have problems in the transition from childhood to adolescence. Respite falls away and must be fought for again. Carers are very concerned about what will happen to their dependant children and the dependant adults they look after when they pass away or become incapacitated. That must also be looked at in respect of home care packages.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> We have to look at the recruitment and retention of those who supply care. There is an issue here. Many people who would supply home care services in their communities are disincentivised from doing so because the social welfare system is against them. If they worked for a few hours each day for five days of the week they would lose their entire social welfare entitlements. If it was based on hours per week rather than hours per day, there would be many people within communities who could provide caring services to their neighbours, friends and families. They cannot do so currently because they are disincentivised by the social welfare system. That is something which should be looked at. If an exception is necessary to allow people work for one or two hours a day without losing their social welfare payments, one should be arranged between the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Department of Health. I mentioned this to the previous Minister for Social Protection. He had issues with it, but it needs to be looked at again because in many instances patients who need care have been given home care packages and have been allocated hours but cannot get a service because there are no carers to provide it.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> We also need to look at the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. We need to ratify it as quickly as possible and get over the road blocks in respect of the deprivation of liberty and assisted decision making. It makes no sense not to provide home care. The Minister of State knows that as well as I do. It is a false economy.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Grealish<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T21:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_963">I thank my colleague for bringing this motion before the House. It is a wonderful thing that, with the advances in medicine and in our general health, people are living longer, more fulfilling lives. The number of people in Ireland aged over 65 is soaring. It has jumped by almost a fifth in the space of just five years according to the 2016 census. The population of those aged over 80 has doubled over the past quarter of a century alone. Thankfully the majority of them are still living at home. More than 40% are living alone. Current projections indicate that by the middle of this century the number of people aged 80 and over will be pushing the 500,000 mark. We need to do more to ensure that these older people can stay out of long-stay residential care for as long as possible. This motion seeks to put home care on a more solid footing. It also makes solid economic sense to the country as a whole. The cost of helping people to live largely independent and happy lives within their own communities is a fraction of what it costs to keep them in a nursing home or hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> Of course, any discussion of the future of home care services for older people must include a serious look at the situation regarding day care centres. These centres play a vital role in the efforts to enable an older person to remain in his or her own home for as long as possible. They offer not only services for the physical welfare of the older person, but also a most important social outlet for people whose only other contact from day to day is probably the postman. We need to look at funding for these centres and ensure that it is adequate to allow them to continue the good work they do in supporting older people in local communities. </p>
          <p eId="para_965"> The cost to the HSE of a person attending one of these day care centres is an average of €66 per week according to a reply I recently received from the HSE in response to a parliamentary question I tabled on the issue. The equivalent cost to look after the same person in a nursing home is more than €800 a week on average, and a lot more in many cases, particularly in Dublin. It is therefore clear that any investment in day centres is a most cost-effective way to help our older people continue to live independent healthy lives in their own homes and their own communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> Many of these centres are facing an uphill struggle to maintain their services at the level they wish to. In County Galway there is a wonderful day care centre in the village of Claregalway. It is open five days a week from 9.30 a.m. to 5 p.m. It was opened more than five years ago after a group of local people came together with the aim of providing the facility for the village and the wider community. It is a place where older people can visit, enjoy social interaction and take part in various activities and educational programmes to enable them to continue living independently. The centre also provides a day respite service for carers of people suffering from long-term illness. Various activities and educational programmes are provided which are specifically designed for the elderly community to keep them up to date on what is going on around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> On that issue, I have visited the day care centre and what I have found and what I have been told more and more over the last number of months and years is that the HSE is actually telling people to attend it. It is cheaper to tell the family to put their elderly family members into the day care centre than to put them into nursing homes. The HSE is actually using the day care centres as nursing homes and it is not giving any money to the day care centres to provide that service. That is an absolute scandal. It is going on around the country. Health care workers are doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> It is the same thing with Cuan Mhuire. Cuan Mhuire is an excellent facility run by Sr. Consilio Fitzgerald which provides services for people who have drink problems. If a person goes into a hospital with a drink problem, the hospital will pay for a taxi to drop him or her out to Cuan Mhuire. The hospital will tell Sr. Consilio that the person is now her problem and no longer that of the hospital. That is what is going on out there. That has to be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> The centre in Claregalway is supported by fully qualified staff and care assistants. A wheelchair accessible bus service is available to bring people to and from the centre. While the Claregalway and District Day Care Centre gets funding from the HSE, it is barely enough to pay to provide even one month's service in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_970"> I will finish on this point. Planning permission has been received for a new day care centre and an early retirement village in Claregalway. A local farmer gave the land free of charge to build this new day care centre and nine or ten independent living units. Fair play to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment. It is providing the funding to build the independent units. Nobody wants to give funding towards the building of the day care centre however. Will the Minister of State look into that and see if any funding to open that facility can be provided by the State?</p>

          <p eId="para_971">I am glad to be part of the group which brought this motion before the Chamber tonight. It is imperative that all of us, as elected Members, ensure that our elderly people are looked after properly and to try, as far as possible, to keep them in their own homes as long as we can. We all know that nursing homes give people great attention and great care. However, if one asks the residents in a nursing home who have their senses, they will inevitably say that they would love to go back to their homes if they were well enough. That is where they want to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> We have to acknowledge the great efforts of the home help people and the great work which they do. These carers are the finest people in the world. The attention and care they give to the elderly is wonderful. The elderly people really appreciate them, but the problem is that they do not get enough time to spend with the patients. That is sad. I will give the Minister of State an example. There was a man named Tim. The Minister of State talks about minutes. Tim needed an extra quarter of an hour in the morning and the same in the evening for a second home help provider to come in and help the family member or the other home help person. He was refused that, but there was no problem in the world with getting him into a nursing home and getting the fair deal scheme to cover it even though the cost was much greater. It was the same person in either case, but that man was happier in his own home. Once he was helped out of bed, put sitting near the fire and had everything laid on for him, he would manage for the rest of the day. It is sad to think that we could not get the extra few minutes for him for whatever reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_973"> There is something wrong in Kerry. We do not seem to have enough funding. I will give the Minister of State an example of another woman. She was in Cork University Hospital. I have spoken about boundaries today. One of our parishes is divided between Cork and Kerry. Half of it is in Cork, half is in Kerry. The people in the hospital said that she would get 20 hours a week home help but when they found out that she lived in Kerry, they said she would only get ten. How could that be?</p>

          <p eId="para_978">It badly hurt many people that the Minister a couple of weeks ago said that elderly people were going to be means-tested for home help. That is shameful and disgraceful when a proper service is not currently being provided. Many people only get a half an hour of home help in the morning and the same in the evening, amounting to five hours per week. Such people do not receive any assistance at weekends or bank holidays and definitely will not get any on Christmas Day. They have to pay for private home help, which means that they are using up their pensions and have to get help from family members. That is the truth of what is happening in Kerry. It is not fair. Members know that some HSE officials receive huge salaries. It is not fair that the Government is thinking of means-testing sick and elderly people whose home help provision has been cut to minutes. We are asking that in certain cases where people need more home help and the fair deal scheme is an option, some of the money allocated to the fair deal should instead be used to provide proper care for them at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> I want to particularly thank day care services. There is a wonderful such service in Rockmount in Kilgarvan, another in Rathmore and more in other places, towns and villages in Kerry. Such organisations provide a great service. They pick up elderly people on a bus and bring them out for a few hours on three or four days each week. It means a huge amount to people and the family members caring for them that they can have a break.</p>
          <p eId="para_980"> As regards respite, there is a lovely new hospital in Kenmare which has only one respite bed for the entire area. Half of the beds in the hospital are not being used. Such situations need to be examined. I could talk for far longer but I am butting into someone else's time. Families are doing great work but we need to help and support them and that is why we have been elected to this House. Will the Minister of State listen to what is being said and to ensure that those people get recognition?</p>

        <speech by="#JimDaly" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health" eId="spk_374">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T21:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_981">I welcome the opportunity to address the House this evening and I am happy to say that the Government is not opposing the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> Recent research undertaken has shown that it is the preference of most older people to continue to live independently in their own homes and communities. That is confirmed by my experience of speaking to older people around the country and meeting with organisations which represent them. For that reason, I am strongly committed to ensuring that older people can continue to live in their own homes, surrounded by their family and friends, for as long as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> Home care services are central to achieving that objective. Such services help to reduce the level of inappropriate admission of older people to hospital and nursing homes as well as facilitating their timely discharge from hospitals. Although home care has traditionally been more associated with lower-level support than residential care, many older people with complex care needs are now being maintained at home. That shift increases demand for service provision that, because of our ageing population, will intensify in the decades to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> The increasing life expectancy of our citizens not only bears testimony to our social and economic progress but also represents an opportunity. Older people make a huge contribution to their families and to our society and economy. As emphasised by the national positive ageing strategy, if we are to reap the benefits of that enormous demographic bounty, it is incumbent on us to enable people to age with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. That is my responsibility as Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for older people and it has the support of Members on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> The Health Service Executive has responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home care and other community-based services for older people. The HSE’s home care services are provided on the basis of assessed health care need and no personal contribution towards the cost is required. Contrary to what Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, there is no proposal to means-test home help provision in its current form.</p>

          <p eId="para_990">There is no proposal by the Department or the HSE to means-test care.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> Significant resources are currently being invested in home care services. In 2017, the HSE will spend approximately €370 million on home care, with targets for the delivery of just over 10.5 million home help hours, almost 17,000 home care packages and 190 intensive home care packages co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies for clients with complex needs. The 2017 funding represents an increase of €27 million over that made available in 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> However, the Government is aware that those resources, while significant, are insufficient to meet the growing demand for home care and that that must urgently be addressed. Accordingly, an additional €41 million was made available for older people’s services in budget 2018. That allocation comprises €9 million once-off funding in 2017 and €32 million next year, a significant proportion of which will be allocated to home care services. Working within available resources, the HSE has sought to maintain and, where possible, expand the range and volume of services available to support people to remain in their own homes. Private and voluntary sector providers play an important role in that service delivery, complementing the work of staff employed directly by the HSE to provide a flexible and responsive service.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> In addition, although home care is among the health and social care services for which there is currently no statutory regulation, the HSE is progressing a range of measures to improve home care provision overall, to standardise services nationally and to promote quality and safety. Those measures include a national procurement framework for home care services which provides a mechanism for quality assurance. It came into effect in 2012 and was again put out to tender in 2016. Within the framework, private and voluntary sector providers are also monitored through two-year service level agreements with the HSE. More broadly, home care service provision is monitored by the HSE on an ongoing basis relative both to the overall availability of resources and to individual clients' care needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> Home care service provision has developed over the years with a significant local focus and there is more variation than the Government wish there to be in the delivery of services across the country and at different times of the year. To help address that regional disparity, the HSE is in the process of implementing a standardised, comprehensive care needs assessment procedure across the country which will ensure consistency in the eligibility criteria applied for home care and long-term residential care. Following the completion of a pilot of that single assessment tool in May, national level implementation is now in progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> While the existing home care service is delivering crucial support to many people across the country, the Government recognises that it needs to be improved to better meet the changing needs of our citizens. In particular, I am very conscious that the current system relies heavily on family carers. That was movingly highlighted by the "Prime Time" programme last week. Carers play a crucial role in helping older people to continue to live in their own homes and they make a profound difference to the health, well-being and quality of life of those for whom they care. Carers also make an important and often unacknowledged contribution to the economy. That is reflected in the 2016 census results published last month, which indicated that approximately 195,000 carers are providing a minimum of 6.6 million hours of care per week.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> It is Government policy to recognise, respect and value the role of carers as key care partners. The national carers strategy was launched in 2012 to set the strategic direction for future policies, services and supports provided to carers by Departments and agencies. This is a whole-of-Government approach underpinning the reality that the needs of carers are many and must be met by many Departments. Carers require supports to help them to maintain their own health and well-being and to empower them to participate, where possible, in economic and social life.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> The Government's commitment to supporting carers was demonstrated earlier today when I, along with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, announced Government approval for additional funding to enable all carers in receipt of carer's allowance to qualify for a GP visit card.</p>

          <p eId="para_1004">-----and regulation of home care services which we will introduce will improve access to home care in an affordable and sustainable way. It will provide transparency about individuals' eligibility for services and about service allocation and ensure that the system operates consistently and fairly across the country. A system of regulation will be designed to ensure public confidence in the standard of the services provided and to bring Ireland in line with best international practice. It will be important to get the balance right in this regard and to ensure that the system of regulation is effective and not overly bureaucratic. The new scheme will also result in more effective integration with other health supports, including nursing, therapies and other primary care services and will have consequent benefits for the family carers. The development of the scheme will be supportive of the complementary goals and objectives set out in the national carers' strategy, the national dementia strategy and the national positive ageing strategy. It will also align with the Sláintecare report. It is important to note that it is not only older people who may require home care services. This issue will be considered as we prepare proposals for the new scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> As an initial step in developing the new system, the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to undertake a review of the home care systems in place in four European countries. The review, published in April of this year, will help us to ensure that Ireland's new home care scheme and system of regulation is informed by international experience. In addition, in July the Minister, Deputy Harris, and I launched a public consultation on the financing and regulation of home care, which closed in October. The purpose of this public consultation was to enable us to find out more about the views of service users, their families and health care workers on current and future home care provision. We received more than 2,600 responses, and a report of the findings will be published early next year. These findings will help to inform the Department's development of the new funding scheme and regulatory arrangements. The process for determining the type of home care scheme and approach to regulation that is best for Ireland is complex. A significant amount of analysis is needed to develop policy proposals on the form of the home care scheme and the system of regulation that will apply to these services. It is important we take the time required to ensure that these measures will be successful, affordable and sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> Within the context of this ongoing work, this evening's debate is very welcome. I think everyone in the House will agree that, in addition to more resources for home care, we need to establish a funding and regulatory scheme that will ensure that, for generations to come, all our older people are supported to live independently at home for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. I look forward to working with Members on all sides of the House, as well as with other key stakeholders to advance this important initiative. I assure the House that I will be fully engaged in this process in the period to come and will work to ensure that the new scheme delivers the best possible outcomes for older people in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_1008">We are all now, thankfully, living longer, and most of us will live independently for the rest of our lives. Less than 5% of all the elderly require care late in life, and all parties agree that every effort should be made to facilitate this in so far as possible in the comfort and security of their own homes. Fianna Fáil believes that the funding allocated to enable older people to remain at home provides not only the best value for money, but also the most humane result for older people. Many thousands of families help their loved ones to stay at home when they are ill or very frail, and they receive very little assistance from the State. This needs to change, especially to deal with the growing challenges of dementia care. Fianna Fáil will support the Rural Independent Group's motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009"> I have had many discussions about this with the Minister of State. By 2040 there will be 1.4 million people in Ireland aged over 65, of whom 450,000 will be over 80. We all know that home helps, the people who work in this sector, are absolutely fantastic, and they are not paid a large amount. What many of the Deputies here will note is that the problem is not too bad from Monday to Friday because we are dependent on HSE staff. It is not always easy to get the correct package for one's patient or one's constituent, but once the package is allocated, nine times out of ten Monday to Friday seems to work pretty well. However, Saturday and Sunday can be a huge problem because we depend a lot on agency staff who do not get paid as much as the HSE staff, which we all realise. On top of that, not all agencies pay home care providers' travel expenses. This is particularly relevant for people living in rural areas. I dealt with such a case over the weekend in which someone is living 12 miles from Waterford city and the home care providers are only allocated a half an hour morning, midday and evening. However, it takes a half an hour to drive out to the house, a half an hour to give the service and a half an hour to drive back, and they do not get fuel allowance for this so they do not want to come out. I have found this to be a huge issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> I also draw the Minister of State's attention to the fact that over 63% of 55,000 people with dementia live at home. Every day, 11 people in this country are diagnosed with dementia, and this will not change. Unfortunately, another 11 people probably go undiagnosed. These people who live at home with dementia need supports and intensive packages. I welcome what the Minister of State said earlier, that a lot is being done but that more needs to happen, because on 30 September of this year only 139 intensive home care packages were in place. That is a dismal number when one considers that we have, as I said, 55,000 people with dementia, 63% of whom live at home and are looking for support from carers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> I have been doing quite a lot of work with the Alzheimer Society of Ireland. It is astonishing to learn that 58% of people who have dementia forget to eat, 54% forget that they have eaten and eat again, and 51% do not finish their meals. This is where the home care provider is so important. He or she comes in morning, lunchtime and evening, reminds the person living at home to eat his or her dinner, take his or her medication and, in some instances, go to the bathroom. These are small, simple things but they make all the difference for someone who can stay at home, have the wraparound supports he or she needs and be there with loved ones. These home care packages are a central part of community health care. They allow older people who may need assistance and support to stay in their homes rather than having to be treated in hospital, and as the motion quite rightly states, this is cost-effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> Before I finish, I wish to refer to the Bill that my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, introduced earlier in the year, the Nursing Home Support Scheme (Amendment) Bill. The Bill provides for people, instead of being allocated nursing homes under fair deal, to avail of the same hours in their home at a fraction of the cost. The Bill is waiting on a money message, and I appeal to the Minister of State to raise this with the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_1013">I commend Deputy Harty and his colleagues in the Rural Independent Group on putting forward this motion, which is extremely important. I know that our party spokesperson on older people, Deputy Mary Butler, has been doing lot of work in this area with different advocacy groups and highlighting to the Minister of State and to the Government the need to put additional resources into it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> All of us who are public representatives are very conscious of the importance of home support, home help and home care packages. In my own constituency work the one major concern I have had for a considerable time is the delays in the actual provision of the home care package or the home support following its initial approval. Far too often the HSE at local level must make decisions in a budgetary context, whereby the patient has been approved for home help or home support but the funding is not in place to provide it as soon as the patient needs it. Over the next few weeks, right until February or March, I am sure we will hear of overcrowding in emergency departments and be given figures concerning people who have been medically discharged but are still in acute hospital beds. In many instances, and we receive calls from the families of these people, the home care packages will not have been put in place, and we all know that caring for a person at home costs a fraction of keeping that person in an acute hospital bed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The lack of provision has an additional adverse impact in that it causes delays for other people seeking to access acute hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> The only way we will ever have a reasonable level of provision is if home support funding is provided on a demand-led basis. When a patient is medically approved as needing that support, it must be put in place. Health Service Executive officials at local level, public health nurses and administrators should not have to juggle plates to ensure the budget is not exceeded. If a person is deemed to require home help, he or she should not have to wait weeks to receive it, with the resultant cost elsewhere in the health service. We get very good value for money from the people who provide home care packages. As Deputy Butler said, they go way beyond the call of duty. People want to remain in their own homes and that is where the best care can be provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_1017">I commend my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group on using their Private Members' time to debate this issue. Last week at the Committee of Public Accounts, we had the pleasure of hearing from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. Having asked the same question on several occasions in this House and before that in the Seanad, I again queried whether any research had been done on the potential benefit of loosening or relaxing the means test for the carer's allowance, which, together with the provision of a medical card, some home help hours and perhaps a housing adaptation grant, might help to afford people the dignity of staying at home and avoid the necessity of paying out an average of €1,000 per week in fair deal costs or €1,000 per day for an acute bed. Remarkably, as is so often the case, the impermeable walls between Departments, much like the pigeon holes in Leinster House reception, are such that nobody speaks to anybody else. The answer from Mr. McKeon was no, the matter had never been investigated. An official from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who was in attendance at the same meeting confirmed that the matter had not been looked into by that Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> Instead of talking to each other in this House and making all the right sounds superficially about what could, should and might be done, will the Minister of State bring together the Secretaries General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Health to examine whether a relaxation of the means test for the carer's allowance, together with the provision of some additional supports, would result in an overall saving for the State? My expectation is that we could save a great deal by taking that approach, which would additionally have the great advantage of allowing people the dignity of remaining in their own home in later life. Will the Minister of State speak to the Secretary General in his Department to see whether such a consultation may be commenced? I understand there is some type of management administration system whereby the Secretaries General of the various Departments get together from time to time. Perhaps they just have coffee, but as I learned last week, they certainly do not discuss a cross-departmental approach to schemes like this. Will the Minister of State be the pioneering person who takes the initiative and knocks a few heads together to see whether the approach I have outlined can be made to work and what savings it might produce?</p>

          <from>Deputy Niamh Smyth<recordedTime time="2017-12-12T21:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1019">A June 2016 report on home care provision by the Irish Association of Social Workers, Age Action Ireland, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and University College Dublin's school of social policy, social work and social justice was a timely study and a welcome contribution to the debate on how best to care for older people. We have heard numerous reports of people finding it difficult to access adequate home care. It is important that we understand why this is the case and what can be done to resolve it. Fianna Fáil is of the view that the funding allocated to enable older people to remain at home not only serves to provide the most comforting and dignified type of care but also offers the best value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> In 2015, the HSE estimated that some 2.2 million extra hours of home help and a further 3,500 home care packages for older people are required. Unfortunately, those additional resources were not provided for in the 2016 service plan. The programme for Government includes a commitment to increase home care packages and hours, but we are concerned at the lack of detail as to how that commitment will be delivered. The June 2016 report to which I referred clearly highlights the inconsistencies between the various local health areas when it comes to the availability of home care. That inequality of provision must be addressed as a matter of urgency. It is unacceptable that there are so many inconsistencies in the system, with older people missing out on home care simply because of the area in which they live.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> Real progress in meeting the challenge associated with this area of health care provision must be made during the lifetime of this Dáil. Home care is the preferred option for older people and it is well recognised that such provision helps to keep people active in their communities, which in turn brings enormous health benefits. Every Deputy has had people coming into constituency clinics whose situations were transformed after being allocated home help hours and home care packages. It is wonderful to see. We are all agreed that caring for older people in their homes is the best form of care we can provide and the most cost-effective for the State. As Deputy Butler pointed out, it is of particular benefit for patients who suffer with dementia to be cared for in their familiar surroundings and by their own family. I understood that in Cavan-Monaghan, somebody has to die before the staff are made available to care for people at home. Home care hours are allocated but the staff are not there to deliver the package. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure sufficient staff are in place to enable home care packages to be activated and facilitate people to access the service immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">I commend the Deputies in the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward this motion in Private Members' time. I thank my colleague, Deputy Butler, for the work she has done on this issue. The way in which we look after older people and the degree to which we facilitate them to live longer in their own homes will determine the quality of our society. These are issues that matter greatly and have a direct impact on people's lives. Fortunately, we are now living longer and most of us will live independently for the rest of our lives. Fewer than 5% of the population will require care late in life and every effort should be made to accommodate them in the comfort and security of their own homes. Home care provision is the most cost-effective way for the State to honour its responsibility to older people. Of far greater importance, it also results in the best outcome for the people concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> Currently, older people and their families have two options. They can avail of a fair deal package, which is available on a statutory basis, or they can seek to access a home care package, which, unfortunately, is discretionary and, in many cases, grossly inadequate. It makes sense for all concerned that home care provision be placed on the same statutory footing as the fair deal scheme. As things stand, the home care package regime is not patient-driven and there are significant geographical disparities in the availability of services. Often it depends on where a person happens to live as to whether he or she may avail of home-based care. In my own county of Tipperary, due to a lack of qualified home carers in the area, there is little or no service available. Families have no choice but to look to the fair deal scheme far sooner than is necessary. Moreover, there is no transparency regarding eligibility criteria and the decision-making process, with such matters entirely at the discretion of the health service. As a result, many infirm older people have little choice but to opt for nursing home care, at a far greater cost to the Exchequer. Day care centres and respite care are likewise extremely important for elderly people. Respite care gives families who are looking after a person on a home care package a break of one or two weeks, which is vital for the long-term well-being of the persons carrying out the care. Day care centres, too, provide an invaluable service and must be properly funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> In 2015, the Health Service Executive estimated that an additional 2.2 million hours of home help and a further 3,500 home care packages for older people are required. There was no provision for that in the service plan for 2016. Those additional resources must be provided for older people.</p>

          <p eId="para_1025">I join colleagues in thanking the Rural Independent Group Deputies for bringing forward this important motion, which I expect to attract cross-party support. It is an issue all Deputies encounter in their clinics and often in their own lives. My grandmother went through a prolonged period of availing of home care before spending time in hospital prior to her death. She would have liked to go back home at the end but that, unfortunately, was not possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">It is a very real issue that affects people in our constituencies and lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027"> As policy makers, we know that we have to deal with the challenges posed by an ageing population. We see it in every aspect, from pensions, health insurance through to planning. We also know that the ESRI's report in projecting forward to 2030 shows that the population is expected to increase by between 600,000 and 1.1 million and that within this population increase the share of people aged over 65 years is expected to go from one in eight to one in six. The number aged 85 years and over is expected to double, while the number living longer and healthier lives is growing rapidly. This is hugely positive for all of us, but, as policy makers, we have to be able to address this issue in terms of service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028"> I will comment on some of the points made within the motion. There is a note about the increasing privatisation of home help and community care services. We increasingly hear advertisements on radio placed by various providers offering different packages. I will not make any comment on the efficacy or usefulness of any of the providers, as they could be very good or bad. I do not know, but I do know that the proliferation of such adverts and services demonstrates that the public service is not working. I also know - it does not take a genius to figure it out - that one must be able to afford to avail of private services, as many cannot do. That is an immediate indication of inequality in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029"> We often tend to take for granted that people in a family are helping out in caring. I have seen this in cases in my constituency. Often the State takes it for granted and it may not place the same store on this work, in a monetary and every other sense, but people can be caught in that bind where they are often sacrificing careers and other relationships to care for an elderly family member and not being recognised by the State for doing so. It strikes me that it is imperative the scheme is recognised in law on a statutory basis, like the fair deal scheme, in order that people could avail of what should be an automatic right. Currently, the scheme is discretionary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030"> Statistics tell us that 10% of people have an unmet need and cannot avail of services. I stress that the figure is probably much higher. Because so many know that they will not be able to avail of the service, they just do not apply. As a consequence, the 10% figure could actually be a lot higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031"> I will conclude on a local note. An exemplar in the care of older people is McAuley Place in Naas where Margharita Solon and her team run a fantastic operation. When the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Helen McEntee, was in office, she came to visit the centre. I was there on the day she came to inspect the facility. To the Minister of State and everyone else in the House who has an interest in this area, McAuley Place in Naas is an exemplar on a national scale when it comes to how to do this; older people are living fulfilled lives with dignity and independence, with the services they need on their doorstep to support them at that stage of their lives.</p>

          <p eId="para_1032">I propose to share my time with Deputies Pat Buckley and Martin Kenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> I commend the members of the Rural Independent Group for bringing forward the motion which I believe is extremely important. It is good that we are talking about the issue. I have had occasion to see on a number of levels the operation of the home help service in action. I have represented home helps for many years. It is not true to say HSE home helps will not work at weekends, as has been suggested. They will work at weekends; they want to work at weekends and are only too happy to work outside normal hours because they do not offer just a nine-to-five service. We would like to see the Government funding this service and not running to the private sector to provide it. The fact that there are advertisements on radio placed by private services does not indicate that the public services are failing, rather it indicates that the Government favours private providers, from which we do not see value for money or a good return on the investment made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> I also had occasion to see the home help service work in the case of my uncle Bernard. I call him my uncle, but he was just one of the people to whom I was very close and he passed away on Sunday. He had Parkinson's disease and his home help, literally, was a lifeline. Like everybody else, he had to fight for every single hour and minute of home help he received. Our medical and health professionals and scientists are enabling people to live longer, which is really good and positive. Unfortunately, the efforts of the scientists and doctors have not been matched on the political side in coming up with solutions to help people to stay in their own homes. We need to plan for a society that is ageing. To do this we need help and an input from experts and stakeholders in the field. We also need to listen to home helps. Very often I hear people say they cannot get a home help to work at certain hours or in certain circumstances. That is not the case. I have never worked with a more flexible group of workers. They provide a huge amount of care and we are going to need to rely on these services more. We can see that the number over the age of 65 years has increased by 19.1% to 637,567 since 2j011. There was also a 15.6% increase in the number over the age of 85 years. It is fantastic and I hope we will all get to live to a good age, but, unfortunately, the default position of successive Governments has been to allow carers, families and loved ones to carry the can. Today one in 20 people is a family carer. Collectively, they provide unpaid care worth a staggering €10 billion each year. When people have come to meet me, I have told them that if there was a carers' strike, Ireland would grind to a halt. Of course, they do not strike as they are busy just getting on with it. We need to ensure we will plan to have services available and that we will look at the demographic evidence to see what services will be needed in the future. We also need to talk to older people, the people who need a hand and supports, to ask them what they want. That is why it is important that home help and home care packages are provided on a statutory basis. It would mean that people could count on availing of the service as a right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035"> My uncle Bernard worked hard all of his life. He was my father's best friend and they first met 57 years ago when they worked at Cahill May Roberts. He was a driver and my father a van boy. They worked every single day of their lives and paid tax. At the end, when Bernard was sick, he had to fight again for a home help service in order that he could be at home and live with a little dignity. The statistics are all moving in the one direction. Ireland has an ageing population, which is a positive development, but we need to put and secure in place the right to a home care package and to remain in one's own home and the dignity it gives.</p>

          <p eId="para_1036">It is hard to believe there are more than 195,000 carers in the State, but it is more worrying that more than 29,000 of these carers are over the age of 65 years and that more than 3,500 are under the age of 15. My mother worked as a carer for over 30 years and, with other carers, knows the importance of providing care for older people in their own home. It offers them respect and gives them security. It also gives them back their sense of independence. That is the reason Sinn Féin is committed to ensuring older people can live with the dignity and respect they deserve, but it is not only older people who need our help. While many with a disability are able to live their lives the way they choose, many of them require some level of care at times and cannot be excluded. Despite the need for an increased number of care hours, it is worrying that budget 2018 included no commitment to increasing the number of personal assistance hours or respite care services. Last week I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health which was subsequently referred to the HSE. I asked the Department what its plans were to ensure Fermoy Community Hospital would remain open and be resourced adequately to meet needs in the area. The hospital was facing the loss of 14 respite beds because of staffing issues. The problem has been averted but only temporarily. We must invest in services for our ageing population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037"> A home care package gives an individual dignity. It also promotes positive mental well-being and instils self-worth and self-pride. We must, however, also give care givers as much support as we can. I commend the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward the motion as we must support the 118,000 female care givers and the 77,000 male care givers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> We need a social care service with equal access for all based on their needs and to the greatest extent that resources allow.</p>

          <p eId="para_1039">I commend the Rural Independents Group for putting down this motion this evening. All of us are conscious in all our constituencies of people who are waiting and trying to get home care packages, people waiting for home help hours and the fight and struggle that goes on. I am sure that it is the same everywhere, including for the Minister of State, that when one contacts whoever is sorting out those hours in the constituency, one is told that they have a few more hours available than was the case last year but demand has grown. This is a problem that we have. Demand keeps growing because our elderly population are, naturally, in need of some more care as more people fall into the category. It is not that we did not know it was going to happen. We have the statistics. There is a statistics office that knows the age of everybody and has a fair idea of the trends. Unfortunately, we do not seem to have planned for this or worked out how to resolve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040"> I am always struck by the cost-benefit analysis of this matter. Money spent on home care packages or on providing home help to people is the best money that the Government could spend on the health service. First, it employs people at the coal-face to do work and put money back into the community, usually the same community as the person who is getting the care. Second, it ensures that person will stay out of hospital and longer term care which is much more expensive for the public. </p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> There were references to the privatisation of provision of elder care and home care packages. It is something I find happening all the time. I came across a person recently who was looking to have home help hours increased. They were told that they could be given so many hours a week but the levels had been cut the previous month and if they wanted to get their hours back to the same level, they would have to get a company to provide the service and they would have to pay for it themselves. That is well and good for some people but many people do not have the resources to do that. The Government should not allow a situation to develop where a package of care is set in place, and then to put pressure on people to pay for it, the hours are withdrawn forcing people to pay for it themselves. That is happening in too many cases across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> The Government must realise that money spent on elder care is the best spent money possible. Somewhere in the highest echelons of the HSE, someone needs to turn on the light and realise that if the money is spent on home care, it will save triple or four times that somewhere else. Unfortunately, that message is not getting through. </p>
          <p eId="para_1043"> There was an announcement today on respite, which is not a dissimilar topic. RTÉ recently broadcast a "Prime Time" programme which exposed the position regarding respite care. It is a terrible indictment of this Government if this is the only way to get money to people in need is to have exposés on the matter on television with "Prime Time". We need to step up and ensure that the money is spent in the right place, and then it will be saved elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_1044">I congratulate Deputy Harty and his colleagues on bringing this motion before the House, and for his opening statement where he placed his emphasis on the delivery of this service through the public system. I welcome that. I welcome the Government's confirmation that it is accepting the motion. It is positive, but it prompts the question of why this proposal was not brought forward by the previous Government, with its overwhelming majority, given the cost effective nature of the proposal. It gives the lie to the constant mantra that this Dáil is paralysed. This is a good example of the new politics working and making a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> Our population, while relatively young compared with other European countries, is still ageing. Figures have been quoted tonight of 637,567 aged over 65 years. Over a quarter of those live alone and independently. That is 100,000 more people than were aged 65 years in 2011. The significant increase in the numbers aged over 65 years, and over 85 years, which is some 68,000, requires careful planning and investment. The lack of an integrated service, poor transport, disconnectivity and inappropriate housing is actively leading to unnecessary admissions to long-term care and into hospitals. These admissions are completely preventable. What is needed is quality support to enable people to remain in their own home which is the key and in line with what people want. Most importantly, it is the most cost-effective policy which any sensible Government would have pursued long ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> Unfortunately that has not happened. Approximately 60% of the current budget for the provision of services for older people, around €1.7 billion, is spent on long-term residential care. That is 80% to 20% going into private, for profit institutions. Only around 4% of people over 65 years live in long-term residential care. The reality therefore, which has never been discussed, is that 96% of people over 65 years do not live in long-term residential settings and, most importantly, do not wish to. They want to be involved in the decision-making process as to how they will spend their lives, and to be part of the democratic process. From replies to parliamentary questions by myself and other Deputies, we know that in practice home care packages and home help hours have been reduced significantly and are fewer than they were in 2008. Home care packages have increased but the net increase is not an increase because the demand is higher than what has been provided. </p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> The lack of a proper service to help people to remain in their own homes adds to the acute crisis in our hospitals. It leads to delayed discharges and admissions. Responses to my parliamentary questions echo what many Deputies have said this evening, that families are fighting tooth and nail to the most basic home care package. There are people who have suffered a stroke or other serious illness who want to go home, their families want to take them home and they face a battle of only getting ten hours, for instance. If they fight or they go to a Deputy they might get more, but then again they might not. That is the level of what is happening on the ground. </p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> It has been said already that what is needed is a statutory entitlement to home care. It will require increased spending but only in the short term. In the long term, it will save the State money and lead to a healthier population in that age group. More respite care is also needed. We need extra investment in community nursing home facilities. I have been told a figure of 80% to 20% for private care which does not represent a balanced market. We need long-term planning and investment given the significant demographic changes. </p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> Deputy MacSharry has said that he raised the following matter, and I raised it subsequently last week at the Committee of Public Accounts. The Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection had not considered that it might be more cost effective to look at the domiciliary care allowance, the carer's allowance and providing home care packages and to do a cost-benefit analysis of it compared to the cost of long-term residential care which is approaching €1 billion. It was just under €1 billion in 2017, and that was catering for only approximately 23,000. If one looks at all the other packages, for much less money they provide care for an extraordinary proportion of the population. It came as a surprise to Deputy MacSharry and I that this had not even been considered and that across Departments, they might look at more cost-effective ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050"> Finally, I will be parochial. All this makes perfect sense and the Minister has nodded many times to speakers tonight. However, there seems to be a disconnect, or a cognitive dissonance, between what people want and what public representatives say in the Dáil on their behalf, and what the HSE is actually doing on the ground. I lár na Gaeltachta, sa Spidéal i nGaillimh, tá dream agus níl siad in ann aon áit a fháil chun cruinniú a bheith acu i lár na Gaeltachta. A group, the average age of whose members is 80, is not allowed to meet in a premises owned by the HSE which, for over a year and a half, has remained empty. On the one hand the HSE gives the group a grant but on the other it refuses to facilitate them in a building it owns. This leaves us having to write lots of letters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051"> I support this motion in a general way but I have one reservation over the fact that it is to be done on the basis of the fair deal scheme. I believe fair deal is really "unfair deal" and I would be most unhappy if we went down that road. However, I certainly agree with the sentiment of the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1057">They are pedantic. I will get it right the next time. I commend them on the bulk of their motion but there are certain things with which I do not agree, though they are for another day. Having worked as a care assistant for the past 16 years of my life, and for five years as a home care worker before I came in here, I understand the vital importance of home care work, not only for the worker but for the patients and their families. Whether they are convalescing at a hospital from long-term illness or coming to the end of their life, it is vital to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058"> Millions upon millions of hours - some 10 million - were cut from home care packages over the past ten years, by the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. Fewer people got a home care package in 2015 than in 2008. A total of 2.24 million fewer hours were delivered and this has had a hugely detrimental effect on people's well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059"> I am surprised that nobody has pointed out that, at this moment, 75,000 people are trying to avail of home care packages but only 21,000 are actually availing them. That means a huge gap of 50,000 people. I personally know families in extremely difficult circumstances who would beg public health nurses and doctors for their loved ones to come back home but they cannot provide the service, which has a knock-on effect as these people do not want to be in hospital but want to be at home with their loved ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060"> There are 50 for-profit home care providers and it is an extremely lucrative business. Most workers are paid between €9 and €11 per hour but the private company charges the HSE double that amount. It is profitable but not efficient from the point of view of the taxpayer. There are many people who are now reaching an older age and who want to be cared for in their home environment rather than in a hospital and it is more cost-effective to do so. One does not want to depict a doomsday scenario of the health services because some amazing people work in the service, such as doctors, care assistants, auxiliary and office staff but there is a two-tier health care system and, like under apartheid, if one has money one can get the best but in the public health system one has to wait and sometimes to beg.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061"> According to the Irish Nurses and Midwives Association, 526 patients are on trolleys today. People do not want to be outpatients or in hospitals but want to come home so we support this motion. Hopefully, it can be addressed in a fundamental way, unlike previously.</p>

          <p eId="para_1063">I thank Deputy Harty and the other members of our group and I thank David, Mairead, Mairin, Tríona and all in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office for their diligent work in bringing forward this motion. The Government parties, the Opposition parties, namely, Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin, and the Independents all agree with what we are saying and the only reason they are doing that is that we are right. There has to be recognition of the great work being done in caring for our people at home. We are all aware of the fair deal package and I wish to acknowledge the great work done by our community hospitals and local nursing homes, which take great care of elderly people, people with dementia of different forms and people who cannot exist at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> In the past, Ministers thought it was a good idea to close down our community hospitals such as those in County Kerry like Killarney Community Hospital, Kenmare Community Hospital and Caherciveen Community Hospital, and a couple of hospitals in west Cork. Everybody knows now that we could not do without our community hospitals and I am proud of the fact that our father, Jackie Healy-Rae, as chairman of the Southern Health Board, took on the Minister of the time and highlighted the fact that it was outrageous and nonsensical. He was proved right over time and it was right to keep our community hospitals open because they provide an invaluable service. Our nursing homes also provide great care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> We are suggesting how funding should be allocated to support people who want to remain in their own homes. Every person's dear wish would be to stay at home, whatever else happens, because there is no place like one's own humble home as people like us, who spend a lot of time away from home, know very well. We are all the same and we would all like to be in our own old corner.</p>

When I say "we" I mean we as public representatives collectively, which is why I am so proud of and gladdened by the Government and the Opposition this evening, that we are all united on what we are suggesting. I again thank Deputy Harty in particular because we have great politicians in our group, but Deputy Harty is our doctor. Not many groups have their own personal doctor, but we do.</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">I am disappointed my colleague from south-west Cork, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, left just before I was to speak on health issues, because he could relate to a lot of the difficult issues for many people in the constituency. I am delighted to be able to bring forward this motion this evening, along with my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group, and I thank Mairéad in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office, and any other person who has given assistance in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075"> This morning on Leaders' Questions, I again raised with the Taoiseach the issue of waiting lists with opthamologists in the HSE, and the HSE's failure to provide urgent operations for people throughout the country, especially cataract operations. The Minister of State and I know this is not the only failing of the HSE. As my colleagues said earlier this evening, there is a huge crisis in home care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076"> The entire health care system is quite questionable. As recently as ten minutes ago, I received a call from a lady in Kinsale who has serious cancer and requires urgent treatment. She attended a clinic this morning expecting to be seen, but was turned away and told to come back on 27 December. This is appalling treatment of a human being who is suffering severely. It is a question that goes right to the core of our political system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077"> As recently as yesterday, I met a man in my constituency whose elderly mother was unable to avail of any home care, despite her age and frail demeanour. This person requires constant care and her family is able to provide only so much. They have been refused any sort of home help hours to date. In this motion, we call for the home care packages scheme to be established into law in order to allow everyone an automatic right to the services within the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078"> The increased privatisation of community care in this country is a clear indication that the public system is not working for people. Last week, the country watched in horror at the RTÉ "Prime Time" carers in crisis programme. We saw that thousands of people all over the country spend virtually their entire lives looking after loved ones who are unable to care for themselves. In many cases the carers suffer ill health themselves. Census 2016 recorded a 35% increase in the number of carers who are aged 85 and over. Carers provide more than 6.5 million hours of care per week. On average, carers care for their loved ones for almost the equivalent of a full 40-hour working week. Almost 9% provide full-time 24-hour unpaid care, with no real break at all. This is an outrageous attack on our elderly, and nothing short of abuse of the people who are caring for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1079"> What needs to happen here is on the first day that it is proven through medical evidence that a loved one requires care, a social welfare payment should be made to the carer. This would totally cut out the shambolic carry-on of leaving a carer five, six or seven months without a payment, which is nothing short of outrageous. Would the people whose job it is to apply the carer's allowance wait six months for their wages to come through? I highly doubt it, and we would not want them to do so, but we stand idly by as politicians and allow this to happen to people who are dedicated to their job and who, in many cases, work 24-7.</p>
          <p eId="para_1080"> In recent months, works have been completed in Bandon Community Hospital for the elderly. These cost millions of euro, and much was funded by the local community. As of yet, the new facility remains closed, and many people are unable to get respite care in Bandon hospital at this time. In spite of my efforts, I have been pushed from one Minister to another in seeking an answer, which no one can give me. The greater Bandon community is left dismayed. Who is in charge of the health service?</p>
          <p eId="para_1081"> Our carers do wonderful work, but they are hugely stretched and unable to receive any respite care for themselves. Our motion also calls for the Government and the Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly to increase home help hours to ensure that an efficient service can be provided to more older people. In addition to this, the fair deal scheme is, ironically, the most unfair scheme that has existed in this health service. People who have worked tirelessly all of their lives, simply put, are being robbed of all they have through this system. People all over west Cork with loved ones in community hospitals and nursing homes are contemplating selling their homes, or else taking their loved ones home to die, due to the exorbitant costs they face in this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1082"> Bus loads will leave west Cork over the coming weeks to avail of cataract operations in the North. This is a simple failure towards the elderly people of this island, those people who, as I stated, worked hard and paid their taxes. This country would rather let them go blind than resolve a crisis that affects 8,000 elderly people. The very simple solution would be to open up surgical theatres throughout the country, such as that in Bantry General Hospital, and get the procedures carried out in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1083"> Ireland has an ageing population, and 30% of the population will be aged over 65 by 2030. This raises significant challenges and opportunities for Irish society and, in particular, for the health service, as it is in crisis now and it looks to be worsening. I cannot imagine how it might be in ten years if we do not begin to change this.</p>

          <p eId="para_1084">I thank all of the Deputies for a very worthwhile debate on this very important matter. It is clear from the comments tonight that there is agreement on the need for reform of home care services and the development of a new statutory home care scheme. I see examples of this in my constituency of Wexford.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> It is one of the great success stories of our age that so many more people are living for so much longer. The success achieved in recent decades in improving health and extending life expectancy should be acknowledged and celebrated. However, without doubt, our ageing population poses significant challenges that need to be recognised and addressed across a wide range of areas. Each contributor this evening has definitely highlighted this. This includes ensuring the best possible health and social services are in place to meet the changing needs of people as they age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086"> It is important that society supports us all as we age, and that when it is needed, access is provided to high-quality health and care services and supports, from primary care through to acute care, community, residential and end-of-life care. Most of the Deputies who contributed from all sides of the House have highlighted some of the greatest examples of the care available to each and every one of our ageing population, including our relatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087"> Our health care system must acknowledge that older people, by and large, prefer to stay in their own homes, as Deputy Michael Healy-Rae highlighted, for as long as they can. As the House heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, earlier, we are already looking at how this can be facilitated and supported. Everyone understands and agrees there is no quick fix for this situation. It is critical that the appropriate supports are in place to match each person's needs at whatever point he or she is at in his or her interaction with the health care system. This means providing a range of flexible supports, including better home supports, increased use of technology, supported living models and quality residential care, both short and long-term stay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> The future of home care services affects us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1089">As the national positive ageing strategy emphasises, ageing is a lifelong process that does not start at 65 years of age. We all have a responsibility, as individuals and collectively, to ensure that Irish society is age friendly and that Ireland is a good country in which to grow older.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090"> I assure Members that the development of the new home care scheme is being advanced by the Department of Health as a priority. However, Members will appreciate that the development of policy proposals and the legislation to underpin them is a complex undertaking. It is ambitious in its scope and we owe it to future generations to get it right. When one does something one must do it right so one need not revisit it to correct it. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has targeted enactment of the required legislation within two to three years. While this timeframe is ambitious, the concern for many is that it will be far too long. Our older people need assistance now, as a matter of urgency. Therefore, I wish to reassure Members that the Government is committed to increasing funding for home care in the coming years, as recommended in the Sláintecare report. The Department of Health will work closely with the HSE to maximise the value of this investment. We are also particularly mindful of the need to support family and unpaid carers. I reaffirm the Government's commitment to the national carers strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091"> I welcome this opportunity to assure the House of the Government's commitment to bring about real and substantial improvement in the provision of home care services. Everybody recognises the great assistance and care that family members give to elderly relatives and friends. It would be remiss of me not to recognise all of the carers as we enter the Christmas season. These people are on 24-hour duty and they deserve recognition. Most of the Deputies have mentioned that elderly people wish to stay in their own homes. They can do so only because of the family members and the care assistants who call to them often three or four times a day or if they are lucky enough to be in receipt of home care packages. Those people deserve recognition as we approach the holy season of Christmas. They are the real heroes who will continue to care for their relatives and friends. I see that in my constituency of Wexford, as other Members do in their communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1092"> I thank the Deputies for tabling this important motion. I assure them that this is receiving attention from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, and his officials.</p>

          <p eId="para_1093">I thank Deputy Harty and all the other people who helped with this, as well as my colleagues, Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, Grealish and Michael Collins, for their input and their contributions. I also thank all the other Deputies who spoke on the motion. I must lament that the Labour Party Members are as láthair arís, as are some of our friends in the Social Democrats and the Green Party. The Labour Party has abandoned the people of rural Ireland. Last week I said cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmaid, but cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre? One Deputy in my constituency is blowing every day about what he is doing for the people. It is all blunderbuss and he is firing blanks. I refer to Deputy Alan Kelly. He is not here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1094"> The Minister of State gives us thanks, but we do not want thanks. The carers do not want thanks either. They want solace, support and to be heard. Deputy Butler was talking to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, today. A simple solution is to ask for a seven-day weekly rotation in the HSE home help service. That would solve the issue of the weekends. It should not be rocket science. At the weekends and at times such as Christmas there is nobody, and that is not good enough. This motion was tabled in an effort to coerce the Government to act on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> We tabled a motion over a year ago, in November 2016, regarding the fair deal and the unfair deal that farmers and the self-employed are getting. Tá an tAire from west Cork imithe anois but he is due to meet Maura Canning and her group from the wonderful committee in the IFA tomorrow. I hope he has good news for them because he has met them several times. He tells them that he is waiting to hear from the Attorney General. When we seek to cut something we do not have to consult the Attorney General. However, when we have cut something and we wish to reintroduce it we must consult the team in the Office of the Attorney General. That is the case with the motorised transport grant that was cut five years ago. When Deputy Finian the hero McGrath was on this side of the House he was a great man, but he is doing sweet bugger all to reintroduce that. We are also waiting for the HSE. It is a total mockery and shenanigans of the highest order. The people can see through that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096"> There are 55,000 people with dementia in this country. There are 129 home care packages for that number of people. It is an absolute insult. We know what we are waiting for in respect of the fair deal. The Carers Association and many other groups are doing Trojan work, yet we make them pay VAT on any equipment they buy. A commitment in the budget to return the VAT was strongly sought by our group in the talks on forming a Government. This is money from people's pockets on which they have already paid their tax. They give it voluntarily so we should not even dream of having VAT on those items.</p>
          <p eId="para_1097"> There are 70,000 people seeking a home care package and 50,000 have been left without one. Any modern, self-respecting democracy would not allow this to continue. The budget for the HSE has grown to €16 billion this year and I am sure it will be well over that in next year's budget, but we get fewer outcomes and less ordinary service. The people we are discussing are the people who worked hard and tirelessly to educate their families and to do everything else over the decades. Now they are in ill health. That might be only around the corner for some of us. It could happen any day. We do not know. We are all approaching that era. There are also young people who are sick for different reasons. However, we cannot assist the enablers who do this work. Instead, we persecute them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1098"> On the other hand, private agencies have been established. Somebody said that there are up to 50 private agencies. I did not think there were so many, but it is a large number. Many of them have been set up by former and retired HSE officials, which is a scandal. There should be a moratorium whereby when people leave the HSE or the public service, they cannot set up private businesses on the following day or have the business established before they leave. That is morally and financially bereft of decency and it must be stopped. It is happening in the planning area as well, whereby people are consultants before they leave and retire. We must break that cycle and the grip they have on the handlebars of power in this country. It is not allowing ordinary people to give solace and support to their families with a modicum of dignity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099"> They can see the money they can charge in this area from within the HSE. They can see there is manna from heaven if they set up such a company when they retire with their package. Home helps are paid €11 per hour at best. It could be €9 or €10 per hour for a few miserly hours. They might only be given 40 minutes and some have been cut down to 30 minutes. They would only have arrived in the house. These are not clinical people who just wish to get in and out. These people are interested and passionate. They have made a career of caring for people. They wish to come into the house, meet and greet, light the fire, cook the breakfast and do whatever necessary, delicate work is required, which many of us would not like to think about, with the patient or the people for whom they are caring. It is valuable work. We are continually cutting their hours and giving them so few hours that they are going around in a spin. We pay them €9 or €10 per hour, yet we pay up to €25 per hour to the private companies which, in turn, only pay up to a maximum of €11 per hour to their employees. Who is getting the rest? I am not a mathematician but I do not need to be to calculate that. It is going into the pockets of the many people who set up companies and who worked in the HSE. They failed the country when they were in the HSE and did not deliver. They were not public servants. Some of them have become self-serving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100"> There are many good officials and workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1101">In particular, I salute the people on the ground, who include the community welfare officers and district nurses, but they are so busy with paperwork and regulations, of which we got more today from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, that they barely have time to see patients because they are writing report after report. I salute all those people and the managers of the home help service who do their best to distribute the little they have. </p>
          <p eId="para_1102"> I will provide some figures relating to carers. Family carersprovide more than six million hours of unpaid care every week, saving the State approximately €4 billion annually according to the charity Family Carers Ireland. In an article<i>
						</i>in<i> IrishHealth.com</i>, Deborah Condon stated: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1103">According to the charity, almost 200,000 family carers in Ireland provide 6,287,510 hours of unpaid care every week, ‘yet despite the enormity of this contribution, family carers are struggling'. It noted that since 2009, there has been a €2.7 billion cut in health and social care spending and this has led to a reduction in vital services, such as respite, home care and residential services. </p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The article went to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1105">"Their work saves the State €4 billion each year. Despite this contribution, many carers find it more and more difficult to get respite and access services. Isolation, financial hardship, depression, stress, poor health and exclusion from paid work remain hallmarks of many carers' lives," explained Catherine Cox of Family Carers. She insisted that because of Ireland's ageing population, care in the home 'is one of the biggest health service issues facing the incoming government'. "We are asking politicians to commit to investing in and implementing real supports for family carers that fit with the realities of caring in Ireland today," she said. </p>
          <p eId="para_1106">This is the reality. We paid much homage to the carers' strategy for years. Another report is gathering dust, which is totally unacceptable. The Tipperary branch of Family Carers Ireland found that carers provide a staggering 256,120 hours of care per week. This breaks down to an average of 42.1 hours per carer per week. These statistics, which have been provided by the CSO, not the carers, serve only to confirm the heroic efforts that are being made each and every day of the week by the carers of County Tipperary. The findings also record that 7,041 people stated that they provided regular unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability and that this comprised 4.4% of the county's population in April 2016. Of the carers in the county, 4,225, or 60%, were female while 2,816, or 40%, were male. What is deeply concerning, however, is the finding that there were 138 carers aged under 15 years. This demands immediate examination. </p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> The Minister of State has accepted the motion. This is not good enough for us in the Rural Independent Group. We want this implemented. We are not going to wait like we waited since last November for the fair deal package. We want it done now. We will hold a press conference tomorrow on the plinth of Leinster House to announce this to fight for this vital support and some modicum of decency for these people in their homes. They are Trojan people. </p>
          <p eId="para_1108"> I want to mention day care centres, of which there are many across my county from Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel to Fethard to Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary town, Nenagh, Templemore and Thurles. The Government tried to screw them in the budget regarding VRT and the VAT they get back on their buses, buses which they need. The Government wants everyone to be out on a limb. The Government is made up of a callous and cold crowd. It should get the HSE by the scruff - the CEO, Tony O'Brien, and others - and bring them in to hold them to account. They are not serving the people. They are not looking after the ordinary people who need services. The Taoiseach had the cheek this morning to say that GPs should keep two patients a week out of accident and emergency departments. What is he going to do? They have no care at home. If we looked after them at home and enabled them to be kept at home, the accident and emergency departments would not be half as busy. There are more than 560 people on trolleys. Is that a modern Ireland for which the people of 1916 fought. I am almost finished and I appreciate the Ceann Comhairle's forbearance. Some of the other Deputies did not even bother to turn up to debate this. It is a very serious issue and those of us in the Rural Independent Group will not sit idly by and allow this to continue because it is outrageous and despicable. It is the worst treatment that sick people, young and old, get. Deputies Michael Collins and Michael Healy-Rae have to organise buses to Belfast to get operations to stop people going blind. Where is the Government's moral compass? It is lost in the sheets of paper files and the baggage in government. I hope the Government finds its compass, or someone needs to use a compass, to look after the people whom the Government was elected to look after. </p>
