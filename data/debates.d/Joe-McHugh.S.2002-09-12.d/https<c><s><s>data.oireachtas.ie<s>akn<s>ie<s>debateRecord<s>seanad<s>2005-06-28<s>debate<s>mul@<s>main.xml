          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Morrissey that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">To ask the Minister for Health and Children to furnish a report on the staffing levels and patient throughput at the dental unit, Roselawn Health Centre, Castleknock, and if sufficient dentists are available at all times to deal with emergencies and routine dental work.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to reconsider extending the allocated hours in the case of a child (details provided) who is attending a school in County Donegal who has been psychologically assessed as needing assistance on a one-to-one basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_9">She would, I am sure, agree this House has a proud and distinguished record of debating amendments on Report and Final Stages when a Bill comes back here from the other House. Does she also agree there is still a fair degree of public concern about the fact that most of the 138 amendments were not debated in the other House last week and that we have an important job to do this week?</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Will the Leader give me a firm commitment that the Government will not apply the guillotine to this Bill at any stage this week? If we do not manage to debate the 138 amendments this week this side of the House is willing to meet next week to go through those amendments, to ensure proper public scrutiny in the Houses of the Oireachtas of the amendments concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">The amendments will probably be moved in groups rather than discussed individually.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_16">I am aware they will be grouped, and that is the normal procedure. However, irrespective of the grouping, very substantial matters must be discussed, and this House has a very proud history of doing a job that the other House, for one reason or another, sometimes cannot do. I want to be assured that the Government will not apply a guillotine in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">On another issue to do with business scheduled for later this week, No. 15 is a report from the Committee on Health and Children on the risk equalisation scheme 2005. Perhaps time might be allocated with the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on Thursday morning to debate the issue, given what is currently in the public domain. It would be appropriate for us to have a debate for an hour or two, since we are set to approve reports from the Committee on Health and Children. Perhaps the Government might concede that.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Last week the Government issued two very important public statements, one on child care and the other on housing. It was a disgrace that two such significant Government announcements were not debated in either House of the Oireachtas. There was room for them in press conferences and in spinning to the media, but no discussion in either House. There has been no opportunity for the Opposition to question the statements' significance. No other Parliament in the world would tolerate that, and it is very important that, where the Government makes a major public statement, it ensures the Houses of the Oireachtas have an opportunity to test it and that it is made in plenary session of one or other House. It is a disgrace that that did not occur. The Taoiseach has time on a Thursday to open chip shops all over the city but not to attend either House of the Oireachtas. That is an example of the continual dumbing down ofParliament for which the Government has been responsible for the past nine years.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_20">I apologise. It was not a chip shop but a tile factory. It is very important for the dignity of the Houses that important announcements be first made in both Houses of the Oireachtas rather than to the press corps outside.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_21">The Taoiseach is my constituency representative, and generally speaking I get on fairly well with him. However, Senator Brian Hayes's point is perfectly appropriate. If the Taoiseach is in charge of the Government of this country, his primary responsibility is to be inParliament to answer the difficult questions. He is not simply to be a glad-handler or official opener of everything. I remember one city manager who was described as somebody who would attend the opening of an envelope. In this case, it might not even have to be that. The use of the word "opening" on an invitation would be enough to draw the attention of the Taoiseach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_22">Envelopes are well known to at least one member of Dublin City Council's staff.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_23">It is the other side of his very engaging human qualities.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">I believe all of us, including the Leader, would welcome some kind of consistency in the hours we meet although I know the difficulties she sometimes faces in arranging that. We are all involved in public life. Sometimes we are asked to commit ourselves to working lunches a week or even a month or two in advance. Then, if we meet at 12 p.m., 12.30 p.m. or 1 p.m., as we have tended to do recently, one has to cancel such engagements at the last minute.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Perhaps I might raise two more questions very briefly. I compliment Senator Leyden on introducing his Bill, which is extremely important. It addresses a real human problem regarding the location of wills in the aftermath of someone's death. He explained it extremely well on the one o'clock news. As a long-time member of this House, I very much welcome the positive publicity gained for it through a Government Member, who described himself with uncharacteristic modesty as a backbencher, using this House's facility to introduce a Bill. I am glad the Senator got Government support and that of coalition colleagues. I am sure that support will also be forthcoming from this side of the House. As a member of the Independent group, I will be reintroducing a new version of the Bill that I put forward, the Civil Registration Bill 2003, since the Government has once again shown an inability to grapple with the issue, and has characteristically kicked it into a committee. I am waiting. The committee will have reported by the autumn at which stage I will go to work on this matter hammer and tongs. We are lagging behind disastrously in the area of civil registration. Switzerland recently became the sixteenth country in Europe to introduce legislation in this regard. It is disgraceful that we are so far behind because the Government will not bite the bullet.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I ask for a continuing debate on Iraq. This is particularly important in light of recent international reports, published in the United States, which have begun to focus on the use of Shannon Airport in the process of extraordinary rendition. We must clean up our act now that the outside world has got wind of this story. I and others informed police about a <i>prima facie</i> case involving the criminal use of the aircraft in question, but nothing was done. As a Parliament, we are entitled to some answers on these issues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_27">There is no doubt that if there is even a remote suspicion that a kidnapped child was on board an aircraft that passed through an Irish airport, the entire resources of the State would be devoted to rescuing that child.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Hear, hear.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_19">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_29">It appears that people who are kidnapped with a view to being tortured in some of the most nasty regimes in the world are immune from the attentions of our security services. That is disgraceful.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">We will deal today with the Maritime Safety Bill 2004. I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, on the thorough and detailed explanations supplied to Oireachtas Members in regard to the 85 amendments to this Bill. This is in stark contrast to the blank page of explanation in regard to the far more numerous amendments to the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 which were rushed through Dáil Éireann last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I expect no more from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Parliament is an inconvenience for that Department and rights are something it seems to abolish with enthusiasm. This House is entitled to a proper explanation of complex amendments to legislation with which it has already dealt. Instead, however, there will be only long scripts delivered by a Minister and, if we are lucky, a copy of the script. This is unsatisfactory and not the way to do business. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is a model of good practice in this regard. Perhaps it could send somebody to teach manners to those in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">This weekend, at a rock concert in Croke Park, the Taoiseach was yet again deservedly booed for his betrayal of the poor of the world. The lead singer of U2 pointed out this betrayal and the young people in attendance responded appropriately. If Fianna Fáil could come to appreciate that promises made should be kept, this country would have much better policies.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I support the calls that have been made for an urgent debate on the Tánaiste's decision on risk equalisation. It effectively means the Tánaiste is sanctioning a substantial increase in premiums to be paid by VHI subscribers, which will follow in quick succession on the increases of the past 12 months. The anticipated increase means that premiums will have increased by approximately 35% in the past year. As Senator Ryan noted, the explanation given by the Tánaiste for her decision yesterday is unacceptable to most involved in the health sector, particularly the unions, who have expressed total dismay. It is unfortunate that Irish subscribers will have to subsidise British people involved with BUPA Ireland. I hope that before the end of this session, the Leader will ask the Tánaiste to come here to fully explain her decision.</p>

It is conscious of the Irish in Britain and beyond and acknowledges that fact. There was no intent on its part to disenfranchise them in any way. It is important that this House should be a forum for such issues. I hope the Leader will consider giving time to the Minister for Foreign Affairs so he may inform us what is being done in terms of the task force's recommendations.</p>

It is worth pointing out that BUPA makes 17% profit in Ireland, in comparison to 5% profit in its UK operation. The recent statement by BUPA that it would pull out of the Irish market if risk equalisation were introduced was both childish and nonsensical. It will result in either VHI subscribers facing further increases or eating into the VHI reserves. If we are to have genuine competition in the market, risk equalisation should be introduced.

This detailed report requires urgency and should be debated soon although I am sure it is not possible to do so this week. We had a debate here last week about prisons but one of the points to which Senator O'Meara did not refer was one made by the Ombudsman for Children on the difficulty judges have in deciding where to send a teenager, for example. In some cases where parents have begged the judges to put the child away because he or she is creating problems, the judges are loath to do so because they do not have prisons in which to put them. This is an area in which the Ombudsman for Children is not covered by the legislation passed comparatively recently. It is time for us to examine this again.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">The issue is one I have raised with the Leader on numerous occasions, namely, the contribution local authorities must pay for water and sewerage services. In most cases, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is seeking 20% of the total. In some cases, tenders were awarded more than a year ago but the Department is still seeking a 20% contribution. The local authorities in question cannot come up with that contribution so the clock is still ticking in regard to the tenders. If this is the case, it is easy to understand why there are overruns on most of the capital projects managed by local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">If at all possible, I ask the Leader to arrange before Friday for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to come to the House or to make a statement on the farcical situation concerning the contributions that must be made by local authorities for water services. In some cases, local authorities must re-advertise and seek new tenders — one can imagine the cost of this in terms of the abuse of taxpayers' and ratepayers' money. The Leader should seek a solution as a matter of urgency.</p>

I support colleagues who call for a debate with the Minister for Agriculture and Food on the matter. It is important that the Minister goes to Brussels with the full support of all Members and parties in the House and the Oireachtas. She will be defending an integral part of Irish agriculture and the tillage industry. It is important she gets a result and that she has the full support of all Members in that regard. The House should be in a position to offer the Minister its full support. She might be able to remain for an extra half an hour or an hour on Friday to discuss the sugar industry.</p>

While my colleagues are concerned that the Minister did not make a decision yesterday, the Tánaiste is apparently awaiting a decision on the future of the VHI. I hope that in the coming weeks and months we will have a mature debate on risk equalisation, which I do not believe to be all it is made out to be.

In many cases the crisis relates to financing and the finance to be provided by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. In many villages and towns this presents a real problem as it prevents growth. It also puts pressure on one-off rural housing, a matter often debated in this House, and is a significant problem in the planning sector. If the towns were provided with water and sewerage schemes there would not be the same demand for one-off housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">A ridiculous situation is developing in many villages in Clare where local people cannot find a house in the village or town because there is no water or sewerage scheme to facilitate them, yet they are denied permission for one-off housing in rural areas.

          <p eId="para_175">Senator Browne also called for a debate on risk equalisation. He asked when the report on sudden adult death syndrome will be published. I understand there was another death of that nature last week. The Senator also spoke about the sugar beet industry. We are endeavouring to find an additional hour for a debate on the matter. I do not yet know the outcome of that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Senator Quinn discussed the report of the Ombudsman for Children. He mentioned that judges face difficulties when deciding where to send — I hesitate to use the phrase — recalcitrant children. The Senator's view on risk equalisation is refreshing and interesting.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">Senator Mansergh mentioned that the Taoiseach answers far more questions in the Dáil than some of his predecessors. I do not want to provoke a debate on the matter. He also asked for a debate on the EU sugar plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Senator John Paul Phelan agreed with those who said we need to have a debate on risk equalisation. He argued that a quango is being established to deal with social and affordable housing. If the Senator comes to Athlone, he will see that a great deal of excellent social and affordable housing has been built there.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Senator Terry said that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism should publish the reports on the National Aquatic Centre. She suggested that the Minister should ask a group of independent engineers to inspect the structure and produce a report on foot of that. It is a fair point.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Senator Bannon also raised concerns about social and affordable housing. I also invite him to come to Athlone.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">Senator Paddy Burke said he has met many councillors — I wish him good luck on his odyssey — and that they are expressing concern about the development of water and sewerage schemes. I agree with the Senator that it is a huge issue. It was also raised by Senator Dooley. Difficulties and delays are being caused by the requirement for local authorities to make contributions for water and sewerage services. I will raise the fair point made by the Senators with the relevant Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">Senator Bradford supported the calls for a debate on the sugar beet industry. The Minister in question will be defending the case of this country's agricultural industry in Brussels on 14 July. The Senator also spoke about risk equalisation. Like Senator Quinn, he considered the matter in a practical manner. Many questions have to be asked about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">I agree with Senator Bradford's comments on Zimbabwe. I would like to understand why towns are being destroyed. Perhaps the sight of them offends Robert Mugabe's eyes. The Senator called on the Minister for Foreign Affairs to muster opposition at EU and UN level to Mr. Mugabe, who is a dictator.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Senator Dooley argued that there is a crisis in water and sewerage schemes throughout the country. Like Senator Paddy Burke, he must be visiting many local authority members. Both of them made the same point.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Could I make a point about the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2001-06? I have been reprimanded in a note I have received from outside. Big brother is looking in.

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_192">The House may recall that on Committee Stage I announced my intention to examine the existing provisions dealing with the compulsory registration of title in the Registration of Title Act 1964 with a view to introducing amendments on Report Stage that would promote and increase the rate of registration of land. This is all the more important now because promotion of registration of ownership will be one of the primary functions of the new property registration authority. Amendments Nos. 1 and 4 to 9, inclusive, are the result of the examination conducted in conjunction with the Land Registry.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Section 24 of the 1964 Act currently provides for the extension of compulsory registration. It allows the Minister, by order, to extend compulsory registration to any county or county borough. Only one order has been made to date. It was made in 1969 and it extended compulsory registration to three counties, Meath, Carlow and Laois.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">What I am proposing for the future in amendment No. 8 is that the extension of compulsory registration will not be determined solely and exclusively by geographical criteria. I intend to retain the geographical dimension, which will mean it will be possible to designate a specified area such as a county, and to add two further criteria. First, it will be possible in future to extend compulsory registration to specified types of land, for example, multi-unit apartment buildings either generally or in a specific area. Second, I propose to introduce a new subsection into section 24 of the 1964 Act which will allow the Minister to extend, by order, the type of disposition to which compulsory registration will apply. At present, when registration becomes compulsory, it applies in the case of freehold land to a conveyance on sale and, in the case of leasehold land, to a grant or assignment on sale of such an interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">The new subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) provides that an order under the section may extend compulsory registration to other types of disposition, for example, succession or gifts <i>inter vivos</i>, that is, between people who are alive. The new subsection (2)(<i>b</i>) is a standard provision which will allow an order to be amended or revoked. Amendment No. 1 provides that all such orders shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">Amendments Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, are drafting amendments to section 23 of the 1964 Act, which take account of the changes made in section 24. They insert references to the new subsection (2)(<i>a</i>) in section 23. Amendment No. 9 is triggered as a result of these amendments. It substitutes a new clearer text in section 25 of the 1964 Act. The current text contains an ambiguity in regard to the date after which registration becomes compulsory.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">While the new compulsory registration possibilities to which I referred will come on stream following the enactment of the Bill later this year, I am anxious in the meantime to make progress on compulsory registration under existing provisions in the 1964 Act. I, therefore, sought the views of the Land Registry regarding the possibility of extending compulsory registration to a number of additional counties. Following receipt of the registry's views, I will consider whether making such an order would be feasible.</p>

My party supported the Bill from its inception and it supports the amendments tabled by the Minister in this regard. The whole area of land reform, which I spoke about on Second Stage, requires radical proposals to be implemented and this legislation is only the first step in the process. We support the Minister's amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_207">This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister of State may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil.

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_208">I thank the Senators for bringing forward their formal consideration of the Dáil amendments to this Bill. I have arranged for detailed explanatory notes on the amendments to be distributed and will be glad to answer any questions on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">We debated the Bill here then referred it to the Dáil, after which it became necessary to amend it to overcome some difficulties that could otherwise have arisen. The core purpose of the Bill is to secure more reasonable use of inland and coastal waters and to safeguard human life and priceless natural and other heritage. If I did not introduce these amendments, however, all fishing vessels under 24 m would have required a certificate of compliance by 1 July under the Fisheries Act 2003. That would have caused serious problems for the industry and consequently I decided to introduce the amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">I would like to have addressed the issue of vessels over 24 m long but was not in a position to do so because that is covered by EU regulation and would not have been constitutionally possible. In addition, I received legal advice which overturned the general understanding of what constitutes the foreshore. We must address this matter immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I propose to do so by confirming in legislation, provided this House passes it, that the general understanding that the foreshore runs to the limits of the territorial seas, namely, 12 nautical miles. The advice I received, however, is that the foreshore runs only to the low water mark, some yards from the coast. These amendments seek to confirm the understanding that has existed since 1933 when the foreshore legislation was introduced. In this Bill I wish to provide for validation of actions undertaken on the basis of that understanding. We have a responsibility to all those who have foreshore licences or leases and I am endeavouring to restore the <i>status quo</i>. This confirms people who hold licences or leases in their secure occupation of the areas concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The Bill as initiated aimed at a more secure and reasonable use of inland waters. We have drafted these amendments which, with the co-operation of the Seanad, will resolve the difficulty about the certificates of compliance. I will introduce regulations to deal with these over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Many people asked me what I was doing about jetskis. There is no question of my compromising on safety. Equally important is the question of extending the foreshore lease to the 12 nautical mile limit which was always understood to be the limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">If Senators wish, I can go through the sections of the Bill. The earlier signature motion, which will come before the House later this afternoon, is necessary because of the urgency of having sections 53 and 55 and Part 6, inserted by the Dáil, made legally operational as quickly as possible ahead of the rest of the Bill. For convenience, I will deal with those provisions in dealing with what I describe as "Group 1". There are up to 77 amendments split into four groups. I have circulated all the information and will answer specific questions about any amendment or section.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">I thank the Minister of State for his explanation and for what he has done in connection with the Foreshore Acts. The difficulties involved came to my attention a few weeks ago and could have caused many problems in several areas. The Minister of State is well aware of one in particular. I thank him for moving so quickly to resolve these difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The amendments serve to make the legislation on licences issued since the first Foreshore Act retrospective. Does that pose any difficulty?</p>
          <p eId="para_218">In regard to some of the earlier sections of the Bill there are a few references in the comprehensive briefing we received to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act. Can the Minister of State clarify that reference because I am intrigued as to how landlord and tenant legislation forms part of a discussion on legislation in the maritime area?</p>

          <p eId="para_220">Many small fishermen who operate one or two person boats have called for changes in the red tape and the constant bureaucratic difficulties and blockages they must overcome to acquire or renew licences.

          <p eId="para_221">I commend the Minister of State and his officials for the extensive briefing notes made available to us in advance of today's final examination of the legislation. The briefing is essential and I wish that other Ministers would take it on board because without it we could not perform our role adequately in regard to such extensive amendments, although some are purely technical. There are 70 miscellaneous amendments and 14 new sections. That is a very extensive reworking of the Bill. On the other hand, the Minister of State has very much responded to matters raised with him and has at all times shown flexibility regarding this legislation, which has been vastly improved as a result. We will be considering only the groupings of amendments, but I specifically commend the Minister of State on amendment No. 26, which increases the maximum fine on conviction for taking or sending an unseaworthy vessel out to sea from €100,000 to €250,000. The level of fines is an indication of how we view the offence, and there are a fair number of amendments regarding unseaworthy vessels. This entire area clearly needed a great deal of work and the Minister has shown himself willing and able to respond in that regard. I recall, when this Bill originally came to us, that some concern was expressed regarding jet skis. The Minister has not only responded to that but to other issues too, making this fine legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanDaly" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mr. Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I do not wish to delay the legislation, but the Minister of State will be aware that, in certain areas, local farmers have foreshore rights to sand, gravel and seaweed. In many cases, those have not been exercised. When application has been made to extinguish foreshore rights, people turn up from God knows where to claim that they had such rights to sand, gravel and seaweed. Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify that this will not change the situation that has pertained. If it is proposed to extinguish a foreshore right, can that be done without paying compensation to those who wish to claim? Will the fact that there is now to be a six-mile extension give them extraordinarily expansive rights that they did not have before, when the foreshore was the line of demarcation between low tide and high tide or whatever the rule was?</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Perhaps this is a matter for another Department on another day, but I would like to be clear on this. It has concerned us, especially along the Shannon Estuary, and it is becoming more important in view of efforts to create special areas of conservation around estuaries and so on where people such as landowners claim to have sand, gravel and seaweed rights. How will the change being made here affect what has traditionally happened when it is proposed for any purpose — for example, the building of the power station at Tarbert or that at Killiney — that foreshore rights be extinguished? Compensation had to be paid in the above cases to those who had established rights to sand and gravel through their titles and estate. I am thinking in particular of the ESB case. It was claimed that, since the board could not extinguish the foreshore rights, it could not pay adequate compensation. Will that procedure be changed by this legislation? I do not wish to delay the Bill, which is complex.</p>

        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_164" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_224">Perhaps I might respond to Senator Kenneally regarding retrospection. If this Bill is enacted as a result of an earlier signature by the President, we will revert to the position we were in for approximately 70 years. The advice of the Attorney General is that we are restoring the <i>status quo</i>. It confirms people who hold licences or leases in their secure occupation of the areas concerned and ensures this can now be regularised. I was first formally told of this on 16 June, and I was immediately extremely concerned and met the officials, who advised me. It was fortuitous that this Bill was going through the House and I was able to use it as a vehicle to address this matter. We would not have had as many amendments otherwise. Several amendments are typographical, but the majority result from the proposed insertion of new sections to deal with fishing vessels under 24m. and the foreshore. Part 6 specifically provides that the validation of foreshore licences and leases does not affect anyone’s constitutional rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Regarding Senator Daly's question on private property, the Bill will not change the position at all. If one has private property on the shoreline, it does not confer a right to bring in a bulldozer and take as much sand as one wishes. There is a responsibility for coastal protection. However, it does not change whatever rights are there, which will remain. I do not have any concerns in this area. It was sufficient for me to get this through and regularise what was there without having any concerns on other issues that might arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Regarding the increases in fines for owners of vessels or those responsible for their going to sea, it was welcomed in both Houses that we should increase them substantially. That has happened throughout the Bill and I hope that, if not this year, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, will introduce the fines Bill next year, which would ensure that fines could be increased in line with the CPI or some other index on an annual basis rather than become totally out of date. Senator McHugh referred to smaller vessels with one or two crew members. He would be thinking in particular of the new potting licences introduced last year; I am not sure how many have been issued. However, quite a few smaller fisherman were offered licences as a result of an application to us through BIM.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">There will be a code of practice. I agree that we do not want red tape. We are talking about safety. Following my appointment to the Department, I met officials from BIM, the marine survey office and the Registrar General of Fishing Vessels. We issued cards indicating very clearly what we felt would be required to ensure such boats were made safe. Owing to the pressure on the surveyors in the marine survey office, we also have a list of private surveyors; I understand small boat owners have worked very closely with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">In addition, because of our concerns for the safety of the smaller boats, we are providing grant aid of 40% for the purchase of safety equipment. I appreciate what the Senator said about red tape. As I said, we cannot compromise on safety, but we are also realists. I hope during the course of this year to have all those licences processed. The Senator might ask why we bother licensing them, since it is unnecessary. However, it means that, when they are licensed and registered, we can provide them with funding for safety equipment. If schemes are administered by BIM, people can avail themselves of funding for the notching of lobsters or whatever. It might be somewhat cumbersome and difficult for them at the moment, but it is short-term pain for long-term gain.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_231">These amendments have been discussed in the Dáil and most found a general acceptance. The main concern of Members of my party when the Bill was debated in this House was that the enforcement of these laws will require substantial resources in terms of co-ordinating efforts between the Garda, harbour authorities and county councils. The latter may introduce by-laws and so on in this area. I wish to put on the record that we chose not to table a number of amendments during previous Stages of the Bill because their financial implications meant we did not believe they would be accepted.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Fine Gael does not have a problem with the second group of amendments.

          <p eId="para_234">I do not foresee any financial implications as a result of these provisions. Had I not introduced this group of amendments in regard to vessels below 24m, the financial implications for the owners of such vessels are too horrific to contemplate. In such circumstances, not one of those vessels would be able to go to sea after next Friday. We are all aware how long it takes to secure a certificate of compliance. This involves an initial application to the marine survey office after which the boat may have to be taken out of the water to be surveyed. This process can take a considerable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">The industry will bear some costs in this regard but it has been aware of the implications of surveys for some time. The change in this area is a welcome development by the industry and it gives me time to deal with the issues involved by way of regulation. I wish to make abundantly clear that it is not a question of compromising on safety. Neither I nor any other Minister could contemplate that.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">The third group consists of amendments Nos. 29, 31 to 36, inclusive, 43, 45, 54, 57, 65 and 71 to 73, inclusive, which relate to boats that are less than 15m. in length. These are the boats in respect of which a licence offer was made after 1 May 2004.

          <p eId="para_238">They include requirements for the weighing of certain goods vehicles before loading onto ships and provide for the outlawing of conduct endangering vessels, drunkenness of passengers and crew and unlawful interference with vessels. Amendment No. 54 refers to the nautical publications to be carried on board vessels while amendment No. 56 deals with access to and from ports and harbours. Amendment No. 57 empowers the Minister or other authorised persons to direct that vessels be moved in the interests of safety at sea. Suspensions or cancellations of the certificate of competency of the master or other crew members of a vessel not propelled by oars, on conviction of an offence under Part 3, are dealt with in amendment No. 65.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">The intention is that this will cover boats in general. I have already referred to the pressure under which the marine survey office and all the surveyors operate.

Most of those who own jet skis are dedicated to partaking of the sport they enjoy in a safe and responsible manner. There does not seem to be an affiliated grouping for the sport but many experienced jet skiers have called for strict regulation in terms of the purchase and licensing of jet skis. I welcome the Minister of State's intervention in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">It is important to reassure the public that the majority of those who use jet skis are responsible people who wish to abide by the law, including the international laws of coastal zoning. I welcome any regulation that can be introduced to assist them in enjoying their chosen sport in a responsible manner. Jet skiing is a sport enjoyed by many hard-working people. However, there is also a reckless element engaged in the sport which includes those who put the lives of swimmers and others in danger. There must be regulation in regard to the purchase of jet skis and a proper licensing and age requirement. At present a 12 year old can buy a jet ski without any licence or certification. This is a matter that must be discussed.</p>

A person attempting to distribute loads throughout a vessel needs to know the weight of each of them. I assume this is already happening and that what the Minister of State is attempting to do here is to bring clarity to the legislation in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Container traffic refers to goods carried by sea that are not loaded onboard a vessel by way of a goods vehicle. There is a significant amount of this traffic from various ports in this State to all parts of the world. Goods transported in this way are usually lifted from lorries and put onto the container ships which are particularly built for this purpose. In this regard, I understand there is no practice of weighing these containers before they are loaded onto the vessels. Will the Minister of State explain whether this issue is clarified in the legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_245">I have sought clarification on the issue of jet skis at various times during the debate on this legislation. Does the Bill allow for regulation in regard to age and licensing requirements for those participating in jet skiing? Alternatively, is it the case that any person of whatever age can simply decide to attach jet skis to a boat and proceed to froth the waters and cause disturbance? I have made this point on other Stages of this Bill. I am not a killjoy but there are a number of jet skis on inland waters such as Lough Ree which appear to be operated in a cavalier manner. I want to know whether the issues of age and licensing arrangements are addressed in this Bill. The Bill addresses safety, an issue which arises in this instance. If they are not at present covered, when will they be?</p>

As an avid jet skier, I concur with Senators McHugh and Kenneally that the amendments bring clarity and will enhance safety for people who operate jet skis. I welcome any regulation which lays down clear parameters for people who would like to use and enjoy jet skis responsibly. It is positive and gets rid of any reckless behaviour, such as was referred to by the Leader in terms of Lough Ree. Over the years, a number of fatalities have occurred. As the Leader noted, while licensing and training may not form part of this legislation, they may be borne in mind in the future. A small vessel register would also be a positive measure.</p>

At the time, the Naval Service and the Army kept the vessels in question under surveillance. I am not sure of the final outcome of this matter. Is there any way to strengthen the law so we will have more effective control over vessels which pass through our territorial seas? This is particularly pertinent for nuclear vessels, which are banned from our harbours, and may be done through the involvement of the European Community. A year ago, widespread anxiety existed with regard to this matter. It seems to have died away because the vessels did not come. The possibility remains that discarded vessels may be sent to harbours in the UK to be dismantled. We need to be vigilant on this matter and strong legislation is necessary to protect our coastlines and harbours.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_250">I will first address the issue of weighing. A load on, load off container must be transported on a truck. Its weight may be calculated by means of simple mathematics. The truck, which is weighed on the way in and out, has a tare weight normally displayed on the fuel tank. From experience, we determined that the weight limit for every container should be 42 tonnes, which reduced the overall weight inside the container to 20 tonnes or lighter, depending upon what is being carried. The load may be heavy material, frozen fish or stone. That can happen. I do not anticipate any difficulties in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">As far as Sellafield is concerned, we all share the view that the only answer is to ensure that Sellafield is closed so we will not fear for the future. However, ships have rights of passage outside our territorial waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">On the issues of jet skis and age, like the Leader, I am not a killjoy but want to be reasonable. Younger people may be more capable of operating jet skis. I want to examine the matter closely. It is not included in this Bill but section 47 will permit me to make provision for this issue in the future. It would take a lot of work to ensure that a process similar to car testing will apply for anybody who wants a jet ski. This Bill and the third group of amendments address conduct which endangers vessels, structures or individuals, regardless of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">We will give powers to local authorities to introduce by-laws. While they do not have to do so at present, a suggestion was made that the introduction of by-laws be made compulsory. Who better to know than members of the local authorities? As I explained to both Houses, the function is reserved for the local authorities. Local authorities will have power, after consultation of at least one month and seven days, to introduce by-laws. I would not like to see a situation where each local authority has different types of by-laws because one might travel through counties Sligo, Donegal and Mayo. A consultation process has been carried out. A template will be developed to indicate the type of by-laws we want. It is a matter for the local authorities but we will assist them in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Age is a matter to which we will give consideration. We were not able to do so with regard to this Bill because that may have consequences.

          <p eId="para_260">I would like to thank the Minister of State for coming here today. This Maritime Safety Bill, since it was first presented in the Seanad, has undergone a complete metamorphosis into its finished form. It is far better legislation now than when first introduced and I thank everyone for their input into it.

If there must be a consultation process between the Department and local authorities, an attempt should be made to liaise with jet ski users as they are the people who see the risks. I do not know if they have a network or umbrella grouping. Perhaps Senator MacSharry might be able to help us out on that point as he is much younger than I am and he jet skis every weekend. Jet ski users also see other risks. Friction exists between jet skiers, water skiers and other players off the coast and consultation should also occur between local boat clubs within the different regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Regulations are important but the question of the Garda Síochána and the Coast Guard enforcing them is a grey area. I have already asked my own leader, Deputy Kenny, to raise an issue regarding quads and motorcycles in a special area of conservation in my locality by means of parliamentary questions. I can speak with the Minister of State afterwards on this matter. The Garda Síochána and the local authority cannot come together to enforce the law. I know it is outside the Minister of State's brief but he would have a special interest in the matter as it relates to Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In my parish a golf course was not allowed to be developed over sand dunes in a special area of conservation but scrambling, quad and motocross races take place every weekend in that area. The Garda and local authority know about it but the law is not being enforced. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has already replied to me stating it is against the law, yet we are introducing similar laws here. I wish to highlight that grey area.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">I commend the Minister of State on his work on this necessary legislation. Reference has been made to jet skiing, clearly an issue of which people have experience. It has become popular during the past few years and is in need of regulation. Senator McHugh raised an important point in that putting the law in place is one thing while enforcing it is another. The framework devised by the Minister of State and his officials is certainly one which, if enforced, will be effective. The test will be in its enforcement and seeing how problems are solved and eradicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">We cannot make progress without legislation on the Statute Book. I look forward to seeing this Bill's provisions being implemented and to the introduction of regulations which make maritime activities safer and allow everyone to enjoy our fabulous maritime amenities. There is no reason this should not happen if this legislation is enforced.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
          <p eId="para_266">I take this opportunity to thank Members and officials of the House for their assistance over the past number of weeks in ensuring this Bill could be enacted, subject to its earlier signature by the President, within the next number of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">I also thank the officials in my Department who worked exceedingly hard, burned the midnight oil and even returned from holidays, as they realised the seriousness not only of the maritime safety aspect but also the aspects relating to the foreshore and the certificate of compliance for vessels under 24 m. I am extremely grateful to all of them. We would only realise the importance of the work we have done today in its absence. I am not presumptuous about what the President might do but if we did not do this, it would be extremely serious for all coastal regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">We can regulate as much as we like but individuals and groups must realise they are responsible for their own safety. We cannot insist that everyone who goes out wears a life jacket irrespective of age. We can only suggest it as one cannot have an official at every small port around the country ensuring it is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Senator McHugh's point on the sand dunes is correct and I know the area he referred to quite well. The existence of the special area of conservation and national heritage area meant it was not possible for one of our finest professional golfers to build a links course there. If that was not acceptable, it is wrong that others should cause such damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">It is not difficult to deter but it is difficult to detect. All we need do is drive along the roads, particular in rural areas, and see marks made by people who put their lives at risk by doing "wheelies". I state to those who use the sea that they are responsible not just for their own safety but also that of others. They should behave responsibly at all times. We have regulations, statutory requirements and guidance from safety and other experts. That guidance should be followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The proper operation of vessels requires the constant and skilled attention of the persons in charge of them. Alcohol and drugs can seriously interfere with the performance of duties. The clear message we all want to send out from this House is that no one who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs should go to sea. I thank the House and am grateful to it for agreeing to take this vital legislation in the last week before the summer recess. Many people would have been adversely affected had the House not agreed to take it.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_275">In page 10, subsection (1), line 6, after "with" to insert "the residents in the Grangegorman neighbourhood,".</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Throughout Second Stage and the various contributions, both here and in the other House, there was widespread support for the idea that the residents in the immediate area of Grangegorman be consulted at every possible opportunity because of the impact of this huge development in a highly-residential area. It is important that the residents in the area would be kept on-side, so to speak, and remain supportive of the development. At every opportunity, they indicated their support for the project and warmly embraced it.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">With regard to the strategy, section 12(1) states: "The Agency shall ... for the strategic development of the Grangegorman site in consultation with the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Health Service Executive, the Minister and the Minister for Health and Children." The list of bodies should include the Grangegorman representative and residents' groups. In all cases where reference was made in the Bill to the consultative group and the stakeholders, residents' groups were always included, but they are omitted in this instance. It would be appropriate if they were included.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_278">I support the amendment, which is also in my name. Senator Ulick Burke and I were both briefed by the local people in the Grangegorman area. It is important that we include the residents of the Grangegorman neighbourhood if the plan is to be representative, which is the Minister's intention. I was lobbied by people from this area. Being a practical politician — I am sure the Minister will appreciate one must be fairly efficient — I e-mailed them, asking them to explain the reasons for the amendment, the effect of the amendment and the outcome of the amendment. I am happy to place their reply on the record of the House. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_279">Reason: The section is about the strategic plan, which the Agency is charged with developing after its establishment. The residents are excluded from the list of interested parties to be consulted for developing the plan.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_280">Effect: Excluding the residents from the process would obviously lead to a deficient plan and certain problems for the future.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_281">Outcome: The amendment would result in a more inclusive and therefore more relevant plan for the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">If we want consultation, not to have the local residents involved in this consultative process from the start would be regrettable. As the lobby has come from these people, it should be actively considered by the Minister. I support Senator Burke's amendment, which I am happy to second.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_193" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_283">It is important to remember the principal purpose of the Bill and the strategic plan, namely, to develop the campus for the Dublin Institute of Technology and to provide health care facilities for the Health Service Executive. Obviously, in devising the plan there should be consultation with the major stakeholders which are, of course, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Health Service Executive and the relevant Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Where residents are directly and rightly involved — a member of the agency will be a resident — they are part of the consultative group, and they are involved at all stages which directly involve the local residents. As regards the involvement of major stakeholders, the strategic plan is literally the plan for the site. The Bill in its widest sense makes adequate provision for consultation with local residents and it is not necessary to include it in this section also.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_194">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_285">The functions of the agency are listed at section 9. Section 9(<i>k</i>) states that one of its functions is to arrange for a communications strategy that will include among those involved “residents in the Grangegorman neighbourhood”. Section 12 also refers to communications and strategic developments. The residents are interlinked with the process. By omitting them from this section, we do them a disservice. It is an indication that we will include them to a certain qualified extent, which is regrettable, if it is the intention of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">Throughout the Second Stage debate and on every other occasion when we referred to the involvement of the groups, "communications" was the key term, as well as the embracing of the stakeholders. The Minister could give priority to the major stakeholders, if that is her wish, but if she does so, she will create a tiered situation. I ask her to reconsider the issue. She should embrace the residents' groups on all matters or she will reduce their importance as stakeholders. The functions of the agency are listed at section 9 but the residents' groups are omitted at section 12. The Minister should reconsider the matter with a view to incorporating them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_195">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_287">To some extent I understand the Minister's reluctance to include too many people because boards and groups that expand too far can become unwieldy, which is inimical to democracy. However, in this case, only one person will represent the area. With regard to the strategic plan, in the 18th century there were regular rows between the citizens of Dublin and the University of Dublin, Trinity College — a kind of classical town and gown harangue or malaise went on. I am not suggesting anything quite as vigorous will happen in this regard but one wants the best possible relationship between local residents and a major, spectacular development such as this — it is an extremely positive development which we all welcomed on Second Stage. We do not want tension between this institution and the people representing surrounding areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">As Senator Ulick Burke noted, this is important in terms of communications. It is also important because we all hope this development will be a splendid one, which will have a kind of integral development into the local community, which will have access to its various services. The site will have a large area of open parkland which, presumably, will be very pleasant for recreation, swimming pools may be developed as part of the apparatus on campus, and lecture theatres may be made available to the community. The intention is to make the best use of these facilities so the people of the neighbourhood know of them, have some input into the plan which will develop them and, I hope, use them. Therefore, it would be useful to have a representative of local residents so there will be, as Senator Burke stated, positive communication and a positive input in terms of development.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">It would also avoid problems further down the line. As a fictitious example, should U2 favour the institute with a concert to raise funds for its new science laboratory or something like that, this might be agreed with the local residents if they were part of the decision-making process. However, if the idea was suddenly landed on them, all the ould biddies would be out banging bin lids or phoning their councillors to complain, "Oh, I couldn't sleep with the noise", and so on. That would be obviated at no great cost because the addition of one person would not overbalance matters in the context of a group of this size.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The Minister should not rule this out absolutely. While she is obviously not in the mood to be very yielding on the matter today, she might be prepared to reconsider it sympathetically so an amendment could be put down on Report Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_196">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_291">I see merit in Senator Burke's proposal. However, the Bill provides that the agency has a resident as a member and provides for a wide set of consultations involving local residents. Moreover, while the subparagraphs of section 12(2) have little or no relevance to consultation with local residents, section 12(3)(<i>b</i>) states that in preparing a draft of the strategic plan, the agency shall consult with a number of agencies, including the local community. There is a considerable degree of consultation involved, even at the stage referred to here, when the draft is being prepared. While there is some merit in the amendment the Minister has covered the matter comprehensively.</p>

        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_197">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_292">I am concerned about the ability to get things done, as suggested by good management practice. It would be good management practice to consult with people such as the residents when drawing up a plan but I am not sure it is wise to insist they have a right to be on the proposed group. We are trying to achieve an objective and there may be difficulties if we are forced to involve others, whose objective might not be the same, in the plan. The Minister is on the right footing in this regard. Those drawing up the plan will consult the local residents, rather than give them a say on the basis proposed by the amendment. As Senator Fitzgerald points out they are obliged to do so and, on balance, I support the Minister.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_293">I support the amendment in principle. Much work is done in involving the public in consultation in preparing the draft and the period before the strategic plan is adopted. On Second Stage I pointed out that when we dealt with Adamstown the significance of the consultation process was that substantial amendments were made arising out of consultations with the community. This is provided for in section 12(4)(<i>b</i>) which states that the agency must “consider any submission or observations made to it under this subsection and not withdrawn and make such amendments or modifications (if any) to the draft development plan as it considers appropriate”.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Very often people are sceptical about public consultation procedures, believing them to amount to a fait <i> accompli</i> and that nothing will happen as a result. I support the amendment although I agree that the section largely covers these concerns. What Senators Ulick Burke and Norris are trying to do is to emphasise the element by which the public is involved in the whole procedure. It is important that the consultation process does not just go through the motions because public input contributes to a good plan.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_295">It is a good day for the Minister as she has support from the Opposition side of the House. As Senator Quinn said, she is correct in leaving matters as they stand. It is difficult dealing with different groups of residents and there is no way of knowing that one will not end up with four or six residents' groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">While I can see the very good reasons for which Senators Ulick Burke and Norris have tabled this amendment, section 12(3) (<i>b</i>) covers the scenario, as well as section 12(3)(<i>c</i>), which states that the agency shall “make arrangements for the making of submissions by interested parties in relation to the draft and the consideration by the Agency of any such submissions”.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_200" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_297">It is interesting to see how the academic world will support the Dublin Institute of Technology. The major difficulty between a plan for Adamstown and a plan for the Grangegorman site is that Adamstown is a town. It is largely made up of residents and the facilities needed by those residents, which is why consultation with the major stakeholders, the community, is important. In Grangegorman the major stakeholders are the Dublin Institute of Technology and the HSE. These are the bodies that will occupy the site. That is the major difference between the two situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">We have gone to great lengths to ensure that the local residents have been included at all stages. At the time the agency begins its consultation and its development of the strategic plan there will already be a resident appointed to it. The residents are involved in rather than outside the process. The consultative group is a further example of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">We have also gone to great lengths on the matter of how to determine who is to be elected to the agency. In so far as we can facilitate the local community, recognising its major interests, we have done so. However, the principle users of this site are the people who should be consulted on the strategic plan.</p>

This project is unique in that it is in the middle of a residential area. The impact on the residents will be significant. I accept that the Minister has embraced the residents of the area and has recognised their importance, but in this instance they seem to be omitted. The Minister refers to the academic support for her position but she must acknowledge that the development will be within a residential area. As such the residents, having been granted the status of stakeholders, should be included in this.</p>

Clearly, commercial activities will be needed. It might be something as simple as a bookshop, a coffee shop or a restaurant, or it might be incubatory units. Including the term "related" might be restrictive so I do not propose to accept the amendment, even though I am sure it was not intended to hinder the work of the agency. It is not our intention to include inappropriate commercial activities either.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_309">"(4) The Agency will elect a chairperson at its first meeting.".</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Section 17(4) provides that "The Minister shall designate one member of the Agency as chairperson".</p>
          <p eId="para_311">That will be seen as an undemocratic way of appointing a chairperson. A designation means it is in the control of the Minister rather than it being a democratic decision of the agency. It would be normal in most agencies that at the first meeting the members would democratically appoint a chairperson. If the Minister designates one member of the agency as chairperson, that will be seen as undemocratic in so far as it may deny certain representative groups a choice. I am sure that each and every member of the agency to be finally be appointed would have the capacity to act as an able chairperson. I hope the Minister takes another look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Amendment No. 8 proposes that there be two residents of the Grangegorman neighbourhood rather than one appointed to the agency. I hope the Minister considers this as many requests have been made to her in this regard. While I know this may be cumbersome, the Minister has already indicated the number that should be on the agency. If we are serious about the importance of the project, which will be the largest educational project in the history of the State, it is important that the people directly affected are brought together, from academic representatives to all the stakeholders. Therefore, it is important to have two residents' representatives on the agency and that they be elected from their own grouping.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_313">I support this amendment. Both Senator Ulick Burke and I have received similar requests in this regard. Amendment No. 7 deals with the position of chairperson of the agency. Under the Bill as it is currently framed, the Minister nominates the chairperson rather than allowing the agency choose its chairperson. In many groups, and I have been associated with one or two, it is left to the incoming board or agency to elect its chairperson. This gives a satisfactory degree of independence which is necessary for good operation of a business.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The effect of the Bill as it stands, which is perhaps unintentional, is to reduce the perceived independence of the chairperson as the Minister's nominee. It would be better and more transparent to reassure people of independence by allowing the agency to elect its chairperson. Although a chairperson nominated by the Minister may well win the hearts and minds of his or her fellow members of the board, they must go through a process of so doing because of having been imposed from outside. However, if the group elects its chairperson, there is automatic and immediate good will towards him or her. This is a cogent reason for acceptance of this amendment. I also support the other amendments proposed by Senator Ulick Burke.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_315">The problem I see with electing a chairperson is that the agency is a very disparate group. On the day, it is difficult, even if members are given resumés in advance, to know where people stand and this must be taken into consideration. While I would love to see two residents selected, I have a concern about people being elected from the area because I do not know who the electorate will be or the criteria for getting on the election panel. Would a local representative be elected? We need to think carefully about such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I have been on boards, for example Comhairle na nOspidéal, where the chairperson was selected by the Minister and not elected. Some chairpersons won the hearts and minds of the rest of us, but others did not. Comhairle na nOspidéal is the nearest I can think of to the sort of grouping that will be on this agency. When we came together, I did not know 80% of the people on it and I am sure the same is true for most of the others. Electing people about whom one knows very little is difficult, even with a resumé.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_208" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_317">Senator Henry took the words from my mouth in saying the board is a very disparate group. It arises because the members represent very different interests. We need as a chairperson somebody who can be above any of the individual interests but who has a vision for the whole area. We need somebody who will not represent solely the education, health or residents' interests but a person with an overview. The representatives as set out may not have that.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I too have seen various bodies that have elected their chairperson. In some cases the vested interests got together and elected someone from one group as chairperson and someone from the other group as vice-chairperson. As a result it became a closed shop. I will give serious consideration as to the type of person who should be chairperson of this agency. It must be a person who has the skills to consult, the vision for the site and the leadership qualities to bring everybody with him or her. It is a challenging position and as the agency will be there for approximately ten years we must ensure we have somebody who can give that kind of commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">With regard to the amendment suggesting we change from one resident representative on the agency, if I changed that I would have to double up on some of the others also and the agency would become unwieldy. We must keep our focus on the main purpose of the agency. I have been careful to ensure that local residents are included and involved at all stages of the consultation.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">When one hears that a member of an agency or a board has been dismissed by a Minister, one immediately thinks that a serious misdemeanour must have occurred. That has not always been the case, however. Such people have been removed in the past after Ministers became concerned about simple differences of opinion with individuals who had previously been appointed, selected or elected to a State agency or board. It is important, for that reason, that the Minister adopt a "hands-off" approach in this instance, as far as possible, when members of the proposed development agency are being appointed. The Bill currently states that a member of the agency may be removed if he or she has "committed stated misbehaviour". It could be argued that such behaviour includes an expression of disagreement with a policy being pursued by a Minister or a ministerial appointee, as opposed to those selected, elected or appointed from outside bodies. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_212">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_325">I do not like this section of the Bill. The Minister and I may come to blows over it. I do not believe that it is appropriate to provide in legislation, as this Bill does, for "the Minister's opinion" about what is a matter of fact. That somebody has "committed stated misbehaviour" is or is nor a matter of fact. It is not a matter of opinion — it is a matter of fact. The Bill gives the Minister very swingeing powers by stating that a person can be removed if "his or her removal appears to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions". Is it the case that the Minister does not have to give a reason? The Bill states that the Minister can make a decision if it "appears" to him or her that it is necessary. I remind the Minister that apparitions can be fairly dangerous and cannot be relied upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The Bill also provides that a person can be removed from the agency in cases of "ill health". How can a Minister for Education and Science have a proper, informed or professionally competent opinion about somebody's health? The Minister might see that person once in a blue moon, if at all. I am reminded of the late Stanley Holloway's "My Word You Do Look Queer". I am sure the Minister will excuse the levity. It seems that a member of the agency can be dismissed if the Minister says, in effect, "my word, you don't look well". I think it is absolutely daft. I hope we call a vote on this amendment if the Minister does not show herself to be yielding.</p>

I get worried when people other than medical professionals give opinions on whether someone has become "incapable through ill-health of performing his or her functions". This section of the Bill is loosely worded.

The current Minister, Deputy Hanafin, would never act in such a manner.

They have suggested that such a Minister might use ill health as an excuse to remove a member of the proposed agency. Senator Brady put it cogently when he said that a Minister could not declare in a public and transparent manner that he or she was removing a certain member of the agency on the grounds of ill health if details of that ill health, which would have to be clearly causing the member of the agency to be unable to perform at a reasonable capacity, were not well known within the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">I consulted the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel in anticipation of this learned debate, which I did not expect to be so flattering. I was informed that it would be inappropriate to change the wording of this section because it is a "standard provision". This section should not be amended because the proposed agency will be bound by the rules of administrative law and the principles of natural and constitutional justice, which already require that adequate grounds must exist for the removal of a person from his or her job and that the reasons for such a removal must be stated. Therefore, the agency must act reasonably if one of its members is dismissed. I cannot accept the amendment for that reason.</p>

I cannot give the exact time and date of instances in the quite recent past when all the members of a board or an agency were dismissed. I do not know whether such decisions were taken on the basis of "the Minister's opinion", on the basis of "ill health" or on the basis of a simple difference of opinion, as I said initially. I remind the House that people were removed from boards, or decided to leave such boards after undue pressure was placed on them by Ministers, possibly through their representatives on particular boards, on three or four occasions in the fairly recent past. The concerns expressed must be taken on board so that we will get clarity on what the Minister can or cannot do in certain instances.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">While the Minister outlines a cogent position, I would like to comment on a couple of matters. The first relates to the situation explored by my colleague, Senator Tuffy, namely, inviting the Minister to advise the House on whether this is novel legislation. While it is very informative and helpful in an historical sense, it does not mean the House must accept uncritically these provisions; very often they are just shoved in as a matter of form because they have always been there. When highlighting issues in this House, I recall on a number of occasions over the past 20 years being told that it has always been the case, that as something is almost a regulation, we will shove it in as a matter of form. We managed to indicate situations where this was not appropriate. It is always useful to know if a Bill is novel legislation, if provisions work successfully or have caused problems, but this is not a blanket answer. I am pleased the Minister did not offer a blanket answer or state that just because it is in other legislation, it must be immune from critical scrutiny in Seanad Éireann.</p>

We are not talking about the local committee where someone is asked to leave, which may be what Senator Burke is talking about. An agency which is set up by the State and appointed by the Minister must be bound by all legal and constitutional provisions. For that reason, good reasons would have to be given for removing someone and they would have to stand over the decision.</p>

Presumably, the person to be dismissed can review the reasons, and if he or she feels there is something wrong with them, or the publication of the reasons or the fact that they have been dismissed constitutes a libel, they can have recourse to the courts. This gives some comfort, particularly in terms of natural justice and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I recall a incident some years ago relating to the IFSC. When the former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, dismissed a couple of people, there was a huge stink about it. One cannot always avoid trouble in these matters. If one is a member of an agency, it is very unpleasant to be dismissed. It is definitely a black mark and something quite negative for anyone to be dismissed in that way. This is something which would have to be considered seriously. I am somewhat reassured by the Minister's remarks.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">It is strange that the Minister said the consultative group should report to the chairperson of the agency rather than to the agency in full. Is it linked to the fact that the chairperson has not been designated initially by the Minister? Is there some reason for pre-examination of the report prior to it going to the agency in full? There is an element of confinement if the original report is sent solely to the chairperson. If reports are sent to a body, they should be sent to all the members who have equal status. The normal procedure would be to present it to the chairperson for distribution to each member. Is it significant that the report will be sent to the chairperson of the agency at such times as it considers appropriate? There is an element of restriction in this regard and I hope it will be changed. The amendment seeks to remove the element of restriction and include the agency as a whole rather than just the chairperson.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I support Senator Burke's amendment. My concern is that presenting the report to the chairperson alone will create the possibility for the chairperson to withhold all or part of the report from members of the board. No one should think this is a farfetched idea. For example, it happened in the neighbouring island at Cabinet level. It is perfectly clear that the advice of the Attorney General was not made available to the Cabinet concerning the Iraq war. Ten days elapsed between the provision of the Attorney General's report on the legality or otherwise of the Iraq war to Mr. Blair, as chairperson of the board, namely, the Cabinet, and the report being made available to the Cabinet; Mr. Blair deliberately withheld it. A castrated and politically useful version of the report was made available to the Cabinet on a limited basis ten days later.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">We have had a situation where the Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, indicated that, even though he is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he was not able to get hold of a full copy of the Carty report, which placed him in difficulties. In this very House, the then Cathaoirleach, the late Seán Doherty, lost a case in which I was involved, because he concealed part of a report containing legal advice which indicated that I was right and he was wrong. These are three political examples where parts of a report have been withheld — by a Prime Minister in Britain and a Cathaoirleach in this House and from a Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I would like the Minister to give us a reassurance, if possible, that we could not have a situation where all or part of a report is withheld from the full board. Alternatively, perhaps she will give us clear examples of where it is in the general public interest where all or part of a report should be withheld. I cannot imagine such circumstances but perhaps the Minister has a more fertile imagination than I possess.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">This provision is included for practical reasons and for those of efficiency. Rather than be obliged under the legislation to convene a full meeting of the agency the consultative group can liaise directly with the chairperson. That is standard procedure in most large organisations where, as in this case, there are a number of stakeholders in the overall aggregate group. To seek to oblige the consultative group to consult the agency each time it wants to prepare an interim report or a draft consultation would be inflexible and would impose constraints on the process as defined in section 22.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The examples cited as potential problems are exaggerated. In addition to the point made by Senator Brady, section 22(5) — it states "The Agency may at any time dissolve the Consultative Group appointed under <i>subsection (3)</i>”— provides a safeguard so there is no reason for alarm. The provision is pragmatic and promotes efficiency, maintaining the right focus in a process that is complex and wide-ranging. It might be necessary from time to time for the consultative group to sound out the chairperson of the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">We suggested that the group report directly to the chairperson in order to give it status, so that it could go straight to the top, rather like reporting to a Minister instead of officials, or to the Taoiseach instead of a Minister. There is nothing to preclude the chairperson or the group itself from giving the report to every member of the agency. There is nothing to preclude the chairperson or chief executive of the agency from inviting the consultative group to make a presentation, therefore, I do not see parallels in some of the examples Senator Norris gave. Giving the group a direct reporting mechanism was designed to strengthen it.</p>

          <p eId="para_389">That is helpful, as were the contributions from colleagues on the Government benches. Senators Brady and Fitzgerald indicated that this would often be an informal situation involving some discussion. I envisaged a printed report or some form of written record.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The Minister's response that there is nothing to prevent the chairperson making such a report available worries me. I expected that this would be virtually automatic. I suggest the Minister considers tabling her own amendment requiring the chairperson to make it available to the rest of the board. I have sat on a number of boards and would be unhappy if information was withheld because it is impossible to make proper decisions in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The Minister's response that the chairperson may make a written report available opens up the strong possibility that it may not. I would be unhappy serving on a board where I was asked to take positions and make decisions on matters where I did not have full disclosure of the information, especially a document as significant as a consultant's report. If, as seems possible from the Minister's response, such a report could be withheld from members of the board how can it possibly function efficiently?</p>
          <p eId="para_392">None of us are so full of ourselves as to insist on acceptance of our own amendments but I would like to see the issue addressed. If the Minister shares my view that members of the board would not be in a position to act responsibly if they did not have full information — there may be an adequate reason why she does not — she might include a phrase to that effect. The Minister's reference to the status of the group being enhanced by the report being presented to the chairperson is a good point but the chairperson should in all but the most exceptional circumstances, of which I have not yet heard examples, make a printed report available to all the members of the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">Most of the ground has been covered on this issue. To ask the consultative group to elect a chairperson at its first meeting is to expect nigh on the impossible. The Minister made a perfectly reasonable suggestion that the chief executive of the agency and the chairperson of the consultative group should be extremely focused and they should have the competence to take on the process of consultation regarding various aspects of the development in a focused and efficient manner. In the absence of that, subsequent generations could be left to discuss the final stages of the agency's work. The agency's work should be expedited in the most professional, efficient and cost-effective manner and in the briefest time possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">As Senator Fitzgerald remarked, we teased out the principle underpinning this part of the legislation earlier so I will not exasperate my colleagues or the Minister further. I support the amendment for the reasons previously stated regarding the perception of independence but I understand the Minister's position on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_418">The chairperson of the consultative group will have to be as skilled as the chief executive of the agency but in a different way. A person will be sought who can organise a listening process to take on all the views of the various stakeholders covered by the legislation and assimilate them. It is provided in the legislation that the chief executive of the agency could decide to be the chairperson of the consultative group, thereby making a direct link between the agency and the group, or he or she could appoint somebody else. The last thing I want is a vested interest emerging from the process who may then only carry back what he or she wants to hear as opposed to what was said. Somebody is needed who can take an overview, particularly in a consultation process as broad as this.</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_419">I am concerned by the Minister's comment about vested interests. The appointees to the board should have equal status and work well under the direction of the chairperson. However, the chairperson, who will be designated by the Minister, could have a vested interest. How can the Minister be confident that the appointee will not have a vested interest? The Minister stated he or she will have specific skills but that implies she doubts the capacity and ability of the other board members, who should have equal status regardless of their background, to take on the role of chairperson. I am concerned by that attitude.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_294" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_420">The chairperson will be designated by the chief executive of the agency or a person nominated by him or her, not the Minister. I do not have a role in this, good, bad or indifferent. In the election of such bodies, one sector of a vested interest could come together to ensure its man gets the job whereas I hope the chief executive, if he takes the position, will be above all that and will see the bigger picture to ensure that could not happen or to ensure his appointee will not represent a specific interest. Everybody could come together and decide to elect the representative of the local residents but he or she could have issues at variance with the educational or health interests of the campus or <i>vice versa</i>. We want to ensure that does not result from the consultative process because everybody’s objective views must be taken on board. The subsection provides for this.</p>

That should apply to all civil servants. As I understand it, a civil servant must give up his or her job in order to become a Deputy, Senator or Member of the European Parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">The Senators have a point. We are fortunate that Deputy Hanafin is the Minister piloting this Bill because of the detailed knowledge she has of the DIT. She has a broad outlook and depth of experience and knowledge of its workings. Conversely, however, while we all expressed the wish today that this Minister would retain her portfolio in perpetuity, if she chose no longer to be Minister for Education and Science she could bring a wealth of experience to the agency if, while still a Member of the Oireachtas, she was in a position to become a member of the agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">My one point of dissent from Senator Henry's comment is her use of the phrase "pleasurable bodies". I would take no pleasure in such a body.

          <p eId="para_426">I thank Senator Fitzgerald for his kind comments. He and I soldiered together in the VEC and DIT, starting exactly 20 years ago this month. Coming from the perspective of the Department of Education and Science, we probably treated the chief executive of the agency as a teacher who could be seconded while a member of the Oireachtas. While that does not apply generally across the Civil Service it is possible for academic staff and teachers to be seconded. That must have been the frame of mind informing this provision although I do not know exactly how it came about.</p>

          <p eId="para_433">From the outset I was conscious of ensuring we got the balance right in the definition of the Grangegorman neighbourhood.

          <p eId="para_434">In response to that debate we tabled an amendment to the definition of the neighbourhood. The map was circulated in the ante-room to the Chamber.

          <p eId="para_435">The location of DIT will have a significant impact on the area, in terms of education and training, recreational and sports facilities, rebuilding of the area and the transport facilities, and so on.

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_437">I thank the Minister and his staff for all their help regarding this Bill. We are lucky to be here to discuss what is probably the greatest indication of the commitment of State resources to a single educational project. It is a great achievement that it brings together scattered facilities from around the city into one campus. That it is going into the inner city of Dublin makes it unique. The acid test of commitment will be the provision of funding and support to allow the completion of the project within the timescale outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">We must bear in mind that with the amalgamation of so many different groups of people and staff who previously operated in individual areas there will obviously be difficulties. Even the amalgamation of two small schools has always caused difficulties, although perhaps not concern. It is important that whatever requests are made of the Minister or the Department by representative groups be dealt with quickly and efficiently by whatever means, whether they be demands for resources, support mechanisms or facilities. They should receive a speedy response to offset any difficulties that may arise because of this very significant amalgamation.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">If one has approximately 20,000 students and all the staff on one campus, there will be problems. To get around them as quickly as possible, ironing them out to the satisfaction of all involved, is one matter. Another thing that comes to mind immediately is that this Bill will provide an opportunity in what has been a disadvantaged area for far greater participation by many who would not have had access to an educational facility, in this case, third level. It was noted on Second Stage that people have already established links between primary and secondary schools in the area. They are all important, but most important of all thereafter is that we will have far greater access for people in this area. We have all mentioned in the House over the years that such people have been denied access.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I hope for that reason that the Bill's provisions are fully successful. That will entirely depend on the commitment of the Minister and Government of the day to the provision of resources.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_441">It is fitting and appropriate that Deputy Mary Hanafin should be the Minister to bring this Bill before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Perhaps I might indulge in some brief reminiscences. I was honoured to serve on the VEC-DIT with Deputy Mary Hanafin. I do not know if I am allowed to talk about someone not present, but perhaps Senator Tuffy might give me permission through the Chair to mention her father, who was the third level education officer in DIT during our reign on the VEC-DIT. I mean it as a compliment rather than to cause offence. It is both appropriate and interesting that the Minister, Senator Tuffy and I are monitoring the passage of this Bill. Deputy Carey succeeded me as chairman of the VEC in 1988. I hope that I am not leaving anyone out.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I congratulate the Minister. It is great to see that, only months into her term, she has brought forward this phenomenon, which must be the biggest single educational project in the history of the State. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Minister's predecessor. They had the tremendous vision of an array of possibilities and potential, bringing 39 complexes from over 30 sites into a single complex in the north inner city of Dublin. I pay tribute to the Taoiseach and those in the Government at that time who created that vision and decided to pursue it.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">If I may I wish to go back before them to the tremendous vision of the pioneers of vocational and technical education. They had such an innovative, pioneering spirit that, charged with responsibility for second level vocational education, they envisioned the evolution of that spirit into third level. To have that, they must also have had a tremendous vision of the phenomenal contribution those areas of vocational and technical education, and related areas of the sciences, would make to the future development of the country. If they were only alive today — I suppose that some still are — they would see the phenomenal contribution the DIT in particular, the biggest third level institution in the State, is making to the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">I salute the DIT for its varied specialties, its precedents and the pioneering areas it has developed and brought to the fore. It has achieved firsts and exclusives in several areas. It has never excluded people, having always promoted inclusion. I congratulate the Minister and the DIT. This is a new dawn for third level education. I do not care whether the organisation pushes for university status. It has created such a unique and distinctive place —"niche" connotes something small — in third level education, contributing to and linked with technological, industrial and commercial life, that it has already made its statement. I wish it well from here.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_445">I too congratulate the Minister on introducing this legislation and having it passed by both Houses so rapidly. I am sure the help of her officials was invaluable. Practical legislation of this sort is incredibly important. This Bill injects life into that area in Grangegorman which has been very run down for many years. It should make a great difference to the people of the area. I take particular joy in the fact that it is going to make such a difference to the Dublin Institute of Technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">I spoke on Second Stage about my admiration for all those who have worked in the various schools in the DIT. Senator Fitzgerald is right to talk about those involved in vocational education such as Eamon Tuffy, and the effort put in by so many. The various schools within the institute benefited not only the country but also many individuals. The institute transformed the lives of many to perhaps a far greater extent than was the case with most of our universities for many decades. I heartily congratulate all involved in the Dublin Institute of Technology on what they have done and will do in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">I should have mentioned my special interest in this area when I spoke on Second Stage. I lectured in physiology at the Kevin Street facility for a time. It was new at that stage, an indication of how long ago it was, and we were tripping over building blocks. I ask the Minister to keep in mind the pleas of Senator Ormonde and I that we should not be obliged to attend the opening of the new facility at Grangegorman on zimmer frames. I support Senator Ulick Burke in urging that the resources be provided to allow the agency to proceed with its work as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Third Schedule might suggest that by the time all these properties are sold, it should be possible to build as magnificent a campus as could be desired. However, I am sure the Minister will have to provide additional resources. I look forward to seeing how the legislation is brought to fruition. I congratulate the Minister and all those from the Dublin Institute of Technology who have done such work in the past and will now enjoy the benefits of suitable accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Senator Fitzgerald raised the issue of university status. Many graduates of the Dublin Institute of Technology were happy to be constituents of mine as a consequence of having their degrees conferred by Trinity College. It is only for a short time that this has not been the case and we must look to the future in this regard. I hope those involved in the DIT will remember that they do not have to set up a university of their own.</p>

        <speech by="#CyprianBrady" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_450">I congratulate the Minister and her staff on this legislation. Much thought and effort has gone into the construction of the Bill and its passage through the Houses. I also congratulate the president of Dublin Institute of Technology, Professor Norton, and his staff, who have had a significant impact on the legislation. I wish them well for the future. I spend much time in the immediate area of Grangegorman and it is clear there is great anticipation in terms of what is to come. There is also a significant amount of goodwill and this will be borne out as the project develops.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The way the legislation has been framed and the consultation that is taking place will prove to be beneficial in the long run. It has already been observed that this project represents the single greatest investment in third level education in the history of the State. It will be implemented over seven to ten years and there will undoubtedly be problems. The work begins now in establishing the agency. However, as a consequence of the thought and effort that have gone into the framing of the legislation, any problems that arise will be dealt with as efficiently and speedily as possible. I wish the Dublin Institute of Technology well and thank the Minister for her input.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_452">I thank the Minister and her staff for bringing forward this Bill and for all the work they have done. My father, Eamon Tuffy, would be flattered to be mentioned in this debate. I agree with Senator Fitzgerald regarding the pioneering work of the VEC-DIT over many years. As I said on Second Stage, this is a tradition that must be continued and built upon. Institutions such as University College Dublin are very much following in the wake in terms of the type of work done by facilities such as those in Bolton Street and Kevin Street, particularly in the areas of part-time and further education.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">I have already raised the issue of the reduction in numbers of part-time students in Dublin Institute of Technology and it is a matter that has also been raised with the Minister by Deputy O'Sullivan in the Dáil. That reduction may be taking place in a particular context and blame cannot be apportioned to anybody in particular in this regard. However, it is important that this issue should be examined by the institute authorities and the Minister because it goes against all the advice form OECD and other bodies. We should be building up the numbers of part-time students in the institute.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">This is a unique and significant project but the manner of its devising has been worthwhile and it is an approach that should be taken with other projects. There may be other instances when it is useful to establish an agency to promote and sponsor a particular project and develop a strategic way of planning its implementation on an ongoing basis. This is not something that has been done often in the past, with the exceptions of Adamstown and the Dublin docklands. It is important that large projects are undertaken in a strategic way rather than taking a piecemeal or <i>ad hoc</i> approach to planning. The outcome will be all the better for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The Minister said this project does not compare to Adamstown but it has a similar effect in the sense that it involves a significant development in the middle of an area that is already developed. Adamstown was a largely residential town but those who made an input to its development were not necessarily going to live there. The same applies to the development at the Grangegorman site. The residents may not necessarily work or study there, although it is to be hoped that many of them will do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">In any case, they have a vested interest in how the site turns out. The provisions are there to facilitate consultation with the local community and it is important that this takes place. There is often some reluctance to allow this of consultation. For example, South Dublin County Council was apprehensive about the outcome of the process of consultation which took place in regard to Adamstown but went ahead and took on board the views of the various interested parties. The plan that was produced out of this process was all the better for that consultation and I hope the same will happen in regard to the development of the Dublin Institute of Technology site. The local community should have a major and ongoing part in the development of the DIT.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">I thank Members for their careful consideration of the Bill. It is the better for the debate that took place here and in the Dáil and some important sections have been improved by virtue of the points raised in both Houses. I join Senators in thanking my departmental officials who have put an enormous amount of time into consulting with interested parties on this and ensuring the legislation would be appropriate and acceptable to so many different people. We must bear in mind that this major development is important not only for the educational institution involved but will also have a significant positive impact across the northside of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I remind Members that many people have been involved in formulating this legislation and that it was my predecessor who published it. In providing for the appointment of the development agency it is only the first step. There is much work to be done in securing the necessary financing and working through the development of the site.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">As I said on Second Stage, the greatest champion of Grangegorman is the Taoiseach and there is no better person to have on one's side. He is driving this and wants to ensure the development takes place. I look forward to ensuring that we can move quickly in this regard. I too hope we will not have to wait until Senator Henry is using a zimmer frame before the facility is opened and that I will be in a position to open it.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil. In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question, "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated the proposed groupings to the House. A Senator may contribute once on each grouping. I remind Senators that the only matters that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_464">The first group of amendments consists of amendments Nos. 2 and 10 to 27, inclusive. This group relates to Parts 4 and 5 of the Bill, which refer to the transposition of the EU directives on market abuse and prospectuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Senator McDowell raised a number of points regarding these provisions on Committee Stage and, following further examination by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the Office of the Attorney General, these provisions were further amended in the Dáil. Furthermore, the drafting of the regulations to transpose both directives has been progressed alongside the progression of the Bill through the legislative process and this has resulted in some mismatches which have now been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Amendment No. 2 amended section 2 regarding the commencement of the new section 31, which repeals the existing provisions on market abuse law. At present, the Irish Stock Exchange operates the official list, the regulated market and the recently launched the Irish enterprise exchange, lEX, which in EU terms is not a regulated market for the purposes of EU directives. It was always the intention to apply the market abuse regime to the lEX using the powers in section 37. However, it will be necessary to examine the proposed transposing regulations to be made under section 30 to see what modifications may be necessary in the application of the full market abuse regulations to the lEX. This will take some time. In the meantime, it is considered undesirable to have no statutory prohibition on insider dealing applying to the lEX market. Section 2, as amended, will allow for a deferment of the repeal of Part V of the 1990 Act in its application to the lEX market until the section 37 order can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Amendments Nos. 11 and 23 amended sections 29 and 43, now sections 30 and 46, regarding the regulations transposing the market abuse and prospectus directives. The previous draft gave the Minister the power to make regulations under section 30 for the purpose of giving effect to the EU market abuse directive, market abuse regulation and supplemental directives. However, the market abuse regulation is directly applicable in all member states. Therefore, it was incorrect to refer to "giving effect" to the regulation and section 29 has been amended to reflect this. Likewise, it was incorrect to refer to "giving effect" to the prospectus regulation in section 43, which has also been amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">It has also been clarified that regulations made under sections 30 and 46 may only provide for penalties on a summary conviction. Subsection (3) of section 30, as amended, provides that such regulations may include provisions regarding disclosure of interests in relevant share capital currently in section 3 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1999, which is being repealed in the new section 31. Regulations may also impose the requirements imposed by Article 6(9) of the EU market abuse directive that any person professionally arranging transactions in financial instruments who reasonably suspects that a transaction might constitute insider dealing or market manipulation shall notify the competent authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Amendment No. 12 added a new section 31 repealing Part V of Act of 1990 and the Companies (Amendment) Act 1999 which contains the existing law on market abuse and insider dealing. I would like to point out that the repeal of the market abuse legislation in section 31 and the repeal of the prospectus legislation in section 40 represent a significant streamlining of the law in these two areas. The EU directives will simplify administration and reduce the number of different rules and standards across the European Union. This is not adding new legislation on top of the existing law. It is bringing our legislation into line with Europe and making us more competitive globally.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Amendment No. 14 amends section 34 by giving IFSRA the power to make rules in order to determine whether a financial interest is significant, as required by the market abuse directive. Amendment No. 15 adds a new section 35, amending section 33AJ of the Central Bank Act 1942. This will ensure that the Irish Stock Exchange, in acting as an agent of the bank for the purposes of the market abuse directive, is covered by the immunity clause contained in Section 33AJ of the Central Bank Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">Amendments Nos. 10, 16 and 18 to 20, inclusive, amend the definitions of "Irish market abuse law", "EU prospectus law", "Irish prospectus law", "local offers" and "offers of securities to the public" to ensure the text is consistent with that in the transposing regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Amendment No. 22 amends section 43, previously section 40, by removing the reference to a threshold as it is not considered necessary to have such a threshold. The market practice is that for non-equity securities, the offerer, the person who sought admission of the securities or the guarantor alone should be liable. It will mean that Ireland will not lose competitive advantage to countries where liability for prospectuses for all debt issues attaches effectively to the issuers only. Amendment No. 25 amends section 48, previously section 45, to provide that the competent authority may prosecute for any summary offences under section 48, which refers to untrue statements or omissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Amendment No. 27 amends section 51, section 48 in the Seanad text, and gives IFSRA — the competent authority designate — the power to define "significant" for the purposes of the register of SMEs and natural persons. Article 2(2)(<i>a</i>) of the prospectus directive lays down criteria for those investors who wish to be considered as qualified investors, one of which is that the investor has carried out transactions of a significant size on security markets at an average frequency of at least ten per quarter over the previous four quarters. The amendment was felt to be necessary because, for example, applying for inclusion on the register of SMEs and natural persons is not an obligation imposed by Irish prospectus law but one that only arises if a person decides to avail of that particular registration regime. Amendments Nos. 13, 17, 21, 24 and 26 are related to or consequential on the amendments I have just described.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">The second group consists of amendments Nos. 9 and 32. A new section 28 was inserted which added a new section 260A to the 1990 Companies Act, and the Schedule amending the UCITS regulations was amended by adding a new Regulation 79A. These amendments make provision for investment companies established under Part XIII of the Companies Act 1990 and investment companies established as UCITS to prepare their accounts in accordance with certain accounting standards. These amendments will give these investment companies the flexibility to prepare their accounts in accordance with an alternative body of accounting standards. These standards are to be issued by standard setters prescribed by the Minister by regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Investment companies are still bound by the Acts and will be required to give standard information that every company gives but are being allowed to actually prepare the accounts in accordance with another body of accounting standards in place of the international financial reporting standards, which would not necessarily require such disclosures. A company opting for the alternative standards must fully comply with the relevant standards as if it were registered in the jurisdiction of the standard chosen.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_480">Amendment 28 adds a new paragraph (<i>n</i>) to section 56(1) — section 53(1) in the Seanad text — which amends section 60 of the 1963 Companies Act. Tax law provides that employee share ownership trustees must be incorporated as subsidiaries of the company in which the employee share option trust, on behalf of the employee share option plan, will acquire the shares. In addition, it is not unusual for non-Revenue approved arrangements to have as the trustee, a subsidiary of the company whose shares are acquired. This amendment is accordingly designed to allow these forms of financial assistance to operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">Amendment 29 relates to new section 75, inserted to address a problem arising from the present scope of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, which brings issuers of non-voting debt instruments under the remit of the takeover panel, if those instruments are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange. The provision is causing concern for the Stock Exchange and the takeover panel. The Stock Exchange is now a major centre for the listing of debt instruments, having achieved significant growth in the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">An emergence of a large number of domestic Irish issuers of debt has also occurred, mainly in the international financial services sector. This growth has been encouraged by governmental initiatives which accept that debt issuance represents a significant opportunity for Ireland to go "up the value chain" as regards financial services activities. The recent Deloitte report sponsored by the IDA placed debt issuance at the top of the strategic aims for Ireland as a financial services centre. It would not be in keeping with this strategy if those Irish bond issuers were required to list in a country such as Luxembourg in order to avoid this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">This issue was not identified when the legislation was enacted and the takeover panel has no desire for the legislation to have this effect. We are not aware of any other jurisdiction where the remit of the local equivalent to the takeover panel goes beyond traditional voting equity shares in this manner. Moreover, the focus the 13th EU directive on takeovers, which must be transposed into Irish law by 2006, is on equity shares with voting rights. The amendment also ensures that a company listing only equity securities in London and only debt securities in Dublin will come within the remit of the takeover panel.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Amendment 31 adds a new section 87. In Parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill, certain functions are given to the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland. It was always the intent that these would be discharged by IFSRA. No difficulty arises in Part 3, as this part amends Part XIII of the 1990 Act. However, in respect of Parts 2, 4 and 5 we were advised by the Office of the Attorney General and the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel that the necessary designation should be done by way of primary law.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Separately, the Department of Finance already had under consideration some changes to the Second Schedule of the Central Bank Act, and was proposing to add other statutory provisions to the Second Schedule. The amendment in subsection (2) makes all the changes needed to the Second Schedule in primary law. The amendment in subsection (1) ensures that the administrative sanctions regime set up in the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 do not apply to the market abuse and prospectus provisions.</p>

In accordance with Standing Order 103, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage. On the question "That the Bill be received for final consideration", the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil. This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. For Senators' convenience, I have arranged for the printing and circulation of the amendments. The Minister will deal separately with the subject matter of each related group of amendments. I have also circulated the proposed groupings to the House. A Senator may speak once on each grouping. I remind Senators that the only matter that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">On another matter, in the House last week I asked the Leader — she, in turn, may not have made the request — for a briefing on all of the 138 amendments before the House. It was not provided, which is in marked contrast to the fact that on a similar procedure today, when we had an opportunity to discuss a maritime issue, a briefing was provided in written form to each Member of the House. Such a briefing on this Bill would clearly and precisely explain the amendments we have not had a chance to debate on Committee Stage because of this procedure whereby Report Stage can only deal with the amendments as made by Dáil Éireann, where the vast majority of proposed amendments were not debated. I wish to record that the briefing requested by me on behalf of our Opposition spokesperson has not been provided.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_502">There is no sense in which my Department refused anybody a briefing. If such a request had been communicated to us, we would have given a briefing to anybody who wanted it.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">I do not wish to devote much time to the group 1 amendments because these are technical in nature, with little serious content from a policy perspective. In the main, they arise from drafting improvements suggested by the Parliamentary Counsel. The other types of amendments involved are those correcting the alphabetic position of definitions, on which half an hour was spent in the Dáil, clarifying references to the disciplinary regulations, defining the word "document", changing references to "Departments of Government" to "Departments of State", ensuring consistency with normal drafting conventions by using the word "direct" as opposed to "require", and correcting typographical errors.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">I will refer to some of these amendments in more detail. Amendment No. 9, for example, which inserts "vindicating the human rights of each individual" as a new paragraph (<i>c</i>) in section 7(1) of the Bill dealing with the functions of the Garda Síochána, was agreed by me with a change in the wording in light of an amendment by Deputy Jim O’Keeffe, the Fine Gael justice spokesman in the Dáil, who proposed the insertion of the phrase “respecting the human rights of each individual”. In deference to Senator Tuffy, she put down a somewhat similar amendment in this House on Committee Stage last December, which was supported by Fine Gael Senators and Senator Maurice Hayes. While I was not persuaded initially to make the change, I reflected on it and accepted it.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">With regard to amendment No. 11, Deputy Costello was sufficiently persistent in making a case for the amendment which I agreed to make to section 7(3). This resulted from his amendment to his own amendment and, in the circumstances, I was happy to make the change.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">On the subject of amendment No. 32, I was pressed in the other House to strengthen the provision in section 16(1) of the Bill which provides for the drawing up of a new code of ethics, by inserting "shall" instead of "may". I did this on Report stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Amendment No. 33 deals with the insertion in the Bill of provisions that will enable the Garda Representative Association to look after the interests of Garda trainees. I made this concession with the approval of the association and Garda management.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Amendment No. 37, which deals with arrangements for the Garda Commissioner to obtain the views of the public about policing matters and the state of crime, is not a new provision. When the Bill was considered in this House, it appeared as section 34. However, the suggestion was made to me in the other House that it should appear in that part of the Bill dealing with the role of the Garda Commissioner. Accordingly, it now appears as section 27.</p>
          <p eId="para_509">Amendment No. 133 is necessary as a transitional provision with regard to the continuance in being of Garda disciplinary regulations under the 1989 regulations, although those regulations may be revoked in line with the provisions governing the drawing up of new regulations in this area. I envisage that there will be new regulations but I want to provide that some disciplinary regime will be in existence until new regulations are introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Amendment No. 135 is related to the matter of the Garda Commissioner being made the Accounting Officer for the force in regard to the appropriation accounts under section 43 of the Bill. The responsibilities arising in that regard under section 18 of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act 1993 are expressed by that Act as applying to Departments or offices. It is doubtful if the Garda Síochána comes within the definition of those two terms, so it was necessary to make the amendment to the 1993 Act as provided for in the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#MauriceCummins" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_511">We are very disappointed that legislation of this nature was rushed through the other House in the absence of debate on many amendments. It is undoubted that all of the last minute amendments introduced on Report Stage in the other House should have been introduced on Committee Stage, a point that was made time and again but not accepted. All the amendments, including those that were not accepted in the other House, should have been debated at length. In this debate, we can only debate the Government amendments as passed in the other House. We cannot have a vote on each of the amendments individually but must wait to have a vote on all the amendments. It is a farce.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">As my party leader stated, the Bill should have been stalled for a maximum of, say, three months to invite an independent and respected panel of interested people with international expertise to review it and report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas. This would be, first, to assess the Bill fully and to address all the recommendations made by Mr. Justice Morris and, second, to assess whether the structures proposed for highlighting complaints against gardaí are in line with international practice. It is very important that we get this Bill right and the manner in which the Minister has ploughed ahead, without proper debate, is absolutely disgraceful. I would have expected better from the Minister, especially given that he was receptive to changes from this House when the Bill was initially brought forward. The Minister accepted some amendments from this side of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">It is a cliché to say that rushed legislation is bad legislation. I sincerely hope the objectives outlined will be realised but I question the constitutionality of some aspects of the Bill. I will not be surprised if this Bill is challenged in the years ahead, especially in areas where due process is deemed not to have been followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The Minister referred to amendments tabled by Members of the Opposition in respect of human rights and other areas. I am glad such matters were teased out in the other House. Those amendments were put forward by the Opposition in good faith and, if these were accepted, surely the least the Minister can do is to listen to and debate the amendments put forward on this Stage. These may also improve this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The manner in which the Bill has been handled is an absolute disgrace, especially as this is important legislation dealing with the Garda Síochána. This is the most important legislation since the foundation of the force. In that respect the Minster has made a serious mistake. I do not know whether it is the Minister's decision or that of his officials. This decision to plough ahead will haunt the Minister in years to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">My colleagues will raise the substance of the amendments but it is important to put on record our distaste at the manner in which the Bill was handled in the other House, and the fact that we cannot vote on individual amendments. The amendments will have to be voted on in total, at the end of the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">I was going to begin by saying I spoke more in sorrow than in anger but it is more with a sense of ironic hilarity than either sorrow or anger that I rise. That the security of the State is in the hands of a Department that deals with parliamentary process in the way this Minster has allowed is not something by which I feel threatened. The level of incompetence is so great that I do not feel threatened by the attempt to play the spook. I feel more insecure because it has failed to do the spook job properly. The presumption running through this process is that the Oireachtas is an inconvenient obstacle to the rule of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Oireachtas is the best bastion the security of the State can have. Without a functioning Oireachtas, respected by the Executive, the State cannot be secure. That is why I am motivated more by ironic hilarity than anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">This House devoted an enormous amount of its time to a thorough, detailed discussion of this Bill. Even the Minister, who understandably gets impatient with the process sometimes, did not believe that any Member of this House was deliberately wasting time on this Bill. It was treated with the respect it deserved.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_521">The Oireachtas was not treated with the respect it deserved by the Minister and the Department. The Oireachtas was the subject of a farce last week, with amendments appearing out of fax machines at a rate that generated vast quantities of paper in Members' offices and even greater quantities of confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I am not a lawyer but I have been in this House long enough that I am not bamboozled by lawyers. The production of 138 amendments was an attempt to bamboozle. As the Minister has stated, these are not the most significant amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The Minister knows the quality of the capacity for persistence of my colleague Deputy Joe Costello. If the Minister has agreed the Garda Síochána now has a specific purpose of dealing with immigration, are all past dealings in this area now of dubious legality? Does this invite legal challenges? Perhaps it does not but at this stage one takes Government advice on what is legal and proper with a grain of salt. I refer to the nursing home debacle and the scandal of the delay before the Morris tribunal was set up. The obfuscation by various people regarding what they knew, what information they had, what they did with it and why they did not deal with it, is most peculiar. If the Minister were to tell me he is categorically assured that the legislation is satisfactory, I would be sceptical, and the public is also entitled to be sceptical.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I can guarantee that some time in the future a major flaw will be detected in one of these amendments. I have been in and out of this House for 25 years and we have been embarrassed by errors in amendments in the past. Last week we spotted an error in the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Bill. This can only have been the product of rushed drafting. It was spotted by the plebeian footsoldiers of the Opposition in this House, after the great minds of Parliamentary Counsel's Office, the Attorney General and everyone else missed it.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">That is what the Oireachtas does best — it looks at things without the protection of a sense of its own importance but with the belief that if the Members cannot understand it, there is probably something wrong with it. Sometime in the future some error will be found and some sanctimonious person, probably in the legal profession, will give us a lecture on how the Oireachtas did not do its duty. The Oireachtas is ready, willing and able to do its duty and it is the Government that did not do its duty in this rushed, hamfisted job. This is epitomised by the fact that there were errors in the groupings of amendments because it was rushed. Nobody is infallible or immune to the errors that come from being rushed. People in the background seem to believe they are infallible but we all know they are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The Minister may tell me my party supported this next point but that does not trouble me. I think student members of the Garda Síochána should be members of USI, like any other student. To be members of an ordinary student union when they are undergraduates would be a healthy experience for them. This would give them an injection of the reality of life rather than being confined to a particularly inward-looking trade union. It is a trade union which would be better off being part of the process of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, as that would give it an injection of reality. We are not going to fall out over this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I am glad there is an explicit assertion of the duty of the Garda Síochána to vindicate human rights. Perhaps we will not have a repetition of an episode a few years ago when correspondence to Members of this House was seized by the Garda Síochána because it was a letter from a garda about a human rights issue. It was opened by accident, gardaí seized all of the letters and used a letter as evidence in a disciplinary matter within the Garda Síochána. It was a letter to my colleague Senator O'Meara, who did not know the letter existed. This is all a matter of public record. Perhaps it will be accepted that the job of the Garda Síochána is to vindicate human rights and this sort of incident will not happen again.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_528">I, many other colleagues and the Minister worked hard on Committee and Report Stages when this matter first came to our attention early this year. The Bill as first published had been in existence for a considerable period before it was brought to this House and on five separate occasions I had asked why it had not come before us. If it had, it would have ensured we had time to discuss the matter in its entirety. The Bill was dealt with in a serious and expeditious manner by this House and the Minister, who engaged with us. It is worth noting that some of the amendments in this first group are as a result of suggestions we made.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">I wish to again clarify something I said earlier regarding briefing on the 130-odd amendments before us. When I asked one of the Minister's officials a straightforward question earlier today, I got a straightforward answer, which I appreciate. However, last week when I made a suggestion to the Leader, what I sought was that spokespersons would be provided with a written brief on the amendments so that they would know exactly the nature and scope of the amendments coming back from the other House. I regret that did not happen. However, when I sought information from an official of the Minister, I got excellent advice which gave me some idea of the points I should make.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">If the second report of the Morris tribunal had not issued, what would have happened to this Bill in the Dáil and the Seanad? Had the report not been made, how many of the amendments before us would have been put? Is it not the case that whenever the second, third and fourth reports of the tribunal issued, they would, inevitably, lead to some form of amendment of this primary legislation? The rush referred to by Senator Ryan is not good for parliamentary democracy. The other House could easily have sat another week or beyond to ensure that the kind of scrutiny mentioned here was given the full weight we all like to see. As Senator Ryan rightly said, debate in this House — which is not the kind of party political pantomime that sometimes takes place in the other House — regularly highlights inefficiencies and glitches in a Bill that can be rectified. I regret that each amendment cannot be debated on its merit in this House over the next number of days, rather than the groupings we have here.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">The Minister put forward the view on Committee Stage that one of the reasons the legislation should deal with the Garda Síochána as a whole was because our police force operates throughout the country and not like the police forces in the United Kingdom which have regional command structures. The first 15 recommendations of the second Morris report all relate to the inability on the part of the Donegal gardaí to follow orders, have a management structure in place or follow the letter of the management system and orders that came from Dublin. When I made the suggestion that we might need to consider a regional model of policing to ensure greater accountability, my suggestion was rubbished on the basis that it would not suit our policing conditions, the history of the force and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">In light of the first 15 recommendations of the second Morris report and given that the management structure of the force and the geography of Dublin to Donegal and many other places were a hindrance at the time, is it not time to reconsider this matter? This suggestion arises from comments I made on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Many of the amendments in group 1 are welcome. The Minister has responded to a teasing out of the Bill on Committee Stage. Senator Ryan referred to the reference to "human rights", something we debated at length in this House. I also welcome amendment No. 37 which allows a greater model of discussion between members of the public and the force. This is to be construed following a paper the Garda Commissioner will ultimately publish.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Minister must concede, however, that this is not the way to do business. We should not have to deal with the range of amendments that come from the other House in one fell swoop. We can only speak on 14 occasions to the groupings. This is not the way this House, traditionally, does its business, despite the fact that in group 1 the Minister has taken on board many important new amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">I agree wholeheartedly with Senators Cummins, Ryan and Brian Hayes that it is manifestly wrong that this Bill should have been left until the 11th hour of this session and that it has effectively been guillotined through the Dáil and now through the Seanad in this fashion. When I was spokesperson on justice, equality and law reform in the Dáil, I repeatedly pressed the former Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, over a four-year period on the urgent need to amend legislation to bring the regulations and operations of the Garda Síochána into the 21st century. Unfortunately we have had to wait for this weighty and detailed volume, which while it has many good ideas contains many proposals about which I have major reservations. Above all else, it is the guillotining of the legislation that appals me.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that had it not been for the volcanic and sensational revelations of the second Morris report, published three weeks ago last Wednesday, we would not have the amendments that have come through from the other House. Many of the amendments are good ones despite the fact that it is the wont of this Minister and this regime not to listen when valid, well-intended arguments are put forward on Committee Stage, not in an obstructive but a constructive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">Amendment No. 9 deals with section 7, which states, in subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), that one of the functions of the Garda Síochána is to provide policing and security services for the State with the objective of “preserving peace and public order”. Unfortunately, it did not do so in Donegal. It created mayhem and public disorder. Another function, set out in subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), is “protecting life and property”. It did neither in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I welcome the section regarding vindicating human rights for each individual. This ensures a place for the amendments put forward by our colleagues in the other House and Senator Tuffy here. As the Minister said, there was a valid argument, but why Senator Tuffy's argument was not accepted in the first place is beyond me. I am glad it finally dawned on the Minister, by way of persuasion in the Dáil, that there was substance to it. Hence the reason for the deletion of section 7(4).</p>
          <p eId="para_542">One of the functions of the Garda Síochána, as set down in section 7(1)(<i>g</i>) of the Bill, is “regulating and controlling road traffic and improving road safety”. For how long have we been pressing for a designated traffic corps? I genuinely believe that assigning members of the Garda Síochána to traffic duties, such as speed checks, is a manifest waste of resources. Every day, I see three or four gardaí operating speed cameras from hidden locations. There is nothing wrong with trying to detect speeding — God knows we have enough carnage on the roads. Gardaí who have received two years of training in Templemore are tasked with sitting covertly in culs-de-sac and culverts, on byroads and high roads and behind hedges. It is a manifest waste of public resources for them to be assigned in such a manner. They have to use “hair dryers” to try to detect those who are driving at a speed of over 70 mph, or whatever the current kilometre equivalent is.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">One would have imagined that this Bill represented a golden opportunity for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a designated traffic corps. I genuinely believe that such a corps could be trained in six months. I give credit to past members of the Garda Síochána who did the bidding of the State — they enforced the law without fear or favour — having received just six months of training in Templemore. They did their job much better than some of those who are currently assigned such responsibilities. It is a terrible waste of Garda resources that members of the force are being given the function of enforcing traffic regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We do not have that many gardaí. When one takes into account wastage, sickness, resignations and retirements from the force, one will realise that the Garda Síochána has a core of approximately 12,000 members. The Minister, Deputy Michael McDowell, has given a commitment to increasing the number of gardaí, but I have outlined the reality of the current position. Just 12,000 gardaí are actually available for duty every day. The Minister has wasted an opportunity in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I welcome amendments Nos. 13 and 14, which amend the legislation so that it clearly prescribes that any prosecution must be brought with the explicit approval of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">One of this Bill's major omissions is it does not provide for the redesignation of a Garda investigation. An amendment to that effect could have been included with the amendments under discussion. I would like to refer to a specific redesignation, which occurred in the McBrearty case in County Donegal. The Minister has admitted that the members of the McBrearty family, who were totally innocent, were grossly abused during the investigation into a crime in which they had absolutely no involvement — good, bad or indifferent. The designation of the investigation was altered from an investigation of a road traffic accident, in December 1996, to a murder inquiry. The McBrearty family was not informed when the investigation was redesignated in August 2002 as an investigation of a road traffic accident.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I watched the coverage on TV3 and RTE last Friday of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's announcement at a press conference of his intention to introduce new regulations for the transport of cash shipments by companies like Brinks Allied and Securicor. I welcome the regulations, which were drawn up in the wake of a spate of robberies, and I commend the Minister and the Garda Commissioner on them. Even though journalists had been told not to ask about anything other than the matter under discussion, near the end of the press conference the Minister was asked out of the blue about the redesignation of the McBrearty case. The Commissioner, who took up the question, said that although the case was redesignated as an inquiry into a road traffic accident in 2002, he was not made aware of that in his then capacity as Deputy Garda Commissioner until 2004. I watched the Minister's tell-tale reaction to the Commissioner's comments. It seemed to me that the Minister was simply agog as he listened——</p>

          <p eId="para_552">I cannot reply to Senator Higgins's comments while remaining in order. It is not in order for the Senator to waste time by discussing matters which are not related to the amendments under consideration by the House.

          <p eId="para_553">This is not time-wasting. I will conclude what I am saying about this group of amendments. The procedure used to redesignate an offence goes right up to the Deputy Garda Commissioner's office. A redesignation can only be allowed after it has been considered at that level. In this case, the redesignation was on the desk of the then Deputy Garda Commissioner, Noel Conroy, who is the current Commissioner. That is for another day. We await further revelations in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_557">I welcome the change in terminology from "may" to "shall" in section 17 as a consequence of the acceptance of amendment No. 32. Section 17(1) now states that "the Minister shall, by regulation, establish a code of ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for members of the Garda Síochána".</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimHiggins" eId="spk_356">
          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_559">It is an absolutely crucial change. I would have liked to have seen an indication of the thinking behind the code of ethics. I know the Garda Commissioner will be assigned responsibility for preparing the draft code of ethics. Given the public furore about the failure of some members of the Garda Síochána to perform their functions, I would like to know whether the Minister has consulted the Garda Commissioner about the Commissioner's intentions when drawing up the code of ethics. What kind of draft or blueprint will be prepared? It is a matter of current public debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">I agree wholeheartedly with the argument made by my colleague, Senator Ryan, about allowing student gardaí to become members of organisations like the Union of Students in Ireland. A valid point was forcibly made by Professor Dermot Walsh in the wake of the publication of the report of the Morris tribunal. He said that some kind of injection of collective thinking is given to student gardaí in Templemore during the induction process and, as a consequence, they emerge from the Garda College with a paralysed state of mind. Mr. Justice Morris aptly and colourfully referred to this phenomenon in his report when he spoke about the Garda culture of circling the wagons. In other words, when members of the force are in trouble, their colleagues adopt an approach of "all for one, one for all". I do not have a problem with such an approach in the Army because it is a collectivity, but something should be done during the Garda training process to tackle that culture as it is found within the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The model that is used when Army cadets are being trained should be embraced in the Garda Síochána. Cadets are allowed to study in institutes of technology and universities so that they can live in the real world with real people, but trainee gardaí have to remain in the cloistered and monastic setting in which Garda induction takes place in Templemore. The training given to gardaí is one of the roots of the Garda Síochána's problem, which manifests itself in the culture of circling the wagons. That culture, which is quite prevalent within the force, was referred to graphically by Mr. Justice Morris.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I would like to discuss the amendment which relates to trade unions. Nobody wants to see splinter groups emerge as they did before. However, I continue to have worries about the Government's dealings with Garda representative associations. Can the Minister guarantee the House that this legislation will prevent a recurrence of the "blue flu" debacle of some years ago, when the members of the force made a collective decision to stay at home on a particular date, thereby leaving the civilians of this State totally exposed? Can the provisions of this Bill guarantee against a further eventuality of that nature?</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I welcome amendment No. 37, which inserts a new section 27 in the Bill. Section 27(1) gives the Garda Commissioner responsibility for making "arrangements for obtaining the views of the public about matters concerning policing and the state of crime". Given that the Bill has been in drafting and gestation for so long, one would have expected it to indicate the types of forum which will be established. Who will the fora consult? Who will be called in? What degree of dialogue will take place? What reaction can we expect? Will the fora simply be talking shops? Will they have real strength, real power and a meaningful existence? I will reserve my comments for the other parts of the Bill. I endeavoured to be as relevant and certain as possible and, by and large, I have been in regard to dealing with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">As I said, most sections of the Bill are extremely good. There are major problems in regard to the ombudsman and obduracy of the Minister. There are major problems in regard to other aspects of the Bill, which we will get to in due course.</p>

The word "guillotine" was never mentioned in regard to this House. The matter was raised this morning on the Order of Business, when the Senator was not present. I said there would be seven and a half hours of debate and that we would sit Thursday night, Friday night and all next week, but the word "guillotine" was never mentioned in this House. I ask Senator Higgins to withdraw his remark, which is a slur on me as Leader of the House. I was the one who dealt with the issue this morning when the Senator was not present.

Senator Cummins will bear that out. In fairness, I have not seen a Bill where the Minister was so amenable to taking on board the opinions and views of all Senators. Many of them were reflected in amendments made in this House on Committee Stage arising from the Second Stage debate and, subsequently, on Report Stage. It would be unfair to state that ample time was not allowed to debate the Bill and that there was not an ample response from the Minister in that regard.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_571">On the point made about the Bill being discussed more on Committee Stage than on Report Stage, I could not agree more with the Senator. However, blaming the Minister or his officials is not correct, it is misguided. It is a matter for each House to decide how the business is dealt with. I welcome what the Leader said, namely, that there is no guillotine on the Bill. It will be debated for as long as is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">On the amendments, most are of a technical nature and do not need much elaboration. Senator Higgins drew attention to one amendment, on which I support him. This relates to the code of ethics in section 16. I am pleased it is mandatory and that a code of ethics will be established to include standards of conduct and practice for members of the Garda Síochána. The mechanism for doing so is fair and practical. In any group of 12,000 to 14,000 people, everyone will not conform to the best standards to which they should aspire. Therefore, there is a necessity to introduce a code of ethics, which I welcome. This was discretionary in the Bill, but it was made mandatory in the Dáil. It is now back before us and I welcome the change, which will be to the benefit of members of the Garda Síochána in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I have no difficulty allowing members of the Garda Síochána in training in Templemore to be members of the GRA. However, if the force is run properly, there should be no necessity for representation at that stage. Nonetheless, the provision exists. As Senator Higgins said, gardaí provide a fundamental public service, and anything that detracts from that by way of union representation or whatever is a distraction we should try to avoid. I hope we will not see a repeat of the "blue flu".</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Morris tribunal has given rise to many of these amendments, and in that regard I compliment the Minister. Making these amendments to the legislation before the recess, rather than deferring them for three or four months, is the right move. If he had taken that course of action, he would have been open to criticism in the House, which would have been justified to a certain extent. As Senators said, when the further Morris tribunal reports are published, they will probably give rise to further refinement and changes in the Bill. There is nothing wrong with that because it is an ongoing process. These changes are not set in stone. It is the best legislation as perceived today and constructed by the Parliamentary Counsel, the Minister and his officials. By going through both Houses of the Oireachtas, it should be commensurate with the needs of a properly-structured and efficient service provided by the Garda Síochána to the public at large. As time goes on, issues will arise which will lead to changes being made.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">The Minister has been very amenable to suggestions made. The House came together on some of the issues and, where there was a consensus, he took the issues on board. This is reflected in the Bill, for which we should commend the Minister.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_576">I, too, would like to have had more time for a combined Oireachtas discussion on this important Bill. The Minister is constrained by the time available to him. Like Senator Mansergh, as a simple former civil servant, I cannot see why the time could not have been extended because there is value in a close committee-style scrutiny of complicated matters. Having said that, the Minister engaged with us fully on the previous Stage in this House. A number of the amendments that appear here are in response to issues raised at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">It would make the best the enemy of the good for the Minister to hold fire now on this matter. There is a tail wind in the Morris report and it would be like throwing away the spinnaker if he stopped now. I have a firm belief in the ability of great organisations to resist change and get a second wind. Having said that, I would like to refer to general points raised with which I agree. First, this could be a centralising matter. On the other hand, it should allow for devolved structures. I would not be in favour of having different police services. It is important that the whole structure is flattened and that there are devolved structures for people to raise issues, where comparisons can be made and recognition taken of the different policing needs of different communities and areas. I am seized of the point made by Senator Higgins about making the education of young gardaí like the education of others with whom they would be working. If that means being members of the USI, good luck to them. It might be managed by delaying the time of attestation or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">On the amendments, I welcome the introduction of the provision relating to human rights and the fact that the code of ethics is made mandatory. A sufficient mechanism for consultation is set out in the Bill to ensure that the Garda Commissioner has enough help to prepare a draft of this for the Minister. It is the Minister himself who will produce the code.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">One set of amendments does not seem to be included in the first group, where I expected to find them. These are amendments Nos. 109 to 114, inclusive. They are technical amendments and I cannot find them anywhere else. The amendments affect the same item, where the word "member" is deleted and "person" is substituted. I have no other comment on that grouping of amendments. I thank the Minister for taking on board many of the points made in the course of the debate.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_368" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_583">I identify with Senator Mansergh's comments. The notion that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and civil servants are conspiring to bear down on the Oireachtas and sweep away rights is utterly untrue. One only needs to examine the procedures followed with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">When I was appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2002, my Department commenced planning for a Garda Bill in the autumn of that year. I inherited a proposal for an inspectorate body that would function in the fashion of an ombudsman. We in the Department discussed this at great length and it was my view that the entire relationship between the Executive and the Garda Síochána should be re-stated in clear and modern terms. Many of the provisions in the earlier part of this Bill about statements of policy, directives and strategic planning for an Garda Síochána touch on this and did not exist before.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I wished to emphasise at the time that the Oireachtas is the body to which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be accountable with regard to police functioning, which is an extension of the Executive power of the State. I also looked to clearly state in the Bill that the Oireachtas and the Minister is in charge. One of the reasons for this was the difficulties encountered by me in my time as Attorney General in getting information necessary to discharge the functions of the office, such as advising the Minister of the appropriateness of his actions and conducting civil proceedings on behalf of the Irish people.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">It appeared to me that from the days of Peter Berry, there was micro-management of the police in every single respect, through officials of the Department being made Commissioner of an Garda Síochána and a very clear pyramid of authority which went directly to the Secretary of the Department of Justice. It was micro-management of a highly structured kind of policing in Ireland by a Department. By contrast, in later years the barometer had swung almost completely the other way to the point where Mr. Justice Morris found that the Department had become almost isolated from the policing function. This may be an over-simplification and it is not easy to deduce how it happened over the years but it was exacerbated when the Attorney General of the day ceased to be the prosecutor and the Director of Public Prosecutions became an independent prosecutor. The view took hold in the Department, among the Garda and in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that the relationship between the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions was at a level equal or superior to the relationship between the Department and the Garda. Part of this process led to the events being dealt with by Mr. Justice Morris, which I do not want to deal with in detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">When I commenced my term as Minister in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, re-stating the relationship between the Department and the Garda became a matter of huge importance. Instead of proceeding with complaints procedures against the Garda Síochána as a response to the situation existing then, the Department embarked on an ambitious programme to re-state the constitution of an Garda Síochána in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Having worked on this from September 2002 to summer 2003, the heads of the Bill were published in summer 2003 for a public consultation process. The Bill was also sent for drafting. The Bill was introduced in this House because of pressure of business in the Dáil. This facilitated reflective debate on the passage of the Bill through the Seanad. I pay tribute to the Members of the House for this, as the debate was constructive and without time wasting or negativity. The entire passage was constructive. The Bill was extensively amended in the course of the debate, with the inspectorate idea being introduced as it became necessary to respond to the initial findings of the first report of the Morris tribunal. This ensured that something would be in place to deal with the collapse of authority and morale in an Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Bill was extensively debated on its introduction in the Dáil. It received 21 hours on Committee Stage and the Government provided for a further 13 hours on Report Stage. Regrettably, two of the 13 hours on Report Stage were spent wrangling over whether enough time was provided. I will not criticise another House in the Seanad, but I was disappointed with this. A proposal to extend the sitting for two hours to compensate for lost hours was rejected. Walk-through divisions were called on Private Members' business, which used up more time.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Ultimately, a situation existed where huge amounts of time were wasted. A technical amendment being dealt with now, which moved a definition on a page because it was not in alphabetical order, was debated for half an hour. Much filibuster-type speaking occurred detailing what had happened, for example, at residents' association meetings in Chapelizod the previous week. I am glad to return to the Seanad in circumstances where the Bill will get a fair hearing.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">With regard to the procedures in this House for a Bill that returns from the Dáil, the rules are a matter for the Seanad. They are not made by me. Enough time is provided and I repeat what the Leader has said about sitting indefinitely, if necessary, to get the Bill right. On Committee Stage in the Dáil I indicated that I would sit all night until dawn if necessary to deal with all the proceedings.</p>

          <p eId="para_593">Business had to be continued. With regard to a point raised by Senator Maurice Hayes, I could have accepted the Labour Party's Private Members' business proposal, which would have deferred consideration of the Bill until a commission on policing had reported in 18 months' time. If I had done this, the next general election would be approaching with no work done on Garda reform, no change coming about, probably more bad news coming from the Morris tribunal, more paralysis and no start made on addressing the issues we now know require major reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Many other issues arise, such as a regional command structure and the necessity to avoid switching people unnecessarily. I encountered this recently with a person being promoted by Government. His biography, given to the Government as support material for his promotion, indicated that at the time he was made superintendent he was transferred to Cahirciveen for 11 months and then brought back to Dublin. Although I am sure he is a wonderful man and I will say nothing critical of him, I do not believe that his short stay as a commanding officer in Cahirciveen could have led to good policing. This churning process is not desirable. I do not want to deny promotion rights but one of the issues that must be addressed is the need for greater stability and continuity in policing particular areas. If people walk into an area from somewhere else and walk out again in a relatively short time, the chance of them having a clear view of the merits or demerits of the force and the requirements of their area are reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Senator Ryan referred to Garda training. It is a two-year process, which involves extensive training in stations, community work and so on. It is not similar to joining a Jesuit seminary where one is hidden from humanity in the middle of nowhere. Some 24 months are devoted to the entire process whereas six months is set aside for the equivalent process at Hendon, the British police training college. The jury is still on out on whether we are overly generous in that respect. The training of Garda members is complicated but, given that such time is provided, it should be used to maximum effect and a good, liberal education should be offered consistent with the needs of a disciplined force. It is not a commune of independent minded people who sit around on bean bags to discuss the future of the world.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_597">The Army is one example. During an impassioned contribution to a Private Members' debate in the Dáil, Deputy Costello pleaded with me to transfer elements of Garda training to a new campus in his constituency at Grangegorman. However, the public relations aspect of that would not be good. It would have been better to use the description, "north inner city Dublin".</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The traffic corps was mentioned. Senator Higgins and I have diametrically opposite views on what such a corps should entail. He argues that non-members of the Garda should carry out traffic policing duties. My officials and I examined that possibility carefully but we concluded that a force other than the Garda carrying out drink driving arrests and setting up road blocks would create major problems. It would need its own ombudsman commission and barracks. Where would arrested people be taken? Would the force have stations throughout the country or would it share Garda stations?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_374" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_600">We decided the traffic policing function would be retained by the Garda and an assistant commissioner is in charge of establishing the traffic corps as a separate division within the force. At least 600 of the 2,000 additional recruits will supplement the existing 500 road traffic complement of the Garda so that the corps will number approximately 1,200. The purpose of this is to increase road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">I make no apology for the need for a respected, disciplined force with a proper command structure to ensure road safety. I agree gardaí should have nothing to do with using speed cameras, issuing tickets and processing penalty points but proper policing of our roads contributes to proper security and improved Garda intelligence generally. It would be counterproductive to hive road traffic duties away completely from the Garda. It would not be good to deploy two separate forces to carry out this function in circumstances such as ours. If one wished to go down that route, one would have to think carefully about it but this is not the time to do it. A traffic corps is being established, which will comprise 1,200 members by 2007. It will be progressively beefed up to make the enforcement of road traffic law an integral part of the Garda's activities with adequate resources allocated to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">When Senator Brian Hayes referred to structures and regional policy, he argued for the re-establishment of the DMP but such a rigid force within a force approach on a regional basis would not be desirable. However, I take Senator Maurice Hayes's point that we must have stability and continuity and we cannot have churning and high turnover rates in respect of positions of authority if a decent quality of policing is to obtain.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The legislation is important and it is a necessary condition for the proper reform of the Garda but it is by no means sufficient in that there must be absolute change in management practices, attitudes and accountability measures. While this is a trellis on which the rows of a reformed Garda Síochána will grow, the legislation will not deliver the end result. It is important that the Garda should undergo a revolution in management style, attitudes and so on. It will begin in Templemore and end in the top room at the Phoenix Park. We are in a process of change throughout the force.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The change must begin now. Waiting for 18 months, as suggested by the Labour Party in the Dáil, or putting off the evil day to address this issue, is no good. The Garda needs change now. As Senator Maurice Hayes said, the wind is with us and the sails are full to undertake change now. If the sails are hauled down to reconsider the entire project and address it in the run up to the next general election or following the next general election, we will have lost at least two years of vital importance to the Garda Síochána and will have damaged the force significantly. While the legislation may not be perfect, it is as good as I can make it. The time has arrived to get on with the process of change and if an issue rears its head, which has not been addressed in the legislation, it can be dealt with. It will not be the end of the world.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_606">It has been suggested that promotions within the Garda are political. I am totally unaware of the party political allegiances of any senior member of the Garda Síochána. I do not know what are their sympathies. I have never had a discussion nor have I had an intelligent reflection on that subject. I am wholly unaware of their political outlook.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_378" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_608">The Bill, for the first time, provides for an independent system of promotions within the Garda with external people constituting the majority of every promotion board for sergeant, inspector, superintendent and chief superintendent. However, the three most senior appointments are dealt with on a discretionary basis by the Government. I assure the House I have gone through the process of filling the most senior position and party political attitudes had nothing to do with it but the Government of the day must have confidence, in the last analysis, that it is making the correct decision and it cannot hand over the process to somebody else. If one is in a position to fire somebody, one should be in a position to hire him or her and if one could not fire him or her, it would be a sorry day. I make no apology that the present system gives the Government a little discretion regarding the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner posts. Apart from that, the Bill will make it clear that the promotional system is operated independently and transparently with outside majority participation at every stage of the promotion ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">There have been people in the Garda Síochána who believed that somehow the Minister of the day influenced these decisions. People have come up to me during divisions and stuck notes in my pocket and so on, saying "remember so and so". This behaviour crosses the political divide. Every one of those notes goes into the wastepaper basket as soon as I get home.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Likewise, people think that the Minister transfers gardaí from one place to another around the country. No doubt that happened in the past but I have never had any hand, act or part in moving a garda from one place to another or anything to do with promotion. I will not do that. This legislation will bring about a new dispensation in regard to promotions, transfer and so on. Everything will be above board and transparent. The Garda Síochána deserves no less.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">I ask the Minister to address the second group of amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_380" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_612">The second group of amendments consists of amendments Nos. 4, 7, 8, 26 to 31 inclusive, 125 and 128.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">There was a lengthy discussion in this House and on Committee Stage in the Dáil on the provisions in the Bill dealing with what were originally termed "volunteer members" of the Garda Síochána. During the course of the latter debate I undertook to consider further some of the points raised and strongly pressed by some Deputies, particularly Deputies Jim O'Keeffe and Costello.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">These amendments arose from my consideration of those issues and were introduced on Report Stage. We changed the name from "volunteer members" to "reserve members" because some people said they might have to be paid gratuities, expenses or allowances to carry out their functions. The term "volunteer" suggested they would never receive recompense for anything they did. That was a reasonable change.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">The point was made that I was casting matters too rigidly in saying that the reservists would have all the powers of a member of the Garda Síochána in every circumstance, no matter what it was. Deputy Jim O'Keeffe argued strenuously that this should be qualified in some way and that there be a means to reduce powers for reservists in certain circumstances or to declare certain matters off-limits to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">At the time I said I had not come across any power or function likely to be given to a volunteer member, as the term then was, which it would be inappropriate for him or her to carry out. That decision should perhaps be left to the judgment of the Garda Commissioner, in light of the range of duties that could be assigned to reservists.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Therefore, I proposed the insertion of a new subsection (5) to allow the Commissioner determine the range of powers to be exercised and to tailor them to duties to be carried out by reserve members whose primary function is to assist gardaí in exercising their duty in particular situations. That change was made in response to an Opposition objection and proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I had originally provided in the Bill that a 12-month moratorium should occur between the Bill being brought into effect and the possibility of a reserve being created but Deputy Jim O'Keeffe argued that proposal was surplus to requirements. He thought if the reserve force was a good idea we should not postpone it in that way.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The implementation of this Bill will be quite complex and I do not see why, if we are establishing a reserve, we should back load and defer it to another day. The amendment removes the 12-month wait. This is not perceived in any way as a substitute for the Government's commitment to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000. That will happen by 2007. I want to make it clear that the 12-month moratorium is being removed at the request of an Opposition spokesman, not at mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">Amendment No. 27 is a drafting amendment which reflects a drafting convention preferred by the Parliamentary Counsel that a person "performs" rather than "exercises" a function.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_623">However, my party's stance is to support the reserve force. We welcome the change from "volunteer" to "reserve" as a sensible one. People want gardaí to be visible. The reserve force may provide a more visible presence on the streets and help gardaí carry out their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">We can learn from what has happened in other police forces around the world in regard to community policing and reserve forces. The experience has been positive in several places, including the United Kingdom. We were in London recently to look at the system where it works. The permanent police force there complimented the reserve officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">I note from these amendments that the Garda Commissioner has already put to the Minister proposals for training for reservists when appointed and regulations to be made concerning their recruitment. When will these proposals be published? I would be interested in seeing them because I asked about this issue when the Bill went through this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">There might be retired gardaí, members of the FCA, the Civil Defence and others who have some training in regard to discipline and so on. Will the reservists have the same two-year training that ordinary members of the Garda Síochána receive or what is the position in that respect? I am concerned about the prospect of giving the reserve force the same powers, duties and immunities as the ordinary members.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">Senator Higgins mentioned the same point in regard to the traffic corps. What will be the position of reserve members who deal with summonses, drunk driving and so on? They will assist a garda so the arresting officer would have to be the permanent member of the force. What happens when it comes to giving evidence, and the reserve member goes into court to support the permanent member of the force? I presume the reservist would be remunerated for having to attend at court. I would like that area to be teased out.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The change of title from "volunteer" to "reserve" is a good one and I am happy that the Minister has taken on board some of the amendments tabled on this matter in the other House, especially by my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. I remain concerned, however, about the matters I have raised.</p>

          <from>Dr. M. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_629">I too welcome the introduction of a reserve force. It could be very important, particularly in regard to community policing. This is especially so of the point the Minister made about continuity of contact. These people are more likely to be recognised in the community because they are likely to be older people with time to give to this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">I am glad the Minister proposed the amendment which enabled the commissioner to specify or restrict their range of activities. One could not imagine these people driving Garda vehicles or being armed. Their training must be tailored to what they do. One would not imagine that someone doing that out of public spirit would be able to give up two years. We will have to have a different sort of training. However, on the Patten commission, we were extremely keen that there be a part-time reserve, the main purpose of which was to anchor the police and give it contacts in local communities. I commend the Minister on that.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_631">I made no disparaging comments about individual officers of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is a corporate entity with a culture of its own. I know many people who work there. If people find out whom I know there, that will probably end their promotion prospects. Nevertheless, those whom I know there are the same as the rest of us. This is nothing to do with individuals. It is a culture and corporate ethos that has been there for as long as I have been here. When the Minister described the Peter Berry period, he described what I believe still to be the residual view there. Anyone who deals with the extraordinary immigration service and its two hours a week on the telephone knows it is still unique in how it deals with the rest of the world. I was not attacking individual civil servants. I do not do that, and I was not doing so in this case; I was talking about the "entity", if I might choose a neutral word.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">On the amendments, I will not try to rejig what we did months ago. I very much identify with what Senator Maurice Hayes said. Properly constituted, defined and trained, a Garda reserve can be a great <i>entrée</i> into communities — the best possible way for the Garda force. I am a little worried about amendment No. 37.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_634">I apologise. It is amendment No. 31, according to which the Garda Commissioner may determine the range of powers to be exercised and duties to be carried out by reserve members. Does he have to consult anyone? It is rather bald as it stands. I would not want to take from the Garda Commissioner his executive functions, but in the context of legislation trying to put together a structure and ethos of collaboration and modern management, the Garda Commissioner, apparently on his own, without reference to the Minister, the Department or anyone, may determine the range of powers to be exercised and duties carried out. I would hate that to be done without agreement and without its being at the initiative of the Garda Commissioner. That would be micro-management if it were the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, if I am permitted to mention it. If the Minister did that, it would be wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">However, to leave it to the Garda Commissioner, apparently without any need to consult anyone, is not a great idea either. It is not my biggest problem with these amendments, but it is a genuine issue that I hope the Minister might at least briefly address by saying what he thinks will happen. As it stands, it is extraordinary. While the reserve gardaí are on duty, they will have the powers, immunities, privileges and duties of any other member of the Garda Síochána. I would rather the Garda Commissioner to be obliged to take some advice on this before making such decisions.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_388" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_636">I agree completely with Senator Maurice Hayes that the big issue, also mentioned on Committee Stage by Senator Cummins, is that many members of the existing ranks regard this as some sort of effort to bypass or replicate them or produce what was ineloquently described as "yellow-pack" policing. Nothing could be further from my mind. I am talking about the new Ireland of today, in which the sergeant will not live with his wife in the back room of the station. That world is gone for ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Nowadays people commute 30 miles to work. If they commute to police Donnybrook from Ashbourne in County Meath and points west and north, in a sense the Garda Síochána will be in danger of deracination — having its roots removed — so that it floats above the community rather than being of it. Senators may find the idea of Donnybrook being policed by residents of Ashbourne strange, but the same applies to both the wealthiest and the least wealthy communities in Ireland. Is the Garda Síochána to have a presence in the least wealthy communities too? We must ask ourselves that question. Particularly where there is deprivation and exclusion, there should be closer links between the Garda Síochána and its functional area.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I know that all my words in this House are carefully noted by the Garda Representative Association executive and so on. This will enrich the experience of being a policeman in Ireland. It will not deprive any member of trade union leverage or anything else. It will have exactly the opposite effect, making the lives of full-time gardaí more rewarding, so that they have available to them the resource, the roots and the local connections a system of reserves will bring. I really do not believe that it is the threat perceived in some circles to their leverage, status or trade union clout.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_640">I honestly believe that quite the reverse is the case. The absence of a reserve in this State compared with Northern Ireland would, if left unchecked, widen the gulf between the Garda Síochána and the community at a time when we want to narrow the gap. I am strongly of the view that it has a positive potential in the interest of every single member of the Garda Síochána, particularly the full-time members.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">When we started, section 14(3) simply stated "While on duty, a volunteer member has the same powers, immunities, privileges and duties as a person appointed under <i>section 13</i> to the rank of garda”. That was baldly stated; they had every single power. I was roundly told on several occasions that it was too wide a proposition and that one did not want reservists given every power while on duty as of right that a member of the Garda Síochána has. I was told that I must qualify that in some way.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The real question was how I should do that. That broad statement was made subject to subsection (5), which gives the Commissioner the right to determine the range of powers to be exercised and duties to be carried out by reserve members. It states not that he must do it but that he may do so. He can leave it if he likes as in subsection (3) or he can delimit it in various ways. We have obvious examples, for example, whether one wishes members of the reserve to act as immigration officers, to carry firearms, or to be drawn into escort duties on cash transit and so on. There are plenty of matters in which the Commissioner should be given broad discretion to narrow the applicability of his reservists. This formulation is about as good as it gets.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Senator Ryan has rightly asked whether the discretion is too broad and whether the Commissioner should be required to consult the Minister of the day or gain his or her consent. I wanted to be flexible, since I believe that an issue will arise on some occasion. Fairly broad discretion must be built in. Section 15(1) states: "The Garda Commissioner may, subject to <i>subsection (4)</i> and the regulations, appoint persons as reserve members of the Garda Síochána to assist it in performing its functions.” The regulations are there as an overriding constraint on the Commissioner. In addition, Members should be aware that the Commissioner is not totally free in that he or she must provide an annual policing plan and a statement of strategies and must also comply with specific directives given by a Minister. There is plenty of room for a nuanced approach to this and it is not the case that a blank cheque is being offered to the Commissioner.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_645">The third group consists only of amendment No. 51 which deals with closed circuit television, CCTV, systems. I brought forward a Report Stage amendment in the Dáil which provides for the installation of CCTV equipment to allow for the recording of data in two sets of circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">I will briefly explain why this amendment was introduced at such a late stage. During the past year, the Secretary General of my Department and I have been concerned about the slow roll-out of CCTV and have found that the current arrangements are inadequate and ineffective. We decided a different approach must be put in place and that CCTV had to be kick-started across the country. In particular, we concluded that provision should be made for community-based CCTV systems, such as have operated in Moyross in Limerick, subject to proper safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">In that context, I asked the departmental officials who were dealing with that particular project to seek the advice of the Office of the Attorney General as to whether a statutory power was required to enable me to allow persons other than gardaí, community groups in particular, to operate CCTV. It was decided that such a statutory provision was required and that it would be safer to devise a statutory power that dealt with both Garda and community CCTV.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The first category relates to the installation and use of such equipment by the Garda Síochána for its own purposes connected with the functions set out in section 7 of the Bill. It also covers a situation where the Garda may wish to use the services of outside contractors with expertise in this field under direct Garda supervision and control. Outsourcing seems to be the new buzz word in many of these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The second situation that is envisaged relates to the installation and operation of community CCTV systems which are grant aided by community groups. I launched an initiative in this regard earlier this month which provides for grants for individual installations of up to €100,000, and the same again in RAPID areas, for approved installations which comply with the scheme operated by the Government. The purpose of this initiative is to provide in law for such recording to be conducted in public places with the aim of preventing, detecting and prosecuting offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">There are areas where the local chamber of commerce might decide that it could operate such a scheme and would apply for grant aid to do so. On the other hand, there are particular areas such as Moyross where a community-based CCTV system has brought a great sense of security to a community in the knowledge that activity in particular estates is recorded. That has been very successful. What worries me about this, however, is that local vigilantes might set up such a system. This amendment provides for a prohibition on such activity unless one is authorised to set up such a scheme. I do not want do-gooding vigilantes taking over the surveillance of their own areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The proposals I set out in the new section are in line with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Attorney General has advised requires that such recording should be authorised by law. They are also in conformity with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1988. It must be noted that although the restrictions in that Act on the processing of personal data do not apply to the Garda Síochána where the purpose of such processing is the prevention, detection and investigation of crime, the Act still applies to data controllers even when the restrictions of the Act do not apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The provisions of the amendment take account of this situation. In line with the Attorney General's advice, I have provided for a proper mechanism to allow the Garda to enter into contract arrangements with outside firms for the installation and operation of CCTV systems on its behalf and subject to its control. This section also provides for the installation of CCTV by community groups, subject to certain checks and balances having particular regard to privacy considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">In order to provide some context for the proposals, I will briefly outline the background. At present there is no legislative basis for the operation by the Garda or local communities of CCTV. The issue of evidence derived from Garda CCTV has been raised in criminal trials but the legality of Garda CCTV does not seem to have been challenged or been the subject of any adverse finding. Judgments could be regarded as implicitly supportive of CCTV such as that in the case of Mitchell <i>v</i>. the Director of Public Prosecutions which was reported in 2000 in <i>Irish Law Reports Monthly</i>. Footage from non-Garda CCTV has also featured in recent Supreme Court decisions, Bradish <i>v</i>. the Director of Public Prosecutions and Dunne<i> v</i>. the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">In April this year, my Department sought advice from the Attorney General as to whether legislation is required to regulate the use of CCTV in public places by the Garda and community groups. This was in the context of the initiatives I mentioned earlier. The Attorney General advised that, subject to confirmation with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, the Garda Síochána and local authorities — in the case of local community groups — are data controllers for the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1988 and are therefore the subject of section 13 which allows for codes of practice to be agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner and for their elevation to the status of statutory instruments. These codes of practice will regulate working with CCTV but would not authorise CCTV themselves. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner subsequently confirmed this position and supported the proposal to place the operation of CCTV on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">In addition, in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights that the interference with the rights of privacy of individuals recorded by CCTV is in accordance with law, it was necessary to provide in legislation for the conditions and circumstances in which CCTV might be put in place. Failure to do so would mean it could be regarded as a disproportionate and unlimited power.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">As the operation of surveillance for the purposes of crime prevention, investigation and prosecution is an executive function of the State, in order for it to be carried out on the authority of the Government, legislation should provide for the delegation of the function and for an authorisation system which would enable the Garda Síochána to supervise the operation of the system and to withdraw such authorisations as necessary. In the latter regard, the aim would be to prevent those private parties, be they community groups or otherwise, who have inadequate controls in place or who breach an individual's right to privacy from continuing to record image data. The provisions in this new section give effect to this advice and have been inserted as a new section into chapter 4 of the Bill which has been re-titled, "Co-operation with Local Authorities and Security in Public Places".</p>
          <p eId="para_657">Subsection (3)(<i>c</i>) of the new section 38, as it applies to local community-based CCTV systems, links in with the joint policing committees provided for in section 35. I could go into greater detail but the remainder of the section is self-explanatory.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cummins</from>
          <p eId="para_658">This is a new section that was not debated in this House. I am not even sure if it was reached on Report Stage in the other House. I cannot accept the Minister's explanation that the question of provisions regarding CCTV have only now arisen in regard to a Bill which has been in gestation for two years. The mind boggles in this regard because CCTV has been in operation for a considerable time with pilot projects in place eight or ten years ago. One of the initial pilot projects was supposed to take place in my own city but this never came about. It is disgraceful that an entirely new section was introduced on Report Stage in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">There are a number of questions in regard to this section and the Minister touched on only some of them. They include issues of staffing, monitoring, the controls that are available and the retention of footage. It is utterly undesirable that the lives of innocent people should be exposed. The Minister needs to provide further explanation in regard to the retention of CCTV footage and the controls in this regard. He dealt with some aspects of this but we are talking about a new section which should have been debated at length in both Houses. They way in which this has been included willy nilly is totally unacceptable. The Minister "shall issue guidelines" to the Commissioner regarding the supervision and control of the monitoring. What type of guidelines? We should know, as we discuss this section, the types of guidelines which will be put in place in terms of monitoring. This is the time and the debate to do so. With regard to "persons who meet the established criteria", what are these criteria? Why do we not have the established criteria in front of us? That is a broad area. We want to know and should be informed. This is the place where the issue should be debated. What are the guidelines and criteria? If we are asked after this Bill goes through, we will still be unable to answer and the public will not know what they are. They should be laid down.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The Bill then states that "the Government shall, by order, establish criteria for the purposes of <i>subsection 3(c)</i>”. An earlier line refers to subsection 3(<i>b</i>) and that different criteria for different classes may be established. It is again all up in the air. They are words without meaning. We want to put meat on the bone in the context of these criteria and guidelines. I hope that the Minister can do so this evening.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_664">It is commendable that the section is in the Bill. I further welcome the Minister's acknowledgement that the roll-out was not as expeditious as everybody would have liked. That is recognised by him and the Secretary General. There is a need to roll it out and ensure that CCTV use is expanded, particularly in urban areas. It was interesting to note that, within the past couple of weeks, a serious rape was detected because of the availability of CCTV footage. It was recognised that, without that footage, the successful prosecution of the crime would have been difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">This matter needs to be resourced as well as promoted. While this resourcing must be pioneered by the Department, partnerships may be also be formed with other agencies. The many positive aspects of this Garda Síochána Bill were recognised by all sides and speakers when it was formerly before this House. Undoubtedly, one such aspect is the introduction of a partnership with local government to ensure that policing receives attention and achieves a certain standard at local level. My town council and, in particular, Councillor Michael Sheehan, has for many years advocated that CCTV would be a significant aid in combatting some anti-social behaviour and criminal activities. We met with the Minister's predecessor in order to source funding for this matter. I welcome that. There is no reason a partnership could not be established with local authorities as well as with local communities. I see this as highly desirable and councils would be attracted to participating and becoming involved with the joint policing committee in the selection of locations where CCTV cameras could be installed.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I referred specifically to authorised CCTVs. I wonder whether a small lacuna exists. At present, many CCTVs are privately operated, in particular by banks and other institutions, businesses and chambers of commerce. I wonder whether they may be brought within the remit, possibly with minor grant aid, so that gardaí have direct access to the footage and they are seen as part of the overall combatting of crime and anti-social behaviour in targeted areas. This may make a significant contribution to the control and maybe even the deterrence of crime but especially to its subsequent detection. I welcome the introduction of this useful section to the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_398">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_667">Some of my more civil libertarian allies have reservations over CCTV. Indeed, some of them had reservations over the use of CCTV for traffic control purposes. They got worked up because some of the cameras had zoom lenses which, they suggested, meant that everybody could be watched. I do not share those views. It is foolish not to use modern technology to defend the rights of ordinary citizens. Modern technology must be regarded as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">I have a series of questions for the Minister on this matter. Does he not think that it is somewhat centralising to give this authority to the Garda Commissioner? For example, subsection (2) notes that the Garda Commissioner shall specify the areas. It is a little ludicrous that the Garda Commissioner in the Phoenix Park should decide which streets in, for example, Montenotte, where I live, should have it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_399">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_669">I would not think they are needed in Montenotte.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_400">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I am rendered speechless by Senator Walsh. We do not need them as Montenotte is very pleasant and quiet. I sound like I am trying to sell my house. I am not but it is a pleasant and quiet area. We have no problems to shout about.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I do not know whether permission is still needed from the Garda Commissioner to put double yellow lines on a street. We got away from that and let local authorities make these decisions. The first proposal to pedestrianise a street in Cork was approved by the city council and disapproved by the Garda Commissioner. It would not have transpired but for the discovery by the ingenious city manager that he possessed the unqualified power to close the street for repairs. He therefore closed it permanently for repair, repaired it and left it in that state until sense prevailed. I wonder about the Garda Commissioner deciding on that level of detail. I do so in a constructive manner. I am not trying to be awkward or to delay the Minister on the matter. I am concerned over that type of centralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I am also concerned over the wording of subsection (1), which refers to the operation of CCTV for the "sole or primary purpose". I have no problems with the sole purpose but if it is accepted that the primary purpose is the commendable one, what are the secondary purposes? Otherwise, why is "primary" needed? The implication is that the primary purpose is to perform the tasks we all desire. The secondary may be established by the local community. What need exists for the term "primary purpose"? CCTV, as established under this section, should be about the sole purpose. I do not understand the ambiguity in terms of primary purpose and would be interested in an explanation on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Some other matters crossed my mind. A clause must exist somewhere in the Bill which states that, if the Minister issues guidelines, the Garda Commissioner must implement them rather than receive them as guidelines. Guidelines exist for An Bord Pleanála under which, we are told, they are not obliged to operate. They must have regard to the guidelines. I assume that the Garda Commissioner must act if he receives guidelines, in which case we might as well call them instructions and be done with it. I am interested in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I would like to ask the Minister questions on a number of other issues. Is the destruction of these records covered in this section? I may have missed it as it is a long section. I read it two or three times. The capacity to store audio-visual data is constantly improving. The amount of space required to store thousands of gigabytes of data in any medium is probably 1% of what it was. We should not allow this type of material to be stored indefinitely by default because not only is it inherently bad, but the Internet is awash with vast quantities of material described as recorded by various forms of closed circuit television. If we keep this information indefinitely it could turn up for sale in California. It may be of a voyeuristic nature, as people do strange things in public places, not all of which are illegal but they might well be embarrassing. An issue surrounds the retention of this material and a good case can be made for provision, at least in the guidelines for the Garda Commissioner, for securing and destroying this material as it ceases to be relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">I would like reassurance from the Minister on a point raised by Senator Jim Walsh. I assumed if CCTV was used in private firms it would automatically be available as evidence. Is it explicit in law that it must be available? If fraud is suspected in a bank and the bank has a CCTV system is the Garda investigation into a crime in that bank entitled as a matter of course to have access to that CCTV system? One would be entitled to have access to paper records to investigate a fraud. It seems extraordinary if we have not clarified that matter at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I am sceptical about the definition of CCTV. The legislation refers to a fixed and permanent system. A certain mobile phone operator has had great fun with the planning laws by putting up what it always describes as temporary structures, which therefore were not covered by legislation. I do not know why it is necessary to put reference to a fixed and permanent system in the legislation. It leaves room for people to play with the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">In general I am never reluctant to argue with this Minister but I am often reluctant to argue with him on matters exclusively to do with law. The definition of a public place includes areas where the public have or are permitted access whether as of right or by express or implied permission. I know it is meant to include sporting events but it seems more broad than is necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_688">I have some reservations about the point on retention of material which is no doubt made for civil libertarian reasons. News reports today included coverage of a Garda investigation into a murder that occurred 32 years ago. In some cases events come to light five, ten or 15 years after they occur. I would not be in any hurry to destroy records. Cases of abuse of CCTV coverage by public authorities might alter that, but the reality is that so much information is recorded that unless people who wish to make use of it know precisely for what they are searching and why they are doing so, it is like searching for a needle in a haystack. I would not be greatly concerned that a storage facility of CCTV coverage from five or ten years ago would be open to abuse. In many instances if we had records we would be in a better position to pursue convictions for crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">With regard to amendments referring to the Garda Commissioner or the Minister specifying matters, in reality this is done on the basis of submissions and consultations. The Garda Commissioner does not wake up some fine morning and decide to put CCTV in Listowel or Adare. It means he will make the final decision on submissions received. If one considers all the possible quibbles, qualifications and conditions, legislation would be impossibly long, and this legislation is already long. One must be wary of entangling decision makers in so many different procedures that it becomes difficult to progress matters expeditiously. I welcome the new section of the Bill without qualification or quibble.</p>

The Minister might consider subsection (11) in terms of the guidelines dealing with the type of issues raised. It seems right to give power to the Commissioner but I imagine a Commissioner in any ordered society would also have the power to delegate it down the line to be dealt with locally. It seems to be the type of function that ideally should be discussed with local policing partnerships as Senator Walsh suggested.</p>

He can devolve some of his functions by name or by rank to different people.

          <p eId="para_710">The guidelines can deal with the question of destruction if it is an issue. When guidelines are issued, I draw the House's attention to the fact that the directives will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as possible after they have been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">When this Bill was being drafted, I noticed on the draft that there was a prohibition on operating unlawful CCTV. I asked about banks, post offices, pubs, night clubs and so on and said that we had better provide for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_714">On the fixed and permanent system, that was put in again at my insistence. I will give an example of that, although I do not want to get into the question of guilt or innocence. The spraying of graffiti on Jewish sites in Dublin was the subject of video surveillance. I do not want an <i>ad hoc</i> camera which is put up to stop a particular activity being the subject of permission from the Garda Commissioner, consultation with local policing committees and so on. There are <i>ad hoc</i> uses of cameras in public places for particular crimes. If a journalist is under threat and we want to put up a camera near his or her house, we do not want to have to go through all of this procedure to do something on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Likewise, the example I gave was a useful tool for the gardaí to stop that activity. I do not want to talk about any pending court proceedings.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this issue. My concerns relate to a health centre in Castleknock. My understanding is that the centre might not have a sufficient number of dentists to deal with emergencies and routine treatment of children in the area. I ask the Minister of State to consider that in the light of my concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I have written to the Health Service Executive about the issue and received no less than two letters stating that an investigation is being carried out over a period of some six weeks. In view of the impending summer recess, I decided to raise this matter on the Adjournment. I await the Minister of State's reply.</p>

        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_432">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_719">I am taking this Adjournment matter this evening on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Senator Morrissey for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the position in regard to the dental unit at theRoselawn Health Centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">As the Senator is aware, the Health Act 2004 provided for the Health Service Executive, which was established on 1 January 2005. Under the Act, the executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. This includes the delivery of public dental services. Nonetheless, I am happy to convey the information provided by the Health Service Executive on the specific question raised by the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">The dental centre at Roselawn Health Centre is one of 11 dental centres providing services to a distinct geographical area. There are five treatment areas located within the Roselawn Health Centre. Dental staff are distributed between the 11 dental centres based on the best possible combination to meet the dental needs and demands of the service users. The distribution is under constant review to ensure that the resources are provided to their greatest efficiency and maximum effectiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Currently, there are 14.7 whole-time equivalent clinicians employed in the Roselawn dental area consisting of 11.7 whole time equivalent dentists and three whole time equivalent hygienists. Roselawn dental area has a complement of 17.8 whole time equivalent clinicians. Thus, there are vacancies for 3.1 whole time equivalent clinicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Taking into account the fact that there are a number of unfilled clinicians posts in theRoselawn dental area, there are naturally some limitations on the dental services being provided. However, I am pleased to inform the House of the dental services currently being prioritised.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">A daily emergency service, with no appointment needed, is provided for all eligible children at each surgery that has a dentist on duty. At the emergency service a dentist provides relief of pain and trauma using a number of temporary or permanent treatments. Consultation and advice is given to anxious parents or guardians with respect to dental issues which cause concern. In addition, screening and routine dental treatment is provided to second and sixth class national schoolchildren, with priority being given to permanent teeth. The service is focused on those locations in the geographical area with high levels of dental disease and social deprivation, as identified annually using indices of dental decay and the Department of Education and Science's designated school lists. Furthermore, screening and routine dental treatment of all special needs children and adults in the dental area is provided. Finally, where indicated by medical or dental abnormalities, baby teeth are filled.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Despite the existing vacancies, there has been a high patient throughput in the Roselawn dental area. The figures for 2004 show 20,711 children were seen in the Roselawn dental area, of which 8,114 were seen at the Roselawn health centre. Furthermore, of the 20,711 children seen in the Roselawn dental area, 5,048 were child emergencies, of which 2,073 were seen at the Roselawn health centre. As noted, the Health Service Executive has the responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, public dental services. The executive will continue to set priorities within available resources on an ongoing basis.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeMcHugh" eId="spk_434">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_727">Without mentioning the name of the child involved, I raise this matter in light of an individual case at Ballyheerin national school, County Donegal, of which details have been supplied. This child has been receiving one-to-one support through the facilitation of a resource teacher on an ongoing basis. The work that has been achieved to date, according to his parents and the school principal, can be summed up by stating that the child has been blossoming due to the help or facilitation that has been offered.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I emphasise that this is not a severe case as the child has only a moderate learning difficulty. However, if he is making progress as is the case, a point echoed by his parents and the school principal and staff, we should study this closely. If the child does not get a continuation of sustained learning resource support, what will happen down the line? Is it not an obligation on us, as legislators, and officials within the Department of Education and Science to continue with support if it is working? It is working, it is not broken, so why are we trying to change it?</p>
          <p eId="para_729">That is in regard to the individual. The bigger issue concerns the whole ethos behind clustering. I would agree with the idea of clustering, namely, the grouping of small rural primary schools and the appointment of good, dedicated resource teachers to work in them. There is a cluster in the region in question, made up of Doaghbeg, Cashel, Croaghross, Drumfad and Tamney national schools, and including Ballyheerin national school. The combination of those rural primary schools work together for the overall betterment of students with special learning difficulties. Should we not be working extremely hard to try to facilitate the students in these schools?</p>
          <p eId="para_730">To refer to the ethical dimension, the consequence of this one child losing 3.5 hours of resource teaching means that the teacher who has worked in a dedicated manner in all of these schools will, unfortunately, lose his job. It is a double edged sword. On the one hand, a student is losing out and, on the other, the rural area is losing a dedicated support teacher. I am not saying there is anything sinister in this. However, I would ask an obvious question on the grounds that in a similar rural area across Lough Swilly, there is a similar problem with clustering. The deficit at a school in that area — ScoilChoilmcille, Malin, school roll No. 146310 — is perhaps one hour, but this will possibly result in the loss of another dedicated, professional and highly motivated teacher.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">Although I can assume the content of the Minister's reply, a bigger issue is at stake. We are introducing clustering as a way to ensure that disadvantaged rural schools, many in CLÁR areas, are facilitated in terms of special needs supports while, on the other hand, the reduction of a few hours means that the schools involved do not get the dedicated core staff required to carry out special needs teaching. It must be asked whether children with moderate learning difficulty are being discriminated against in terms of the special learning support they require. Are they discriminated against as a result of budgeting or the Department's ability to fund a special needs teacher?</p>
          <p eId="para_732">It is a complicated issue and I have no evidence on it. However, to consider the issue head-on, one would wonder whether it is a numbers game, a financial game or a sinister attempt to keep hours down so rural areas will be deprived of special needs support. I have given two examples. I ask the Minister, Deputy Mary Hanafin, to re-examine the total roll number at Ballyheerin national school, which was supplied with notice of the Adjournment matter, and the case at Malin, which I do not want to discuss at length as I do not have as much knowledge on it as on the case at Ballyheerin.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" eId="spk_435">
          <from>Mr. T. O’Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_733">I thank the Senator for affording me the opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science concerning the provision of special educational needs resources for the pupil in question, who is currently enrolled in a mainstream school in County Donegal. An application for resource teaching support in respect of the pupil in question was submitted to the Department of Education and Science by the school and was reviewed by the National Educational Psychological Service in December 2004. The outcome of the review was that the pupil's needs fall within the high incidence category.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">In this context, the Senator will be aware that a new general allocation system has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs. More than 600 extra resource teaching posts are being provided in our primary schools from next September to underpin the introduction of the new scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school. This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which schools with a high incidence of special educational needs required a psychological assessment for every child before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away. The school this pupil is attending has been informed that it has received a teaching allocation of five part-time hours under the general allocation scheme to meet the needs of pupils such as the one referred to by Senator McHugh.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">It is up to the school to use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different pupils to ensure all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. However, others do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">While the new scheme will not prevent schools from giving one-to-one time with the resource teacher to children that need it, one-to-one teaching is not the best option for every child. The Senator may be aware that the National Council for Special Education, which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is now responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports and deciding on the level of support appropriate to the school. Some 71 special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been recruited throughout the country and will be a focal point of contact for schools and parents. The local SENO has confirmed that to date no application for additional special educational needs supports has been received in respect of the pupil in question. However, should the school wish to forward additional supporting documentation not previously considered in respect of this pupil to the relevant SENO, arrangements will be made to have the matter examined further. I thank Senator McHugh once again for giving me the opportunity to clarify the position on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. While I am not able to give forensic detail on whether the school applied to the SENO, as far as I am aware it did. If the case is not documented on the system this may be the opportunity for the school to do so. I will advise the board of management of the school accordingly.</p>
