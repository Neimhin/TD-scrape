          <p eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to instruct his senior veterinary officials to provide farmers with access to movement permits and identity cards for their livestock in the areas where the strike of clerical staff prevents farmers accessing their entitlement, and to process REPS applications and farm grants that have been unattended since November 2000 which is causing financial hardship to those families.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan on the following matter:</p>
          <p eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to increase funding for Irish emigrant welfare organisations in Australia.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_7">Yesterday the Public Offices Commission published the spending of all candidates in last year's general election. Two issues arise from that which we should debate in the House. One is the timeframe in which election spending is monitored. This is quite absurd because huge sums of money can be spent by candidates in advance of that monitoring period. We need to debate this issue because it could lead to a serious distortion of the election result.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">The other issue concerns the reason most Ministers and Ministers of State exceeded the expenditure limit, namely, the value that was put on the support they were given by their ministerial offices. For a three week period, significant sums of money were added to the election spend of some of the Leader's colleagues. There is an important constitutional issue in this. If such money is available to Ministers and Ministers of State during three weeks of a campaign, imagine the value over 12 months or a four year parliamentary term. We need to address this issue because the same level of support is not in place for Government backbench and Opposition Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">There must be a genuine debate on whether it is right that Ministers can use vast sums of public money for their own constituency purposes. We already know the value for three weeks. If that is multiplied to take account of longer periods, it is clear that millions of euro are spent every year promoting Ministers and Ministers of State in their constituencies at the expense of Members in other political parties and those in their own. We need to debate this issue because it has serious constitutional implications. Perhaps the Leader would make time available to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">I welcome the comment yesterday by Fianna Fáil MEP, Niall Andrews, a distinguished Dublin Member of the European Parliament for the past 20 years or so, when he described neutrality as a sham. I fully agree with him on that, as does my party.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Will the Leader allow time for a debate on our motion, No. 32, in the name of Senator Bradford and my Fine Gael colleagues? I suspect this motion does not have the support of a majority of the House, but I, among others, have been calling for a debate on neutrality for a long time. Now we know the position of our party and I encourage other parties to put their views on the record. An open-ended debate in which we can discuss our motion and the views of our colleagues in other parties would be very useful from the point of view of airing nationally our views on neutrality, given that there are many views on this issue among all the parties.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">Cúpla seachtain ó shin chuir muid Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla fríd an Teach seo to give rights to people from the Gaeltacht and to Irish speakers. Bhí grúpa anseo inné ó Chorca Dhuibhne, from Ventry national school. The school is losing a teacher, but if it was a Gaelscoil in the Galltacht it would retain that teacher. I would like somebody to come here to explain this injustice and discrimination against Gaeltacht people. Sin é díreach an rud a bhí idir láimhe agam ag cur i gcoinne a lán rudaí sa Bhille sin. It is utterly unfair on Gaeltacht people. Every time we take a decision on the Irish language it discriminates in some way against them. That is completely wrong. I ask that the Minister come in and explain to ordinary people why people in the Gaeltacht are getting less support to run their schools and develop the Irish language than people in the Galltacht.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">When I came here 16 years ago, certain conventions and rules were made very clear to all of us. This is not a cheap shot but a matter of some importance. One of these conventions was that we do not make reference in the House to people's absence, and we certainly do not make references publicly, in either House, about what goes on in the Members' bar. It is absolutely outrageous for people to make references such as this in the House. I do not know the reasons behind it or why the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was in the Members' bar, although I did listen to his explanation. I have argued many times that Ministers should come in to deal with Adjournment matters in both Houses, but incidents such as this are just not acceptable.</p>

We should not sign that away, taking the choice away from the people so that they are compelled to become involved in conflict because of some treaty or agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Over the last 30 years, this State has dealt quite successfully with violent threats to its security – threats with which no other country in western Europe had to deal – without being involved in a military alliance. We had armed terrorism in our own State and operating out of it, but we did not need a military alliance to deal with it. I have no problem with an intelligent debate on neutrality, but every time I have heard that phrase used the real implication has been that we should figure out a way of getting rid of it. I am prepared to have a debate about neutrality any time. We need to discuss what it means, what the future holds for us and what we should do about it. I am not persuaded that we need to become involved at this stage in any alliance in which we are obliged in advance, without having the right to consider the merits of such a course of action, to become involved in an armed conflict. That is a good position to have and it is one we should retain.</p>

Two countries have been devastated, as has Palestine, and as far as anybody can see terrorism is becoming more virulent, more extensive and more threatening to more people. We need to counsel those with much more power than we have to stand back and explore possible remedies for terrorism. If what happened in the Middle East yesterday is to be replicated day after day and week after week, it will push us in entirely the opposite direction to that desired by many who talk about the war on terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">I invite the Leader to let us have some time before we adjourn to talk about the issue of terrorism in the world. We need to do a lot more than have one military invasion after another because that tactic is manifestly not working.</p>

The horrific pictures of carnage coming from other parts of the world in recent times should be a reminder for everybody to remember from whence we came. The great danger is that if we allow a vacuum to continue, we could go back to the dark days we had before. I suggest to the Leader that before the summer recess we should have a debate on this subject. I know we have had many debates on Northern Ireland, but this time we should agree that its focus should be reconciliation and partnership. We have the opportunity of making a reasoned and balanced contribution in these dangerous times.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">The House will recall that three weeks ago, we welcomed the appointment of the new Garda Commissioner designate, Noel Conroy, and tributes were paid to him and to the outgoing Commissioner. One of the features of the term of office of the outgoing Commissioner was a series of internal inquiries about the conduct of the Garda Síochána. In particular, I am thinking of the inquiry set up in relation to the Veronica Guerin murder after a confession by Paul Ward was thrown out by the Central Criminal Court. Another was set up in relation to the Dean Lyons affair, in which this tragic man was wrongly accused of the murder of two psychiatric patients at Grangegorman.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">There was a series of internal Garda investigations into the goings-on in Donegal. There was also an internal Garda investigation into events during the "Reclaim the Streets" protest, when Army deafness was replaced by Garda blindness. However, we have never seen a report in respect of the findings of these inquiries. In the interests of the Garda Síochána, such reports should be subject to public scrutiny.</p>

At every GAA championship match during the current season, Garda video cameras have been used to scan the crowds. I do not know what purpose this serves. A feature of the GAA has always been – we are extremely proud of the fact – that violence never erupts in the crowds attending matches and there is never a need to segregate people. However, the Garda Síochána is insisting that, at every championship match, its video cameras should scan the crowds. That is daft and it is a waste of Garda resources. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be asked to come before the House to discuss the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Garda investigations and the deployment of gardaí.</p>

There is an undeclared war taking place in the region and it is a matter of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, with car bombs, assassination attempts and general carnage. The superior Israeli force is well supplied with American equipment, while the Palestinians are badly equipped. This House should debate the matter.

Two schools, at Ventry and Cloghane, are being treated badly and in a discriminatory manner by the Department of Education and Science. Yesterday, in a united fashion, the Ventry community sent representatives, including one of the teachers, to Dublin to meet the Minister for Education and Science or an official. Sadly, they failed to meet either. They met the Minister who represents the constituency as a Member of the Dáil, but there was not much he could do yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The schools were given a commitment in writing and they have established that their enrolment numbers are increasing. They had a health and safety report carried out in respect of portacabins, etc., but it would cost a great deal more to implement the recommendations in the report than it would to provide the extra teacher in respect of whom they have already received a commitment. As Senator O'Toole stated, if we were talking about a Gaelscoil situated a few miles outside the Gaeltacht, there would be no problem. This is a ludicrous policy on the part of the State.

With respect, the Minister has broken the golden rule of negotiation, namely, that there is no such thing as a free lunch. He has totally weakened our position. The situation needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I again call on the Leader to use her good offices in this regard.

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_63">Mr. Begg made a moving contribution about the moral responsibility of countries within the EU, such as Ireland, to the countries of Africa. He had, as head of Concern, a background in this area and had seen, first-hand, the effects of the internecine civil wars which have ravaged that continent. At a time when matters of great import are being discussed at the Convention on the Future of Europe, while I would not go so far as to agree with Deputy Andrews's concept of Irish neutrality as a sham, I believe, however, it has been used as a convenient cloak by successive Administrations since the Second World War. The original concept of neutrality was based on a decision taken by leaders who had fought the British Government some 20 years earlier. If they had abandoned neutrality or taken the Allied side formally in the Second World War, it would, inevitably, have meant that British troops being stationed in the then Irish Free State. It was as much a pragmatic political decision as it was ideological.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">If we consider the changes that have taken place in Europe, the shifting sands of politics on the Continent and the different priorities being placed on a common foreign and defence policy, it would be an absolute derogation of national duty for this country to opt out of its responsibilities to those who may need our help. Although there has been a tacit acceptance of the vagueness of neutrality, we should at least establish where we are going and what should be our commitments to our fellow citizens in the European Union and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">I also echo the comments of Senator Leyden. It is with regret that I, as a spokesperson on foreign affairs in this Parliament, have to say that I believe that the Israeli Defence Forces – IDF – are out of control. They are beyond political control within the body politic of Israel. Many people will have seen a programme called "The Killing Zone" last week, which showed in very stark detail what is happening in the occupied lands of Palestine. Those of us from Ireland who have a rare insight into conflict within communities in Northern Ireland, know in our hearts and souls that, despite repeated killings, talks eventually have to take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I speak with great compassion in respect of what Israeli citizens have been experiencing through horrific instances of suicide bombings, of which there was a further example yesterday. I have great sympathy for the Israeli people who are caught in their geographical location. However, I urge their Government to rein in the IDF, which is taking the law into its own hands. I regret to say that its forces are operating in a manner comparable to that of the Nazis during the Second World War. They are shooting people out of hand and seeking to justify it. It is time the Israeli Defence Forces were reined in. We in this Parliament, as friends of the peoples – Israelis and Palestinians – of the region have a responsibility to put our views on record. I strongly support the call for a debate on the matter as soon as possible.</p>

Ireland is rapidly becoming one of the most expensive countries in the European Union. I compliment Senator Leyden on his name and shame list and his endeavours in this regard in recent weeks. However, I suggest that the Senator should add one further group to the list, namely, the Government. Half of the increased costs over the past 12 months are directly attributable to the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I join in the support for Senator Brian Hayes's call for a debate on neutrality. Niall Andrews, MEP, must be admired for what he said because he spoke in the context of the Second World War and the present situation, and we all know things have dramatically changed since. Unless we redefine what we mean by neutrality, ours will be seen as an <i>à la carte</i> approach. There are many people who felt during the recent conflict in Iraq that we breached our neutrality on the Shannon issue. Leaving that aside, if we want to be part of modern Europe and if we want to be involved rather than to adopt an “I stepped in and I stepped out again” approach, it is important for us to have a role. It is timely that we should debate the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">I am surprised at what my colleague, Senator Higgins, stated regarding scanning GAA matches. Any of us who attend matches will know that there is no necessity for that. When has one ever seen any crowd violence at matches? Recently I attended a thrilling game between Waterford and Limerick which was filled with emotion and drama. One never sees crazy crowd scenes at matches. It is a waste of Garda resources. In fact, having scanned the recent matches in Croke Park, perhaps there is an over-deployment of Garda resources at many of these big matches. One could deploy the scarce resources more effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">An issue which I have raised many times in this House is the radiotherapy report. The report has been finalised for some time. It has been leaked that it will recommend the provision of radiotherapy services in centres of excellence in Dublin, Cork and Galway. It looks as if Waterford and Limerick will be left out. As I have stated in the past on the Adjournment, in our area the Government is disadvantaging about 350,000 who will not have a proper radiotherapy facility in the area. This is a considerable inconvenience to people, who must travel to St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">It would cost approximately €1 million next year to finance a radiotherapy facility in the Regional Hospital in Limerick. The area is available and planning permission has been received, etc. Like other areas, we demand and should get that service and we should not be treated as second-class citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">I support my colleagues' call for a debate on neutrality. It is important that we look at this issue and define it, and that for a change we are honest about it. I really do believe in Irish neutrality in terms of keeping ourselves out of military alliances. We should put the most effective weight we can behind the United Nations peacekeeping initiatives. I feel that particularly when people raise the spectre of the tragedy of former Yugoslavia. A properly equipped, properly supported, properly mandated United Nations force is, in my opinion, the way to go. Creating further armies around power centres throughout the globe is a recipe for further war.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">We were told at Amsterdam, Utrecht and Nice by the Government that our neutrality was not compromised. Recently they have been saying there is nothing left of our neutrality after Amsterdam, Utrecht and Nice, making precisely the points that those of us who were critical of those treaties were making at the time. Let us be honest about it, tell the Irish people and know exactly where we are going.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">I also support the call for a debate on the Middle East. To my surprise, Senator Mooney is slightly naive when he stated that the Israeli Defence Force is out of control. It is very much under the control of people like Mr. Sharon, who has made it utterly clear that he will subvert the peace process. Orders were given from the top for the targeted assassination of Hamas spokesmen, who were going to and from meetings where they were trying to negotiate a ceasefire.</p>

I am talking about the situation there where innocent people are being killed, and where, for example, in a previously targeted attack, a 1,000 lb. bomb was dropped where they expected somebody from Hamas to be and 15 civilians were killed. The really sinister aspect is that there is political direction by the Israeli Government and it pains me to have to say it.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">I ask the Leader to raise the following matters with the appropriate Minister. This morning we had a useful and interesting meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport. It highlighted that as a result of the precipitated deregulation of taxi services Ireland has been cited in a Swedish report as the worst example of deregulation of 13 capital cities of Europe surveyed, but also that as a result of this deregulation the number of wheelchair accessible taxis has dropped from 800 to 13, which is astonishing when we are supposed to be looking at the rights of people with a disability.</p>

Perhaps the Leader of the House would facilitate us by stating when she will take this motion in the name of all the Fine Gael Senators.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">We seem to be flying all over the world trying to solve problems in different parts of the globe and neglecting the home front. Farming here is facing extinction unless the Government is prepared to take action. Incomes have dropped in every sector of farming. Young people are leaving the land. Every parish is affected because the people are not prepared to accept the hardships their fathers and forefathers had to put up with. It is important that we have a debate as soon as possible on the Fischler CAP reform proposals. This is of the utmost importance to people involved in farming, to people living in rural Ireland and to the economy generally. Perhaps the Minister would afford us time next week for a debate on the Fischler proposals.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">On the home front, I want to add my weight to Senator Cummins's call yesterday for a debate on the future of our international sports stadia. There is strong speculation that the capacity of Lansdowne Road will be reduced from 44,000 to 23,000 under new regulations. I highlight the concerns today in the aftermath of the friendly carnival event in Lansdowne Road last night enjoyed by people from all over the country, from Cork to Donegal, and even the Leader's Westmeath. We must focus our debate on the people of Ireland who follow and enjoy sport and go to these games, not on the organisations such as the FAI and the GAA or on the politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">We urgently need to have a debate on our future fisheries policies. We now have a opportunity following the great news from the European Parliament that the Irish Box will be protected, but at the same time due to the restrictions on tonnage small Irish fishing boats are not being allowed to fish. On the one hand we are getting massive grants to dredge and upgrade our harbours, but at the same time we are driving the small fishermen from our ports.

It is now June and he has failed to meet Waterford City Council on the issue again, as he had promised. As a body, Waterford City Council is now coming to protest next week because of the failure of the Minister to publish this report. It is of paramount importance for people with cancer problems that radiotherapy facilities should be made available in the regional hospitals. It is a disgrace that this report has not been issued following promises for the past 18 months that it would be.</p>

There are many issues to be considered. A price was put upon the size of one's office and the amount of time spent in the office as against the size of one's room. Other extraneous issues were also considered. I agree that a debate would be useful in highlighting these issues. There is a need for a debate on the dichotomy between a campaign which lasts for five years as distinct from a campaign lasting three weeks.

A number of Government amendments were also tabled which Senators will acknowledge have improved the Bill. A small number of amendments tabled by Opposition Senators required further detailed consideration but, unfortunately, the period of time between Committee and Report Stages was not sufficient for me to bring back considered responses to this House. I have promised, however, to raise such issues on Committee Stage in the Dáil, which I understand will take place on Wednesday, 2 July, and report back to this House before the summer recess, on Friday, 4 July. I hope this will enable the Bill to be enacted by mid-July, thereby giving entitlements to some 70,000 fixed-term contract workers, particularly in the area of pay and pensions.

While certain aspects of the legislation need to be sorted out, I acknowledge the fact that the Minister of State was so open to Opposition amendments. I am sure Senator Coghlan will support me in this regard. The Minister of State listened to issues of concern and both he and his officials were quite open to new ideas.

          <p eId="para_133">I also record my appreciation of the Minister of State and his officials. I thank them for their careful and kind consideration. I concur with the remarks expressed by Senator O'Toole. The Minister of State has shown his respect for this House by considering the amendments brought forward by Senators. He has agreed to consider certain amendments before the Bill is examined by the Dáil and bring forward suggestions in that House. He will report back to this House after the Bill has been amended in the other House. It is important that we record our appreciation of the bodies mentioned by Senator O'Toole, IBEC and the ICTU. A great deal of work has been done by the social partners at national and European level, for example, by keeping an eye on the framework directive from which this legislation flowed. I express my appreciation of the Minister of State and his officials once more.</p>

          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_134">I join my colleagues in thanking the Minister of State for the attention he has given to this Bill. I thank the House for accepting amendments proposed by Senators on all sides of the House. The former Senator Pat Kennedy was a member of the Opposition when I was bringing through the Companies Bill as Minister of State. He expressed some most helpful ideas and thoughts in relation to the legislation at the time. I commend the Minister of State for his willingness to listen to others and assure him that Senators appreciate the fact that he is bringing so much legislation through this House. His attendance and that of his senior officials is also appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">It is important that information is given to the public, as a great deal of legislation is being passed. We must ensure, for example, that the 70,000 who will benefit from this Bill are properly informed, for example, on a website or by e-mail. Perhaps the Department's website could provide a summary of the Bill to communicate the attractiveness of the new provisions to those who will be affected. The Minister of State and his officials, as well as IBEC and the ICTU, have put a great deal of work into it. The public may not be aware of the benefits to them of the legislation going through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">My colleague, Senator O'Toole, who is the 16th member of the Cabinet, is playing a very important role in Irish life. When negotiating with IBEC, however, I wonder why he did not ensure trainee nurses, trainee gardaí and members of the Army were not excluded from the remit of this Bill. He should have concerns in that regard. As a nominee of such organisations in the Seanad, I have a vested interest in this issue and must say I was very disappointed. I ask the Minister of State to speak to his colleagues, as I do not understand the reason members of the Defence Forces, trainee members of the Garda and trainee nurses are excluded from the benefits of section 17 of the Bill. They are the main employees at that level in the State.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_143">On behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, I wish to speak about the changes in interest rates in the last week. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, are abroad on business.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">The level of inter-bank interest rates is a matter for the European Central Bank, which is entirely independent of any Government in relation to its monetary policy activities, and the individual financial institutions operating in the market. It is important for me to stress that neither the Government nor any Minister has a function in respect of the setting of interest rates, either on mortgages or more generally. This is a function of the competitive forces within the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">However, I welcome this opportunity to discuss in the Seanad the economic and financial implications of the recent reduction in ECB interest rates. The recent 50 basis points cut in these rates – which is ECB terminology for a 0.5% cut – will have a positive effect on economic trends in Ireland. First, to the extent that the cut is passed on to borrowers, it will directly stimulate the Irish economy by increasing disposable income and domestic demand. In addition, it will boost activity in the economies of many of our trading partners, thereby stimulating demand for Irish exports. Our position as a small open economy, which is highly integrated into the euro area economy, means that an increase in European demand should have positive knock-on effects here.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">The key factor in determining the extent to which rate cuts are passed on to borrowers is the level of market competition. In that regard, Senators will be aware that the Competition Authority is engaged in a study of the banking market. I understand that its study will deal with competition in the provision of banking services generally in the State. The study covers the markets in which the clearing banks operate, including other participants in those markets such as the credit unions and An Post. The study will seek to identify both the degree of rivalry between existing participants and whether there are any barriers to the entry of new participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The authority has undertaken to advise the Government if existing legislation or administrative practice has a disproportionate effect on competition and it will make recommendations for change if this is found to be the case. It also intends to identify issues relating to consumer inertia and plans to make recommendations to ensure that consumers can exercise their full rights to their advantage using the competitive process. It will, of course, consider appropriate action if any practice or arrangement appears to be in breach of the Competition Act 2002. The study is still in progress and it is planned to be completed this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Senators will also be aware of the recent establishment, after passage through this House of the relevant legislation – the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act – of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This authority carries a more advanced remit than any previous body in respect of its focus on the needs and requirements of consumers. The legislation has, for the first time, placed the statutory position of Consumer Director at the heart of the Irish financial regulatory system.</p>
          <p eId="para_149">Neither the IFSRA nor the Consumer Director have a role in respect of price fixing for interest rate products. However, the Consumer Director has a number of crucial functions in regard to furthering the interests of consumers. These include: monitoring the provision of financial services to consumers; monitoring the extent to which competition exists among providers of financial services, in so far as it affects consumers of those services; increasing public awareness of the availability, costs, risks and benefits of financial services; issuing and enforcing codes of conduct, regulations, directions, etc., to financial services providers with regard to the conditions under which they provide services to customers; control and monitoring of customer charges, other than interest rates imposed by credit institutions and bureaux de change; and promoting, in general, the best interests of users of financial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">In her annual report, the Consumer Director must specify, <i>inter alia</i>, how far she has promoted the interests of consumers of relevant financial services during the financial year concerned and “the extent to which competition exists among providers of those services in so far as it affects consumers of those services”. In summary, the role of the Consumer Director in regard to this issue is to monitor competition and to promote the interest of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">The cut in interest rates by the ECB clearly provided a competitive opportunity for financial institutions here and a consequential cut in retail rates would have been expected. I am aware that the IFSRA made public its views on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Those taking out variable rate mortgages or other borrowings expect rates to fall as well as rise and, generally, the level of change in rates is a matter for the institution concerned. However, the Consumer Director has a role in monitoring the extent to which competition exists in financial markets and would, therefore, be concerned if the institutions were overly one-sided in the operation of their discretion in this regard. I understand that on this occasion the Consumer Director has advised consumers to ask their lenders about their policies in respect of the pass-through of interest rate changes. I am informed that the financial regulator intends to carry out a survey of interest rate pass-through on various lending and borrowing rates and to pass any relevant information in this regard to the Competition Authority in the context of its study of the banking industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Further consumer protection legislation, which will, among other things, establish industry and consumer advisory panels to advise the IFSRA and establish a statutory financial services ombudsman scheme, is currently being drafted. These will be substantial steps in ensuring the appropriate protection of Irish consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">There are, from time to time, things which Government can do to improve the general access to funds of credit institutions and other entities, with a view to assisting the efficient operation of the market, and the availability of choices for consumers. A recent example was the development and passage of legislation allowing for the issue under Irish law of asset covered securities. This legislation has not yet been availed of by Irish domestic mortgage lenders, but one international bank has pioneered the first issues of such securities and proved the concept as a viable one, which is available to credit institutions, among other funding options.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">I thank the House for the opportunity to discuss these issues here today.</p>

          <p eId="para_159">The decision by the European Central Bank to cut interest rates by 0.5% was a welcome relief for those with high mortgages. A four-bedroom house in any large town now averages a purchase price of €200,000. Despite the fact that European interest rates are at an historic low, this still represents monthly repayments of approximately €1,600 or €1,700 to a young couple on two average incomes. The sum of €400 per week is a huge burden just to, literally, keep the roof over one's head. When one then factors into the equation that we have jumped to the top of the European league in terms of prices and living costs, young people are put to the pin of their collars in order to keep body and soul together.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">While the announcement ten days ago that housing prices are about to peak is good news for those who intend to invest in a house in the future, it is less positive for home owners and, in particular, from the point of view of those who have already made that investment, with mortgages of €200,000. It is potentially frightening news because it heralds a drop in house prices which would, in effect, mean a negative equity situation for some home owners.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">We welcome the decision by the European Central Bank. When its Governor, Wim Duisenberg, announced that the ECB was reducing its interest rate by a half of 1%, many young couples breathed a sigh of relief in the expectation that the saving on their €200,000 mortgage would be €83 per month – not a princely sum, but nevertheless welcome. However, it was not to be. Not a squeak was heard for hours after the announcement from a single financial or lending institution as to whether or to what extent, if any, they would reduce their interest rates in the wake of the ECB cut. There was no indication as to what relief would be given to domestic borrowers.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The first cut in interest rates came from IIB Home Loans. Not alone was it the first, but it also passed on the full ECB reduction to its consumers. It took another two days before there was a budge from any of the other lending institutions. On Monday, the country's biggest mortgage lender, Permanent TSB, followed suit by passing on to its customers the full value of the ECB reduction. It was joined by NIB and ACC Bank. However, the two biggest players in the banking market, AIB and Bank of Ireland, held their cards close to their chests by demonstrating a characteristic tardiness in disclosing their intentions. Despite the fact that AIB is by far the country's biggest lending bank, and despite the headlines set by those who had made earlier announcements, AIB failed to pass on the 0.5% cut, resorting instead to a reduced cut of 0.38%. This was also the reduction conceded by the EBS.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Yesterday, on the Order of Business, Senators rightly alleged that the so-called rivalry between mortgage lenders is, in fact, a mock competitiveness and that a cartel is operating in the sector. This is an understandable perception. While we welcome the Minister of State's announcement concerning the Director of Consumer Affairs setting down certain parameters within which the banks will have to operate—</p>

          <from>Mr. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_165">—a key component missing from that list is some kind of regulation of interest rates. One of my big regrets is that we did not insert a stipulation regarding controls on interest rates on Committee and Report Stages of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority Bill. Financial institutions have no obligations, moral or otherwise, other than to their directors and shareholders. It is profit at all costs and on this occasion their avarice has been manifestly exemplified.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulCoghlan" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_166">I welcome the Minister of State back to the House, although he is being overworked at the moment, and I welcome what he has had to say. During the last week, we witnessed an amazing spectacle. On the one hand, the Taoiseach spoke about a moral imperative and obligation, while the banks were saying – as is the position outlined by the Minister of State – that they have a commercial imperative. We are all aware what their bottom line is. I find myself in agreement with the comments of my colleague, Senator Higgins. Perhaps when the Financial Services Regulatory Authority was being established we could have done more to define the relationship that should properly exist between the various authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I welcome the enhanced role of the Director of Consumer Affairs as outlined by the Minister of State. Many such matters are being examined both by the director and the Competition Authority, to whose forthcoming report on banking I look forward, as I am sure other Members do also. It will give us further food for thought.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Of course it is right that mortgage holders should be protected to the maximum possible degree. Ireland has a good rate of home ownership, which is higher than many countries, including our immediate European neighbours. Home ownership is an important safety valve which gives people civic pride. There is a huge difference, however, between what is being charged to borrowers, including businesses, and this is affecting our competitiveness. We are being lectured repeatedly about competitiveness and we are doing much of the lecturing ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I do not necessarily agree with creating extra Oireachtas committees but the one that has been announced regarding corporate affairs and competition is very important. We already have 15 committees and I will not get into the argument about whether such work should be done by a new committee. It is wrong, however, that there is a such a wide disparity between what is being charged to mortgage holders and what is being charged for necessary commercial loans. That matter will have to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">I have one slight quibble with my colleague, Senator Higgins, who mentioned one of our leading financial institutions, AIB. I was upset that they did not pass on the full amount as sanctioned by the ECB, but they claim to be more competitive with a rate that is 0.2% less than their competitors in the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">As Senator O'Toole said yesterday, the House is concerned that there should be no conspiracy or collusion by a banking cartel. We must recall that the ECB president, Wim Duisenberg, said there is more room for manoeuvre. The ECB will address the matter again as early as 1 July to see how further interest rate reductions can be made. This is all very welcome because we need to stimulate the domestic economy as well as avoiding any tail-off or possibility of economic stagnation. We are aware that we have suffered and our competitiveness is crucially important, so I would like to see it being addressed. There should not be the current differential that exists between necessary commercial borrowing rates, particularly for the vast range of small businesses throughout the land that are so important for the economy. I would make a plea to the Minister of State in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I do not know what the function or role of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority or the Director of Consumer Affairs should be in this regard, but the question must be addressed at Government level because that disparity should not be allowed to continue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryORourke" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, was able to address the House on this matter and to listen to the debate. I particularly appreciate that because he attended the House for the Final Stages of the Bill. I appreciate also the role of the House in highlighting this matter. It was taken up here on Tuesday, before there was any move by the financial institutions but just after the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the financial regulator had spoken out strongly about the need for the banks to pass on the ECB's interest rate cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I deplore the subservient way in which we, as consumers, are meant to behave towards banks and financial institutions generally. It has historical echoes of the cap-in-hand approach to the great master, seeking whatever he can give us. We all have bank accounts, cheque books and credit cards which are required for everyday business and commerce. The banks provide a service but we, in turn, are paying for it – it is not something that is being handed out free. It is not a case of touching the forelock and saying, "Thank you very much, Sir, I will not be back bothering you again". The banks have consumers' money, whether in large or small amounts, and therefore we have already gone three-quarters of the way in this barter arrangement. The banks hold our money in safe keeping but we are entitled to our full rights as consumers. That is what irks me.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I read some remarks made by Mr. David Holden who is responsible for public affairs at the Bank of Ireland. He said it was not within the bank's competency to pass on this reduction in interest rates. I cannot quite understand what he meant because, generally speaking, "competent" means that one is able to do the job in a reasonable manner. The day after the ECB interest rate cut, Mr. Holden said it was not within the bank's competency to pass it on. I remember reading his remarks and being entirely puzzled because I know Mr. Holden. He is quite well able to talk and disport himself but I wondered what he was at and what exactly he meant. I knew the story was only just beginning.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">When I worked as a Minister responsible for consumer affairs I had begun to speak out about these matters. I was interviewed on "Morning Ireland" and recall receiving an irate telephone call from the head of the Irish Bankers Federation who said, "It had nothing to do with you, my dear," or words to that effect, "because it was in the remit of the Minister for Finance." I had responsibility for consumer affairs and, with the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, was drawing up the Consumer Credit Bill. I should not have been worrying my silly little head because these issues were being taken up by mandarins in the Department of Finance—</p>

          <from>Ms O'Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_178">—and the relevant Minister for Finance, now our esteemed Taoiseach. I recall being nonplussed. If one goes to buy a suit and there is something wrong with it, one will just leave it and go on to the next shop. One does not leave one's money if one does not like the garment. However, we leave our money and expect to be treated as consumers but we are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">I now come to the actual villain of the piece. The ECB made the cut which everyone was expecting. As the Minister of State said, this is a small open economy and any twist or turn in these matters improves or disimproves the situation to a large extent, more so than in the case of large countries. We depend very much on these fluctuations. Who gave the banks and financial houses the authority to say it was not in their competency to pass on to consumers the benefit of the interest rate cut? No one gave them that authority. I am aware they serve their boards of directors with escalating profits each year. I am not jealous of them – I do not want to sound as if I am looking for these millions, not a bit of it. However, they cannot say they are failing their boards of directors or shareholders. They certainly are not, rather they are giving them huge value for their investment, which is good to see in a market. It is obscene of them and irregular in the proper meaning of the word not to pass on what has been given and say they will keep it. This is the consumers' money.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Apart from the individual consumers being thwarted by the banks' arbitrary decision, there are also the business community and the wider implications for the country. In the United States the consumer confidence index is the one index which indicates how the country is doing. If consumers are spending, the country is operating and <i>vice versa</i>. This is causing damage to the country as well as to individual consumers. It is extraordinary in 2003 to have a statement, “It is not in our competency to pass it on”. I am interested in the Minister of State's statement that the financial regulator now intends to carry out a survey of interest rates in respect of various lending and borrowing rates and pass any relevant information to the Competition Authority in the context of its study of the banking industry. I hope it will hurry with it and the findings are issued warts and all.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Reference was made to the fact that the financial institutions pretended to be in competition with one another in order that we would be scurrying like beavers from one institution to another. They are not in competition with one another. They are in a cosy club, peopled in the main by men and those who do not intend us to get any advantage in being members of the European Union. Surely if we are into showing off the advantages of the Union, it should be done when the ECB reduces interest rates. Let us contrast the position with the ECB increasing rates. I guarantee that within one hour the competency would extend to increasing rates. This is a warning shot across the bows of what has happened this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I read an interesting newspaper article which stated the Minister for Finance would have to look again at the levy he was charging banks. The statement was not attributed to the Minister but one could read between the lines –"Buck up, boys, or you will have another big levy imposed." I know the Government cannot say this openly. The financial regulator, the Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Foley, and the Competition Authority are looking at the banks but it is we, the little people, who stood to lose during the week if action had not been taken. The country as a whole stood to lose in an economic sense if the benefit of the interest rate cut had not been passed on.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I thoroughly bewail and condemn what was clearly a looming aggrandisement and arrogant action by the banks and financial institutions which very quickly came to heel on this occasion, at which I suppose we have some sense of atavistic pleasure. It was dragged out of them as if they were guarding banks of gold and we were the predators. They are the predators, not us.</p>

I have seven C words in front of me, which I hope to get through in five minutes: currency, consumer, competition, cartel, conspiracy, criminal and confidence. This is the first benefit of the currency in real terms that people see. There are others but this is one clear benefit to consumers who are the key people in all of this. We must ensure they get a return from our involvement in the currency. The whole issue of the Competition Authority brings us back to the point I have been making on a regular basis, that is, it should have the structures and resources to deal with these kinds of issues. One cannot send Detective Plod out to see if the banks are working in a cartel. One needs people who are highly competent and confident, well used to how the banks do their business.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Ordinary people do not realise that for the banks to operate in a cartel in this situation is a criminal act. This is not understood by them. It would be very good for public representatives if ordinary people in the street knew that the legislation we have passed in these Houses protects them from being victimised in these situations. It would also be useful for us to ensure that what we intended in the legislation actually happened. This is the reason the Competition Authority needs to be supported.</p>

I do not think that anyone from the banking business could say to me with a straight face that there was no contact between any of the main financial institutions on this issue. Of course, there was, and it continues to be the case. This, effectively, could be proven to be a criminal act. People have recently begun to understand that insider trading is a criminal offence. It would be useful for the message to go out that it would be a criminal act if the banks acted in concert on this issue. Therefore, we should make it clear to the banks and financial institutions that we will ensure the focus is on them and that the matter will be investigated fully.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">This is hugely important at a time when the economy is on the verge. PricewaterhouseCoopers spoke yesterday about significant growth in GNP next year. All this depends to a great extent on consumer confidence. As a confidence building measure, nothing would be better than for consumers to see merit in what is happening and have a sense of confidence in themselves, their lives, the economy and the main players in the economy. It must be regarded as utterly unacceptable to us that the rate cut made by the ECB should not be passed on to the consumer via the banks and the other institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">I first recall being in a bank, with my grandmother, when I was about four years old. At that time there was a huge element of deference to banking. There was a rather plummy and arrogant man behind the bank counter, and I always remember my grandmother saying to him: "Young man, your job here is to count my money. I expect your full attention, and I expect you to remember that while you are there and I am here, you are my humble servant."</p>

          <p eId="para_193">I am sure the Senator's grandmother had plenty of money. Otherwise she would not have treated any bank with such courage. That is the only moral one can draw from that story.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I endorse what everyone has said this morning. To me, what has happened regarding the banks and the ECB cut is simply theft. It is subterfuge, but it is theft. There is only one purpose to ECB cuts. Whether the cut is half a point or a point, it results from the appalling state of the European economy. The rate is cut because the European economy is sluggish. It is an effort to put more money in people's pockets in order to get the economies moving. That is all. It is a very simple, unsophisticated exercise, done through the banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Under the present system, the banks are not meant to pocket any of this money. It is understood that they will pass it on. They are taking advantage of the situation, which is, as the Taoiseach rightly said, immoral. I applaud the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, for bringing these people to heel.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">It was obvious to everyone last Thursday and Friday that when, as usual, no announcement was made by the banks, they were intending to maintain the loan rate. They were wondering how much they could keep and what they could get away with. They knew there would be an uproar in the media and that consumer groups would be upset. They did not think the Government would intervene in the active way it has done. It is wonderful that it did so. The Government does not, and can not, set interest rates, but if the banking institutions wanted to pick an issue over which they would fall out with the Government – and they need each other – this was the wrong one.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">To a large extent, the banking institutions have now capitulated. As Senator O'Higgins said, AIB has not capitulated quite to the extent of the others, because it claims it was already offering the cheapest mortgage rate. Its rate is now coming very close to the others, which is clear evidence of the existence of the cartel which Senators O'Rourke and O'Toole spoke of. I cannot quite remember the figures, but they are now very close.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">Yes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_199">With AIB having cut its rate by a smaller amount, the rate difference between the institutions is now so small that inertia exists, and people have no incentive to switch to other institutions. The banks know this. I am convinced that, as Senator O'Toole said, there is a cartel operating, that telephone calls are being made between banks, and that they agree on rates and on what action they should take. At this stage they hardly need to make telephone calls, because they can move in tandem. They understand each other and their language so well. One day it is one person's turn, another day it is another's. This crucifies the consumer, who is helpless in the situation, as illustrated in the tale Senator O'Toole told about his grandmother. The most vulnerable people are the people who suffer the most in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Though bankers try to confuse us, banking is not a sophisticated business. It is a matter of merely making a margin. The banks are not passing on the savings. They make most of their money on deposits, paying 0.1% interest while they themselves obtain 1.99% on those deposits. There can be no easier business. It is not very sophisticated. They then confuse us with jargon, with words like competency and capacity, and make it all sound difficult, which it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Savers face extraordinary difficulties. In the other House, Deputy Richard Bruton articulately pointed out one aspect of the fall in ECB rates which has not been accentuated. The rate cut should have been more than 0.5%. The cuts made by the Irish banking institutions should have been greater, because the rate cuts have not been passed on in full for several years. Far from it being difficult for the institutions when ECB rate cuts are made, they are making money from them. They have been widening their margins on mortgages and lending during this period.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We should not forget credit cards. This is the greatest scandal of all. The credit card rates have not been cut and remain at 17% or 18%.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_204">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank the Leader for facilitating this debate. As previous speakers said, it is very simple for people to remain quiet on this issue and hope that the banks can get away with the actions of recent days. We welcome the concerted effort by the Government in highlighting this issue and bringing to bear some moral authority on the banks. Statements such as those made in this House help to add to that campaign to make the banks face up to their responsibilities. The recent ECB cut must be welcomed. It will give a major stimulus to enterprise and investment across the euro zone. That is badly needed, because the euro zone economy is effectively stalled.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The economic situation in the major Euro zone countries is currently quite depressing. I will put the figures on the record of the House. In France, growth this year will stand at 1%, while unemployment is over 9%. In Italy, growth for 2003 will be less than 1%, with unemployment over 9%. Most worrying of all is Germany, where growth this year is anticipated at 0.2%, while unemployment is over 11%.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The reduction in interest rates should boost business confidence, and will help to stimulate job creation through new investment. It will also help to stall the upward movement of the euro, which has severely eroded the competitiveness of exports from the euro zone to the outside countries. The ECB rate cut is positive in this sense, and we must also consider the implications for the Irish economy. We will, however, lose the positive benefits if the lending institutions do not pass on the rate cut to the customers. The Government has no power to direct the banks to do so, but the moral initiative being taken by the Government in the statements of recent days, and this debate which has been facilitated by the Leader, should help bring the institutions to their senses on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Banks do well out of the Irish economy. They enjoy good margins and earn hefty profits. I urge them to look at the long-term picture rather than at short-term issues. I will give an example of what the benefits for the institutions would be in stalling any decision to pass on the cuts. One third of total lending in this country is accounted for by mortgages. That accounts for €46 billion. If that figure is divided by 0.5%, it works out at €230 million per annum. If the latter is divided by 365 days, it rounds off to €630,000 per day. Therefore, for each day that the banks delay passing on the cut, their profits are increased by €630,000. One can see the sense on the part of the banks in delaying passing on any such cut to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">The right thing for the banks to do would be to pass on the benefit of the ECB rate cut in full to consumers. Any decision not to do so damages the standing of the lending institutions among customers and, in particular, the business community. In the long-term, it will only encourage them to take their business elsewhere. I urge the banks to face up to their responsibility, consider the long-term interests of the economy and pass on this reduction in full.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_209">The thrust of what has been said in recent days is interesting and correct. There is clearly a moral perspective and an aspect of fairness to this issue. The financial sector is the most profitable in Ireland. On occasion, the profits of financial institutions border on the immoral. We are all customers of the banks and we are more than entitled to insist that some of those profits be passed on to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">What was the policy basis for the interest rate reduction in the first instance? I would be among those who would say that the interest rate regime we had here in recent years was not suitable. We have had an economy with double digit growth, whereas interest rates ranged between 3% and 3.75%. The economy was galloping away, while interest rates were encouraging the growth of inflation. That is now no longer the case. The ECB made its decision to reduce interest rates because it recognised, belatedly, the need to stimulate growth in the eurozone area. For once, that decision is right for Ireland, because, like those elsewhere, we need to stimulate growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Much of the focus in the debate has been on domestic borrowing, mortgages in particular. We should, perhaps, be looking more at business and at the need to use the interest rate reduction for the purpose for which it was intended, namely, to stimulate the economy. We should have more focus on the rates of interest paid by business. We should not be looking only at personal overdrafts, we should also consider business loans. The banks, which still frequently insist on the provision of personal guarantees, are still screwing small businesses by charging them interest rates of 10%, 11% and 12% when inflation is running at less than 5% and their wholesale interest rates are 3% or lower. This is intolerable in light of the economic position in which we currently find ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The banks must know this because bank managers are interviewing people with business ideas who, perhaps for the first time in a few years, are under pressure because their cashflow is not as good as it used to be and customers are not as plentiful. The banks know that small businesses need a break and we need them to provide it. We are not merely talking about these businesses, we are also concerned about their employees. The economy needs the stimulus to which I refer in a way that it has not done for a number of years. It is imperative that the banks pass on the rate cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">The banks have, belatedly, passed on the rate cut to those with mortgages and that is what concerns most individuals. However, we need to focus on the other rates – not just those relating to overdrafts or credit cards, which are obscene, but also on that relating to business.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">It is worth considering the ECB's remit. It is interesting that those at the bank appear to have twigged what is at stake. I was always concerned that concentrating too much on the inflation target was a mistake. I believed that there should be a requirement on the ECB to take into account the general conditions of the eurozone economy, growth, employment, etc. The penny – or the cent – appears to have dropped with the ECB in recent months. However, there is a need to go further. When we are reviewing the stability pact, we must look at the remit of the ECB. It may have been good enough for the Bundesbank, between the 1960s to the 1980s, to deal purely with the German inflation target. However, that approach is not good enough in the 21st century for the eurozone as a whole. The ECB must be given a much broader remit to allow it to look at the overall needs of the eurozone economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">Interest rates on credit cards are utterly obscene. How can banks, which make over a €1 billion profit per year, possibly justify charging people – assuming that they are not landed with surcharges for failing to make monthly repayments – 18% to 22%? Inflation is 4.8% at present, while wholesale interest rates are 2%. The banks, therefore, are making profits of between 16% and 20%. The message needs to go out, loud and clear, that this is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I endorse everything that has been said by others in respect of the impact of the rate cut on mortgages. However, we must also appreciate that there is a need for small businesses, in particular, to obtain the benefit of the cut soon. If they do, it will hopefully feed through to better growth and employment for the remainder of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I appeal to the banks to bring down their costs. I commend those who have already acted, including the Bank of Ireland. However, I understand that the AIB has only grudgingly reduced its rates by 0.34%. This must be linked to the AIB's overseas situation and the $670 million which was stolen from it. All AIB customers and staff are paying for this. I am aware that employee's profit-sharing dividends, etc., have been reduced, which is regrettable. As the Leader stated, if the rate had gone up by 0.5%, within hours it would have shot up without any difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">I would oppose any amalgamation between the AIB and Bank of Ireland, because an institution of that strength and size would not respond to public criticism. There is, at least, some element of competition in the market, but it is obvious there is collaboration on interest rates. The Government cannot get involved, but I commend the Minister for Finance for raiding the dormant accounts. That was a great achievement and it is a credit to the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government which decided to take action in this regard. We are very much on the left of Irish politics and we are not prisoners of the banks. The Leader is certainly not their prisoner because she was prepared to allow the debate to proceed.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I agree with what previous speakers have said on this issue. It is obscene that the banks are charging anything from 16% to 20% interest on credit cards and in some cases, as Senator McDowell said, surcharges also apply. The Government should directly tackle the banks on the interest they charge on credit cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">I fully agree with what has been said about the interest being charged to small businesses which are under more pressure now than ever before. The manufacturers of giftware alone are under enormous pressure. A manufacturer of giftware in Galway, Carrigaline Pottery, which has been in existence for the past 50 to 60 years, is ready to close; Tipperary Crystal is up for sale; a company which manufacturers jewellery in Dublin is ready to close; and workers in Waterford Glass are not working one week in every six weeks. The giftware industry is under enormous pressure. We are nearing the day where no giftware will be manufactured in Ireland and any giftware that will be sold here or sold on behalf of companies here will be outsourced in countries such as Taiwan, South Africa, the Middle East and so on. These small companies are under enormous pressure from banks to close. They are under pressure on a number of fronts, not least because of high interest rates, but also because of high insurance premia and other costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The high cost of insurance is an area that should also be tackled. If we can put pressure on banks to bring down the cost of interest rates, surely we can put pressure on insurance companies to bring down the cost of insurance, given that high insurance premia place enormous pressure on companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">I fully agree with what has been said about small businesses. They are being ripped off by banks and they have to pay enormously high interest rates over and above the interest rates that have been set. In many cases, they also have to pay surcharges. This is an area the Govenrment should examine. Perhaps we again need a State rescue bank. We had one a number of years ago, but it closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">There are quite a number of small businesses in the manufacturing area, and I outlined a number in the giftware sector. The people engaged in those businesses are under severe pressure. Perhaps this is an area where the Government could step in with a rescue package. I fully support what other people have said. I thank the Minister of State for his contribution and the Leader of the House for taking this matter.</p>

        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_247">We all welcome the European Central Bank cutting the interest rates. That is good and from a European point of view it is important that our businesses are competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i> businesses in the United States. Its interest rates at this stage are still marginally lower than the European Central Bank rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The interest rate was cut primarily to stimulate the economies in central Europe, particularly Germany which is going through a difficult economic situation. The Minister of State rightly pointed out that because we have such a very open economy anything that stimulates demands within Europe will have knock-on commercial effects for Irish businesses. In that regard, the interest rate cut is welcome and it is also a fairly significant one designed to bring the currency relationship with the dollar a little lower than the euro had been achieving.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">For quite some time before we joined the single currency, the member states had been particularly successful in the EMS whereby they tried to regulate the relationship of the various currencies in Europe within certain pre-agreed parameters, which from time to time were reviewed. When we took the next step to introduce a common currency among most of the member states of the European Union, it might have been opportune on the internal stage to institute a EMS type system where perhaps, in so far as it can be regulated, the relationship between the dollar, the euro and the yen and probably in time the yuan, the Chinese currency, would have been regulated. China is a growing economy and probably in the next 40 to 50 years it will be the number one economic unit in the world. Such a mechanism would do a good deal to address the instability, which is an indeterminate when people are doing business and which artificially distorts trading across the global scene, driven by market forces or whatever else. Prior to entering the euro, the EMS was successful in maintaining a semblance of stability which helped the economies of EU member states. Perhaps that is something that might be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The debate was inspired by a fear that the banks would not pass on the interest rate cut in full to consumers. In terms of political leadership, the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance made their positions very clear. No doubt this had some influence on the decisions made by most banks, even if, having spoken to bankers yesterday, some are aggrieved that they will not get the credit for passing on the full 0.5% cut.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">On the other hand, banks can often be an easy target. It is important that the banking system has the necessary solid foundation to allow the rest of the economy to survive. I would not be entirely critical of some of the decisions banks make.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">An area for and in which the State has a definite responsibility and involvement is competition. Banks openly concede that they compete on the quality of services but not on cost. That is not good enough if we are to have a proper and effective competitive environment. This should be tackled. It is probably in the interests of the main banks to embrace the spirit as well as the letter of competition because, if they fail to do so in the long run, it will only give rise to other regulatory steps being taken to ensure a competitive environment, and these regulations may not be in the interests of banks or their shareholders in the medium to long term. I encourage them to take these steps and compete on price.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">There is also a need for greater transparency. The issue of small businesses has been raised in the debate. Bank charges, which are far from transparent, are undoubtedly a major issue in this regard. It is clearly specified what rate of interest is being paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">That said, there is a responsibility on consumers. I have noticed in recent years since the country has become more affluent that consumers in a wide range of areas are not nearly as discerning as they should be. We should remind them that, if they vote with their feet when it comes to purchasing goods, it is the real essence of and determining factor in competition. If they did this with banks which are not passing on the full interest rate cut, we would see a change of attitude for the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The Minister and the Department could monitor this to see if other banks which have conceded the 0.5% interest rate cut are reluctant to accept customers with borrowings from banks which have not passed on the rate cut. This is where competition can be blurred. I would like to think that the route we are taking is one that will lead to greater competition because ultimately the market determining attitude and actions is the best possible way of achieving a better deal for consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">One other issue to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of State is the direct mailing of people offering them loans which they have not sought or applied for at terms which are often far from competitive. I have a serious concern about this which others have also expressed in recent days, namely, that people would be lulled into consolidating other loans or taking out new loans, often for consumable items that do not have an ongoing financial benefit. This direct mailing practice should be examined. Financial institutions should be allowed to advertise in the media but we should seek to outlaw direct mailing as the consequences can be serious for individuals lulled into availing of what they consider easy access to money at cheap rates but which are not cheap in practice as they discover subsequently.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Industrial Disputes.</heading>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_140">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_261">This issue has dragged on for ten weeks and caused enormous hardship to farming communities in the west, especially County Galway, not only with respect to permits used for the movement of cattle and the sale of livestock but also with respect to thousands of REPS application forms which have been retained in many offices since last November and not processed. This has led to a denial of substantial amounts of money which form most of the basic income of many farmers. There have also been instances where farm building grants have not been processed. At a time when the Minister for Agriculture and Food is taking farmers and their families to court, he has failed to provide access for farmers to their legitimate entitlements such as moving their cattle to allow them to be sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">There is a serious concern about diseased herds where cattle have been retained for anything up to six weeks on farms. If the shoe was on the other foot and a farmer retained or asked to retain a diseased animal on his or her farm, he or she would be brought to court and sent to jail. This is an inconsistency that needs to be rectified.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">One of the most difficult aspects to understand about this dispute is that, in the past fortnight, senior veterinary officials of the Department in Galway have refused to accede to its legal advice to issue on request the documents required for the movement of cattle. This indicates that senior officials in the Department have taken it upon themselves to defy the instructions of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Turmoil of this nature within a Department is not good. The only recourse is for the Minister to take the matter to court. Farmers must be very fed up with such action. They are the meat in the sandwich. As we speak, many farmers are protesting in Galway in order to highlight the hardship many families have endured during the past ten weeks because of the instances I have outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">It is important that the Minister takes this in hand once and for all and intervenes personally so that the people who have been promised promotional opportunities in these rural offices will at least have some recognition for the work they have been doing down the years. When an emergency arose, with the advent of foot and mouth disease, they were verbally promised that if they went back and did their work – which, to their credit, they did – the matter would be settled immediately afterwards. Unfortunately, this was a verbal undertaking – nothing was given in writing – and it was not honoured when the crisis was over. They became absolutely desperate when the favourable recognition and promotional opportunities to which they were entitled were denied to them and they went out on strike. The Minister of State will be aware of the manner in which they were taken off the payroll, namely, by e-mail at 4 p.m. on a Thursday. This is not a good indication of how relations within the Department are being handled.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I hope that there will never again be such an occurrence among any group of employees within the Department. I plead with the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Walsh, to intervene immediately to ensure that the two aggrieved parties can be granted their entitlements as quickly as possible so that the very important work on which the Department should be concentrating at the present time can continue. Serious negotiations are taking place in respect of the Fischler proposals and Ministers and senior officials should be able to concentrate on these rather than being diverted by an issue such as this, important though it may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">It is sad that the people who are most dependent, particularly those on the west coast, are being denied their rights. If a similar incident occurred in Dublin among any corresponding group, media attention would have been drawn to it and it would have been resolved in a much shorter period. It is a pity that there is less concern for the people of the west than there is for those of any other part of the country.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamAylward" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_141">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I thank Senator Burke for raising this matter. Like many of his colleagues from the west with whom I have daily contact, I am aware of and regret the hardship and inconvenience caused to farmers in the area covered by the Department offices involved in this industrial dispute. However, much progress has been made, perhaps even since the Senator notified the House of this matter. I will be careful about what I say here because I do not want to jeopardise the steady progress that is being made. The current mood is very positive and I am optimistic that the matter will be resolved within the next number of days.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">Several efforts were made by my Department to ease the hardship to the farmers in the counties involved, particularly those in the west. People in my part of the country were fortunate that the strike did not spread to it. The necessity of obtaining advance clearance from the CMMS data for animals intended for local slaughterhouses was temporarily suspended and an arrangement was reached with the union to introduce procedures to deal with urgent animal welfare cases. The dispute has proven difficult to resolve and my Department is continuing to work towards a resolution. I am sure the House will appreciate the necessity of resolving the dispute within the partnership process, which has served the country well to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The application to the High Court by CPSU members seeking a judicial review of the decision to remove members of the union from the payroll was heard two weeks ago on 27 and 28 May and judgment has been reserved. The Senator will appreciate that I will not comment on that judgment whenever it is forthcoming. Veterinary officers issuing movement permits and identity cards for livestock would have limited impact, given the volume of work involved and the number of veterinary officers in each office. This, coupled with the fact that there is a convention among trade union members not to perform the duties of another trade union member who is on strike, presented real difficulties for the Department. However, as I have said, we have as far as possible put arrangements in place to provide some level of service to farmers in the affected counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Senator mentioned REPS payments. Prior to the commencement of the dispute, the vast majority of applications were paid in accordance with the terms of the protocol for payments to farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Following the intervention of the national implementation body last week, I am satisfied that real progress has been made and that agreement will be reached within days to put a process in place which will enable the striking CPSU members to return to work. When the dispute is resolved, as I assure the Senator it will be, I will ensure that adequate arrangements are in place to deal with the backlog of work in the offices in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">My reply is short, for obvious reasons, but I am optimistic that within a number of days the staff in question will be back within their places of work and arrangements will be put in place to try to deal with the backlog. I appreciate the concerns of the Senator, as a public representative from that area, and all public representatives who have to deal with this on a daily basis. The fact is that all strikes cause hardship, particularly to innocent bystanders. In this case, we will be very happy to see it resolved. I hope we will have good news within the next few days.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Matters. - Emigrant Welfare Organisations.</heading>
        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_142">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_274">This matter stems primarily from an experience I had in January. A friend of mine who was backpacking through Australia was involved in a serious road accident – he was hit by car. A couple of us who were good friends of his travelled to Australia to see him because he was in a bad condition. I am happy to say that he has partially recovered since and has returned home. While I was there, the plight of the Irish emigrant welfare associations, which look after Irish emigrants, was brought to my attention. Based on the representations they made to me, I asked my colleague, Deputy Paul McGrath, to raise a number of issues by means of a Dáil question.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">It was brought to my attention that while there are at any given time approximately 280,000 Irish-born people living in the USA and between 85,000 and 90,000 Irish-born people living in Australia, significantly more funding is given by the Irish Government to emigrant welfare organisations in America than to those in Australia. Although there are four times as many Irish emigrants in America than in Australia, the American organisations receive eight times as much funding. This imbalance should be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">In the Sydney area, a committee of nine people works on a voluntary basis for the Australian Irish Welfare Bureau. Last year, the total funding given to the Irish welfare agencies in Australia was in the region of $56,000, Australian, which is a small amount of money when one considers the costs involved and the services they provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">While I was in Australia, members of the committee were constantly visiting Irish people in Australian hospitals who had no family members with them. That provided great support in times of trouble for them. I am aware that the Irish-Australian welfare bureau in Sydney received in the region of Aus$20,000 in support from the Irish Government last year. That is welcome but, sadly, far from adequate. It was brought to my attention, in relation to the costs of running the organisation, that one of the largest costs incurred in any year was in a situation where a person who had travelled from Ireland died in Australia, in whatever circumstances. The transportation cost of bringing the remains back to Ireland can be up to Aus$10,000, or half the annual grant the organisation receives from the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I appreciate that the national purse strings are being pulled rather tighter. However, the current imbalance is unjustifiable and should be rectified for the future. These organisations provide a massive service for thousands of Irish people who had to leave this country to make a new life in far-flung places, mainly due to economic circumstances at a time when the Celtic tiger was far from these shores. Their efforts deserve greater monetary assistance from the Government. I await the response of the Minister of State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_143">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. T. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_279">As a nation, we are very proud of our links with Australia, which began with the earliest settlements in that country and continue today with an annual exchange of working holidaymakers in both directions, as the Senator stated. I appreciate his personal interest in the matter. The historic links are very profound. More than 200 years have passed since the first Irish settlers were transported to Australia and, since then, the Irish have merged into every aspect of Australian life. As many as one third of all Australians lay claim to Irish ancestry which a rough calculation puts at almost six million people, some of whom have been settled in the country for generations and whose Irish origins are little more than a curiosity. Many more, however, have moved there in the past 50 years and have strong psychological and emotional connections to their home country.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">More recently, a number of Irish societies have been formed, contributing greatly to feelings of Irish identity, forming social outlets and putting in place support systems for the elderly and vulnerable. The Department of Foreign Affairs recognises the responsibility it has, both to these Irish-Australians and the thousands of young professionals who travel from Ireland to Australia each year. Through the Embassy in Canberra and the Consulate General in Sydney, the Department has worked closely with various organisations to ensure their safety and welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Australian-Irish welfare bureau in Melbourne is an invaluable resource for the Irish Embassy in Australia's second largest city. With the Irish-Australian welfare bureau and resource centre in Sydney, it provides support services for the elderly Irish and is of great assistance to young people who travel there on the working holiday programme. The Australian-Irish welfare bureau in Woolongong, an industrial city south of Sydney, also acts as an important social and community resource in an area with a strong Irish connection.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">In recognition of the good work of these welfare centres, both with the elderly and marginalised Irish and the 10,000 or so working holidaymakers who travel each year, the Government has made an annual grant to each centre since 1996. The grant for 2002 totalled Aus$64,000. Following my visit to Australia a number of years ago, I can appreciate as well as anybody the invaluable work carried out by these centres. More recently, in March 2002, several members of the task force on policy regarding emigrants met representatives of all three centres and were highly impressed at the services provided in each case for emigrants young and old. The report of the task force recommended increased funding for all Irish immigrant services, including those in Australia. However, conscious of the difficult budgetary situation facing the Government, it was not possible to provide any additional funding this year. The Minister for Foreign Affairs intends maintaining the grants for this year at Aus$64,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">The new partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress – the successor to the PPF – contains a chapter on special initiatives which will be addressed during the lifetime of the programme. One of these special initiatives concerns migration and interculturalism and includes a provision, arising from the conclusions and recommendations of the task force, for the development of a coherent set of initiatives in consultation with the relevant interests. The arrangements for carrying out this work are being developed and will help provide a mechanism for advancing the implementation of the task force report.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">While this may lead to increased funding for emigrant services in Australia, the level of funding for next year will depend on the budgetary situation facing the Government. The Irish Embassy in Canberra and the Consulate General in Sydney will continue to address the consular needs of the Irish in Australia and work closely with the emigrant welfare centres to ensure the experience of all Irish people in Australia is positive. I thank the Senator for raising this important issue on the Adjournment.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Seanad adjourned at 12.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 18 June 2003.</p>
