          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator O'Brien that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the current services at Monaghan General Hospital are retained and upgraded as required.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to clarify the steps he intends to take to replace the jobs lost in Castlemahon Foods Limited following the appointment of a liquidator and if he will make a statement on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 30, motion 26.  No. 1 is a sessional order as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and will be taken without debate; No. 2 is a referral motion whereby the subject matter of motion 21 on today's Order Paper is being referred to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for consideration.  Under the Disability Act 2005, the six Departments named in the motion are required to produce sectoral plans relating to delivery of services to people with disabilities.  The motion seeks the approval of these plans put forward by the Departments concerned and it will be taken without debate.  When the motion returns from the committee, it would be a good idea for us to debate the six Departments' sectoral plans.  No. 3, statements on the 2005 Annual Report of the Office of Tobacco Control, will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and will conclude not later than 5 p.m., spokespersons have ten minutes and other speakers have six minutes, and the Minister will be called on to reply not later than five minutes before the conclusion of the statements; and No. 30, motion 26, will be taken from 5 p.m until 7 p.m.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_7">At the start of each session I ask on behalf of my colleagues, and the Leader of the House normally gives a full reply, for an outline of the legislation that will come before the House between now and Christmas.  It would be useful to do that in the next week, with the Leader detailing the Bills that will be debated following the publication of the legislative programme by the Government Chief Whip yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Once again the spectre of politics and money is brought into sharp focus following the controversy surrounding the Taoiseach in the past week.  It is fair to point out that there is genuine embarrassment on all sides about having to raise these matters but once they are in the public domain, the Opposition must ask questions and we will see the culmination of that in the other House later today.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I would, however, like to make a number of points about the controversy.  The Irish people are sick and tired of hearing of these stories whereby senior politicians have taken money for whatever use they so choose.  People will ask the probing questions over the next few days about whether the Taoiseach has any tax liability and there are questions that must be answered about ethics legislation and codes.  The fundamental question people are asking is whether it is right that a senior politician should take such a significant sum of money for his own use.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_10">There are procedures for these proceedings.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_11">As leader of the largest Opposition group, I am making the point on the Order of Business that this must be clarified in the near future so the matter is resolved once and for all, not only for the Taoiseach himself but for the Office of the Taoiseach, which has been so consistently important in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">When will the Government allow time to debate the reports of the Morris and Barr tribunals?  Senator Bannon asked about this on the last day of the previous session and it is necessary that we debate both reports.  The tribunals were established by the Oireachtas and the reports should be discussed in the House as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">On behalf of all Senators, I wish a speedy recovery to a Garda sergeant who was shot today on the Monasterboice Road while doing his job and risking his life and that of his colleagues by confronting particular criminals.  It underlines the threat posed to the Garda Síochána by the gun culture that grips this country.  We should all send him our best wishes for a speedy recovery.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I echo the words about the Garda sergeant who was injured this morning.  We have been quick enough to criticise gardaí at times but we should also take the opportunity to recognise someone who takes risks for us, for democracy and for the law.  It is vital that we support and acknowledge the great bravery of people in those situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The issue being discussed in the media and elsewhere today is one where we are inclined to rush to judgment while we all seek further information.  We have tried to deal with this situation over the past ten years on a legislative basis.  There is legislation in place to deal with tax law and ethics which is difficult legislation with which to deal.  Those of us who have dealt with ethics in committees of this House know this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I will suspend judgment until such time as I get a clear indication on the question of Revenue law and ethics legislation.  I would like to hear from the Revenue Commissioners and the ethics commission.  Once these matters have been clarified we will know where we stand.  If the bar of what is politically correct needs to be raised, as regards the conduct of taoisigh or Ministers, we will have to address that matter also.  There has been much discussion but the fundamental facts boil down to whether the law of the land has been broken.  If so, that brings us to a clear conclusion.  If it has not been broken — I do not know whether it has or not — then we must park the issue.  That is the way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that there are issues hanging there about which I would like to hear more before we all rush to judgment.  I would like to have full knowledge before drawing a conclusion and then we can decide how much further we need to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">On a similar matter, as it concerns large amounts of money, we should congratulate the new Tánaiste and wish him the best in his new role.  On the question of money, the House should indicate how pleased it is that the Government no longer needs an extra €3 billion in annual tax revenues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_19">That is not what we said.  The first thing the Senator needs is a hearing aid.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_20">I am full of ideas as to how we might spend that €3 billion.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I have no doubt I am not the only one.  There are people on both sides of the House who would like to say "Here's how we'll spend it".  During the Estimates season various Departments argue for extra pennies, cents and shillings here, there and everywhere.  Now that we have found this goldmine of €3 billion, I would like to have an input into how it should be spent.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">The golden goose.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_24">Yes.  There are aspects of education and health which are badly in need of it and that is only the start.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_25">We in the Labour Party would also like to convey our good wishes to the garda who was injured while bravely upholding both the principle of a society governed by law and the right of ordinary people to live in it without fear.  I wish him a speedy recovery.  It should be remembered that for all the occasional and perhaps more than occasional critiques, we have a police force which has managed to operate largely unarmed in difficult circumstances.  At the level of individual contact with citizens the force is entirely unarmed, which is close to being unique in the world.  There is therefore a particularly poignancy when a garda is injured.  We need to be heard on this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I ask the Leader to arrange for a serious and significant debate on the future of the health services.  This should occur sometime early in the session and not be confined to a short debate during Private Members' time.  We had a succession of little Fianna Fáil explosions over the summer about the health sector.  Former distinguished Members of this House threatened mayhem if certain hospitals were not preserved, and aspiring Members of the other House made similar noises.  Plans have been put on and off but it would be nice to hear from the Minister for Health and Children now that she is unburdened with the troubles of being Tánaiste and, presumably, better able to talk to us.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_27">She saw it coming up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Perhaps she could explain precisely what is the Government's plan.  So far we have seen doctor-only medical cards which our foolish citizenry do not see the merits of, in spite of continual attempts by the Minister for Health and Children to demonstrate that they are a great idea.  Either our citizens can see that they are of no benefit or they cannot.  I would like to know about the much touted HSE plan for dealing with the accident and emergency crisis, which as far as I can see amounted to persuading as many old people as possible to get themselves vaccinated.  We would all agree with that but not with the implication that the cause of the crisis is the under-vaccination of our elderly population.  Everybody, apart from the Minister and the HSE, accepts the fundamental problem is that we do not have enough acute beds in our hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">The third issue is the spiralling cost of health insurance for the proportion of the population that can afford it, a potentially declining proportion.  May we have a serious debate so we can hear from some of the more vocal Members opposite what they understand to be the position, in the presence of the Minister for Health and Children so she can clarify whether their understanding is the same as her own because it is the biggest issue facing the country?</p>
          <p eId="para_30">When we adjourned in the summer the entire Western world, the European Union and the United States in particular, abandoned any sense of morality in international affairs.  The compliance of the European Union and the United States with the Israeli assault on Lebanon in a deliberate campaign was guaranteed to ensure there was no immediate ceasefire.  That particular position, which was the EU position, was allowed to go through a conference in Rome in which the EU fudged to avoid a confrontation with the United States and in which the fundamental question of the need for an immediate ceasefire was deliberately fudged to allow Israel to continue its actions.  According to the United Nations there are one million cluster bomblets in southern Lebanon waiting to be handled by vulnerable civilians who are trying to get back to the homes that were so brutally destroyed.  Given that there is a fundamental issue involved, I call for a debate in the near future on the situation in the Middle East to see whether we can assert some moral influence to restore the position of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I would not mind having a debate on the European Union's response to the applications for membership by Romania and Bulgaria, which have been approved in principle.  One of those two countries has been told off about the fact that there are a large number of unsolved contract killings which, if it is a criterion for membership, puts our membership in some jeopardy.  Another one has been told off because of the lack of clarity about the relationship between politics and business.  Does that mean that particular country will have to ensure senior ministers cannot take loans from their friends whom they then appoint to state companies?  There is an interesting ethical issue here and, perhaps, we need to be careful to ensure the same principles we demand of new members are applied to existing members.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_32">Seven months ago we had an excellent debate in the House on the Shot at Dawn Campaign.  I congratulate those involved in that campaign, particularly my colleague Senator Mooney and several other Senators from all sides of the House who took an interest in it, on the positive result that has been achieved.  I believe that pressure from this country played a substantial and positive role in that decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">There are three matters I would like debated in the session.  The first is energy policy, though obviously that should take place on foot of the Green Paper on energy.  There are substantial concerns about security of supply, cost and so on, though we all welcome the reduction in the price of oil.  We should also have a substantial debate on the Middle East, as mentioned by Senator Ryan, and a substantial debate on Northern Ireland in view of the decisions that have to be taken by 24 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Speaking for myself and, I believe, colleagues on this side of the House I have total confidence in the Taoiseach.  The House does not await clarification of a particular detail.  I remind the House——</p>

At times like this, balance can be often in short supply.  I was particularly surprised and disappointed that one of the central issues of the debate was downplayed or sidelined, namely, the leaking of confidential information from the tribunal.  This raises serious questions here as we have a role with regard to the tribunal.  I wonder how the honourable judge who presides over it feels with regard to the fact that the tribunal cannot live up to the commitment it gave to people who provided confidential information.  Who had access to that information and what security applies to ensure people's rights are protected?  The danger is that there could be a fallout from this case which could impact on the credibility of the tribunal.</p>

I am also equally hopeful that the House will condemn unreservedly the elements there on that day who descended into mob rule at what was an outwardly democratic expression of decent, honest people in Monaghan whom I strongly support in their efforts to retain their local services.  I hope the House will condemn the abuse that was heaped on the local Deputy who is the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil.  I do not believe this was acceptable and it was more a reflection on the individual in question than it was on the Ceann Comhairle.  What message did this send out to the dozens of schoolchildren who were present and to all the good, decent people who had turned out to protest in an orderly manner?  Democracy is a very fragile flower but when it descends into mob law I hope the House will unreservedly condemn the vile abuse that was heaped on a Member of Parliament going about his democratic duties.</p>

I would like to think that all of us, as Members of this House and as members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, acted as a catalyst.  I believe the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body kick-started the eventual resolution of this problem.  I wish to acknowledge the unsung heroes, the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs who prepared the forensic report which was then taken up by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  I thank all for them for what I hope will be the resolution of a grievous injustice which goes back over decades.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">In its programme for Government set out in 2002, this Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats gave an undertaking that no child under the age of nine would be in a class of more than 20 pupils by the end of this Government's lifetime.  There are only eight or nine months left in the lifetime of the Government, and it is unfortunate that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has dismissed and disowned the undertaking as an aspirational statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">It is very worrying for many parents who have never before seen such numbers at the intake to primary level.  Some 33% of these pupils are now in classes of 25 pupils and upwards.  Some are in classes of up to 40 pupils.  It is no wonder that the public is in despair with regard to promises and undertakings given by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Oddly, of the 15,000 students at primary level in the Minister's own constituency, nearly 12,000 are in class sizes of 25 or more.  During the summer we noticed the Minister dancing around with pupils on the joyous occasions when exam results came out.  It is time that she took in hand this very serious problem.  Everybody in the House is conscious that if we fail students at a very early age, we fail them for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">There has been no commitment whatever.  We have spoken about surplus resources which exist, and some people do not want those.  We then get a clear indication that this Government is not serious about solving this particular problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I endorse some of the words of Senators O'Toole, Ó Murchú and others on the restraint being shown on all sides of this House with regard to the political events of the past few days.  It is extremely easy to sit in judgment on other people's integrity and exploit misfortunes for political advantage.  I applaud that nobody in this House has done that.  It is easy to convert the difficulties of others into a type of political blood sport in a premature fashion.  That the Seanad has today resisted that temptation is to the credit of Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">I wish to mention a matter that in normal circumstances would have been more prominent today, the flotation of Aer Lingus.  Perhaps the Leader of the House could ask the Minister for Transport to come before the House to explain what has happened.  We are very much in danger of swallowing the spinning which has been going on.  I have already seen today the Minister pronouncing the flotation a great success.  It is successful in that the airline is being sold off for half nothing.  If that is a success, that is fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">I must admit I already dealt in the shares.  I believe I am obliged to do so when I speak on it.  The people who really did well out of this are not the taxpayers but the extremely large institutions which beat down the Government  to selling it for virtually nothing.  In normal circumstances, it would have gone for far more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Let us not believe this was a success.  Certainly, Aer Lingus is partially sold, but anything can be sold without problem if buyers exist at the bottom level and that is what happened.  The only people who were successful in this were intermediaries such as brokers, bankers and advisers who received at least €30 million.  The Government received exactly €200 million, which is a pittance in terms of what it has at present.  It makes one wonder whether any future privatisation should take place.  The temptation is to sell and not give a damn about the price.  That has resulted in what happened today.</p>

I would welcome the opportunity for Members on all sides, in a rational way, to deal with the various projects in the constituencies that most affect the people we represent.

          <p eId="para_116">Can the Leader arrange to have the Minister for Finance attend the House at the earliest opportunity to discuss the recent surge in the rate of inflation?  Over the past few months, the rate has risen above 4%, which is well in excess of the rates in neighbouring EU member states and is higher than the projection made by the Government at the beginning of the year.  I would like to hear the Minister's explanation on the matter as soon as possible.  This factor could seriously undermine the economy as we face the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Can the Leader ascertain from the Minister for Social and Family Affairs whether the delay which arose about six months ago in the processing of applications for the old age pension has been rectified?  It was brought to my attention that several thousand people who had reached pension age were sent letters by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to inform them their pensions would not be processed for up to 16 weeks.  While they may subsequently receive back payments on their pensions, they would have to live off their own funds in the meantime.  This is a serious issue for people who, after working all their lives, reach the age of 66.  It is not a significant problem for those who have built up reserves but for the majority who have not and who must rely on the State pension, it is a major hardship.  I ask that the matter be addressed as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I am stunned at the number of gangland crimes and drive-by shootings that are taking place and the fact that they are only reported in small print in our newspapers.  It was reported that six shootings took place in one district of one city over the past weekend, an issue on which other Senators have called for a debate.  Urgent action is needed on this worrying trend and questions must be answered by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I do not think we are being soft on crime and significant achievements have recently been made in this respect.  However, are we doing enough?  Is the Garda being underfunded?  These questions can be answered by the Tánaiste.  Let us put this serious development to the forefront of our attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Earlier today, I attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs to discuss the issue of migration and the problems of migrants.  I was struck by the fact that 9% of Irish residents are now migrants, a figure which will increase to 18% by 2030.  That presents a challenge to us as a nation.  To the best of my knowledge, there is not yet any central authority with responsibility for integrating migrants into society.  We have asked for such an authority to be established and we should be told whether steps have been taken in this regard.  A debate on the NESC's report on migration policy would be worthwhile and should be held forthwith.</p>

The legislative programme will include: the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Bill, Committee and Final Stages; the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill; the Prisons Bill; and the Child Care (Amendment) Bill, about which Senator O'Meara has been asking.  We will also debate the Appropriation Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.  There will be others but these have not yet been brought forward.  Senator O'Meara asked about the defamation and privacy Bills, both of which will be published during this session.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Senator Hayes also raised the matter of the Morris and Barr tribunals and sent his best wishes to the garda shot in the course of duty.  All Members would agree with this sentiment.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The Senator also referred to the spectre of money and genuine embarrassment.  Senator Mansergh pointed out that leaders of other parties did not have to fulfil the course of payments.  We could all talk about such matters but I welcome the restraint in the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">Senator Ó Murchú referred to the leaking of confidential information.  I do not think it originated from the Opposition parties or the tribunal.  We must look nearer home on this matter.  Senator Finucane raised the matter of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU on 1 January 2007, and the possibility of work permits for those entering from those countries.  That issue will evolve as time goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">Senator Maurice Hayes sought debates on the Morris tribunal, the Carthy report, social housing and immigration.  Senator Henry raised the report of the Inspector of Mental Health Services, the report on the Prison Service and the reports of the visiting committees.  I hope to arrange a debate on them soon.  Senator Mooney expressed his solidarity with the people of Monaghan and their march but wished that there had been proper conduct and that the Ceann Comhairle had not been insulted.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Senator Ulick Burke said that no child under nine years of age should be in a class of over 25 but that 33% of children are.  However, there are now 4,000 extra primary teachers in the schools and these are mainly dealing with children who have difficulties.  The average primary class size has been reduced from 27 to 24.  A total of 50,000 pupils in disadvantaged schools are in classes of 15 to 20 pupils.  The Department of Finance has said more teachers will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Senator Daly referred to the drugs scene and the important meeting that was held by the HSE.  The huge seizure made today by the Garda was significant in that regard.  Senator Ross praised the restraint of the House and spoke about the flotation of Aer Lingus.  He asked that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, be invited to the Seanad.  Senator Hanafin sought a debate on the Middle East.  He referred to the Ryder Cup and condemned the actions of <i>The Dubliner</i> magazine.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Before the summer break I gave Senator Bannon a commitment that we would debate the report of the Barr tribunal in the Seanad.  I hope the House will be able to debate it in full next week.  The Senator also raised the issue of Mullingar General Hospital.  The fitting-out money has been made available and work is proceeding on that.  There will be other announcements.  Senator Brady expressed his worry about the leak from the tribunal and spoke about the drugs haul today, offering congratulations to the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Senator O'Meara referred to the Morris tribunal and sought a debate on mental health services for young people.  She also asked about the privacy Bill, which I mentioned earlier.  Senator Dooley praised the winter bed initiative by the HSE and spoke about the roll out of capital projects and the interaction, or lack of it, between the HSE and the Department of Health and Children on that issue.  I accept the Senator's point.  Senator John Paul Phelan said we are raising the leaks from the tribunal to muddy the waters.  That is not the case.  It is most important that they be discussed.  The Senator wants the Minister for Finance to be invited to the House to debate the surge in inflation.  Inflation will reduce now; in fact, diesel was obtainable today in County Westmeath for less than €1 per litre.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">Senator Quinn raised gangland crime and asked that the Tánaiste be invited to the House to debate it.  He also referred to a point he raised previously, the central authority for dealing with migrants.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_98">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_157">I apologise for being late which was due to questions in the other House taking longer than anticipated.  I thank Senators for this opportunity to address the House on the 2005 Annual Report of the Office of Tobacco Control.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Last year saw the first anniversary of the introduction of the smoke free at work initiative introduced by the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and the year also saw the sad death of Tom Power, the first chief executive of the office whose commitment and dedication to the cause of tobacco control impressed all who met him.  It is only fitting that we should record his untimely passing and pay tribute to his record of achievement.  Tom worked tirelessly in developing and advancing policy in the area of tobacco and health and his drive and determination contributed to the introduction of the smoke free workplaces legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">The office was established under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.  It is the body established to progress the Government's tobacco control strategy as outlined in the 2000 document, Towards a Tobacco Free Society.  I will briefly summarise the work of the office during 2005.  During that year much of the office's work was directed towards ensuring compliance with the smoke free at work legislation.  This was achieved in co-operation with the Health Service Executive and the Health and Safety Authority.  The office also played an important role in co-ordinating the national tobacco control inspection programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">Over 35,000 inspections were carried out by environmental health officers and compliance continues to be high — 95% of premises inspected were compliant.  This indicates that the vast majority of enclosed workplaces are smoke free and confirms that the measure enjoys widespread public support.  Where necessary, prosecutions are initiated and 38 prosecutions were taken during the year.  Of these, 32 related to licensed premises, four to taxi companies, one to a retail shop and one private individual was also prosecuted.  Some 37 of these prosecutions were successful.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The office is also involved with the continued operation of the smoke free compliance line, although call volumes have dropped considerably.  A total of 1,353 calls were received during the year and the office also dealt with over 700 calls from members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">The office's role in regard to compliance was underlined and reinforced by a national radio and television campaign which was run during the year with the theme, "smoke free is working, let's keep it that way".  The campaign reinforced the message that smoke free workplaces promote employees' health and well being and it also reminded people that the compliance line was still in operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The office continued its involvement in research into tobacco control programmes during the year.  In conjunction with the Research Institute for a Tobacco Free Society, it funded the all-Ireland bar workers study conducted by Dr. Shane Allwright of TCD.  This study monitored the effects of working in bars North and South and compared and contrasted the effects of working in a smoke free environment as against one where smoking is permitted.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">This showed that among non-smokers, cotinine concentrations in the saliva declined by 80% in the South and by only 20% in the North.  Cotinine is a breakdown product of nicotine.  Work-related exposure to tobacco smoke dropped very significantly in the South but only slightly in the North.  Exposure outside work decreased significantly in the South but increased in the North.  This is a potentially significant finding and may indicate that the underlying public health message is getting through to people generally.  Also, in the South, there was a significant drop in the number of bar staff reporting respiratory symptoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">In regard to smoking prevalence, the office continues to monitor this important indicator.  In recent years, smoking prevalence has fallen significantly — from 31% in 1998 to 24% in 2005.  Unfortunately, there was a slight reversal of the downward trend in 2005 as against 2004 and the office believes that this indicates a need for a sustained anti-smoking campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">On a more encouraging note, a public opinion survey commissioned by the office showed that there is widespread support for the smoke free at work initiative.  Some 93% of people think the measure was a good idea, including 80% of smokers; 96% of people think the measure is successful, including 89% of smokers; and 98% of people think that workplaces are now healthier, including 94% of smokers.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">This widespread support is very encouraging and it shows that public opinion is likely to be supportive of other measures intended to reduce the harm caused by tobacco because, make no mistake about it, despite recent progress, smoking continues to be the number one avoidable cause of mortality and morbidity and there is a compelling case to be made for the re-intensification of our efforts to respond effectively to the challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">On this point, Senators may wish to note that my Department is currently heavily involved in defending a challenge to the Public Health (Tobacco) Acts which has been initiated by the tobacco industry.  The case is currently in the High Court and is likely to go to a hearing towards the end of the year.  In addition, my Department has recently concluded a consultation process on prohibiting the sale of cigarettes in packs of fewer than 20 and I expect to be in a position to announce a date for the implementation of this measure shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">During the summer I had the pleasure of attending a major conference in Washington on the tobacco issue.  I had the honour of accepting an award on behalf of the Government, although I felt a little guilty since I was not that directly involved in——</p>

          <p eId="para_171">Over 130 countries were represented at the conference.  From listening to some of the contributions during the conference and from chatting to people on the sidelines, it was very encouraging to hear people talking about the miracle that had taken place in Ireland, how a small country in which many had pictured people with the pint in one hand and the cigarette in the other could be so courageous in taking this move and the inspiration it had given them to follow suit.  Indeed, many countries have followed the same pattern, although perhaps not in the same fashion.  There is an awareness that this is one area in which we can take action that will have immediate benefits to the people.  It is all about trying to improve the health of our people and it is encouraging to see such a positive response from other countries.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_173">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for his contribution.  I join him in his tributes to the former chief executive of the Office of Tobacco Control, Mr. Tom Power, and extend our sympathies to his family.  Through his work, Mr. Power left an outstanding legacy which we must complete.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The Minister of State said there are many challenges to face and the figures to which I will refer highlight the extent of those challenges.  We have, however, come a long way.  During the late 1990s I was a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children and, under the chairmanship of Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, the major project undertaken was to tackle smoking.  It seemed a task that could result only in limited success but, fortunately, the committee's work was taken on board by then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, and its recommendations led to the smoking ban in the workplace.  We have reached a positive stage and we can map the progress made but we should not underestimate the challenges which still face us.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">One fact that jumps off the page at the reader is the trend in cigarette smoking.  TNS/MRBI carries out a monthly tracker survey on behalf of the Office of Tobacco Control and it presents a picture that causes some concern.  More females than males aged 15 and up smoke, 24.1% compared to 23.7%.  There is a significant number smoking between 15 and 18 years of age, 17.6%.  The age group with the highest rate of smoking prevalence is the 19 to 35 year age bracket, with 32.4% smoking.  The real challenge is not simply maintaining the ban on smoking in the workplace but tackling those statistics.  We must aim to eliminate smoking almost entirely because of the destruction, death and resultant costs to this country of tobacco smoking.  The report notes that smoking kills almost 6,000 people in Ireland every year.  We have public debates on a monthly basis on the rate of road traffic fatalities, tragic deaths that affect hundreds of families every year.  Along with that we have this statistic of 6,000 people dying every year as a result of smoke-related illness.  The challenge is very significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">Medical analysis shows that there is an immediate improvement in health once a person stops smoking.  We still, however, have huge numbers dying as a result of tobacco smoke and we must continue to highlight that.  The statistics on young people, particularly women, who smoke prove that the fact of tobacco causing 6,000 deaths per year does not get through.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">We must campaign aggressively in advertising to dissuade young people from taking up or continuing with the habit.  The Minister of State's closing comments on the introduction of a ban on the sale of cigarettes in packs of less than 20 will be supported by Fine Gael, as it will be by everyone committed to ending smoking.  This commitment was made some time ago, however, during the 2004 legislation, when we were told there would be a ban on the sale of packs of ten cigarettes.  That has not happened so there should not be any further delay and I hope to hear an announcement on this soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">At this time of year, we look forward to the budget.  In recent budgets there have been only modest increases in cigarette prices.  Experts tell us that price is the main disincentive to cigarette smoking among young people.  The Minister for Finance must listen to the Minister for Health and Children and ensure there will be a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes in the next budget because it is a way to reduce consumption and, thus, to reduce the 6,000 deaths per annum.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">We must continue to remind ourselves of this figure because when we read these reports and congratulate ourselves on being European and world leaders in our efforts to rid society of tobacco smoke, we can think the job has been done when 6,000 people are still dying every year and 30% of young people are smoking.  Huge challenges remain.  If price can play a part in the reduction of cigarette consumption among young people, the obligation on the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance is to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The workplace ban has been a success.  Complaints by third parties are acted upon quickly and prosecutions follow.  Such action is necessary and effective.  Walking into a pub is almost entirely different from just four years ago.  At the time the Minister for Health and Children took a lot of abuse but showed a commendable degree of courage and acted in a proper fashion, showing genuine leadership.  We are all now benefitting from that decision but more leadership is required on pricing and advertising because the mountain remains to be climbed and the public perception changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Huge numbers are under greater stress than ever, with young people facing challenges in life in a broad range of areas.  The lure of cigarette smoking as an antidote to all their problems presents itself to thousands of young people every year in an attractive fashion.  That is why, from a political perspective, we need to continue our campaign against smoking from a legislative and advertising viewpoint to change the mindset because the perceived short-term benefits of tobacco result in major long-term costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I compliment the new chief executive and staff of the Office of Tobacco Control on their work.  Much more needs to be done but it is moving in the right direction.  It is one of the few issues that has been tackled over the past nine or ten years with all-party support about which we can report genuine progress.  We must not count our chickens too soon, however.  We note from the statistics that major challenges remain, so we need to redouble our efforts concerning legislation, advertising and consultation.   The figure of 6,000 people dying annually in this country from tobacco-related illnesses is scandalous.  It is in everybody's interest to ameliorate the situation as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Mr. Glynn</from>
          <p eId="para_183">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach.  We have rarely had a victory such as that represented by the Public Health (Tobacco) Act.  Both Houses should be complimented on having brought forward this legislation unanimously and with the support of trade unions that were conscious of the safety of their members in the workplace.  It is hardly any wonder that the Public Health (Tobacco) Act is being challenged by the tobacco industry.  Is that the same industry that from time to time increased addictive substances contained in tobacco products?  That ensured that smokers would continue to be addicted, thus sustaining their habit.  Dick Turpin may have worn a mask but he was a decent man.  This is an outrageous insult to the public's intelligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I join with others in expressing sympathy to the family of the late Tom Power.  As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I came to know him well.  In the embryonic stages of this legislation, I had much contact with Mr. Power whom I found to be a committed and dedicated person in pursuit of the objectives now contained in the Public Health (Tobacco) Act.  Since its enactment, the legislation has represented a victory for Members of the Oireachtas, trade unions and society in general.  Unfortunately, it was one of the rare proactive measures taken over the years to deal with the scourge of smoking.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">As a former smoker, I had great difficulty in kicking the habit.  I worked in the psychiatric services where the cigarette or pipe was an integral part of the habits of residents of such hospitals.  It does not happen as much as it used to but it was probably associated with their condition.  We all welcome this proactive measure because the reactive measures can be seen in our hospitals when people reach the respiratory clinics and may need a lung transplant.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The general function of the Office of Tobacco Control is to promote a tobacco-free society in accordance with the Government policy document Towards a Tobacco-Free Society.  In tandem with the experience of the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Power, I was pleased to attend a seminar in Luxembourg entitled "Towards a Smoke-Free Europe".  On that occasion, this little dot on the edge of western Europe called Ireland, received resounding tributes for the proactive measures it adopted in the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002.  It was pleasant to listen to highly-placed and well-qualified people paying tribute to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, as well as to the Oireachtas generally.  I was pleased to have taken part in that seminar.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Now that the Act has been enforced, it is time to carry out an audit on its success or failure rate.  When I entered the psychiatric nurses' training school in Mullingar, most of my colleagues smoked.  By the time I had given up smoking, however, of the ten other student nurses only one smoked.  That shows that many people had kicked the habit.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Research shows that the number of smokers in Ireland has declined to 23.6% in August 2005, which is less than one in four of the population.  That represents a decrease from 31% in 1998, which was almost one in three people.  Over the last two years, there has also been a significant drop in the number of cigarettes being smoked, particularly among heavy smokers.  However, there is no room for complacency.  Almost one fifth of 15 to 18 year olds continue to smoke even though it is illegal for tobacco products to be sold to them.  Retailers have to obey the law and we must now turn our attention to more vigorous enforcement of the law in this regard.  In particular, leadership within the retail sector must offer more creative solutions to this problem.  In addition, we need to acknowledge the reality that cigarettes are affordable, particularly for young people.  This issue needs to be addressed as a priority.  I agree with my Opposition colleagues that there should be a significant increase in the price of cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The problem with tobacco is that it is a legal drug and to some extent it is socially acceptable.  In the fullness of time, however, the process whereby people who must now vacate licensed premises to smoke outdoors will bear fruit.  They must make a conscious decision to get up from their comfortable seat indoors to got outside in mid-winter to a cold area to smoke a cigarette.  Surely some of them will realise that what they are doing is not in their best interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">This summer, the Department of Health and Children invited submissions regarding the banning of the sale of cigarettes in packs of less than 20.  It is my hope that once packets of ten cigarettes are prohibited this worrying trend will decline.  Surveys for the Office of Tobacco Control have also found that 92% of under 18s who bought cigarettes were not asked for ID.  So much for the laws that this House and the other House pass.  We can only enact laws, we cannot enforce them.  I ask those whose responsibility it is to enforce the law to do so vigorously in the case of tobacco consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">In July, the British Government announced that it plans to raise the legal age for tobacco consumption to 18 and to introduce tougher penalties for retailers who sell tobacco to under age smokers.  For retailers who sell tobacco to under age smokers the one simple remedy is to take away their licence.  We have to get tough.  Perhaps there is something we could think about in implementing the British proposal here.  The British Minister for Public Health, Carolyn Flynn, pointed out that the younger people start smoking the more likely they are to become lifelong smokers.  Someone who starts to smoke at 15 is three times more likely to die of cancer, due to smoking, than a person who starts in his or her late twenties.  That is not a pleasant statistic.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Another measure demanded by anti-smoking groups, which has proved effective in combatting teenage smoking in Canada, is the use of graphic images showing the damage caused by tobacco on cigarette boxes.  Belgium is about to become the first EU country to introduce this measure this year.  We must continue to target cessation programmes to support smokers to quit.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">In March 2003 a Harvard study found that Irish pubs under smoke-free law in Ireland show a 91% lower indoor air pollution level than Irish pubs in cities around the world.  A study of air pollution levels in traditional Irish pubs around the world has found that indoor air pollution from secondhand smoking in authentic Irish pubs in Ireland is 91% lower than in Irish pubs located in other countries and cities where smoke-free legislation does not exist.  The study conducted by researchers from Harvard School of Public Health and Roswell Park Cancer Institute in conjunction with the Office of Tobacco Control, the Research Institute for a Tobacco Free Society and the environmental health department in the HSE, western area, assessed air samples from 128 Irish pubs in 15 countries in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  It is ironic that virtually every major city in the world has an Irish pub but only those in Ireland and a handful other cities, primarily in North America, have clean healthy air.  That is convincing evidence of the dangers of environmental tobacco smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">The Irish law has also brought health benefits to the public as early research indicators have highlighted.  Its successful implementation and enforcement is encouraging to other countries which intend to follow suit, including our closest neighbours in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  We encourage other countries to do likewise.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Environmental tobacco smoke and the practice of smoking tobacco has been proven to be a known and established carcinogen.  One has only to speak with the experts and visit our hospitals for that proof.  The challenge by the tobacco industry of this law is grossly irresponsible.  I am deeply disappointed but not surprised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_196">I welcome the Minister of State.  Like all those in Washington who congratulated him, I applaud the marvellous effort by the Department of Health and Children, the then Minister for Health and Children, all those involved from ASH, the Irish Heart Foundation, Irish Cancer Society and all the institutions which pushed to get the legislation brought forward.  I am utterly disgusted to hear it is being challenged by the tobacco industry in the courts.  That has to be expected because it is what is being done internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">While the report is encouraging there are some serious issues that need to be addressed.  That the rate of smoking is down to 24% from 31% in 1998 is encouraging.  However, it is worrying that the number of women who smoke is the same as the number of men.  Some years ago I was amazed to see in some parts of England, particularly east London, that the incidence of death from breast cancer in women was superseded by the incidence of death from lung cancer.  Unfortunately the incidence of lung cancer in women is increasing here.  It is probable that we will have to address the issue from a gender point of view.  This is an area we have to deal with because we constantly hear about women drinking more and emulating men by drinking one for one with them.  It appears we have reached a situation where women are achieving in smoking what men are trying to get rid of.  Men start to smoke earlier than women and smoke more but they manage to give up more easily and earlier.  That three quarters of smokers want to quit means we have a receptive audience.  Therefore, it is important to see how we can address this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Other Senators have raised the issue of affordability.  Internationally that is an important consideration in getting people to stop smoking.  I regret that in the 2006 budget there was no increase in tax on tobacco products and I hope this is remedied in the 2007 budget.  It is a good idea that the Minister is bringing forward legislation on the sale of cigarettes in packets of fewer than 20.  Behind the checkouts in many supermarkets are rows and rows of packets of cigarettes.  Access is very important and it is all too easy.  I see people asking for a packet of cigarettes as well as whatever they have put into the shopping basket.  Perhaps the Minister of State would consider access and the position of cigarette products in supermarkets.  This is extremely important in trying to reduce consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">While we have not addressed the issue of advertising here it is important.  It is interesting to note that 60% of those who smoke Marlboro Light are female, as pointed out in the report, that nearly 70% of those who smoke Silk Cut Blue are female and 64% of those who smoke Silk Cut Purple are female while John Player and Benson and Hedges are favoured by male smokers.  How are these products being projected at those who are smoking them?  There must be a subtle difference in the advertising.  The word "light" was included to appeal to women to give the impression that it was not as harmful as ordinary cigarettes.  There is a class action in the United States where a judge has said it was a misleading form of advertising to call any brand "light" as so-called light brands were just as harmful as the regular brands.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">The Minister pointed out that Dr. Shane Allwright's report showed huge changes in those who work in bars in particular.  The improvement was astonishing.  It also shows the dangers of passive smoking.  A good leaflet has been produced on passive smoking entitled Let's Clear the Air and Create a Healthier Environment for Everyone, but I wonder whether it is getting enough circulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">I re-read the 1996 report by the Economic and Social Research Institute, Women and Health Care in Ireland by Miriam Wiley and Barry Merriman, on tobacco and substance abuse.  We will probably find that the trends are much the same, only better, because the incidence of smoking has reduced.  Rural women smoke less than urban women.  This report points out that Connacht-Ulster has the lowest level of smoking with only 20% of the target population smoking whereas in the Dublin area, the figure is 25%.  It is interesting to note how particular factors affected whether a woman smoked in the various categories of women by occupation, education and social class.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We must not just base our help on gender but must break down the figures and help particular groups.  For example, half of women in non-manual jobs but only 40% of women in manual jobs never smoked.  The people least likely to smoke are women in higher professional class jobs, only 16% of whom smoke.  As these figures are somewhat out of date, the numbers should have improved.  However, there is a significant difference between the groups.  Improved figures depend on education.  Only 40% of women with primary education only never smoked whereas almost 70% of women with university education never smoked.  Some 38% of women with medical cards smoke and these are the people who are most likely to have financial troubles.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I found the United States study very interesting.  It showed that a woman in the lower socio-economic class was 3.7 times more likely to smoke during pregnancy.  We have a serious problem with women smoking during pregnancy despite the fact it is well known and publicised that smoking seriously affects the foetus.  Women who smoke have a higher incidence of miscarriage, stillbirth and of low birth weight children and when their children are born they are more at risk of sudden death.  Cot death is tragic for any family.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">It is important to remember that it is not just the woman's smoking that has an effect, but also that of the man or any other people in the house.  Having a child in a smoky atmosphere is bad because children's defence mechanisms are much less developed than at a later date.  Even when children pass the babyhood stage and the risk of sudden infant death, smoking can precipitate respiratory infections like bronchitis and pneumonia.  Children of smokers are also much more likely to get chronic middle ear disease which is the commonest cause of deafness in children.  Lung growth is also slower and these children will have less healthy lungs.  Children with asthma are much more likely to suffer severe attacks if they are exposed to passive smoking.  They will also have frequent coughs and sore throats and miss time from school.  Smoking is, therefore, a serious issue for children.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">It is extraordinary that studies in both Spain and Sweden show that far more pregnant than non-pregnant women gave up smoking.  Unfortunately, we have not managed to get this message through to women.  Large numbers of women here who smoke do not give up smoking during pregnancy as anyone who passes by our maternity hospitals will see by the numbers of women in late pregnancy standing outside dragging on their fags.  We had to close down the little smoking rooms when the legislation was introduced.  Those rooms used to be thick with smoke from the cigarettes of women smoking during late pregnancy, sometimes encouraged by visitors.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Senator Glynn mentioned the situation in psychiatric hospitals where significant smoking takes place.  I remember a time when patients were given cigarettes more or less as a reward for good behaviour.  It is good there has been such an improvement in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Has the Minister of State reconsidered the situation in prisons?  We must remember that all those who do not smoke, whether prison officers or other prisoners, are subject to passive smoke while prisoners are smoking.  Attempts have been made to segregate smokers from non-smokers within cells, but do we need to reconsider the situation?  I understand the prison is the person's home while he or she is there.  On the other hand, if three-quarters of those who smoke want to give up smoking, it might be worthwhile addressing the issue again.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I congratulate the Minister of State on this report.  It is great there has been support from all sides of the House for bringing it forward.  We cannot forget the debate on the ban where it was implied that human life as we knew it would never be the same after the introduction of the ban.  That has been proved totally wrong.  The ban has done nothing except improve the situation for everyone in the country.</p>

        <speech by="#GeraldineFeeney" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Ms Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_209">I welcome the Minister of State to the House and am pleased to have the opportunity to debate this comprehensive report from the Office of Tobacco Control.  Other speakers have outlined the fact that the main objective of the report and the office is to inform public opinion and build support for tobacco control measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The Minister of State spoke about the thrill of being in the United States during the summer and receiving Ireland's deserved reward for the implementation of this measure.  I spent a week in France where I noticed the difference between our non-smoking environment and the French smoking environment.  As soon as I entered my hotel I wondered what was the terrible smell until it dawned on me that everybody in the lobby was smoking cigars or cigarettes.  People were also smoking on the beach around young children.  The weather is so sunny abroad that people eat outdoors, but when we went to eat out at night we were bombarded with smoke again.  Not only is the smell bad, the smoke also affects one's eyes and throat and leaves a horrible lingering smell on clothes.  It is terrible.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">This experience brought home to me how lucky we are in Ireland to enjoy such a smoke free environment, particularly in our workplace and social outlets like pubs and restaurants.  Whenever we sit on a plane or attend the cinema, we wonder how we ever allowed people smoke in these areas.  I hope future generations will continue to ask the same question.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The report outlined stark statistics.  I am delighted to hear the compliance rate is 95%.  When looking at the nice charts dotted throughout the report, I was surprised to see that  fewer than 24% of our population smoke.  I thought the figure would have been lower because that is almost a quarter of the population.  We should be aiming for a figure less than 24%.  Some 93% of people think smoke-free workplaces are a good idea.  What happened the other 7%?  Perhaps they were not awake on the day of the survey.  Everybody in his or her right mind, whether a smoker or not, would like a smoke-free environment.  It is great that of the number of premises inspected, 95% were found compliant.  I was interested in the Minister of State's report that 35,000 premises were inspected by control officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">One fifth of teenagers from 15 to 18 years of age continue to smoke.  This is alarming and it is sad that many of these young people are probably female.  The male-female divide on smoking is 50-50 and as many young women as men smoke.  Six thousand people die per year from tobacco related illness and lifetime smokers have a 50% greater chance of developing tobacco related illnesses.  These are terrible figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Some time ago the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children heard a presentation from thoracic and lung surgeons.  They pointed out how important it was for young women, particularly those with a persistent cough, to ensure they had lung and chest X-rays.  By 2020, lung cancer will be a predominantly female disease in this country.  This is most worrying, particularly when other health risks to which young women are exposed, including excessive drinking, are considered.  Earlier today I heard what might have been an advertisement during the Pat Kenny show which referred to a debate running for a number of weeks in conjunction with an open week for the Rutland Centre.  Reference was made to a public talk with questions and answers entitled "Wine, Women and Wasted Lives".  Today's young women are all bright and well educated.  I do not think they even know what is coming down the road at them.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I was delighted to see that the Minister of State's Department will introduce measures to ban the sale of cigarettes in any amount smaller than a 20 pack.  Price is a major consideration in the fight against tobacco smoking.  If the price is high enough, young people will be deterred from buying cigarettes.  I suggest we lobby the Minister for Finance to make substantial increases in the tax on cigarettes in the upcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I was also delighted to hear the Minister of State refer to the introduction of pictorial warnings on billboards rather than the digital message.  If a message can be set out in picture form, it will have an effect, as has been seen in other instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">I wish Dr. Michael Boland and his ten member board well.  I compliment them on a fine report and on work well done which they should aim to keep up.  Their work and the effects of their work will lead to a win-win situation; there are no losers in this one.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_218">Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit, ó mo chontae dhúchais féin, fear a bhfuil an-mheas agam air.  I join with those who expressed sympathy and regret at the loss of Mr. Power, whom I did not know but who obviously had made a considerable impression.  I wish to pay an unqualified tribute to my constituency colleague and fellow resident of Cork, on a very brave decision which pitted him against forces that were up until then regarded as invincible in Ireland.  The vintners' lobby was one of the lobbies with which most politicians and parties were profoundly reluctant to engage in a head to head contest.  It was taken to be a fact of political life that if one took on the publicans head on, one would lose.  The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, did not lose and the country benefited enormously from the measure.  It was a world-leading decision and one which will spread across the whole planet.  In my view, within 20 or 25 years, countries in which it is permitted to smoke in public places such as bars and restaurants and public buildings, will be the extraordinary exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">I fully share my colleague's view about the cultural and aesthetic shock of going into premises outside of Ireland — particularly in our neighbouring island — and suddenly facing the odour of smoke.  One of the pleasant side-effects of the smoking ban in our licensed premises has been a spectacular improvement in the general hygiene of the places because smells that were once covered up by the smell of smoke are no longer covered up and therefore have had to be dealt with properly.  This is a commendable improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I am concerned that the extraordinary success of the Irish smoking ban has provoked multinationals into watching this country much more closely.  I refer to the extraordinary image of the ambassador of the United States lobbying against a levy on chewing gum, presumably the fear of further good example being the issue.  I note the collapse of the Government's attempt to prohibit alcohol advertising which I believe was also the result of extraordinary lobbying.  What has been achieved is wonderful but the forces that lobby for the <i>status quo</i> in many areas where public health is concerned have now decided that Ireland is a country to be watched very carefully.  I regard this as a form of backhanded compliment.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">It is always difficult for people who do not smoke, including myself, to understand the appeal of smoking.  I can find most of the vices in life enormously appealing.  I am naturally disposed towards vice and I do not think it is original sin; it is rather nice to have sex and——</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_223">I will not go into too much detail.  Smoking has never been a vice that I could see the point of.  I can see the point of every other vice.  If smoking was not addictive, people would give it up very quickly because I do not believe it gives any great long-term satisfaction.  It is something people start and they then become addicted and cannot give up.  By the time they realise it is doing them health damage, they find it extraordinarily difficult and begin to rationalise it.  If it was not addictive, most people would not stick at it for very long.  This is a very serious issue even though I am making the point in a good-humoured way.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I have a few suggestions for the Minister of State.  I fully support the idea of a minimum amount of 20 cigarettes per packet, which I would prefer to be a minimum of 200 but that is a separate issue.  I do not believe in prohibition in most cases for substances that are currently prohibited but that is not to say I would legalise them because that would not be possible.  Prohibition does not work very well.  However, one can take constructive, concerted action to reduce accessibility.  It may be worth considering whether cigarettes should be available only in premises which are to a degree restricted to persons over 18 years, such as licensed premises, where people under 18 should not really be present other than accompanied by an adult.  The purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products should be restricted to places where only people over 18 have routine and regular access.  There is a case to be made that all third level education centres and all training centres should prohibit the sale of cigarettes in any shops in those premises or anywhere there are people in the most vulnerable age group.  We should seriously consider whether shops within a half mile radius of a second level school are appropriate places to sell cigarettes.  I suggest a town like my own home town, Athy, or Newbridge, towns of 10,000 population, should have one or two places selling cigarettes.  These could be identified as the places where one could buy cigarettes.  Cigarettes should not be part of the normal range of products on sale in normal shops.  I fully support some of my colleagues in the view that where retailers sell cigarettes to people under age, the same succession of penalties that arise in the case of pubs that sell to people under age should apply.  These include various warnings followed by a closedown for a week.  I believe many retailers would give up selling cigarettes because of the nuisance value involved if such penalties were in existence.  I am informed the margin of profit is minuscule and that cigarettes are only sold to encourage people to purchase other products.  There is a case for a steady succession of measures to reduce the number of places in which cigarettes can be bought.  Cigarettes should not be sold in any place where large numbers of young people congregate, such as outside cinemas.  None of these will end the effects of smoking, but it should be made more difficult for people under 18 to be anywhere they can get their hands on cigarettes.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">There is a genuine case to be made about the price of cigarettes.  I do not know if much can be done about it as I appreciate the argument that if the price is increased a huge incentive is provided for smuggling.  I accept that, but I believe the issue is worth reconsidering.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">I will mention some issues that I know to be true because I have been told about them, rather than witnessing them myself.  Apparently there is a practice in many rural areas of a certain flexibility in pub closing times, and ashtrays may appear when the doors close at 11.30 p.m.  An old-fashioned environment is then reinstated.  Another example was reported to me by a publican in a part of Munster during the European elections.  I was told that every Saturday afternoon people come in to see the Premiership matches.  The doors are locked and the ashtrays are put out for the duration of the match, as these people will not come in to see a football match if they have to go outside to smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It is time we spoke in a language that makes sense.  The tobacco industry is made up of a form of drug baron.  It has no more moral justification than Colombian drug barons for its existence.  It serves no useful social or human purpose.  Therefore I suggest to the Minister of State that as a fundamental principle of public policy, the National Treasury Management Agency and the National Pensions Reserve Fund should not invest in any industry which forms part of the tobacco industry.  I would go as far as to state that our whole pensions industry, a major investor, should have a disincentive attached to investment in tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">There is no redeeming quality in tobacco, and it is an evil and dangerous product that has done enormous harm to people.  It would not be continued in use if it was not inherently addictive.  The idea of my and other people's pension funds being invested in an industry which will shorten people's lives seems to be a contradiction.  I welcome the progress that has been made but I recognise more must be done.</p>

        <speech by="#EamonScanlon" eId="spk_108">
          <from>Mr. Scanlon</from>
          <p eId="para_229">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to the House.  I congratulate the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, on implementing the ban on smoking in workplaces.  At the time of implementation I did not agree with him and if I had a free vote at the time I would have voted against the measure, as I used to be a smoker.  I know what the addiction entails.  I used to smoke 50 cigarettes a day up until 2 January this year.  I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on the subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">I know it is very difficult to give up cigarettes.  If smoking in bars was still permitted, I would not still be off cigarettes.  Usually if a person goes out for a drink and people are smoking, that person would smoke.  I now find that when a person goes out for a drink to a local bar, for example, nobody is smoking and one does not have the urge to smoke.  A person can have a drink in comfort.  I find this to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">There were many anti-smoking advertisements on television and on billboards.  Two advertisements affected me.  On television a 34-year-old man's lungs were shown.  I will not describe what was in them as it was revolting.  A billboard advertisement showed the brain of somebody who had suffered a stroke.  The brain was dissected and clots of blood, etc., were visible.  These advertisements affected and helped me.  They undoubtedly make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">In my home town there are two secondary schools, with approximately 1,000 children attending.  When school finishes at a 3.45 p.m. or 3.50 p.m., I see the children coming from school.  These young people range from 15 years to 17 years.  The number smoking is frightening.  The Office of Tobacco Control states that less than 24% of the Irish population are smokers.  I honestly would not accept those figures as I believe many more people than that are smoking, particularly young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Senator Feeney mentioned the frightening statistic that by 2020, the biggest fatal disease in females will be lung cancer.  It is important that we always keep vigilant.  It has been proven beyond all doubt that smoking is very bad for us, but we must persist in getting that message out.  The message is not getting to young people.  It did for a time but recently, judging from what I see, young people are again smoking in greater numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I am unsure as to whether it is a question of price or money.  I was in a shop on a recent Saturday morning where a young girl was buying some bits and pieces.  She got her cards and other bits, although she was not buying cigarettes.  I would estimate she had €100 in her purse, although she was a young girl of perhaps 13 years old.  It is not a question of money, as children undoubtedly have money.  Although increasing the price of cigarettes is a deterrent, it is not the answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">As a member of the North Western Health Board, I was aware of the practice of inspectors going into shops, particularly small corner shops.  People running those shops usually employ young people to help out during the summer.  In a number of cases, an inspector would have a 15-year-old girl with him or her dressed up to look older than 18, and these people would be used to catch out a young person behind the counter in the selling of cigarettes.  That is not the way to go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">There have been 38 prosecutions in the country since the regulation was introduced.  One prosecution was unsuccessful because the small shop owner fought the case and won it in court.  It is wrong to carry out such a practice with small shop owners, as the fine is €3,000.  Most business people are compliant and do not sell cigarettes to people under 18.  I honestly believe this.  It may occur if a young person is behind the counter.  I know these fines must be in place but it is wrong to try to trick somebody.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergalQuinn" eId="spk_109">
          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_237">It has been an interesting debate.  One facet of it is the big problem of the number of people hooked on cigarettes and who cannot give them up.  I have the Dominicans at Newbridge College to thank, as they created in me such an interest in getting on the football team that I was afraid to smoke in case I did not get on the team.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, comes from that part of the world as well, although I am unsure as to whether he supports the Newbridge team to the same extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I know of a person hooked on cigarettes who is in hospital at the moment.  She is in her 70s, and she has huge difficulties.  It seems to be one of the big challenges we are facing.  The success of the ban on smoking in the workplace proves that we can successfully change deeply rooted behaviour if we put our minds to it in the right way.  Our task now is to ensure that we do not sit back following the implementation of the ban, that we move on the other areas of concern spoken about today.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The evidence shows that although the overall level of smoking remains static, there is a worrying increase, particularly in the numbers of young people and women smoking.  How are we going to face up to this?  Despite the success of the workplace ban, we should not be tempted into thinking that prohibition is an acceptable strategy in coping with the more general problem, as it is not.  Down through the centuries and across the world, states have proved to be very unsuccessful in changing behaviour that is disapproved of.  Generally speaking, when people are determined to act, they will find a way to do so whether inside or outside the law.  We must persuade people not to smoke.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Research has conclusively proved that education, or propaganda if one prefers to call it that, can only go so far.  It has a place in the overall scheme but its effectiveness is quite limited.  It seems to become less effective as the level of smoking drops.  As we heard today, we are lucky to have a relatively low level of smoking in Ireland, with only one quarter of the population smoking.  Those smokers are the hard core and, as such, the most difficult to persuade to change their attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">We must face up to the fact that among some groups in society, namely, young people and women, smoking levels are increasing.  We are fortunate that research also shows us the way forward.  Repeated studies show the most effective persuader against smoking is price.  Senator Ryan mentioned the danger of smuggling but I understand cigarettes are far more expensive in Northern Ireland than in the Republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Significant rises in the price of cigarettes consistently produce significant reductions in the number of people smoking.  There comes a point when everybody realises it is simply not worth it to continue smoking.  That point is reached when the impact of smoking really hits the pocket.  It is not surprising the latest report of the Office of Tobacco Control makes a renewed plea to the Government to sharply increase the price of smoking well above the rate of inflation.  Small increases have no effect on changing behaviour while sharp increases do.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">In the past, the Government ignored such pleas and we must ask why.  Cynics might state the Minister for Finance wants to protect the revenue he raises from tobacco duty.  I do not subscribe to that view.  The political reluctance to do what is best for the health of the country and its citizens is due to the fact that cigarettes feature in the cost of living index.  A sharp price increase in cigarettes would be immediately reflected in the inflation rate.  Today we heard people discussing our high inflation rate compared to other parts of Europe.  Inflation is also a threat with regard to the programme for the future and 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The inflation-linked index is a show-stopper and as a long-time implacable foe of inflation, I understand that.  However, a sensible way out of the dilemma would be to remove cigarettes from the basket of goods which the Central Statistics Office uses in reckoning the monthly cost of living index.  The problem would instantly disappear.  Once cigarettes were removed from the basket they would not affect the rate of inflation no matter how much they cost.  No wider political downside to a sharp increase in the price of cigarettes would exist.  Smokers would object but the wider body of taxpayers would not be affected in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">Lobbying for a substantial increase in the price of cigarettes while the link to inflation remains is whistling in the wind.  We know it will never happen.  Serious campaigners against smoking should concentrate on getting agreement to remove cigarettes from the basket of goods used in calculating the cost of living index.  If that is done, the political impediment to raising the price will immediately fall away.  I urge the Minister of State to bring this to the attention of the Minister for Finance.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_110">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
          <p eId="para_246">I thank the Senators for their contributions this afternoon.  It was interesting to listen to people give honest opinions rather than feel they must defend a particular party line.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">As Senators are aware, the impact of tobacco consumption on public health has been well documented in numerous reports from many agencies and organisations, both nationally and internationally.  The range of diseases and ill health, including lung cancer and other cancers, heart disease, emphysema and chronic bronchitis, associated with tobacco smoke leaves us in no doubt of the absolute necessity to maintain an effective public health campaign.  We will maintain that campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I will deal with some of the issues raised, including price increases.  I accept the maintenance of a high price for tobacco products is an important factor in preventing people, particularly children, from experimenting with tobacco.  That is one reason we will introduce a ban on packets of fewer than 20 cigarettes.  I hope to be in a position shortly to announce a date for its commencement.  We recently placed an advertisement in newspapers informing the industry of our intentions and we will go ahead with this.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">When a ban on smoking in the workplace was first proposed it was strongly opposed by the tobacco and drinks industries.  We were warned about the devastating effect it would have on employment.  Their main fear was a downturn in profits but the main plank in their argument was that unemployment levels would increase, which did not materialise.  Few families in the country have not been affected by tobacco, alcohol or both.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The tobacco industry glamorises its product.  Normally, young pretty women are seen smoking in sexy ads aimed at young people.  The reason is new people must be recruited on a regular basis because their customers are dying.  As Senator Bradford stated, 6,000 people die in this country each year from smoking-related illnesses.  Campaigns are aimed at recruiting young people and the earlier they can do so the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">The drinks industry works in a similar way.  Last week, we were fortunate to host a wonderful event, namely, the Ryder Cup.  It was a great success watched by approximately 1 billion people throughout the world.  It was unfortunate that when it finished, the sporting idols to whom we all looked up glamorised drink in the manner they did after winning the competition.  It was an opportunity which could have been used in a far more worthwhile fashion.  That is a matter for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">In the advertisements run by the tobacco industry, no mention is made of the cancers, infected lungs, heart disease or discoloured teeth which are a result of smoking.  We are all familiar with research showing the dreadful impact and effect smoking can have on a person's health.  We have made a great deal of progress and given great hope to other countries on what can be achieved.  It is important that we do not rest on our laurels but that we continue to build on the success we have enjoyed.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">Earlier, I mentioned my recent visit to the United States to receive an honour on behalf of the Government.  We are regularly visited by people from countries which wish to learn from our experience.  I always make the point to them that while the Government, particularly the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, showed great leadership, the support of Opposition parties and trade unions was an extremely important factor.  All parties had individual members who were opposed to the measure but as parties we supported it, which made it easier to implement and contributed greatly to its success.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Senator Henry raised the issue of point of sale advertising.  The tobacco industry is challenging in court a measure to get rid of advertising in shops, such as colourful tobacco holders.  We were banning that type of advertising and trying to ensure that tobacco would be sold from an enclosed area so it would not be possible to see where the product was in a shop and a customer would need to ask the person behind the counter.  Those are some of the measures being opposed.  However, we are confident that we will be successful in that regard and we will continue with the battle.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">It was nice to listen to Senator Henry sharing some of her experiences and the knowledge she has from her professional life.  I also listened to Senator Scanlon who took a tough decision in quitting what had been the habit of a lifetime.  He has given others hope of what can be achieved.  I will pass on Senator Quinn's remarks to the Dominicans at Newbridge College.  They will be delighted they had such an influence on him.  I hope they will have the same success with their present day pupils as they had with the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">It is all about new challenges.  While some Senators raised issues and recommended certain measures, no single measure will bring change.  However, the combination of measures will succeed in reducing the number of people smoking.  As I said, we have seen a reduction.  In 1998 some 31% of the adult population smoked.  Last year the figure had reduced to 24%.  We want to ensure the figure continues to drop and we will make every effort to ensure that the reduction in the number of smokers continues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_262">I move this motion on broadband in the full knowledge and with certain surprise that the number of column inches and the number of minutes devoted to broadband in this and the other House is painfully small.  In his reply I would like the Minister of State to outline why broadband has had so little prominence in Irish political life in recent years.  It seems to be one of the crying problems of the economy and desperately needs attention, particularly political attention.  We only need to consider the statistics issued by various bodies to understand how badly Ireland is doing in the broadband stakes.  In this debate I do not wish to engage in a pointless pass-the-buck blame game.  However, it is very important that the results of this debate show that the Government is determined that our place in the European and other leagues is improved dramatically.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">How on earth have we such a booming economy when we are so far behind in this vital infrastructure?  We only need to review the statistics to underline that question.  The figures issued, I believe, by the European Commission as recently as this year show we are ranked 19th out of 25 in the European league for broadband.  If the accession countries are excluded, we are only ranked, I believe, 14th out of 15.  That is a lamentable performance by Ireland, on which we will need to improve very quickly if we are to maintain our position as the economic heroes of Europe.  There are two other pillars of this economic boom in which we have excelled.  Obviously the rate of corporate tax has benefited this country enormously and our young population has been of great benefit to the country.  However, that our infrastructure and particularly our telecommunications infrastructure is so poor indicates that it is vital that if we are not to fall down and lose our position at the top of the economic growth league, we must immediately take emergency measures to improve our position on broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Sometimes we pride ourselves on being a much more modern, progressive and economically vibrant state than Northern Ireland, where broadband is accessible to every household.  However, in the Republic of Ireland our figures are considerably below 50%.  How is it that broadband is available to every household in Northern Ireland, but is not available to businesses and people down here who are crying out for it?  The actions in Northern Ireland should be commended and considered by the Government.  The authorities in Northern Ireland took the sensible, sober and modern attitude that broadband should be regarded as a vital utility and should rank along with water, electricity, telephones, gas and other utilities available to every home and business.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">We do not take that attitude here.  We take a strangely <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to broadband, whereas we take an extraordinary attitude to State interference in other matters of far less importance.  There is an unanswerable case for taking a route similar to that taken in Northern Ireland.  The Minister of State can correct me if I am wrong.  In Northern Ireland I believe that O2, as the kind of incumbent operator, was subsidised by local government in those areas where it was uneconomic for broadband to penetrate.  It then became available to everybody.  Let us not pretend that those of us who are free-marketeers always say there should be no subsidies, no state support and no state interference.  There are cases and this is one of them.  If broadband is not provided, the community, the nation and its infrastructure will suffer.  The Republic of Ireland is coming close to that state.  We need efficiency.  We have plenty of money.  We got €200 million out of Aer Lingus today and the Minister will not know what to do with it.  What better way to spend that capital than to put it into infrastructure of this sort to improve the economy of the country in a permanent and measurable way.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">Let me applaud the efforts of those promoting broadband.  Let me single out, in particular, the Irish Internet Association, which has run a gutsy campaign without enough Government support highlighting that three prongs are necessary in broadband promotion.  Those three prongs are what is known as the three As, namely, awareness, availability and adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The first problem we have to address is that the awareness of broadband among the people of this country is lamentably low.  Last week, the Minister announced he would provide €350,000 for an awareness campaign but that amount, which represents about 20 cent per PC owner, is far too small.  We need a campaign which would make people in schools, communities and other groups aware not only that broadband is available but that it is necessary for small businesses and the people of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">If awareness is increased so that people know broadband is necessary for competitiveness, the second stage is to make it available.  However, it cannot be made available without a tremendous push from the Government.  Entire areas complain they are unable to get broadband.  I see no reason the Government should not increase broadband availability by offering tax breaks to entrepreneurs.  Small broadband companies are being established in a rather disorganised manner, without Government assistance, in order to offer broadband to various communities.  That makes one realise broadband is being made available on a random basis in this country.  It is usually based on the local exchange and it is often a matter of luck whether a service is available.  A plan is needed through which the Government would give tax breaks to entrepreneurs who are prepared to take risks in this area so that the promotion of broadband in certain areas is incentivised.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">A thorny issue has arisen with regard to the incumbent, Eircom.  Governments have tended to blame the incumbent for dragging its heels and, while that may be the case, the fact of the matter is that an incumbent will not naturally assist its competitors.  However, one competitor, Smart Telecom, has gotten into big trouble.  That company has managed to enrol a paltry 16,000 customers on its broadband services.  Whether through tax breaks or a shareholding taken by the Government, companies which are established to promote broadband need massive encouragement.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">With regard to the third A, adoption, once people know that broadband is available, they must be persuaded to take it up.  Again, we must incentivise large and small businesses.  What better way to offer incentives than through a scrappage scheme, which would offer tax breaks or grants to people to discard narrowband and upgrade to broadband.  Strong efforts are needed to lift Irish businesses to the level at which they can compete with their peers overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">What message is being sent to multinationals based in Ireland when they see how lamentably bad we are with regard to broadband?  They see a wonderfully attractive country but are beginning to look to eastern Europe and we do not know what losses will result.  Surveys I have seen suggest that by being so far behind, we risk losing as much as 1% of GNP over the longer term.  If the Government is to launch a campaign to increase broadband take-up, it should not only use tax breaks but also a major educational programme in schools.  Reputable consultants and economists warn that the cost to the economy will be highly damaging if we do not improve this vital part of our infrastructure.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_272">I second this crucial motion and thank my colleague, Senator Ross, for tabling it.  The Cathaoirleach probably did not read the Government amendment very closely because he would have ruled it out of order if he had.  It is an astonishing amendment.  At the very least, I ask the Minister of State to remove the third section, which states: "after a late start Ireland's rate of broadband take-up is continuing to accelerate".  That is factually incorrect.  We were second last in Europe last year and in the same position this year.  It is not a matter of take-up but of availability.  The Minister of State should not blame the public because there is no problem with take-up when broadband is available.  I live 15 miles from here, yet I cannot get broadband.  I have a satellite one-way dial-up system which barely works.  When I travel around the country, I find that services are hit and miss.  Sometimes a 3G data card will work at 3G level but more commonly it is at GPRS or dial-up level.  The situation is absolutely appalling but this amendment suggests that the Government is not committed to addressing the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">During the debate on the sale of Eircom, I made a similar point about the information super highway, as it was known in those days.  I said that I did not see Dr. O'Reilly bringing broadband to Belmullet or Dingle because it would not be worth his while to do so.  That is exactly what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Senator Ross correctly pointed out that economic growth is being inhibited.  Some people cannot participate in economic growth because of their location.  Women who could work from home if broadband was available are being prevented from returning to the economy.  Figures show that we are constantly dropping behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">The amendment makes reference to ComReg.  It should be noted that, in addition to the second worst broadband availability, Ireland also has the largest mobile telephone bills and highest line rental charges in Europe.  These issues are related because when I cannot connect to the internet with my 3G card, I have to use my mobile telephone at very significant cost.  Similarly, people use dial-up connections when they should have an always-on connection with broadband.  The Government is exacerbating the situation in terms of telephone bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">It would be easy to make an always-on up and down broadband service available to every house in Ireland through satellite.  I am not impressed by the municipal local area networks because they address the problem only in small towns while using a lot of unnecessary wires.  We could provide broadband by satellite if we had the will to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">We should give close consideration to the points made by Senator Ross.  Economic growth is being inhibited and the country is being made less attractive for investors and industry.  Crucially, research and development is being hindered.  It is also inhibiting postgraduate, particularly postdoctoral, research that is crucial to economic growth in this country.  It makes the delivery of public services more expensive and inhibits the development of e-commerce.  The European position is that the use of broadband in the delivery of public services and the development of e-commerce to allow business outsourcing, has a positive impact on regional development, traffic congestion and economic development in the regions.  Ireland has signed up to this but nothing is happening because of the lack of broadband.  Teleworking, growing at an extraordinary rate in Europe, is inhibited in Ireland because of the lack of broadband.  It is preventing women from returning to the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">We must allow access to broadband if we are to develop modern industry.  This morning I spoke to someone who lives in the constituency of the Minister of State.  He undertook postdoctoral research in California.  He wishes to set up a company in Ireland and broadband is crucial to him.  It will be a success story but he cannot develop his company in that constituency.  It is not a problem in the ether, it affects every constituency.  Access to broadband stimulates economic growth, boosting productivity, creating employment and assisting the economic growth of regional areas.  Broadband is of crucial importance to the Government's programme of expansion and gateway towns.  The problem is that we fell behind in this area.</p>

I agree that this can only happen through public delivery and private investment.  Smart Telecom is an example of how the private sector is unable to deliver because the support structures are not available.  Only 16,000 people signed up for its scheme.  Smart Telecom was the only company not dependent on Eircom, which is why it needs support.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Some companies have received the franchise to provide broadband to a certain county.  Along county borders, neighbours 100 yards away from each other cannot receive broadband from the same company.  I have seen examples of this along the Dublin-Meath border.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I will disappoint Senator O'Toole because I will not withdraw the amendment.  I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_285">To delete all words after "Seanad Eireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_286">—Recognising that—</p>
          <p eId="para_287">—telecommunications services, including broadband, in Ireland are provided by the electronic communications sector operating in a fully liberalised market;</p>
          <p eId="para_288">—the market is regulated where necessary by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the statutory body responsible for the regulation of the sector;</p>

          <p eId="para_290">commends—</p>
          <p eId="para_291">—the Government for its proactive interventions such as supporting the construction of metropolitan area networks in many areas and providing capital grants under the county and group broadband scheme, which is helping to bring broadband subscriber numbers to more than 400,000 by the end of 2006;</p>
          <p eId="para_292">—broadband providers for responding to the challenging target for broadband connectivity set by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources two years ago; and</p>
          <p eId="para_293">—the recent announcement by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources that he is initiating a process to deliver broadband services to those areas in Ireland where it is currently uneconomic for the sector to provide broadband connectivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">I agree with Senators Ross and O'Toole on the importance of broadband but the current situation is not due to a lack of effort by the Government.  Many of the contributions referred to the lack of availability of broadband.  I disagree with Senator O'Toole's statement that broadband is not being taken up due to its unavailability.  The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has examined this issue.  In areas where broadband is available from more than one company, it is not being taken up.  I do not know the reason for this, it may have been the initial price.  As the market is relatively small it may be difficult to initiate competition.  I could not lay my hands on a report I had seen from a few years ago.  It dealt with the number of computers in houses in different EU countries.  Ireland was at the lower end of the scale.  Despite being proportionately the largest exporter of software, we do not have computers in houses.  If there are no computers in houses, people will not seek broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">Our low position on various broadband take-up surveys is mainly a reflection of the delay in the launch of competitive broadband services in Ireland in comparison with other countries.  Representatives and observers of the Irish telecommunications industry agree that Ireland has a relatively low number of broadband subscribers because the full-scale launch took place 18-24 months after the launch in other countries.  The take-up time lag of two years was a result of this, as well as the late launch of competitively priced digital subscriber lines by the incumbent telecommunications operator.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Senator Ross does not know if such problems exist but investigations undertaken show that there are problems with the incumbent.  Due to financial difficulties, cable television networks did not emerge as significant infrastructure competitors <i>vis-à-vis</i> the DSL telephone platform in Ireland.  The deterioration in the share values of telecommunications companies curtailed the scope for the additional investment required to launch broadband services in Ireland.  Coupled with the lack of competition between broadband service providers, such as telephone and cable television companies, the reduction in investment in the aftermath of the dotcom crash weakened the initial introduction of broadband in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">However, we have moved on and there are now more than 400,000 subscribers in this country.  This figure is growing by approximately 17,000 per month.  It is similar to pushing a car — it is difficult at the start but once it gets moving, it will accelerate.  This is why I disagree with Senator O'Toole's request to remove a reference to acceleration in the Government amendment.  Why is demand accelerating now?  The schools project is one of the Government initiatives in this area.  Broadband is not available in every school in the country.  Schools were a target and, by and large, most schools have access to broadband.  That has generated demand in the home because the children want it at home as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">One of the most important developments, given that there is a problem in rural areas, is the group broadband scheme.  This scheme, which part-funds communities who wish to develop their own broadband services, is the Government's most significant initiative to ensure broadband coverage in more dispersed rural areas.  The scheme is now in its second phase.  Under that phase, a total of 119 projects have been approved to date.  So far, this represents an investment of €12.4 million in 445 communities covering a population of 355,000 people.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">Today the most fortunate Irish consumers have the choice of receiving broadband by means of DSL from a telecommunications operator, wireless from an FWA provider or over cable from their cable television company.  It is reasonable to expect that within the next 12 months half of Irish households may be able to choose between at least two of these three options.  In the cases of DSL and FWA it is reasonable to assume there will continue to be competition, with multiple players offering both technologies.  In the cable sector it is difficult to predict the pace of broadband roll-out beyond the plans announced by the then two main operators to enable at least 200,000 customers by 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">This level of inter-platform competition which is finally emerging in Ireland, somewhat later than in many other OECD countries, should have the effect of ensuring strong price competition for broadband services on an ongoing basis.  It is hard to imagine carriers charging higher prices for their products in different regions of the country simply because they believe there is less competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I had hoped to speak about the small and medium sized enterprises sector, which needs broadband to develop business but I do not have time to do so.  I commend the Government's motion.  Progress is being made and the Government will continue to take every step to roll out broadband as extensively as possible throughout the country.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_119">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_302">I acknowledge the work of the Independent Senators in bringing this worthy motion before the House.  The previous speaker referred to the amendment.  The amendment does not say anything tangible about the future or about whatever success has been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">The Government has failed in the provision of broadband to ensure Ireland keeps up with the immense technological growth that has seen such huge advances in the competitiveness of our European neighbours.  Some years ago Ireland was being applauded for our IT and technological advances and was an attractive location for foreign industries.  However, we have reversed the engines with our failure in the provision of broadband.  I listened to the Senator's defence of the Government's record.  I am not seeking to say everything is bad and that nothing is improving but Fine Gael believes that the Government woke up too late to the problem and failed to recognise the scale of the task it faced.  As a result, Ireland is now desperately trying to catch up with our neighbours, with limited success.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">It is undeniable that there are increasing numbers of broadband lines and broadband subscribers and that there will be more of each in the future.  The total number of broadband subscribers in Ireland, according to the latest report from the communications regulator, was up to 372,000.  Recently, the Minister claimed a higher figure of 410,000.  I read the Forfás report produced in 2004.  That report predicted that by the end of November 2004, there would be 450,000 subscribers and that there would be 700,000 by the end of 2007.  From November 2004 to October 2006, there are fewer subscribers than was predicted by Forfás in 2004.  That demonstrates our lack of success in advancing the provision of broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">Some private operators, despite Government indifference and statutory paralysis, have made great efforts to get Ireland on-line.  Recently, O2 announced it is investing €250 million in a network upgrade that will pave the way for the introduction of mobile broadband.  The development will allow O2 to offer third generation mobile services and broadband to its customers.  I am pleased with reports that the company is beginning with the Republic's main urban centres and then extending the work into rural areas.  I urge it to ensure that the extension of the network to rural areas becomes a reality.  It believes that its new services will cover 60% of the population by the end of this year, 80% by the end of next year and then proceed to cover 99.6% of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The Minister has spoken of his plans to expand the regional broadband scheme to give coverage to the remaining 15% of the Republic's population that does not have access to high speed telecommunications services.  The Department has spent more than €80 million over the last three years developing broadband infrastructure throughout the State.  This includes the metropolitan area networks, commonly called MANs, for large towns and urban areas, group broadband schemes for smaller population centres, and school projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">It is worth bearing in mind that the network for metropolitan area networks is being managed by e-net.  It states it has 19 customers who are telecommunications operators.  Incredibly, however, it cannot give us an idea of the number of residential customers who use the network to get broadband.  One would imagine that e-net would be able to link with its 19 customers and establish with each of them the number of its residential customers.  That would give the overall number of people who are availing of the MANs system, a system that was installed at considerable expense by the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">I understood the logic of the State getting involved at the time.  The telecommunications companies were finding things difficult financially and, therefore, would not put in the type of investment required to stimulate broadband provision.  The State had to intervene.  Of the 27 MANs built throughout the country, 22 can deliver broadband to customers.  What has happened to the other five?  They are not linked to the fibre rings in those areas, which is the essential technology required to supply the broadband resource to communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">We originally assumed that Eircom would plug its fibre into these MANs to provide the broadband but that has not happened.  We are aware of what has happened to Eircom and the changes that have taken place in the company over some time.  When Babcock and Brown took over Eircom, I hoped the Minister would intervene to try to ensure that there would be local loop unbundling.  We have had dismal success in that regard.  Only approximately 2.5% of the DSL lines in the country are subject to local loop unbundling.  Eircom has approximately 75% of those carrier lines.  There has been dismal failure in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">I wish to quote a letter I received recently from Limerick County Council.  It sums up the frustrations that exist with regard to broadband and the Government's decision, or indecision, in that regard.  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_311">Dear Senator Finucane,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_312">I am writing to you in my capacity as a Director on the Board of Shannon Broadband Limited regarding the current uncertainty surrounding the extension of broadband in the county.  The position briefly is as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_313">There is approval for eight additional fibre rings to be installed in the region; [this encompasses the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen's, constituency of Clare] two of these are in County Limerick — Abbeyfeale and Newcastle West.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_314">All of the route selection and design work has been completed in respect of these projects and advance works are actually in progress in Abbeyfeale.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">We have been waiting for this for years.  I recall being on the county council many years ago when this was first mooted by Shannon Development in conjunction with the partners in the different local authorities.  What has happened?  The letter continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_316">Shannon Broadband are ready to go to tender for the civils and have been so since early August but have been instructed to hold off by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who are currently considering amending the planned fibre networks (MANS) to wireless solutions which it is anticipated might facilitate the extension of broadband to a greater number of locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">This may appear a laudable objective but we have been waiting for years for MANs to be established to give proper broadband links to communities.  The letter continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_318">Shannon Broadband have serious concerns regarding this potential course of action for a number of reasons:  Primarily, it is considered that moving to a wireless solution would essentially be seen as a downgrade in the standard of broadband which would be available in the selected locations and so would weaken the potential for attracting economic investment into these areas.  In many ways it could be seen to reflect the decision on the Red Cow roundabout many years ago in that it may save money now but ultimately would involve upgrades or alternative solutions at a later stage to stay in line with the rapid advances in technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The letter concludes: "I would greatly appreciate if you could pursue this matter with the appropriate decision makers as a matter of extreme urgency and convey the concerns of Shannon Broadband Limited in this regard."  I presume the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will have received a copy of this letter and will be aware of the frustrations of Shannon Broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">This letter, written by the director of service, community and enterprise, HR and corporate services in Limerick County Council, was probably circulated to all Oireachtas Members in the mid-western region.  It outlines her frustrations, as a director of the board of Shannon Broadband, regarding the absence of activity in this area.  The advances made by Shannon Broadband in recent years have been thwarted and sidelined as a result of a change of policy in the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in what has been an excellent example of joined-up thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">I ask the Minister of State to give an appropriate response and inform the House of what the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is up to in this regard in order that I can relay this information to others.  I have much more to say but my time has elapsed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_322">I welcome the Minister of State.  Broadband is important and, as Senators all agree, must be available to every business, household and school.  I support the amendment because the Government has acknowledged it must accelerate growth in broadband availability.  The perception is that broadband availability is focused in cities and towns with rural and remote communities required to wait longer for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Having read the Minister's report, it is clear the Government is pressing ahead in this area.  In 2004, Ireland had only 63,000 broadband subscribers, a figure which had increased to more than 400,000 in 2006.  The position has improved in the past two years but where do we go from here?  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has been involved in the regulation of the sector.  The notes I received today indicate the Government has established a framework that is in line with the European Union regulatory framework.  ComReg, the regulatory body, is facilitating discussions at all levels in an effort to ensure the last mile, as it is described, is opened up to all operators.  In addition, the Minister has urged all parties involved to co-operate in this discussion.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">On broadband infrastructure, the notes indicate that the regional broadband programme covers three areas, the first of which is the metropolitan area network aimed at business, which is targeted at towns and cities with a population of more than 1,500.  This network is being established by the e-net managers network and progress is being made.  Although there appears to be broad satisfaction, progress must be accelerated in order that everyone can become knowledgeable about how broadband works.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The second aspect of the programme, the group broadband scheme, facilitates local people living in centres with a population of less than 1,500 to come together with service providers.  Perhaps we need to push harder but I welcome Government measures to create infrastructure aimed at making progress in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I understand broadband is available in practically every school.  A joint industry programme brings business people and schools together to work closely on improving the network.  Having asked several schools about this programme, particularly in urban areas, I am aware that it is working well.  Nevertheless, we need to ensure every school has access to broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Minister is examining options to bring broadband to 100% of the population and he expects to bring proposals to the Government for discussion.  A major effort is under way to advance broadband roll-out, even if this may not be proceeding as quickly as we would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Senator Ross noted a lack of awareness about broadband availability.  He may be correct and perhaps an awareness campaign is required.  I note, however, that the Government established a new information website to help consumers and business obtain the best deal in securing broadband access.  A cross-Border television advertising campaign is highlighting the benefits of broadband for households and businesses and a further cross-Border campaign scheduled to run in 2007 and 2008 will focus on the safe use of the Internet.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">Some commentators have expressed concern that the number of personal household computers in Ireland is too low.  Ownership of personal computers has increased from 46% of households in 2004 to 60% of households in 2006.  In addition, three out of ten households have purchased a broadband package.  I accept, however, that this figure must increase.  I note Senator Ross's arguments but we must acknowledge that the Government is making considerable efforts in this area.  It has recognised the areas in which defects have arisen and introduced programmes and an awareness campaign.  Perhaps the major push must focus on local communities which do not yet have broadband access.  I commend the amendment to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_330">There is a degree of mystery about the extraordinary ineptitude of the present regime, in its two manifestations from 1997 to today, in dealing with broadband.  As I just told Senator Ross, this is one issue for which it cannot blame anybody else.  No preliminary work was required.  In 1997, at a time when nobody here knew much about broadband, it was being discussed in some of the chattier corners of the Internet.  I have figures on the growth in speed since the dial-up era which show how recent this development has been.  The Government, therefore, has no excuse because nothing was lacking.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">For reasons which are still difficult to penetrate, the Government took off on the glorious tangent of privatising the country's most important infrastructure, its telecommunications network.  This decision left us with an incompetent telecommunications quasi-monopoly which has done what it liked and has boasted to international bankers that there was no reason to worry about the telecommunications industry being caught by the regulator.  Major international banks have indicated that one of the qualities of Eircom is that it is well able to outmanoeuvre the regulator.  Nobody wants to do anything about it and that is a crux of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Government plays games with statistics and, I suppose, politicians always do so.  It talks about the growth in broadband penetration.  The point is that it is growing faster elsewhere.  Growth in broadband penetration in the last quarter was 19% while it was 28% in the previous quarter.  We are going backwards.  The fundamental fact is that the level of broadband penetration here is down compared to countries such as Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia and Cyprus, which has problems because of its geographical isolation.  We have some consolation in that Greece is behind us so at least we are not visible at the end of the queue.  That is the fundamental fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">The Government can make all the excuses it likes but as it does so not only are we not catching up, we are falling further behind because the rate of broadband penetration is so slow.  Does anybody have an idea of the level of frustration among people living in cities who have been told by Eircom they cannot have broadband because there is a copper wire connection which was put in sometime between the flood and the arrival of the Lord, which has been there ever since and which is entirely unsuitable or because it has complicated, cheapskate connections made by Telecom Éireann or by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs 25 years ago which Eircom refuses to upgrade since it is not focused on its primary job, namely, to provide a good telecommunications service?</p>
          <p eId="para_334">We hear about the growth in broadband access and, thankfully, it is getting a little better.  We hear about broadband penetration which is not even moderate; it is abysmal.  Real countries which are really progressing, such as the Netherlands, have three times the level of broadband penetration we have.  France has twice the level of broadband penetration we have while Sweden has, effectively, three times the level.  People in this Government, perhaps not in the majority party but in the minority one, will point to countries such as that and describe its failed economic model and state that ours is the thrusting model of the new liberalised market economy even though we have not done the most fundamental thing properly, that is, to provide the telecommunications infrastructure the country needs to have a future.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">That is bad enough, but what the Government wants to do is inept.  The reason is that in the majority of what now masquerades for broadband, we are talking about a maximum band width of approximately two to three megabytes per second.  A domestic user will get one megabyte per second for a price which is among the highest in Europe.  This year in France and the Netherlands, they are talking about speeds which are ten times faster than what we aspire to over the coming years.  That is the difference.  We are trying to build a single carriageway when they are building motorways because this Government cannot use its imagination and see what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">What Senator Finucane said is a classic example of the ineptitude.  Having told people to go in one direction, the Government is suddenly saying to hold on, there is something wrong and that it is going to go in a different direction.  There are profound technological and technical arguments about the limitations of wireless broadband.  It lacks the capacity for multiple use.  There are inherent restrictions which mean it will always be a worse solution.  It may be an acceptable solution in some isolated rural areas but to suggest it as a solution for any urban area is another matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Growth is going backwards and broadband penetration is nearly at the bottom of the league table.  There is also the question of the quality of the service.  People will tell one it breaks down.  Although I do not have that problem with the Eircom service, many people do.  The alleged speed is three megabytes per second in my case.  I test it because there are many software packages on the Internet.  It never reaches anywhere near three megabytes per second.  It usually just about reaches 1.2 megabytes on a good day.  If one hits it on a bad day, it will drop down to approximately 0.5 megabytes per second.  Nobody is even talking about this.  The Government is just wheeling it out because it is suddenly embarrassed.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">I will move on to another contention, which is the number of people who can use the same broadband connection at the same time.  One should try it out on a Saturday night where I live in Cork and see how slow it is.  Not only will we have traffic jams, we will have broadband jams because we will not build the quality of infrastructure which will give people the speed they need at the time they need it.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I am sick of the phrase "rocket science".  Rocket science is actually quite easy.  It is not hard to figure this out.  Anybody should be able to understand the analogies between broadband availability on a crude level and road traffic or water flowing through a pipe.  If one tries to squeeze too much through a pipe, nothing will not go through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">We are trying to introduce broadband on the cheap, with the case cited by Senator Finucane being a classic example.  This happened in Ireland ten or 15 years ago when somebody — I believe it was the Department of Finance, which is the most negative influence on Irish public policy — refused to allow proper roads to be built so we ended up with roundabouts where we should have had flyovers, with the result that there was chaos.  Now we are back to the same issue again.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">I know one of the best guest houses in the west Kerry Gaeltacht and, as a result of sheer frustration, the owner has now installed satellite broadband at great expense to herself because so many of her customers wanted access to broadband but nobody could give it to her.  There is a long list of such examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I will quote a far better known former resident of Cork than myself.  Roy Keane famously said that if one fails to prepare, one can prepare to fail.  In terms of the telecommunications revolution and what the Government has not done, we should be beginning to prepare to fail because we are so far behind and the world is moving so far ahead of us that the gap will become unbridgeable and we will be left behind with the result that major future investment will go elsewhere where there are governments with public policy capable of delivering the quality which is unimaginable to those making public policy here at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">According to the latest information, there were 372,000 broadband subscribers in Ireland by the end of June.  By mid-September that figure had gone up to 410,000.  This is equivalent to 9.27% of the population or 26.57% of households in Ireland.  It was only 3% of the population at the start of 2005.  That is progress.  Even Roy Keane would be more than happy to suggest that is real progress.  I have another statistic which goes back to Senator Ryan's barb about real countries.  Perhaps he was talking about the Netherlands.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">At the end of 2005, EU 15 broadband take up was 14% of the population or 34% of households which compares reasonably favourably considering the low base from which we started.  I must accept that one of the reasons we started off at such a low level in the take-up league tables reflects the relatively late launch of competitive broadband service in Ireland by telecoms and cable television companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">I share the Government's aim to increase competition so that consumers and businesses can benefit from cheaper broadband and more choice.  Incidentally, broadband is widely available in the €20 to €30 per month price band.  I agree the combination of competition and regulation is driving down prices.  DSL prices fell by approximately 25% during 2005.  There is a key element of this on which the Government should move as rapidly as it can because I believe it has been going on for years.  I remember when the Leader of the House was Minister with responsibility for this area and she referred to local loop unbundling.  I had an idea it was something to do with making hay but it was the technical term for allowing more competition into the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_359">The bad news, however, is that I agree with much of the criticism of Eircom.  I have had the unfortunate and unhappy experience of dealing with Eircom since I first tried to get broadband in Drumshanbo in County Leitrim, so I could be more like those esteemed Senators from more cosmopolitan areas where broadband had already been rolled out.  I decided I would take the issue in hand myself.  The local exchange is 200 yards from my house and I was told by local engineers that the equipment to enable the exchange to upgrade to broadband was installed in December.  One of the engineers told me that he was finished and that the only thing that was needed was another section of Eircom to test the line, which would take a month.  The man said it should be in place by the end of March.  The end of March passed without any broadband so I was told it would be in place at the end of April.  The exchange was enabled in the middle of June, six months after the equipment had been installed.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">A real problem exists in Eircom.  I have checked with other people who have the same problem and until the Government accelerates its local loop unbundling policy and creates more competition, we will be driven demented by people screaming for broadband who cannot get it because of Eircom's monopoly.</p>

For a country that boasts that it is to the forefront of information technology, we have been remarkably slow in rolling out broadband.  We had considerable difficulty getting it in Dublin 4 on the Burlington Road and it was very costly.  I go to Haute-Savoie in France and my son tells me that broadband is so cheap and accessible, the sheep and goats are on-line.  I cannot understand what has happened here.  Broadband saves time, promotes efficiency and is an economic necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">I am particularly saddened by the delay in roll out in rural areas because home working can be suitable for many people, particularly women, and Internet access is now so slow in many places that these people are at a significant competitive disadvantage.  There should be more action in this area.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  This debate was sought by Senator Ross, who has strong views on this issue, and I support him in those views.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I first came across this issue in Singapore, a place that has always impressed me.  Singapore singled out the opportunity in Asia to become the centre for knowledge creation using the Internet.  I came home excited about that and stood in the Seanad eight years ago, telling the Minister at the time about Singapore, saying we could be the same but we must put broadband in place.  If we had focused on it, we could have achieved it but we have not.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I did not realise how bad things were until my son, who is very interested in technology, told me about going to Clare and being unable to get over the lack of provision.  He said it was like sightseeing on a penny farthing after driving a Jaguar.  He asked how people could live with the frustration involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I did not realise it was so important until I met a neighbour of mine in Howth.  He cannot get broadband, which demonstrates a failure on the part of the Government.  The Government's attention was drawn to the problems and the opportunities but it did nothing about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">Senator Mooney is correct in saying there was a dramatic increase last year but it was from a tiny base.  It is so easy to have such an increase in such circumstances, so it is understandable.  However, I do not want to spend my time criticising what went wrong back in 1997 when Telecom Éireann was privatised.  The real reason we failed in broadband goes back to what happened in that year when we did not take steps to do something about it.  We can do something about it now, however, although I am not sure what.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">I liked Senator Mooney's explanation of what we may have to do.  It may be possible to do something by using the State to influence a commercial company, be it Eircom or not.  This can be done by tax incentives or other financial incentives in some form or another.  We have to do something like this.  Let us examine what happened in Northern Ireland where only a few months ago they decided that everybody was going to have a broadband address.  A previous speaker said that practically every home in Northern Ireland had broadband.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_382">Not every business in the Republic has broadband but we can do something about it.  The onus of responsibility is on the Government, just as over a century ago the Government of the day declared it was important for every village to have running water.  Water was not provided directly to people's homes originally but fresh water was provided through a village pump.  The fresh water of the future economy will be the availability and accessibility of broadband on a worldwide network.  It should not be provided in a pennyfarthing manner, as my son put it, but like a speeding car.  We can do that here but it will take action.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">We must do something about the situation, but what?  In my view, the time has come for drastic measures.  The Government should force Eircom to provide basic broadband access to every household in the country at no cost to individual householders.  The Government should be prepared to pick up the tab for whatever that costs, although safeguards would have to be put in place to ensure the rapacious Eircom did not profit unduly from such an initiative.  We have plenty of examples where that was done in the past.  By adopting such a policy, the Government could ensure that within a short period, say two years, Ireland could go practically from the bottom of the broadband league to the top couple of percent.  Only from the latter position can we realistically hope to pursue a leadership stance in the knowledge society.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">This situation needs bold and courageous leadership.  I wonder if we will get it from this Government or the next one.  I know we will get it eventually because we cannot possibly stay as far behind as we are.  The analogy of providing water supplies in the past is not dissimilar.  If someone two centuries ago had said that water was nice to have rather than being essential, it would not have been understood now.  That is what we are in danger of saying if we do not take action and do something about broadband.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">I am delighted that Senator Ross tabled this motion for debate because I hope it will bring forth some understanding of the degree of urgency that is required.  I do not know if that food for thought will provide action.  Let us make sure the Government is not just listening but will do something about it.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_149">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_386">I join with previous speakers in thanking the Independent Members for tabling this motion.  As one who represents a rural constituency, I come up against the broadband issue daily.  I welcome the Minister of State to the Chamber.  He represents a constituency with a large rural area and I am sure he comes up against the same problem.  I am disappointed by the nature of the Government amendment which seeks to commend the Government's action in this regard.  However, there has been a startling inaction by Government in providing broadband coverage throughout the country.  The amendment also commends the role of private operators but I do not think there is much to commend in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">I am disappointed by some of the comments made earlier.  Broadband is a major issue in my constituency.  Senator Mooney spoke about Leitrim and said the rest of us come from more technologically advanced areas, but I do not accept that.  I come from County Kilkenny, large parts of which are not covered by broadband in any shape or form, either wireless or landline.  Senator Kenneally will be familiar with most of south County Kilkenny.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I have received many representations from business people in south County Kilkenny who cannot get a broadband connection.  Not a week goes by that I do not get a few more people contacting me about such difficulties.  The problem we have with broadband coverage goes directly back to the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and the catastrophic error that was made to privatise the network in advance of unbundling the local loop.  It does not have anything to do with making hay and even if it did I do not think the Government would be able to manage that much at this stage.  That cataclysmic error, which effectively placed the public network in the hands of a private monopoly, has landed us in the current situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Senators Mooney and Quinn mentioned the possibility of the Government becoming directly involved in markets generally.  Traditionally, I have not been in favour of such action but there is a compelling case for the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ensure that Eircom provides broadband connections in every part of the country, not just cities and towns.  By and large, most of our urban areas are covered, although there are specific difficulties in such areas also.  Rural areas are not covered, however.  There is no question of private operators becoming involved in providing broadband coverage to rural Stoneyford in south County Kilkenny.  It will not happen.  If the Government's policy objective is for private business to ensure broadband coverage for Inistioge in County Kilkenny, we are living in cloud cuckoo land because it will not be provided.  Last week, I received a call from a businessman there who does not have a broadband connection.  The error was made back when Telecom Éireann was privatised.  Clearly, the network should not have been sold off with the rest of the company.  In the current situation, we must examine every possible solution to the problem.  I concur with Senator Quinn who said we must look at drastic things such as the State funding large parts of the country that do not have a broadband service.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">It is more than a little patronising to hear the usual Government line from Senator Mooney that people should shop around.  Try telling that to people in areas not served by broadband.  I know of one man who employed ten people in a horticultural business in Stoneyford, south Kilkenny, but he cannot obtain a broadband connection despite having tried for five years in that particular area.  I wish that man was here to listen to Senator Mooney telling people to shop around.  Such a man does not want to shop around.  He wants one company — any company at more or less any price — to provide him with that service, yet nobody will do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">We get reams of answers from Eircom telling us that such an area is not on its list of exchanges to be upgraded.  There does not seem to be any exchange in Kilkenny that is scheduled for upgrading in the next 12 months, although the situation in Carlow is somewhat better.  As previous speakers have said, that will be catastrophic, particularly for small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">I found some of the earlier remarks from the Government side very patronising.  It was stated that the reason we have such low broadband connectivity in this country is that people do not have PCs in their homes but that is sidestepping the substantive issue.  Many people do not have PCs in their homes because they know there is no possibility of getting a broadband connection.  It is a chicken and egg situation but we need to ensure the service is provided for consumers across the land.  There should not be a division between the eastern half of the country and the western half.  I live in the south east and most of the area I represent has no coverage whatsoever, despite what we have heard from Government spokespersons in this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">Government speakers have mentioned the increase that has taken place in the level of broadband penetration.  Given that we have started from a low base, of course there has been an increase but it is minimal.  We had a broadband penetration of approximately 9% in June while the European average is 14%.  In Finland, where two thirds of the country is virtually uninhabited and a large area is inhospitable due to climate, there is 24% coverage.  There is 27% coverage in the Netherlands and 29% in Denmark.  How is it that in Ireland where we have made huge technological advances, have been at the cutting edge of the IT sector for ten to 15 years, and have been recognised as world leaders, our broadband penetration is 8%?  It is an incredible indictment of the efforts of this and the previous Government that the figure is not much higher.  If we do not act quickly this will have a dramatic effect on the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">During the past 12 to 18 months there has been a dramatic fall in Ireland's position in terms of global competitiveness.  We have gone from being in a position where we were competitive to a position where we are not quite so competitive.  One of the reasons is that companies cannot be assured of 365 days per year coverage for broadband.  If the Government does not tackle the issue in the immediate future the economic situation could take a downturn for many small businesses that operate throughout the length and breadth of the land.</p>

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  Being a Galway man he will be familiar with the challenges of providing open access broadband to urban and rural areas.  I should mention the good work taking place at grassroots level and refer to the European regional network of application communications technology, the Eirnet group in Donegal, which has been proactive in looking at possible solutions and alternatives for providing open access broadband to urban and rural areas.  This group which was set up in 1990 is a great ambassador for setting the agenda for broadband in the north west.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Minister of State will be familiar with the group and its unique cross-Border base because it involves Derry City Council and Donegal County Council.  Since 1990 this unique group has been a strong advocate of promoting the broadband agenda.  It has a reputation in Europe given that it is a member of a plethora of European regional groups with a high degree of credibility and recognition for the work it has done.  It has led the campaign for satellite broadband, wireless broadband and ADSL broadband and the traditional fibre optic ESB avenues for broadband.  This group has worked hard at local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Curiously when one is in Donegal and hears some of the Government parties speak about broadband, it is as if the solutions have been found for all of Donegal.  However, that is not the case and we still do not have open access broadband.  I accept we have a good MANs network in Letterkenny and there has been a further announcement of the MANs network into areas such as Carndonagh in the Inishowen Peninsula.  We also have the MANs network in Gweedore.  Nevertheless, there are still many gaps in the Inishowen Peninsula and in Donegal, and we have to keep a firm focus on what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Community groups have been proactive in looking at radio broadband.  I accept that the group broadband scheme rolled out by the Government has been a welcome addition to the broadband infrastructure in rural areas.  One, in particular, is a unique group in north-west Donegal called the Hills of Donegal where there has been an extensive roll-out of radio broadband by North West Electronics.  That is an example of finding a solution when there is nothing else.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">There are arguments as to whether radio broadband is a reliable 100% solution for attracting businesses into an area but I can only give feedback on the positives where small to medium enterprises thrive in their environments with this particular solution.  Many of those who provide feedback to me say it is more reliable than the satellite solution.  However, there are still gaps and problems with the Eircom exchanges and there are problems for those who are outside the MANs network and for households outside the so-called 4.5 km. radius from the Eircom exchanges.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Why is it that across the Border in Derry where there is 100% broadband access there is a radius of 5 km from the exchanges?  Why are we not unbundling the network in terms of increasing that radius to 5 km?  Eircom has said it is extending the network 4.5 km. but the man in the street knows it is only to a radius of, perhaps, 4 km.  It would make a big difference if the radius was increased from 4 km. to 5 km. in terms of making broadband accessible to many households on the perimeter.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The Minister of State is probably fed up hearing the promises of 2002 at this stage.  One of the commitments in the Government's election manifesto was that everyone in Ireland would have access to broadband communications to ensure open access broadband on a national basis.  The current position is dismal with Ireland having approximately one fifth of the number of broadband connections per head as Denmark or the Netherlands and just 72% of the population have access to technology.  All of this will change in the next 12 months.  That was in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">Too many promises and commitments were made with solutions that were not realisable or did not have the commitment from the particular Department to work in partnership with the local groups that have been very successful.  The local group, Eirnet, in west Donegal has been an ambassador and the kingpin in leading the agenda for broadband access.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Naturally we tend to be parochial when we talk politics but in regard to solutions for County Donegal we are at a comparative disadvantage over Derry city.  We are not able to compete in terms of attracting inward investment if we cannot have 100% reliable broadband access.  Last week there was an announcement of more than 450 jobs for Derry.  A place such as Derry and Derry city will always have a comparative advantage over Donegal in respect of inward investment and job creation.  Some 40% of our job infrastructure is reliant on the construction and service industry, with 40% of people employed in those categories.  This is unreliable in both the short and the long term and we must look at solutions such as small to medium-sized enterprise and indigenous industry.  We have creative personnel in Donegal who would like to set up their own businesses, but they are restricted in terms of broadband access.  Many of our Donegal diaspora who have had success in the United Kingdom, Europe and throughout the world want to come back and set up businesses, but they are not in a position to do so because the proper infrastructure is not available.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Many solutions for providing broadband are available, such as satellite and radio broadband.  However, we should look at the experts in the field and listen more attentively to the people leading in the area.  The challenge facing us in the short term is to unbundle more exchanges and work in partnership with local authorities to roll out proper broadband access.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, to the House.  We have failed as a country to stay competitive in European terms.  We may talk about the Celtic tiger, the good times and the ifs and buts, but we have failed to provide a proper, adequate broadband infrastructure, thereby leaving ourselves at a comparative disadvantage with EU countries and accession states.  Even Bulgaria and Romania can boast a better broadband infrastructure and countries such as Slovenia and Slovakia are ahead of us.  It is unfortunate that Donegal people living close to the Border with Derry must envy people from Malin Head to Derry city who have 100% broadband access.  This is not good enough, is unacceptable and something must be done about it immediately.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_151">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_406">I thank all those who have participated in the debate.  The issue of broadband is important because Internet connectivity allows us to participate in the knowledge economy and society.  Connectivity is important for the continued development of our economy and will allow us advance our economy and take on economies with lower cost bases such as those in Asia and central and eastern Europe.  Without connectivity we will not maintain the growth we have developed over the past ten to 15 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">As Internet content and services improve, higher connectivity speeds are needed so we may benefit from activities available on-line, whether e-commerce, shopping, gaming or e-mailing family photos across the world in real time.  Higher speeds need higher bandwidth, which means the ubiquitous availability of broadband connectivity.  As an economy we need to ensure that we take full advantage of technological developments and as a society we need to ensure that we do not allow the creation of a digital divide either socially or regionally.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The broadband market in Ireland is fully liberalised and regulated, where appropriate, by ComReg the independent Commission for Communications Regulation.  The role of the Government is to implement regulatory and infrastructure policies to support the private sector developing a competitive, affordable and rapidly growing broadband market that offers choice of products and providers to Irish consumers and businesses.  I am pleased to say that broadband is now available in almost all parts of Ireland through a combination of DSL, fixed-wireless, cable television and satellite technologies.  The combination of telecommunications regulation and competition is driving prices down for the benefit of Irish consumers and businesses.  For example, DSL pricing fell by 25% in 2005 according to ComReg data.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">The Irish broadband market is currently ranked lower than more developed markets in terms of broadband take-up.  This reflects the relatively late launch of affordable and competitive broadband services in Ireland by telecommunications and cable television companies in the early 2000s.  However, Ireland is one of the fastest growing broadband markets in the European Union and broadband take-up has more than tripled since the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources set a target of 400,000 subscribers in late 2004.  We had 372,000 broadband subscribers by end-June 2006, which is equivalent to 9.27% of the population or 26.57% of households.  Only 3% of the population were broadband subscribers at the beginning of 2005.  At the end of 2005, EU-15 broadband take-up was 14% of the population or 34% of households.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">Broadband subscriber numbers have increased significantly in the past two years.  Almost 140,000 new broadband subscribers were added in 2005 and a further 100,000 in the first half of 2006.  The latest ComReg quarterly report states there are 372,000 broadband subscribers as of June 2006.  This is equivalent to 26.57% of all households.  A snapshot of the market conducted by ComReg in the middle of September put the total number of broadband subscribers at over 410,000, or almost 30% of households.  The official Government target was to have 400,000 subscribers by end-2006.  This has been comfortably exceeded.  The challenge now to industry is to get 500,000 broadband subscribers by mid-2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The website run by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i> gives full details of broadband pricing and availability around the country, including DSL, cable, fibre, satellite and fixed wireless technologies.  The website also lists the different products on offer and the contact details for each service provider.  Currently there is a choice of broadband services that can technically deliver broadband to any customer in Ireland.  Today, almost 70 service providers in Ireland offer nearly 300 different types of broadband products across a mixture of DSL, fixed wireless, satellite and cable options.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly.  The lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity.  The developments of Wi-Max and HSDPA, high-speed downlink packet access, offer considerable potential for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">However, it is not enough to just make broadband available.  The industry needs to continue to demonstrate what broadband can do for those who may not have considered getting broadband before.  The Department's broadband awareness television advertising campaign is aimed at supporting the efforts of the sector.  This campaign, supported by INTERREG funding and by ComReg, has been running constantly since early July and was originally scheduled to run until Hallowe'en.  However, additional funding to extend the campaign right up to the new year has now been secured.  In addition, a further €1.35 million has been secured from INTERREG to help roll out the 2007 and 2008 "Make It Secure" campaigns on a cross-Border basis.  These campaigns will continue to promote the use of broadband technologies but will focus on how to have a safe and enjoyable Internet experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Government has long recognised that a lack of investment by the private sector in the necessary infrastructure has acted as an impediment to the speedy roll out of competitive, affordable broadband services in Ireland, principally in the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Government has been addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions on a number of fronts.  Direct funding has already been provided under the national development plan for the provision of backbone infrastructure and to upgrade local access infrastructure.  In partnership with local and regional authorities, the Government is continuing to fund the construction of high-speed, open-access metropolitan area networks in towns and cities nationwide.  Phase 1 of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.  This programme has been extended to over 90 towns in various locations nationwide.  These networks are enabling private sector operators to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the group broadband scheme.  The scheme, which is technology-neutral, subsidises the roll out of the most suitable broadband infrastructure for a particular area.  Over 160 projects have been approved for funding under the scheme covering almost 580 communities with a combined population of over 420,000.  A total of 37 service providers have participated in this scheme.  This range of small to medium-sized service providers has supported competition using a range of different technologies.  In addition, these service providers have made use of the private and State owned regional backhaul links.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Despite Ireland's rapidly expanding broadband market I accept there are some areas of the country where the sector will be unable to justify the provision of broadband connectivity on a commercial basis.  The time has come to address this issue.  The Minister is currently examining options in this regard and he hopes to be in a position to bring proposals to Government shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Minister believes we need to continue to support competition in the broadband market.  Thriving markets in other countries with multiple operators are driving up connectivity and broadband speeds while prices continue to reduce.  Our infrastructure interventions through the MANs programme and the GBS scheme have helped grow competition in the regions by facilitating the introduction of new service providers to areas where none existed a couple of years ago.  This growth in the sector happened in spite of the obstacles to competition put in place by those intent on thwarting the introduction of real local loop unbundling or LLU.  The local loop needs to be unbundled once and for all to the satisfaction of the regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Senator Ross is an advocate of the free market.  He has many friends in that free market.  The Minister would be delighted if the Senator would use his influence to encourage greater co-operation and commitment from them to finalise the roll out of broadband.</p>

        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_420">The Minister of State will agree the sting is always in the tail.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">I am disappointed by the Government's response to this motion.  I am disappointed in the Minister of State's reply but I am also disappointed in the amendment to the motion.  I cannot understand why the Government has taken this somewhat hands-off attitude in its amendment, as though this was somebody else's responsibility.  In the Minister of State's speech, apart from placing responsibility on me, he has also put responsibility on virtually every other possible entity involved in communications regulation.  This is ultimately not a responsibility of anyone except the Government.  In other countries it is the government which has taken the initiative and has pushed broadband and it is the government which has forced broadband down the throats of the nation for the good of the economy.  The extraordinary <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude by this Government to this issue is completely out of synch with the Minister’s attitude in other industries and other areas and I do not understand it.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The Government's amendment to the motion recognises that the market is regulated where necessary by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the statutory body responsible for the regulation of the sector.  It was set up by the Government.  The amendment recognises that telecommunications services including broadband are provided in Ireland by the electronic communications sector operated in a fully liberalised market.  This means that we do not like interfering in this market.  This is nonsense.  The Government is happy to interfere in any market it likes if it thinks it will be of some electoral benefit.  Just because it has not felt electorally yet the broadband bite on its shoulder, it is being very <i>laissez-faire</i> about this attitude.  I do not think the Government is right.  This matter is far too important in the long term to ignore.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The Government's current obsession with short-term benefits and short-term issues, means that broadband is to a large extent regarded as the responsibility of someone else.  If it goes wrong, it will be Eircom's fault; otherwise it is up to the regulator.  The Government is hands-off and detached from this problem.  This problem can be resolved very quickly by Government initiative.  As Senator Ryan pointed out so articulately, the figures are absolutely damning.  Whatever statistics the Minister of State produced — and they are very few — the gap is widening.  The Minister of State is correct that we are improving a bit but the other sophisticated nations of the world in terms of technology are going ahead even faster than we are.  The gap is widening and as a result we are falling further behind.  We are in terrible danger in the area of high-tech PCs and the Internet of being so smug about our economic success that we are ignoring this Achilles heel in our economic success and in our economic future.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The Minister of State must have spoken to many chief executives, marketeers and observers of the multinationals coming here.  They must regularly say that the twin pillars of a young population and the tax regime are working and that they love it, but they question the availability of broadband.  We will never know how many multinationals and how much foreign investment is lost because other countries, including some of the accession countries, are improving faster than we are.  The real danger is that the infrastructure for the future is something we cannot repair too quickly.  We are all right on the other two issues but on this one we are in danger of falling behind very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The Minister of State referred to a knowledge economy.  I have never been quite sure what that means, but I know it is a pretty good phrase.  It is something we like throwing around so we can say we are quite good at services, educating people and distributing information.  However, there is no point in having a knowledge economy if the knowledge is not distributed properly or we do not compete in distributing the knowledge properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">We are falling behind.  We may have a knowledge economy, but we cannot market it properly because we do not have sufficient broadband resources.  I am staggered by the smugness and blindness of the Government side to this particular problem, which is staring us in the face and will come back and bite us in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I know the economy is prospering, that the Government has done wonderful things in the tax area and that we have a wonderful young population.  However, I also know that this is an area where other countries are catching up on us, pointing out our future problems, and indicating that we are falling behind in the European league.  I hope we will no longer depend on the communities, as we have done so much.  We should no longer depend on the regulator or blame the incumbent.  We should have the three As that I spoke about in my opening speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">We should firstly have awareness, an education programme in every school and a PC and broadband in every sixth form.  We should have a system similar to that which worked in Northern Ireland, involving Government investment, if necessary, and subsidies to ensure that every household has broadband availability.</p>

          <p eId="para_432">I am just finished.  I was encouraged by one statement made by the Minister of State, when he said he was looking at the possibilities of introducing broadband in outlying areas.  That is encouraging.  We should take it much further and make it an imperative rather than just a matter of discussion.  Every household and small business should have broadband available to it.  We must look upon it as a utility just as we look upon water, electricity and telephones.  We will catch up when broadband becomes a vital and essential part of our infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise the important issue of the situation in which Monaghan General Hospital finds itself at present.  It has been under threat for the past number of years.  For the past 50 years, Monaghan General Hospital has been a fantastic hospital.  The surgeons, consultants, nurses and medical staff are excellent.  It is unforgivable that the hospital is under threat at present.  This day last week 3,000 to 4,000 people came to Hillgrove Hotel to protest in support of their hospital.  God rest Pat Joe Walsh, a man who should never have died.  The report was very bad for Monaghan General Hospital.  It proposes taking more services away from the hospital.  Thankfully, as I hope the Minister of State can confirm tonight, that report will be not implemented.  I had assurances in the past ten days that the services in Monaghan General Hospital would be retained and maintained so we would have full medical cover 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">At present surgical services are only offered from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., which is insufficient.  We hope that the surgical services would be there to support the medical services already in place and that should also be 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  The hospital has a state-of-the-art theatre that is completely underutilised.  Elective surgery could take place there, which would take the pressure off the hospitals in Cavan, Drogheda and Dundalk.  It is important that Monaghan General Hospital should serve the people of Monaghan.  The people of Monaghan want their hospital.  They need it and they are demanding it.  I am in full support of the people of Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">I congratulate the people who turned out last Wednesday at the Hillgrove Hotel in huge numbers.  I also congratulate the 7,000 to 8,000 people who turned out at the opening of the Monaghan bypass on Monday.  That speaks louder than words.  That is why the people of Monaghan are out on the streets.  Those people were there to support their hospital, despite the little bit of disturbance, which does not represent the 7,000 to 8,000 people present.  There was a great crowd there.  They were very dignified.  Only a small number were involved in the rumblings at the front, the various things that were said and not obeying the Garda.  That small number of people did not do any good for the hospital or for the opening of the much-needed bypass, which the people of Monaghan have awaited for so long in order to eliminate the queues of traffic coming into Monaghan town.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">We cannot and will not allow Monaghan General Hospital to be downgraded any further.  I appeared on radio and television last week.  I have had discussions with the Taoiseach's office and the Minister for Health and Children.  We are now seeking a meeting with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister of State, who is present this evening.  As the Minister of State knows, for more than a year every Minister who has come to County Monaghan has met the Fianna Fáil organisation, members of the county council and members of the alliance, namely, Peadar McMahon and Illona Duffy.  I offer my support to those two people who have worked so hard and are so determined.  They have the support of the people and the support of all the organisations in the county.  I appeal to the Minister for Health and Children and the Taoiseach to ensure that Monaghan General Hospital is allowed to service the people as is and that its existing services can be improved.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_479">I will be taking the Adjournment on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I thank the Senator for raising this issue on the Adjournment of the House.  It is not the first occasion he has raised the issue and I appreciate his concern about the hospital, a concern which I share.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Health Service Executive established a steering group and a north-east project group to oversee a programme designed to improve safety and standards across the acute hospital network in the north-east region.  The decision was taken having regard to the issues raised in the report prepared for the HSE by Teamwork Management Services entitled Improving Safety and Achieving Better Standards — An Action Plan for Health Services in the North East, and taking account of the findings of the recent report into the death of Mr. Patrick J. Walsh.  Led by the National Hospitals Office, the steering group has representation from key stakeholders such as clinicians and primary care providers.  The project group is being led by a consultant surgeon from outside the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Teamwork report makes a number of short, medium and long-term recommendations.  It concludes that the present system, where five local hospitals deliver acute care to relatively small populations, is exposing patients to increased risks and creating additional professional risks for staff.  The report highlights the need to develop a high quality and responsive emergency and planned service, in line with international standards, by developing local services within existing hospitals and other local centres supported by a new regional hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The HSE published the report of the independent inquiry into the death of Mr. Walsh on 7 September last.  I understand the concern regarding the report in Monaghan and outside expressed by the Senator in the House this evening.  Following the death of Mr. Walsh in Monaghan General Hospital on 14 October 2005, Mr. Declan Carey, a consultant surgeon at Belfast City Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Queen's University, and Professor John Monson, professor of surgery at the University of Hull, carried out an independent and external review of the circumstances of this tragic death.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The report details the difficulties that arose in trying to secure Mr. Walsh's transfer from Monaghan to either Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, or Cavan General Hospital.  It also exposes a failure in communications between clinicians and hospitals in the region.  Since the death of Mr. Walsh, a new protocol on patient transfer has been put in place.  It provides that all requests for transfer from Monaghan General Hospital to Cavan General Hospital or Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, should be granted and processed immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The HSE has given the Minister an assurance that, in progressing the implementation of these reports, there will be no discontinuation of existing services until suitable alternative arrangements have been put in place.  I am happy to confirm that on the record of the House.  The Senator also made a forceful plea for the development of certain other services at Monaghan General Hospital.  I will bring his proposal on elective surgery to the attention of the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_485">I wish to share my time with Senator Brennan.  It is disappointing that a liquidator has been appointed to Castlemahon Foods Limited.  We have to remain optimistic that the liquidator might be able to save some of the jobs or that an alternative owner can be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Castlemahon Co-op was established in 1920 and entered poultry production in 1960.  This internationally recognised brand has been synonymous with poultry for the past 50 years.  O'Kanes, which is based in the North of Ireland and took over the plant more than 20 years ago, has claimed that the plant has been losing money for the past few years.  However, many in the area would contend that capital investment has been lacking compared with the parent company's plant in the North of Ireland.  We have reached the point where the liquidator has moved in and there are fears for the future of the 350 workers employed in the production plant, mill and hatchery.  Producers and breeders are equally concerned because many are farmers who earn their main incomes from supplying the plant.  In January 2005, Kantoher Chickens closed down only a few miles away with the loss of 150 jobs.  The future of an area which was synonymous with the production of poultry therefore looks bleak.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, visited the constituency recently with regard to a plant in Newcastle West which was destroyed by fire and rebuilt by its parent company.  The last plant to be established in west County Limerick was the bicycle helmet company, Gyro, in 1990.  All that remains of that company in Newcastle West is a marketing unit employing four people.  The people of the area are concerned about the lack of industrial development, and significant pressure is being put on public representatives in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">Some time ago, I wrote to the Industrial Development Authority on the matter, only to receive an extremely disappointing response comprising a thesis on industrial policy without any reference to the jobs poverty that exists in County Limerick.  That will have to change and the pressure is on the Minister to create jobs in the area.  I am interested in the response from the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, because I am sure consultations have taken place between his Department and the liquidator with a view to determining whether any hope exists for the workers in Castlemahon as they face into the Christmas period.  I hope my hopes will be raised by the end of this debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_489">I thank Senator Finucane for sharing his time on this matter.  He has given a detailed explanation of the situation pertaining to Castlemahon Foods and pointed out that the company has been a major employer for the past 50 years in an area heavily dependent on agriculture.  I join my colleague in asking the Minister of State to offer every assistance at his disposal in safeguarding the jobs and finding a solution to the grave problem currently facing west County Limerick.  The suppliers to the plant, who have made significant commitments, also face a perilous future.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_490">I thank the Senators for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I was very disappointed to hear that a liquidator has been appointed and that there is to be a hearing in the High Court next month on the matter.  I am conscious of the effect that the job losses will have on the workers and their families as well as on the surrounding community.  This is distressing news for those who will lose their jobs.  I assure the people concerned that the relevant State agencies will provide every support they can.  The priority in the event of closure will be to find alternative employment for those involved at the earliest opportunity.  The role of FÁS, the State training agency, will be particularly important in assisting those who are to lose their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">In February 2005, the company announced a restructuring plan which involved a reduction in staff numbers from 410 to 260.  In May of that year, the company confirmed that workers had accepted the redundancy offer by a large majority.  Unfortunately, matters have not improved over the past 18 months but have continued to decline.  Due to a fiercely competitive market and increased volumes of cheaper imports from abroad, the current level of profitability in the Irish poultry sector is very low.  Nevertheless, I understand the liquidator will be working closely with the management of the company and other interests over the next few weeks in an effort to find new owners for the enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">The company has been operating in an extremely competitive market and had been trading at a loss for a number of years.  During this difficult period, Enterprise Ireland has been in regular contact with the company.  Discussions were centred on potential involvement by the agency in the future development of the company.  However, despite the best efforts of all concerned, it was not possible to avoid the situation that has now been reached.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Given its local presence in the area, Shannon Development has moved quickly to assist with efforts to minimise the effect of the closure on west County Limerick and, in particular, the Newcastle West area.  Within 24 hours of the public announcement Shannon Development arranged a meeting of West Limerick Resources Limited, a local group in which Shannon Development is an active board member.  The group, which is chaired by Shannon Development and comprises key local groups in the area, has done much valuable work following the closure of Kantoher Chickens last year with the loss of 138 jobs.  Together with representatives from County Limerick CEB and West Limerick Resources Limited, the agency will be meeting all public representatives in the area to discuss how Shannon Development can support those affected by the closure.  Shannon Development will quickly establish an internal working group to identify opportunities to assist those affected.  As well as these particular initiatives Shannon Development will remain in close contact with the Newcastle West chamber of commerce.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The most recent live register figures, which are for August 2006, show a total of 6,327 for Limerick city and 1,006 for Newcastle West.  While the figure for Limerick city is down from 6,769 in the corresponding month in 2002, the figure for Newcastle West is up by 79.  However, overall figures for Limerick city and county show a decline in the live register figures from 8,593 in August 2002 to 8,253 in August 2006.  West County Limerick in general is well served with industry and major companies such as Wyeth, Aughinish Alumina, Kostal, Ballygowan and Pallas Foods are the major employers in the vicinity of Newcastle West.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In 2004, Shannon Development completed the land purchase and business plan for a new business park in Newcastle West.  The park is located on a 40-acre site adjoining the town and infrastructural and servicing work on the first 20 acres is in place.  A BBS unit approved by Shannon Development is now in place in the business park and clients are being sought.  Shannon Development has sold three sites to industrial companies and construction on these sites should commence by the end of this year.  In addition to the developments already under way, Shannon Development has solid inquiries on its books on site purchases for the business park.  It is Shannon Development's view that these developments will help to strengthen the industrial base of the Newcastle West area.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">A central goal for the industrial development agencies is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of County Limerick lies in its position as a regional gateway, with the critical mass and infrastructure needed to attract mobile investment to the region.  Both the Government and the agencies recognise the need to provide high volume employment opportunities in County Limerick that provide sustainable long-term jobs.  The strategies adopted have proved successful to date despite a competitive and ever changing global economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">While it is disappointing to see job losses in the poultry sector, County Limerick fortunately has a strong base of foreign direct investment jobs.  The most recent figures available, which are for December 2005, reveal 38 overseas companies employing over 8,500 people in permanent jobs and a further 1,500 in temporary and contract employment.  Most of these 10,000 jobs are in the environs of the city but as a result of the job losses in the company concerned, I am confident that the State development agencies will strengthen their marketing and promotion efforts in the region and will make every effort to secure alternative employment for the area.  This will be done in partnership with other key players to maximise the flow of potential investors for the area and to convert these into investment and job opportunities.</p>
