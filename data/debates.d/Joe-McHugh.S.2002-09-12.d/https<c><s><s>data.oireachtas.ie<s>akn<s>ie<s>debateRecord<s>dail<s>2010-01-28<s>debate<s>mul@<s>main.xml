          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I am glad the Minister for Finance is here today because I want to oppose the Order of Business.  All the matters on this Order Business are important and relevant.  However, the issue that struck people this morning was that of 70,000 mortgage holders with Permanent TSB who face an increase in their variable interest rate mortgages.  They may just be the tip of an iceberg as the figure may well rise to 350,000 mortgage holders if other banks follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">The House discussed at considerable length, and with due diligence from the Minister for Finance, the financial emergency measures Bill, the bank guarantee and the entire NAMA legislation.  Last year, the House bailed out the banks to the tune of €11 billion.  A further €8 billion to €10 billion may be required by them this year.  January has not even passed and at the first opportunity mortgage holders are about to be screwed again.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Will the Minister for Finance, on behalf of the Government, tell these banks and lending societies that many people, who were seduced to take out mortgages over the past several years in the middle of a property boom, now face ruination?  The primacy concern for many is the state of the economy.  Many have paid health and pension levies, taken pay reductions and had all sorts of increases taken out of their wage packets.  Now up to 350,000 face a mortgage interest rate increase.  Is the Minister for Finance prepared to call in the banks today?  Is he prepared to discuss the implications of the bank guarantee and European Central Bank rates?  What can the Government do in response to this outrageous action that will affect so many people?  This is a matter of serious concern for thousands across the country.  Before we discuss other matters on the Order of Business, will the Minister respond to what I have raised?</p>

        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_11">On behalf of the Labour Party, I too oppose the Order of Business.  The Order of Business proposed by the Minister for Finance is "politics as usual".  However, householders and families were told by the newspapers this morning that another increase in mortgage interest rates is on the way.  This is after several months in which one could not turn on a radio or open a newspaper without having someone saying the corner had been turned.  People were told that while their incomes and circumstances were not as good as they were, prices were coming down and the economy was improving.  We now know mortgages are set to increase again.  For many families, these mortgages, given the excessive price they paid for their homes, are in excess of the property's worth.  There is no NAMA for householders who find themselves in negative equity or in difficulty meeting their mortgage repayments.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">As Deputy Kenny stated, we have had to deal in this House with proposals from the Government to assist the banks at a cost to date to the taxpayer of €11 billion.  We have put in place a NAMA process for those who borrowed excessively and for the transfer of the properties of those who speculated in property development over a period.  Not alone is there no relief or comfort for families who find themselves stretched to meet their mortgage repayments, they are now being told this morning their mortgages are to increase again.  We cannot have business and politics as usual in this House while families throughout the country are faced with the type of news they got this morning.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">The Order of Business is as laid before the House this morning.  I did not hear an alternative proposal from the Opposition leaders who wish only to discuss banking matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Let us be clear about one fact.  Permanent TSB has not applied to join NAMA and it has not received one cent in capital from the State.  Once again, Deputies Gilmore and Kenny referred to a collective entity called "the banks".  The particular news report on which this morning's questions are based is correct, namely, the board of Permanent TSB is meeting today to consider its options, which are difficult.  Deputies will be well aware that interest rates are at historically low levels.  Permanent TSB issued a large number of tracker mortgages which means it cannot, at the interest rates charged by the European Central Bank make a profit on its mortgage book.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">Permanent TSB is and has paid money to the State for the benefit of the guarantee.  The suggestion will, no doubt, be advanced in the next 24 hours that we should withdraw the State guarantee from the banks.  Let us be clear about the consequences of doing so.  The consequences of that would be to increase the cost of funding for those institutions.  These are commercial realities upon which all Members of this House must reflect.</p>

I will not have an opportunity to speak on this debate but I call on the Minister for Finance to note that I have raised the matter of European scrutiny with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste on a number of occasions.  Under existing facilities and prior to the Lisbon treaty we did not have the capacity to examine the way particular directives were transposed into Irish law, as against being transposed into law in other countries.  This has a particular impact in a number of areas.  In the context of this report, which is important, and now that the Lisbon treaty has been passed, I call for the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny to have the opportunity to take a small number of directives and examine the way they have been transposed into law here, because there are implications for the smooth running of business and for the operation of a number of sectors in Ireland.  This should be feasible now that the Lisbon treaty has been passed.  I recommend this proposal strongly as I will not have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">On 23 December, the Minister for Finance indicated he would introduce a measure under which senior public servants would not pay the levy applied to every other public servant.  He decided that bonus payments, supposed to be for exceptional achievement, were effectively a part of standard pay.  When will this motion be presented to the House?  I have not yet seen it on the Order Paper.  Will the Minister provide an opportunity for the House to debate it?  There is substantial concern about this measure and substantial opposition because it is believed it is unfair to ask people on the lowest pay within the public service to pay their full due, but those up in high posts have slipped out of that position.  When will the Minister make time for this?</p>
          <p eId="para_217">While I am on my feet I refer to the issues of debt collection and people getting into difficulties with loans.  Emergency legislation was introduced to try to deal with the banking situation.  Where is the same urgency to update our bankruptcy laws, to regulate debt collectors and to provide a framework in which people can be treated fairly by those pursuing debts?  Will we see legislative proposals from the Government, on foot of the group the Minister has stated he intends to establish, to protect consumers at a time of remarkable vulnerability for many families?</p>

          <p eId="para_219">I refer to the question of remuneration levels of certain categories of higher public servant.  Without opening up the discussion in general terms, a statutory instrument was made in that regard and the decision was made by the Government and me.  It was grounded on the fact that were we to have applied the full reduction recommended by the body to the particular group.  It would have meant an effective reduction in their remuneration package of an average of 18% for assistant secretaries, well in excess of the reduction accepted by Members of this House and by principal officers at their equivalent grade and well in excess of the amount imposed on Ministers and in excess of the amount imposed on Secretaries General.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">It is worth noting also that this group, unlike everyone else in the category, was benchmarked in the report on higher level salaries, which Deputies can examine for the precise arrangements applicable to this category.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_221">My question, which was in order, was when will we see the order the Minister has made?  As I understand, regulations under this Bill must be laid before the House and they can be annulled.  Will the Minister make time for the Dáil to debate that order because there is substantial belief that bonuses, which should only be paid for exceptional achievement, should not be regarded, as the Minister has now done, as part of the core pay of those public servants?  The way he got to that 18% was by pretending that they were entitled to bonus pay each year, regardless of performance.  That was never the intention of a bonus scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_222">As Deputy Bruton is well aware, this particular bonus arrangement was unique to this category of public servant.  As I understand the position, the statutory instrument has been adopted and there are no proposals to make time available to discuss it.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">Will the Minister clarify, or perhaps correct, something the Tánaiste told us yesterday?  When I asked her about this yesterday, she effectively said that the inclusion of the bonus as part of salary was recommended by the review body on higher level remuneration.  She told us the review body on higher level remuneration indicated that the bonus was indicatively part of the salary and, therefore, that justified the way in which the Minister and the Government handled it.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I have looked through the review body report and it says nothing of the kind — in fact, it clearly says the reverse.  It makes clear that the Government had already decided that performance-related awards should be abolished and, therefore, the recommendations which it made in respect of the pay of this grade of civil servant had already taken that into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The Government has been justifying what it did by suggesting that the review body had somehow recommended that the bonus and basic pay should be consolidated for these purposes but it did not say anything of the kind.  Will the Minister for Finance clarify that point?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">The commencement order for the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act appeared on the Order Paper on Tuesday.  That was a commencement order rather than a statutory instrument and did not include, if I am correct in my reading of it, any reference to the fact the Minister had used his powers under that Act to grant an exception to people in regard to bonuses.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">The Minister said a statutory instrument does that.  If that has occurred, it has not been on the Order Paper, or at least I have not seen it on it.  It needs to go on the Order Paper and this House and the other one have the right to challenge that within 21 days.  The Minister might clarify that.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">As the Tánaiste said yesterday, bonuses are indicative but all the literature previously available on bonuses state that they are performance-related and reward for outstanding performance and excellence and that they are not automatic.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Will the Minister clarify who, in the upper echelons of the public service, is affected by his and the Government's approach?  County managers, directors of services and senior executives in the Health Service Executive all have bonus arrangements.  The Government indicated, when it introduced the various emergency financial arrangements, that the bonuses had been brought to an end and that, therefore, they had already been stopped by Government as surplus excess payments which would be made in good times to reward very good performance.  That is what the reports and the replies to parliamentary questions on bonuses, since they were first introduced, suggest.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The Minister will understand that more junior public servants, many of them now taking home less than €500 per week, feel very aggrieved that special arrangements have been made for people who, although they are not necessarily hugely well paid, are certainly far better paid than people in the lower ranks of the public service who face big reductions as well as big tax hikes.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">A Civil Service clerical officer on the mid-point of the scale has suffered a net loss in the last three budgets since autumn 2008 of approximately 11.7% of pay.  I accept that is a very significant loss.  It should be compared to the net loss of those in the higher paid grades.  In the same period, an Assistant Secretary has suffered a net loss of more than 24% of pay while a Deputy Secretary has suffered a net loss of more than 27% of pay.  The highest paid civil servants, level one Secretaries General, who volunteered to take an additional pay reduction, have seen their net pay reduced by more than one third.</p>

The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, was present earlier and I hoped she would be here when I raised this issue.  It is concerning a lot of parents.  Families are very upset about it.  There is a loophole in the law which needs to be closed immediately, not in two years' time when young people in this country will have died as a result of taking these drugs.  I ask the Government to introduce emergency legislation to the Dáil to deal with head shops.</p>

The Government's legislative programme indicates that publication of No. 25 in section B, the qualifications (education and training) Bill, is expected in late 2010.  The purpose of the legislation is described as to amalgamate HETAC and FETAC in a new organisation which "will also take responsibility for the external quality assurance review of the universities".  In so far as publication is expected in late 2010, and it is not clear when the report of the working group on the future of third level education is likely to be published, was it somewhat premature of the Minister for Education and Science to announce that he will abolish the National University of Ireland?</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
          <p eId="para_366">I wish to share time with the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power.  I ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to indicate when five minutes of my speaking time remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">I welcome this opportunity to address the House on this matter.  I established the mid-west task force early last year under the chairmanship of Mr. Denis Brosnan following the announcement of the Dell manufacturing closure in Limerick and associated industrial job losses in the mid-west region.  The task force completed an interim report which was presented to me by Mr. Brosnan last July.  The wide range of recommendations in the report covers both local and national issues.  Some fall within the remit of my Department and its agencies, while others fall within the remit of other Ministers and require a whole of government approach in responding to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">The Government has been responding to the recommendations under these headings.  Last September, I sent the task force a report on responses up to that time.  Since then, I have conducted a broad consultation with other Ministers and relevant divisions and agencies in my Department.  Ministers are finalising their responses in light of their budgets for 2010 and I expect to send a further report to the task force shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I shall set out the main responses.  Fuller detail will be provided on some of these responses in the closing remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.  With regard to the position in the mid-west region, which developed around the Dell manufacturing closure announcement, a variety of actions have been taken.  As an immediate response to the developing situation, a response under the heading "Túsnua" was initiated in December 2008.  Túsnua is a multi-agency regional group which was established specifically to address the issue of the impending business closures and downsizing across companies in the mid-west.  The group includes Enterprise Ireland, the city and county enterprise boards, FÁS, Limerick Institute of Technology and the University of Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">This multi-agency response to job losses has been taking place at two levels.  At the level of individual employees, information and services to those facing unemployment has been provided to facilitate them to retrain, re-educate or start a new business.  At the level of companies, specific initiatives have been delivered to indigenous sub-supply companies in the mid-west to explore alternative markets, products and business opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">A range of supports and programmes is being provided.  Management of the web portal, Túsnua, which provides seamless access to a comprehensive range of information and enterprise supports, is available via Enterprise Ireland, the county enterprise boards, FÁS and third level institutions.  In addition, the website allows individuals to register their specific request for support with a facility for immediate follow-up by the relevant agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Information events have been held encompassing all enterprise, employment and education institutions together with private and voluntary sector organisations, including financial institutions, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, citizens information centres and recruitment agencies.  A collaborative information brochure detailing contacts, business start-up supports and financial assistance is available via Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">A series of one and two night seminars and workshops throughout the mid-west commenced in March 2009 to provide individuals with information on enterprise start-up and identification of new business opportunities.  A further Enterprise Ireland-led six-week, part-time enterprise start programme is due to commence in early February at the Enterprise Ireland funded enterprise acceleration centre at Limerick Institute of Technology to facilitate individuals to explore business start-up as a new career option.  This is in addition to a series of programmes run last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">An enterprise platform programme also commenced at Limerick Institute of Technology to assist individuals to commercialise existing business ideas.  A one-to-one meeting facility for individuals interested in business start-up has been available from locally based Enterprise Ireland regional development executives.  In addition, Enterprise Ireland has focused on the sub-supply base in the mid west with dedicated sub-supplier events to facilitate supply companies to explore new opportunities, new business leads and new markets with assistance from El's overseas market network.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">In addition to the Túsnua initiative, a successful application was made under the EU's European globalisation adjustment fund in June 2009.  The application of co-funded assistance from this fund will support the costs of a personalised package of occupational guidance, training, employment, entrepreneurship and educational measures for workers made redundant at the Dell plant in Raheen and in ancillary enterprises.  This application was approved by the European Union budgetary authorities in late December 2009 and the transfer of EU funds is anticipated this week or next.  Provision has been made in my Department's Vote for the national financing element required.  The timeframe permitted for eligible expenditure under the fund in this case is September 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Having successfully secured EGF funding together with significant Government co-financing, we are continuing with the implementation of the suite of EGF-funded measures.  Good work continues to be done by State agencies and educational institutions in Limerick and the mid-west region.  For example, FÁS has already provided guidance services and training courses to more than 1,500 of the affected workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">My Department will be the managing authority for the EGF funding in the State while the Department of Education and Science, FÁS and Enterprise Ireland will be designated intermediate bodies for funds transfer, reporting and monitoring purposes.  Approved funding will be made available to public beneficiaries delivering services on the ground to the eligible redundant workers.  All intermediate bodies shall certify expenditure in their area of responsibility and report to my Department, and all expenditure must adhere to relevant EU and national accounting and auditing procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">It is imperative that the wide suite of EGF-assisted measures being provided to eligible redundant workers be co-ordinated in the most effective and efficient manner locally and regionally.  To that end, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, and I have charged FÁS with establishing a dedicated EGF co-ordination unit in Limerick to ensure all relevant supports across all service providers are co-ordinated on the ground in a timely, effective and efficient manner.  The unit shall act as the primary co-ordination agency for the Department in the implementation of the EGF programme for related supports for Dell workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">FÁS is currently contacting all relevant redundant workers to inform them of the supports being offered with EGF assistance in the areas of training, upskilling, entrepreneurial supports and further and higher education.  They are also inviting the workers to a two-day information fair in Limerick in early February at which all service providers will be in attendance to detail their programmes and supports, to answer queries and to provide for course registrations.  A steering group is also being established to include worker representative bodies to ensure the views of the redundant workers and other key stakeholders are made known and fed into the implementation process.  The Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, will go to Limerick shortly to meet with representatives of redundant workers as part of this process and will hear their views at first hand.  A review of the operation of the fund shall be undertaken by my Department in June 2010.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">In regard to the promotion of industrial employment in the mid-west region, the development agencies Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Forfás and Shannon Development have enjoyed a close working relationship with the task force to date and this will continue into the future.  As with all the other stakeholders in the region, the agencies are fully committed to working through the current difficulties and to getting the message out that the mid-west is a great location and is very much open for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">A strong promotion effort is under way in respect of foreign direct investment.  IDA Ireland is working very hard overseas in continuing to promote strongly the mid west to potential investors.  This is evidenced by the fact that the agency hosted 18 visits to the region by potential investors in 2009.</p>

          <p eId="para_383">It continues to focus on attracting high technology investment to the mid west.  Intel announced a €50 million investment in research and development in the Shannon Development free zone in 2009, a major vote of confidence in the region.  IDA has 52 client companies in the mid-west region employing more than 8,000 people on a full or part-time basis.  While 2009 was been a difficult year for these companies, we continue to work with them to protect and strengthen their operations in the region and to assist them in broadening and deepening the range of functions carried out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Foreign direct investments take some time to be put in place.  In this regard a number of companies that announced investments  in 2008 and in 2009 are currently recruiting.  These include Vistakon, Channel Advisor, ON Semi, Cook Medical and DTS in Limerick, Microsemi in Ennis, and Intel in Shannon.  Enterprise Ireland's client employment complement in the mid-west region in 2009 was more than 9,100.  Nevertheless, it is clear that the economic downturn is resulting in a negative effect on employment creation.  The effect on job retention, particularly in certain sectors such as construction and related industries, has been significant, with a net decrease of numbers employed in El companies.  A key driver of employment growth in the region will be the presence of innovative start-up companies.  Five  such high-potential start-ups were established in the mid west in 2009, with Enterprise Ireland's support.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">Although 2009 was a difficult year for established companies, Enterprise lreland expects the ongoing focus for established industry in the mid-west to be on consolidation, growing gross value added.

          <p eId="para_411">I thank the Tánaiste for sharing the very limited time available.  In that short time I wish to make some key points.  All Deputies from Limerick and the mid-west in general have been dealing with the fall-out from the decision by Dell to cut its work force in half by letting go 1,900 employees.  It is important to emphasise that 1,000 very high quality jobs remain at Dell which need to be supported.  That must be acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Every Deputy has dealt with people in the area who have lost their jobs and some of the stories have been very difficult to hear.  The people deserve our support.  What was the response?  Initially, the Tánaiste made every effort to have the jobs retained.  She travelled to the United States in an all-out effort to achieve this.  It was not possible but she has moved swiftly and decisively to deal with the fall-out from the announcement by Dell.  Her initial response in setting up Túsnua gave valuable information and opportunities to those who lost their jobs in the immediate period.  She acted decisively in setting up the mid-west task force.  She also recognises that there are other parts of the country — including the Border and midlands regions — which have higher rates of unemployment than the mid-west.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">However, she set up a dedicated task force to deal with the difficulties experienced by the latter region.  I compliment the members of the task force, including its chairman, Mr. Denis Brosnan, who have done an excellent job.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">One of the Government's key initiatives during the past 12 months was to make an application to the European Globalisation Fund.  That application was successful and funding has been made available.  The Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, have been working flat out since the beginning of the year to ensure that funding is distributed in accordance with the terms laid down by the European Globalisation Fund.  Those terms include allowing former employees to access such funding in order to upskill and retrain.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">I urge the Tánaiste and FÁS, which is the co-ordinating body, to allow private companies to provide training and support to former employees.  Not all employees are interested in going on to third level education or in furthering their education.  Some of them want to become involved in business and create jobs.  It is important, therefore, that money be made available for start-up micro-enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Shannon Development and IDA Ireland must work closely together in order to attract both employment and foreign direct investment.  I welcome the Tánaiste's announcement that IDA Ireland's new strategy will place a particular focus on Limerick and the mid-west.  The Lynx Cargo project is extremely important for Shannon and the mid-west region.  I have being pressing the Tánaiste and the Minister for Transport to provide every support possible in order to ensure that the project will come to fruition.  The project to which I refer would provide a great boost for the airport similar to that which will come as a result of this morning's announcement that Shannon Airport has been granted preclearance in respect of general aviation — in other words, flights involving private jets — to the United States.</p>

The report indicates that from January 2002 to September 2008, Ireland lost 32% of its international price competitiveness.  In 2000, average labour costs here were 40% lower than those in the US and 10% lower than those in the UK.

          <p eId="para_433">No.  The Tánaiste is referring to the 25% target in respect of regulation, which is entirely different.  The report also calls for a national competitiveness strategy.  Developing such a strategy should also be a matter of policy for everyone and proposals in this regard have already been put forward by Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The report also calls for the entire joint labour committee, JLC, system, particularly as it relates to premium rates of pay, to be overhauled.  That is another policy which Fine Gael supports.  Further, the report refers to reducing employers' PRSI across the board.  Fine Gael proposed this in its alternative budget.  The report also proposes changes to corporation tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Other proposals contained in the report include a workshare arrangement for those who work short time.  My party has also made proposals in this regard.  The report suggests that additional resources should be allocated in order to encourage people to remain in education and training.  This is similar to the national internship programme and the second chance education scheme proposed by Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">The report also makes proposals in respect of capital spending on projects relating to the N18, the N20, the Adare bypass, the Foynes Port link and the Northern Ring Road.  In its alternative budget, Fine Gael proposed that the capital budget should not be cut.  However, the Minister for Finance reduced it by €1 billion in the budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The report proposes the establishment of a commission to consider the boundaries in the area, a move I would support.  There are other proposals in the report which I would support and others I would not.  One of those I would support is that which suggests using the energy complex that comprises Ardnacrusha, Tarbert and Moneypoint as a possible avenue for developing alternative renewable energy.  This very much fits in with Fine Gael's NewERA strategy.  The report also refers to merging the different State agencies operating in the mid-west, which is worthy of consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">If we are going to establish task forces, then it is important that the Government should take into account the reports they submit.  There is no point in appointing a task force, waiting for it to report and then making a speech in the House which does not in any way take cognisance of the work of the task force.  It is as if the Tánaiste did not read the report of the mid-west task force or as if that report is irrelevant.</p>

It appears that her intention in establishing the task force was to engage in a PR exercise.  She wanted to be seen to do something when she actually intended to do nothing.  That is what must change with regard to how the Government operates.

          <p eId="para_445">As the recession continues to deepen, everyone involved in politics is coming across a great many down-beat and depressed people.  In Limerick late last week, I met the most depressed individual I have met in a long time.  I refer to Mr. Denis Brosnan who was completely depressed by the fact that following all the work he and his task force had done, the Government had failed to issue a response.  Mr. Brosnan did not just make this charge in private; he repeated it later on at a press conference held in the hotel where I met him.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Mr. Brosnan indicated that he was depressed because, as far as he was aware, there had not been a response from the Tánaiste's Department or from any of the other Departments to which the 20 recommendations made in the interim report are relevant.  He stated that there are three choices for people in the region.  The first of these is that our fellow citizens could wallow in long-term unemployment.  Alternatively, he said that the Government could initiate a programme under which emigration could be promoted in order that people would move out of the region in the hope of obtaining employment abroad.  The third choice is that Government could take initiatives to create jobs in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Mr. Brosnan was depressed and down-beat because he is of the view that the Government has no intention of taking action in respect of the problems of the region and that an entire cohort of individuals, principally young people, would be condemned to long-term unemployment for a generation.  The contrast between the briefing Mr. Brosnan gave to Deputies from all parties and the Tánaiste's speech today is amazing.  I accept that the Tánaiste is an honest politician and that she is sincere in her views.  However, her contribution to this debate was such a collection of guff — prepared by people who do not understand what is happening in the mid-west region — that it is difficult to know whether we are seeking to address the same problem.  Most of the claims made in the Tánaiste's speech are not happening on the ground.  Túsnua is an invisible organisation.  There may be considerable activity in exchanging e-mails and discussing matters with each other, but there is no practical result of any of the initiatives that are being taken.  It is appalling that 12 months after all the redundancies we are still at this state.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">We all know the history of the problem.  Almost 2,000 workers were made redundant in Dell before Christmas last year.  Another 2,000 in sub-supply industries where Dell was the principal customer lost their jobs.  Another series of jobs that were connected in one way or another to Dell's activities were eroded in the region.  The Government knew this was about to happen and the Tánaiste, the local Minister and other Cabinet Ministers did not share the information with either the workers or the public for quite a long period before the redundancies were established.  We all have contacts.  We were getting the feed through from senior executives in the company——</p>

          <p eId="para_459">Mr. Denis Brosnan is a reputable entrepreneur.  His record as head of the Kerry Group is beyond criticism.  He built it up to be an amazing international company.  He has been involved in other business projects and has been equally successful.  He is admired throughout the region.  He took this on as a public service task.  I was amazed last week at how forthright and blunt he was in saying that of the 20 recommendations across the various Departments he could get neither access nor action and that nothing was happening.  Even the Fianna Fáil Deputies will vouch for that.  That was the blunt message.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">According to the statistics I have, the mid-west region has the highest unemployment level in the country at 13.8%.  Among the under 25s the unemployment level is more than 20% in the mid west.  Many young people have emigrated and many others have continued in education which tends to keep the figure lower.  The Tánaiste spoke of IDA Ireland being the pillar of initiatives in the mid west.  IDA Ireland has done nothing for Limerick in the past two or three years.  Its senior executives did not even meet the task force.  No IDA Ireland manager based in Dublin bothered to meet the task force.  All connections were through the local office and neither Enterprise Ireland nor IDA Ireland has delivered a job coming from inward investment in the region in the past two years.  Their record is appalling.  To assure us that everything will be all right because IDA Ireland has it in hand is absolute cod.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Shannon Airport is crucial to the region.  However, because of the apathy of the Government and the hostility of the Dublin Airport Authority, it is on the way to being closed down.  There was a 12% decline in passenger numbers in 2008.  While the 2009 figures have not been published yet, they are indicating a decline of between 12% and 15%.  Aer Lingus has withdrawn many of its transatlantic services.  Ryanair is pulling out the bulk of its planes based there from 1 March and Shannon is losing its status as a major international airport.  Shannon has been crucial to the development of the region, not only through the direct employment it provides at the airport, but as the gateway for tourism and for inward investment.  The Shannon issue must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I cannot understand why the Government will not abolish the travel tax.  Given that it collects such a small amount of money, that there is such pressure on and that Ryanair has committed to increasing the throughput of tourists if the travel tax is abolished, I cannot understand why it is still there.  The dead hand of the Dublin Airport Authority must be removed from Shannon.  The two airports are competitors.  The Dublin Airport Authority has no interest in promoting Shannon.  Shannon must be given autonomy and allowed to find its own way and market Shannon for other airlines now that it has been let down by Aer Lingus.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Tánaiste briefly referred to other recommendations of the task force.  I am glad about what she said on the Lynxs project, but she seemed to centre it in Dublin rather than in Shannon even though the original initiative was in Shannon.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">All right.  I am glad to hear of that.  However, before it is viable the Government or one of its agencies must provide approximately €7 million for the supporting infrastructure, not in the airport itself, but to provide the access roads and the other infrastructure necessary to promote this.  I would like a commitment in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The western corridor is also crucial to the west.  Completion of the carriageway from Limerick to Galway is held up and the commencement of the carriageway from Limerick to Cork is held up.  If they cannot be done through the public capital programme, the Government should take the PPP route and get private funds to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I welcome what the Tánaiste said about National Technological Park, Plassey and her kind of half-intention of providing some funding there for the microbiology industry.  That would be very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The €20 million global fund going to workers is very welcome.  It is specifically tied into named redundant workers.  Of the 2,000 individuals, between 400 and 500 were from eastern Europe, many of whom have gone home.  Will a quarter of the fund be tied into people who are no longer living in the region and have gone back home because it is tied into the workers?  Will there be an element of the fund being frozen?  Alternatively will these redundant workers who have now returned to Poland and the Baltic states be able to avail of the fund in their home countries since it is an EU global fund and they were made redundant from Dell?  I require clarification on that.  Obviously, it is in the interest of the region that the money be spent in the region.  However, a legal problem is emerging on the terms of the arrangement, on which I would like clarification.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">I would like more information about the fund.  In reply to a parliamentary question yesterday the Department refused to give me the details of the training programmes that would be funded on the basis that FÁS would announce it in a fortnight's time.  FÁS is not in here.  I am a Member of Parliament for Limerick.  Public funds are being used, two thirds of it European and one third domestic, and the Tánaiste's Department refused to answer a question from me about the programmes to be funded from the fund on the basis that it was holding the information because FÁS will announce everything in a fortnight's time.  That does not inspire confidence in me or in the region.  It is a very bad way to treat the Dáil and Members of Parliament when essential information to do with the accountability for public funds is held from Deputies so that a PR announcement can be made in a fortnight's time by a State agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I thank Deputy Penrose for allowing me to use this 15-minute slot because I need that much time to address the issue in any detail.  Deputy Higgins will speak later to give a west of Ireland perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I fully agree with Deputy Noonan that it is unprecedented that somebody like Mr. Denis Brosnan who was given charge of a task force on this very important issue should have had none of the 12 recommendations of the interim report implemented or responded to by Government.  He was forced to take the unprecedented step of calling in the public representatives from the mid-west region and go on the national media to highlight the issue.  While I have every respect for the Tánaiste, her speech contained the greatest load of waffle without any specifics about what is happening.  Words like "information" were used repeatedly in terms of response to the plight of people losing their jobs and who have lost their jobs in the mid west.  There is great concern in the region that what was once a thriving, innovative, prosperous and forward-thinking region has been left with above average unemployment rates, with jobs going down the Swannee and the response from the Minister in respect of IDA Ireland was about nothing. It has not delivered jobs to the region.  I firmly believe the original brief of Shannon Free Airport Development Company, SFADCo, delivered much more to the region than these reconfigured agencies.  I am very critical of the IDA because, as Deputy Michael Noonan has said, it did not even engage with the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">It is unprecedented that somebody like Mr. Denis Brosnan, who was appointed by the Minister to do a job, and the members of the team who gave of their time, should have such a non-response.  We need urgency about this and specifics rather than generalities.  In term of specifics, I am very disappointed that my colleague, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea from Limerick, is not present for this debate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_479">This is the most important thing that has happened for the region.  I acknowledge that the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, at least took the time to come in and make a contribution, but Deputy O'Dea is the senior Minister in the region and I wanted to ask him a couple of questions, had he been present.  Where are the 700 jobs, for example, that he announced on national radio when Dell closed?  Where is the multi-million public private project he announced, in the context of regeneration for Limerick?  The people of the mid-west are sick of being led by the nose on issues such as this and being told things are happening when clearly they are not.  In the same context, we were given all types of reassurances by the senior Minister in the region about Dell.  By the time he went to Texas with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, it was too late.  The stable door had closed, the horse had bolted and Dell had already made its decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">We will all work together in the region on this issue, but we need our most senior Government people to be working with us and I am very disappointed that the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, is not here.  Some of the specifics have been referred to already, and Mr. Brosnan highlighted some of them in his report.  One of them was the Lynx project which has been referred to in the context of the Shannon cargo hub.  Part of what is involved are temperature controlled warehouses to store medical products, to attract biomedical and biopharmaceutical industries.  We already have a record in that regard.  As was mentioned, we have the Vistakon plant in Plassey.  There are 70 acres behind that plant and that area needs to be upgraded in order to attract similar industries.  The mid-west region has a record of attracting multinationals, as well as the experience.  Practical measures are needed such as developing the site behind Vistakon and providing the €7 million, as identified in relation to the Lynx project and the Shannon cargo hub.  We urgently need a specific response on those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The mid-west region is one of innovation.  We have done things for ourselves — the Shannon Airport initiative was the start of this endeavour.  We need to examine how this was all built up.  It took a long time and we are not going to let it continue to go rapidly downhill, as is happening at the  moment.  We are looking for specific blocks or ledges that will stop the downhill momentum to give us the opportunity to pull ourselves back up.  That is what is being sought in the region.  We have a good deal of co-operation with the third level institutions, FÁS, VECs, etc., in the region.  They are working together, but need the Government to take their issues seriously.  We need to ensure that they get the response they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">On the Shannon Airport issue, it is true that figures declined by 12% to 14% in 2009 and it is expected that they will decline again in the coming year.  The threats from Ryanair are very real.  Jobs were announced yesterday in Cork and Farranfore now makes more profit than Shannon.  There is a real concern that it will become a regional airport.  Shannon's potential is enormous as is the need for it in the country.  We need a balance between the east and the west.  Shannon Airport is a key infrastructural access point for that and it needs to be taken seriously.  We do not need the body running Shannon Airport to be called the Dublin Airport Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The region's needs have to be prioritised, and there is major consensus in this regard among all mid-west public representatives.  Most of us here, for example, attended a meeting recently between Mr. Christoph Mueller of Aer Lingus and the workers' representatives at Shannon.  We are all committed to supporting the proposals coming from the workers' representatives.  We all listened to Mr. Mueller saying there needs to be an injection of support for tourism in the mid-west and along the entire western seaboard.  Again, that has to be driven and led by the Government, but at the moment we are not getting that response.  Mr. Mueller is experienced regarding the European market and he can see the significant potential for tourism in the entire western part of Ireland, but at present tourists trying to get to the west are going into Dublin.  They should be flying into Shannon Airport and immediately accessing places such as Killarney, Galway and all the other beauty spots that are unique to Ireland.  If we could increase our international tourism figures even by a small percentage, it would make all the difference to the Shannon region.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">All of us here know the detail of what precisely is required to achieve this.  All we need is for the Government to respond on the very specific promises that were made, such as the announcement by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Martin Cullen, of a €53 million tourism and economic plan for Shannon.  In the event, all we got was €6 million.  We just need such specifics addressed.  I see Deputy Timmy Dooley nodding his head, because there is agreement among all parties in the region about what is needed.  The mid-west region can use funding well if it can get it.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">I have referred to the Shannon workers, but the redundant Dell workers have not been properly included in this process either.  They should have had a central role in the task force.  The task force is primarily led by industrialists and people at that level, but the workers represent a crucial voice regarding the spending of the globalisation fund.  My colleague, Mr. Alan Kelly, MEP, brought that to the attention of the powers that be in Europe and while I acknowledge the Government's role in this regard, it also needed that catalyst from Mr. Kelly and other MEPs to ensure that the workers could talk to officials in Brussels and that the fund was released.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">There is a now a relatively short timeframe within which that fund has to be spent, however.  I recently met with members of the redundant Dell workers' group and they are not happy with the top-down arrangement that is in place.  They are to meet the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, next Monday and that is welcome, but many of the decisions are already made before they are consulted.  Such consultation will take place under the auspices of a so-called steering group that has been established which will include worker representative bodies.  However, many of the structures will already be in place before the workers are listened to.  They are lobbying for the type of supports they need to be made available to them, not just the supports the university, the institute of technology, the VEC or FÁS believe they should have.</p>

          <p eId="para_489">Another issue is the fact that Limerick VEC had to turn away 2,500 applicants for the college of further education in Mulgrave Street because there was not enough room for them.  In other words, 2,500 people in the mid-west region who want to do further education courses cannot fit into the college because it is so tightly squashed in terms of space.  I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, to the House and believe he will be interested in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">Would it not be much better to give those 2,500 people the opportunity for further training and education, rather than obliging them to sign on to the dole queues?  Moreover, this is what such people want and I urge the Minister to bring this suggestion to the Government.  It would be much better to facilitate people's involvement in education rather than remaining on the dole queues.  Many people come into my clinic, as I am sure is the case in Members' clinics nationwide, and state this is what they want.  I refer to people who never have been unemployed previously and who want the opportunity to either pursue further education and training or to have work.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">As for work, regional seed capital and venture capital to assist start-up enterprises is required urgently.  Many people have bright ideas, some of whom already have started businesses.  I recently spoke to a young self-employed woman who provides workplace safety training.  When she first established her business, it paid her a living wage but this no longer is the case.  She has been told that were she to give up her business and become unemployed for six months, she could receive a back-to-work payment and could start up the business all over again.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">Such a system possesses no logic.  It would make much more sense to give that young woman sufficient support to enable her to keep the business ticking over by using whatever she would get on the dole.  Subsequently, after one or two years, or however long it will take, the business will become viable again.  While this is a single example, that person's experience could be multiplied 100 or 1,000 times over in the region and many more times nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">I seek a practical response from the Government to the issues I have raised.  While I have been speaking in general about the region, a couple of specific and important issues arise within Limerick itself.  One issue concerns a boundary extension and all five Deputies for Limerick East have signed a letter requesting the establishment of a commission to consider this issue.  This matter must be furthered rapidly by the Government because Limerick is unable to compete with other cities unless its environs in their entirety are incorporated within the city limits.  At present, several major sites such as the University of Limerick, Crescent Shopping Centre and the major hospital at Dooradoyle hospital all are located within the administrative area of Limerick city and this matter must be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">In addition, the Limerick regeneration agencies must receive the funding they require to redevelop.  I note that a body that was set up by the Government under the chairmanship of John Fitzgerald has produced beautiful reports.  However,the agencies now are stuck because they lack sufficient funding to develop the projects that have been identified and people are becoming disillusioned.  Were regeneration to be properly funded, it would be possible to employ thousands of additional people in the mid-west region in the morning.  There are many areas in the mid-west in which people wish to work and to use and build on their strengths.  However, I refer to the 20 recommendations of a task force that was set up by the Government and which gave its interim report last July.  The need for its chairman to go public to state the Government has not responded to a single recommendation constitutes a huge indictment on the Government's response.  I welcome today's debate because it should initiate an urgent response that will deal with the specific issues that must be addressed in the mid-west to bring it back to being the strong region it was, can be and will be in the future the correct response is provided.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">This illustrates the failure of the Government to tackle this problem seriously as it promised following the massive job losses in the region in companies such as Dell which gave rise to the worst unemployment crisis in a generation.  This pertains both to the unemployment created directly by Dell's closure and the knock-on effect on other small businesses that were ancillaries to that major company.  This stands in stark contrast to the speed with which it acted save the banks and the property businesses at everyone else's expense, the true extent of which shall never be known.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The task force made 20 recommendations, including the allocation of significant additional funds for companies and community enterprise schemes, as well as the fast tracking of local infrastructure development.  Instead of implementing these recommendations, the Government has decided to make cuts to the capital budget in respect of both of these areas.  How will so doing help places such as Limerick and the mid-west in general to overcome their current difficulties?  The result of such Government inaction is an ever-growing tide of unemployment, despondency and emigration.  There is a very effective way to cut the cost of social welfare, namely, to put our people back to work on a programme geared around the recommendations of the task force with regard to developing and improving the infrastructure of the mid-west allied to a comprehensive re-training initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">In budget 2010, the FÁS allowances for community employment and jobs initiative schemes were reduced to €20 and €40 per week, respectively.  In tandem with this measure, the training allowances for participants were cut by half from €1,500 to €750.  The Government rationale for this move was that it would facilitate an additional 500 places on the community employment schemes.  A key part of any strategy to turn things around must be to devote more attention to the development of the Irish social economy and both the jobs initiative and community employment schemes are central in this regard.  The social economy encourages empowerment and community schemes have enormous potential for the mid-west region, as was highlighted by the task force.  It is increasingly recognised that the social economy has an important role to play in society, particularly by enhancing the economy within those communities suffering social and economic exclusion.  The social economy is necessary to build a strong and stable economy but their contribution was undermined by the proposals of the budget of 2010.  The result of the Government's inaction both in the mid-west and throughout the State is an ever-growing tide of unemployment, despondency and emigration.  Inaction is an invitation to another recession and will leave deep scars on the region in the forms of poor infrastructure, long-term unemployment and social exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">There is an effective way to redress the socio-economic problems in the region, which have been exacerbated by the closure of the Dell manufacturing plant, and that is to put people back to work on a programme geared around the recommendations of the task force with regard to developing and improving the infrastructure of the mid-west, allied to a comprehensive re-training initiative.  It is clear that the Government has no strategy to deal with the jobs crisis.  Although the report called, as a matter of urgency, for the acceleration of the Limerick regeneration plan, nothing has been done.  The Government is paying lip service to job creation, regeneration and regional development.  While it may have garnered a few brownie points for Fianna Fáil in the wake of the closure of Dell to put together a task force and commission a report in an effort to be perceived to be doing something, that is not enough now.  The putting together of a report and doing nothing about it merely constitutes fooling people.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The report warned that unemployment in the mid-west could rise to 55,000 by the end of 2010 unless urgent action is taken.  However, 3,000 jobs could be created in the construction process and 4,000 jobs developed under the regeneration plan.  The regeneration plan was never simply about regenerating areas but always had the potential to enhance the entire city and to provide thousands of jobs.  Any potential large-scale investment in infrastructure must result in construction employment.  The Government's immediate priority should be to provide essential, labour-intensive infrastructure with an emphasis on the re-employment of construction workers, which is one of the hardest-hit sectors in the present downturn.  This investment in infrastructure will have the dual benefit of improving the region and providing much-needed employment in construction, architecture, engineering and ancillary trades and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">A variety of existing models can provide a template for such an approach.  Throughout the European Union, labour clauses have been agreed as part of public contracts and urban regeneration projects.  The insertion of labour clauses into development briefs and public contracts is leading the way and provides a linkage between public spending on capital projects and services with public policy objectives, such as reducing unemployment and providing work placement opportunities to apprentices.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Many of the recommendations in the report have a national context, in particular cost competitiveness which has a focal role in economic recovery.  The failure of the Government to take on board the recommendations of the report highlights, not only its blatant disregard for the mid-west region, but its overall negative attitude towards framing a strategy for recovery.  Instead, it appears content to implement huge cuts in public provision that will further set back any hope of recovery and make matters worse for those who have already lost their jobs.  The Government seems content to allow ailing regions sink further into trouble and to let unemployment soar and is only too happy to throw its cronies in the banks a lifeboat to keep them afloat.  The problems in the mid-west — the rising unemployment and the social problems associated with that — are not confined to that region.  The spin-off of what is happening there can be seen in County Kerry.  North Kerry and west Limerick are as badly affected as the mid-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The interim report of the mid-west task force contains many useful proposals for areas such as education, retraining and exploiting the region's natural resources to combat unemployment.  However, one reservation I have about the recommendations of the report is the large emphasis that is placed on cutting pay.  In its recommendations for what actions could be taken by Government to increase the competitiveness of the sector, reference was made by some companies to the need to reduce labour costs.  That is an extremely negative approach that offers little to those employed in the region or for the future of the region in terms of attracting highly skilled or educated labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The biggest contributor to Irish economic success and success in the mid-west region has been the exceptional wealth of intellectual capital.  Pay is a huge issue for indigenous enterprises, especially SMEs.  Some enterprises have called for a reduction in labour costs, including the minimum wage, as part of a Government package to reduce business costs, claiming that wages take up too big a part of turnover.  Given the high cost of living in Ireland, a 40-hour average week makes it difficult for many workers in the sector to earn enough to make ends meet.  Reducing wages is an irresponsible and short-sighted way of addressing the cost competitiveness of the sector.  The policy of reducing wages takes more money out of the local economy.  How can such a policy benefit a local economy?  The concern for Government is not just the quantity of jobs that is created.  The quality of jobs created is equally important.  Regional development cannot be done on the basis of driving down wages.  Further cuts in wages and erosion of conditions and standards of employment would not be acceptable to most people in the region.  The emphasis instead should be on strategic investment in the indigenous economy to take advantage of the potential that lies in sectors such as agri-food, where development and growth can be initiated based on the export market.  This sector already seems to have turned the corner.  This is preferable to waiting for a return to the levels of inward investment behind much of the economic growth of recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">Foreign investment is welcome and even necessary, but one of the lessons of the downturn is that we were too reliant on it and too neglectful of the real indigenous economy.  As we have seen from the fall-out from the banking and property crisis, too much of the wealth of this country was invested speculatively and incompetently while at the same time genuine enterprises that were contributing to the real economy and employing people often found it difficult to access credit, a situation that has worsened recently despite the relative health of many Irish businesses which appear to have weathered the storm and are potentially in a position to generate new growth.  I doubt there is any Deputy who has not had representations from small businesses that find it extremely difficult to access credit in order to stay afloat and keep people employed.  Unfortunately, the directions from the Department of Finance inhibit the survival of small enterprises throughout the island, in particular in the mid west.  This is something that is dealt with extensively in my colleague's, Deputy Arthur Morgan, report on the agri-food sector.  The Government needs to implement the positive recommendations of the task force and make them part of a State wide strategy to encourage recovery rather than continue down the path of undermining public provision and further depressing the economy and setting back recovery for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">I was shocked to hear what Deputies Noonan and Jan O'Sullivan had to say about the non-existence of IDA supports in their area.  I concur with what they had to say because the same situation is reflected in my county.  This is disgraceful.  Nothing has been done to help.  The rate of unemployment in my county is 26%, more than double the national average.  Deputy Noonan pointed out that some 20% of those under 25 years of age are unemployed.  This is an indictment not just of the Government but of the State bodies set up to provide employment and bring equality to rural Ireland.  That is not happening and it does not appear it will happen in the short term.  It needs to happen.  Each day we see the result of this lack in the mid west.  We see Limerick City going through a scourge of antisocial activity, with crime lords running rampant in their respective areas.  This is fuelled by an economy that does not serve the people and by high unemployment, particularly among young people.  We need to wake up to that, not just in Limerick City but throughout and beyond the mid west.  We must be aware of the benefits of providing proper employment and incomes for people and of making proper education and training available to young people coming into the labour market.  Doing that would be the best defence against our problems.  I strongly recommend that the recommendations of the task force be implemented speedily.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  We have been calling for this debate for some time and we now have the opportunity to address some, if not all, of the issues identified in the mid-west task force report, as well as some of the more peripheral issues with which those of us involved in the region are familiar.  Like other Members from the mid-west, I had the opportunity to discuss with Denis Brosnan, the chairperson of the task force, his views on these issues and his concerns about the advancement of some of the elements identified in the report.  He made it clear to all of us that he wanted a co-operative approach across all political divides and stressed the necessity to avoid political point scoring.  Politics being politics, perhaps he as a former chief executive of a public limited company could carry off that suggestion.  However, it has not happened and there has been a level of going for the soundbite rather than taking action.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">This is unfortunate, because this is not about the task force nor the recommendations.  It is about the lives of men, women and children who have been affected by the scourge of unemployment, by the disastrous decision of Dell to leave and move to Poland, with the loss of 1,900 jobs, and the knock-on effect that has had on other supporting enterprises and industries.  It behoves all of us to try to find solutions.  We must move away from the necessity to score political points.  There are other issues where we can do that.  When it comes to something as important as the livelihoods of people, the loss of people's homes, unemployment to which there seems no end and lack of opportunity we must stop throwing balls across the House and sit down and work constructively towards solutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">Several contributors to this debate have identified that some of the issues raised in the report are not local issues.  There is a national dimension to them.  One of the most important aspects of trying to generate employment and assist small businesses was dealing with the banking crisis and resolving some of the major issues.  We have dealt with and are dealing with these issues.  There are no overnight solutions to many of the main problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Deputies referred to foreign direct investment and the necessity for the IDA to bring more companies to the mid-west region.  In the past year and a half or two years, the IDA secured 18 visits to the mid-west region.  Not enough visits have been converted into job creation but I do not blame the IDA for that.  It is very clear that, with the distressed state of economies around the world, particularly in the United States, from where much of our foreign direct investment derives, other nations are experiencing their own financial difficulties.  Companies are down-sizing and are not expanding and investing overseas.  We must be mindful of that when seeking in the House to impugn the reputation of the IDA in respect of its efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">The IDA has a very considerable track record.  Even in the past two years in the mid-west region, it has been involved in the creation of so much employment.  In February 2008, 60 jobs were announced in respect of Vistakon.  Also in that month, Channel Advisor announced 15 jobs and Zimmer Holdings in Shannon announced 250 jobs.</p>

          <p eId="para_517">It is doing its job in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.  Let us move away from attacking the agencies and deal with the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Mr. Brosnan identified a couple of areas in respect of which he wanted to see significant movement.  He referred to governance and boundary issues.  It will be interesting to see how Members on the other side of the House will grapple with those issues when the Constituency Commission recommendations are dealt with.  We will see local squabbling for territory and wonder whether there will be the same unity of purpose as there is today in attacking the Government.  We will learn whether the Members will be able to solve their difficulties on the ground.  I suspect they will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Deputies referred to investment in regeneration.  That is clearly part of the Government's policy.  They referred also to the necessity to deal with the Lynx project.  That cannot necessarily be dealt with overnight.  Tremendous work has been done behind the scenes on this.  Those of us interested in promoting the project have had several meetings with the relevant Ministers.  I hope the Lynx project will get the go-ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">An issue arises regarding State funding and its impact under EU rules.  Notwithstanding that issue, I am confident a solution can be found.  If anybody believes the €7 million associated with the project and the €12 million it will invest to develop the facility will solve overnight the plight of the many unemployed in the region, they are misguided and sending out the wrong signal.  Bigger issues that arise at national level must be, and are being, dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">It is interesting that the previous speaker criticised the Government for not doing enough based on what he perceived to be the issues identified in the report.  Funnily, one of the recommendations, if implemented, would reduce the minimum wage.  The task force referred to the reduction in the cost of employment.  Inherent in that was a reduction——</p>

          <p eId="para_527">There has been an overall reduction in the unit labour cost of approximately 7%, which is welcome.  Energy costs are decreasing and we have become more cost-competitive in the mid-west in line with decisions taken and the changes to the general state of the economy.  The report identified all these issues.  It is important to differentiate between national and local issues and ensure that we continue to invest.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">There was some talk of a lack of investment in the mid-west and of ignoring the region with regard to investment and infrastructure.  The region has done exceptionally well because of the efforts of Members on all sides of the House to campaign for infrastructural investment.  The Ennis bypass and the ongoing construction of the road between Gort and Crusheen are cases in point.  At a time when there has been a reduction in the amount spent on capital projects, commencing the work on the route between Gort and Galway is vital.  The tunnel in Limerick will provide very significant infrastructure to assist in the development of Shannon Airport.  Quite a bit of money has been spent on the airport over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">The mid-west region has not been ignored.  There has been investment in the western rail corridor and the station at Sixmilebridge has been opened.  I hope there will be an announcement very shortly on the re-opening of a train station at Crusheen.  These are all vital investments in infrastructure of which the Government can be proud.  To suggest that we ignored the region in good times is wrong, although that is not to say there is not a difficulty at present.  Issues arise in many areas nationally but a unique issue arises on foot of the loss of 2,000 Dell jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">We must look to what we have in the region.  There is an exceptionally good tourism market.  It is suffering at present because of the recession across Europe and the United States.  The United States was a great feeder of visitors to Ireland.   We must be more competitive and aggressive in marketing the mid-west.  We should certainly pull up our socks regarding tourism marketing.  We must be much more clever about the use or our resources and target them such that they will give the mid-west a competitive edge, not over other regions in Ireland but over other destinations throughout Europe.  If we work well collectively, it will be to the benefit of all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I recognise the efforts being made to create jobs for the unemployed.  The work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, who is to visit the region next week, must be noted.  He has been dealing with people individually to assist in the design of an education and training programme with a view to advancing their careers.  This is the correct approach.  The allocation of money, not directly but through the provision of necessary training courses, represents the best way to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The effort of the Government regarding the European globalisation fund has been one of the most important aspects of assisting people to meet their immediate needs.  We must work collectively to ensure the existence of a framework that will allow enterprise to evolve and allow us to return to what we do best in the region.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_546">The key point is very simple.  When the Open Skies arrangement was being implemented in respect of Shannon, the tourism and economic development plan was commissioned by the then Minister for Transport, Deputy Martin Cullen.  The plan has not been implemented.  Of the €53 million referred to in the plan, only €6 million has been allocated to date.  The funding was made available to allow Shannon deal with Open Skies.  The task force report has been available for six months but there has been no action.  Mr. Denis Brosnan asked Members to ask the Minister to implement a few key recommendations, at a relatively low cost to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">In 2009, there was a 17% drop in net employment by enterprises supported by State agencies in the mid-west.  Mr. Denis Brosnan looked for a couple of key items, including the fast-tracking of urban regeneration in Limerick.  While the recent announcement of €25 million in this area is welcome, it will not enable capital projects to get under way.  Proper capital funding must be provided.  I would like if the Minster for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made a statement on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">Mr. Brosnan also sought to have Limerick and the mid-west made into a priority region for foreign direct investment.  Not one single new IDA Ireland backed job has come into the mid-west in 2009 since the Dell closure announcement.  This report was commissioned on foot of that announcement.  To say that the Government has looked after the mid-west region makes no sense and does not bear up to the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">Mr. Brosnan raised other several points.  Shannon Airport runs the risk of being classified as a regional airport unless something radical is done.  Only €7 million is required for the Lynx cargo project but the Dublin Airport Authority is still examining it with the Department of Transport.  A commitment from the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to push on this is needed.  There is also the proposed bio-medical industrial park in Plassey technology park with 70 acres for Shannon Development which would cost €10 million.  The two projects would only come to €17 million but bring many jobs to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">This is a good report but all we have got are bland statements from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  She has not made one commitment to fund any of the individual projects raised by Mr. Brosnan.</p>

          <p eId="para_552">Mr. Brosnan said he sees no purpose in proceeding with the final report until some recommendations of the interim report are produced.  Without any disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher, I would expect the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to make the concluding speech in this debate.  This is the largest single crisis in jobs to hit the mid-west which will lead to the downgrading of the region.  All of its Deputies should be working together.  However, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, are not present in the Chamber for the debate on a report which is critical to our region and one on which we want action to be taken.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_553">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important report.  I commend the eminent businessman, Mr. Denis Brosnan, and his team for the excellent work they did in preparing the report.  The least we could have is the Government taking on board some of its recommendations.  We cannot afford the luxury of having another report left to gather dust.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Unemployment in the mid-west region stands at 13.8%, some 1% above the national rate, while in Clare it rose by 121% in the past two years.  The most concerning fact is that the number of under-25s on the dole queues has jumped by a staggering 142.3%.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Dara Calleary, should visit the Shannon Free Zone where they will see many "For Sale" or "For Lease" signs on business premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Shannon Airport is the key driver for economic growth in the region but it is facing the most difficult period in its history.  It is a crisis that has not been helped by the Government.  Ryanair is axing 18 routes out of the airport which had been a boost to tourism over the past five years.  This is because the Government has imposed a €10 travel tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I am also concerned about Aer Lingus's operations in the region, particularly after the investors' day meeting in London on Monday last when the airline's chief executive officer, Christoph Mueller, said Dublin provides a natural advantage for long-haul expansion westbound.  That tells me Aer Lingus is not interested in Shannon Airport or transatlantic business out of it, raising questions about its commitment to the region.  While I accept the airline is going through a crisis, the Government should use its shareholding in the company to influence the airline's policy direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In last night's state of the union address, the US President, Mr. Obama, focused on job creation policy.  He said his administration could slash tax breaks for companies that shop jobs overseas.  This would have consequences for the 65 US multinational companies employing thousands in the mid-west region.  It could be another factor in the death knell for the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I do not want to be just negative.  Last July, on the aviation preclearance legislation, I referred to the Lynx cargo project in which the company is willing to invest €12 million in the region.  While the Dublin Airport Authority will need to spend €7 million on the project, the money has not been forthcoming.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said she supports the project.  If she does, then she should put her money where her mouth is to ensure the Dublin Airport Authority finances the project.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_560">It is what the region will need.  Companies in the region will be producing medical devices and refrigerated units, yet the Government has turned a blind eye to the Lynx project which would assist in exporting these products.  As well as cargo preclearance, we need full preclearance for the corporate jet sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">The Dublin Airport Authority is spending €1.2 billion on the development of its second terminal at Dublin Airport.  Last week's <i>Sunday Independent</i> reported that the authority spent €850,000 on consultants to advise the Minister which company should operate T2.  Surely some of that money we need for job creation in the mid-west could be diverted to Shannon Airport.  Will the Minister of State give this authority money to the mid-west?</p>
          <p eId="para_562">Our region will die unless the Government gets involved.  Over 50 years ago, the late Dr. Brendan O'Regan came knocking on the Government's door for money to support his initiatives in Shannon Airport and the region.  Today, Mr. Denis Brosnan is knocking on the door seeking support for his recommendations but, unfortunately, the Government is silent on the issue.  We want action quickly.  The buck lies with the Minister of State and his Government colleagues.  I urge them to stand up and deliver on these task force recommendations instead of leaving them on the shelf gathering dust.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnCreganFF" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_563">I welcome the opportunity to make some contributions to this important segment in today's business.  Like other Members, I had the opportunity to be briefed by Mr. Denis Brosnan and other members of the task force in Limerick last Friday.  I commend them on their tremendous work and the service they are doing for the region and the country at great inconvenience to themselves.  Other Members referred to the priorities that Mr. Brosnan asked us to highlight such as the Lynx cargo hub project.  We all recognise the importance of this project to Shannon Airport.  Fortunately, the newly appointed chairman of the Shannon Airport Authority, Mr. Brian O'Connell, was present at the briefing and he also pointed out the economic boost the project could be to the airport and region.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">However, when a Government is asked to support an airport it can raise difficulties.  We are all aware of how careful the Government must be in terms of the provision of State aid.  I welcome that the Tánaiste in her speech referred to this matter in a positive manner and that the Government, Dublin Airport Authority and Department of Transport are examining ways of supporting it.  I believe it will be beneficial to the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">Mr. Brosnan also raised the issue of the development of a technological park, which is practical and can be done quickly.  I refer again to the Tánaiste's remarks in this regard.  She stated: "In relation to the National Technological Park in Limerick, it has appointed consultants to audit the existing infrastructure and to carry out preliminary design work on appropriate layouts, budgets, estimates and timelines for the further development of the NTP into a more strategic site for the attraction of industrial investment from Irish and foreign companies."  In my humble estimation, that is action.  The matter is being dealt with.  Rather than being negative, Members should acknowledge that the Lynx and technological park projects are being examined and supported.  I welcome the Tánaiste's comments in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">Mention was made by Mr. Brosnan and previous speakers of the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.  I encourage these three organisations to in the strongest possible terms continue to prioritise the mid-west region in terms of its need for jobs in the months and years ahead.  Deputy Dooley referred in his contribution to the number of visits  last year from potential overseas investors.  While many of them have decided not to invest in the region, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland have a job to do and must continue to attract investors to the region and to sell the region to them.  We must ensure we have in place the critical infrastructure necessary to win that investment.  It is hoped we will do so in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Another point worth mentioning is the back to education schemes.  Applicants wishing to return to education are experiencing difficulties owing to the embargo in the teaching profession and public sector generally.  Perhaps when globalisation fund moneys are being disbursed this matter could be re-examined in the context of assisting the mid-west region.  It is critical people have access to education, in particular Dell workers, many of whom are interested in going that route.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I welcome that the Government has secured €22 million from the European globalisation fund.  This funding will soon be disbursed to organisations to assist people who have lost their jobs.  The closure of Dell was a huge blow to the region.  Many other industrial jobs have been lost subsequent to the closure of Dell.  As regards the Dell workers, I believe these people are county enterprise board type clients.  However, the criteria within which the county enterprise boards must work needs to be changed.  I recently spoke to Mr. Ned Twomey, the CEO of the county enterprise board in Limerick who agreed with me when I pointed out that many of the people who are losing their jobs will be inclined to get into small service-type industries such as hairdressing, small garages and so on.  We need to support these people.  The criteria currently laid down for county enterprise boards is too rigid and should be changed.  I asked Mr. Twomey to contact the other agencies to see if they could come up with practical ways these people can be helped.  People want practical support on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I ask the Tánaiste to take into account, in the critical weeks ahead in terms of the disbursement of funding from the European globalisation fund, the following suggestions.  Support could be provided through feasibility study reports in respect of which normal feasibility rules would apply, the rate of support would be 80%, balanced by individuals' own time and by allowing people to retain their back to work allowance.  I accept the prior agreement of the Department of Social and Family Affairs would be required in this regard.  In terms of priming grants under the European globalisation fund, EGF, a special category should be established for Dell and other workers in relation to providing aid for self employment or entrepreneurial activity.  This is in keeping with the EGF regulations which state that the EGF should provide specific, one off support to facilitate the reintegration into employment of workers in areas, sectors, territories or labour market regions suffering the shock of serious economic disruption.  This may include out-placement assistance and entrepreneurship promotion and aid for self employment.  This proposal should be considered.  An employment subsidy targeting eligible European globalisation fund participants and paid to employers who employ and retain an eligible participant for 12 months could be introduced.  There are many ways we can offer practical help to workers on the ground, including loosening some of the regulation and removing some of the red tape.  This is a critical time for the mid-west region and for those who have lost their jobs.  We should not be tying ourselves up in knots with red tape, stringent regulation.  We must allow agencies the discretion to offer practical support on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">Other suggestions include an interest-free loan of up to €25,000 per applicant repayable over five years with a 12 month moratorium on repayments, the purpose of which would be to promote entrepreneurship and business creation.  A mentor could be appointed as a condition of the loan.  Conditions as apply in the new county enterprise board micro-credit proposal enterprise loan fund could also be applied.  These are ways through which we can provide practical help and support to people.  I appeal to the Tánaiste to examine these suggestions.  I believe county enterprise boards can be effective.  Many of the people losing their jobs are typical county enterprise board clients who need help.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">Mr. Brosnan asked that representatives of the mid-west region — all Deputies and Senators present that day agreed with this — work together to support the region, which is exactly what we should be doing.  I see no benefit in launching a personal attack on the Tánaiste who has been accused of not being honest and fair with the people of Limerick.  It was also stated that her speech was bluff, which is not helpful.  We must be positive and proactive and support our region.  We can do so by refraining from making these type of comments and remarks.  I am not here today trying to score political points or make political charges.  I have come here in good faith as a messenger to the Dáil, sent this week by Mr. Brosnan with a clear message for Government, namely, that he needs assistance in regard to three or four suggestions.  The Tánaiste addressed those issues during her speech.  We should respect that and should continue in our efforts in our constituencies.  We must work together and be proactive to ensure we obtain the best possible results for our people in the shortest period.</p>

          <p eId="para_574">I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate this afternoon.  This is a critical debate for all parts of the mid-west region, including my constituency of north Kerry and west Limerick.  Mr. Brosnan brought home to us the reality of the situation last Friday.  He took the unprecedented measure of calling politicians from all parties together and appealed to us to help him.  The task force report provides us with two advantages starting out.  First, we have someone of the calibre of Mr. Denis Brosnan, whose record in terms of the development of one of the biggest food companies in the world, certainly in Ireland, we all know.  He developed that from a greenfield site from humble beginnings in Listowel in north Kerry.  He has a proven track record and the Government did well to get him to chair this task force.</p>
          <p eId="para_575">However, Mr. Brosnan is obviously a man who is disillusioned at present because of the lack of action.  He is a type of individual who likes to contribute but does not like to waste his time, and if he is taken for granted and is not being listened to, then he is someone who does not walk away from a task he is given but who will not stay around much longer if there is no interest from the Government in his recommendations.  Mr. Brosnan pointed out to my party quite clearly that it is over six months since the report was sent to Government and there has been no action that he can see in implementing any of the 20 recommendations of the report.  I am sure there are a few recommendations in this report that could be implemented immediately, just to keep the task force alive.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">The figure Mr. Brosnan gave to us that struck home was that the numbers signing on in the mid-west region has increased by almost 150% since December 2007.  Apart from Dell, there are jobs being lost across the region.  This must be of concern to the Minister.  Mr. Brosnan asked us for political support.  I say this to the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, if I can get his attention, he is obviously not interested in this debate.  Minister O'Dea, could I just——</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_579">Mr. Brosnan asked for political support, and could I say how it should start?  The Minister, Deputy O'Dea, should chair a small sub-committee of the type used by the Government on a regular basis.  Its membership should include the line Ministers including, especially, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  It would also concern the Taoiseach because of his interest in the mid-west region.  At local level, if one wants political support, with which I agree, both Deputy O'Dea, as the senior Minister in the area, and a former senior Minister, Deputy Noonan, should co-chair a group of politicians.  It is not that this will be the panacea to solve this problem, but Mr. Brosnan wants political support.  We can give it to him, but it must be co-ordinated.  It is an asset that we have Mr. Brosnan.  If we give him the necessary political support, I believe he will stay with it and we will see results.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">We have in the region a shining example of an agency that has done more for regional development than any other agency in this country, that is, Shannon Development, an organisation much maligned and criticised over the years and whose powers were taken away.  The Government took away the power of creating local indigenous enterprise and handed it over to Enterprise Ireland.  In the Kerry area, the dynamic which existed when Shannon Development had responsibility for local indigenous industrial development was far greater than it is at present.  The dynamic presence in the region has been reduced since it was set up by Dr. Brendan O'Regan.  This has been referred to.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelCoonan" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Deputy Noel J. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_583">Like the other speakers, I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on this.  I am coming from the perspective of a representative in the mid-west area, despite being from north Tipperary.  Often people forget that north Tipperary is very much part of the mid-west area.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">We are coming from a background where on 28 July last the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coughlan, launched the interim report of the mid-west task force.  At that launch, she stated she would waste no time in consulting with her colleagues with a view to evaluate, consider and implement the task force report.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Almost seven months later we, as Oireachtas Members, joined the chairman of the task force and the chairman of Shannon Development in Limerick to discuss the matter.  I listened in awe to the chairman of the task force, Mr. Brosnan, when he went on to outline his frustration, and that of the members of his board, with what was happening in the mid-west.  In no uncertain terms, he sounded the alarm bells, stating how desperate was the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I listened to Deputies here today state that we are scoring political points.  I listened to the eminent Mr. Brosnan, who stated, in no uncertain terms, that the State agencies and the Government had failed the people of the mid-west.  He went on to outline why.  He stated that they were crying out for an initiative from the Government to give hope and confidence to the people of the region by supporting at least three of the 20 projects that he outlined, those being the international cargo hub for Shannon Airport, Plassey Technological Park in Limerick and the governance of Limerick city.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Mr. Brosnon went on to express his alarm at the number of people who had lost their jobs in the mid-west — over 38,000.  We do not blame the Tánaiste.  It goes back over the ten years of the Celtic tiger, when the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, and his colleagues totally abandoned the mid-west region and did not put the necessary development into it.  Mr. Brosnan outlined that.  He went as far as to say that if those involved in the relevant State agencies were members of the Kerry Group, of which he was an eminent chief executive, they would be long gone.  Those are startling words to come from any chairman of a task force who was appointed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Mr. Brosnan went on to state that the situation was getting worse, we cannot continue to wait, the people of Limerick and of the mid-west region need jobs, and if we do not get jobs, the crime and the social deprivation will increase and reach enormous proportions in Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The chairman put it up to the Minister, Deputy O'Dea.  This is not my quote, but I will remind him of what was said, that it is time that he, as figurehead Minister in the mid-west, behaved like Mighty Mouse in Dublin, not Mickey Mouse as happened.</p>

Today, the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is in Templemore living it up.  I presume he is there, if he had the nerve to visit the place.

          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_618">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic.  At present I represent a constituency from a neighbouring western region, but I am familiar with Limerick, in particular.  It is the city in which I was born and where my father spent most of his working life.  It is important that we are positive in responding to the interim report of the task force.  I wish to be positive in what I have to suggest.  The report highlights the deficiencies generally in respect of regional thinking.  It is impossible to deal with the matter in detail in ten minutes but I wish to make one or two points I believe are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">It is impossible to develop a strategy that one can effect quickly for any one region without considering its connection with other regions.  Most people who write reports on regional policy generally use a title such as "towards a policy for the regions".  I refer to one illustration of this, that is, the recent report from the Dublin Institute of Technology on the development of a North-South corridor that would be located along the eastern side of the island.  It is in contradiction to the proposals made for the Atlantic Way.  It is also rather methodologically flawed and ignores some fundamentals in respect of regional thinking.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">It is best if I make matters plain.  If one has undeveloped resources in one region, they sometimes co-exist with urban dis-economies in another region.  If one analyses them clearly, the history of these two documents shows there has been significant urban dis-economies in the greater Dublin area.  This has led to an overspill in respect of housing and transport and much other unsustainable activity in the adjoining counties to Dublin.  The new North-South corridor, as proposed by DIT, would be both impractical and unsustainable, apart from the fact that it challenges the assumptions in the Atlantic Way.  This is a matter on which there are further opportunities to speak.  There is an unfortunate distinction in the report between the members of the task force and the stakeholders.  It is also somewhat regrettable that some of the unsubstantiated assumptions of some of the task force have fed in to the report.  A rather casual engagement has taken place with the real interests of stakeholders, for example, the workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I will be specific now, which is necessary in a ten minute speech.  In response to this interim report, one could arrive at one general conclusion, that is, the importance of the retention and creation of employment and the provision of opportunities for those who have been made unemployed involuntarily.  This is surely a central matter and I find it very difficult to understand why innovative strategies have not been taken.  I refer to the particular example of when Digital closed in Galway.  I was a member of Cabinet at the time and Dr. Mike Cooley carried out a skills audit on the workforce of Digital.  This led to the successful establishment of several new companies by people who had worked in that computer sector and who brought new businesses into existence, such as one involving the weighing of cattle and other such developments.  These were small clusters of new opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">It is very important to realise the impact of Mike Cooley's work.  It included the grouping of worker skills and new skills, and the creation of new enterprises was invaluable.  It would have been useful if he had been brought in to examine what was possible for the Dell employees.  People may say something like this has been attempted already.  So be it.  I am acquainted with Dr. Cooley, who is from Tuam.  He has spent a good deal of his lifetime as an expert in such areas as the development of special equipment necessary for disabled people, and this is his current interest.  This is the type of positive suggestion I wish to offer.  I believe his contribution could be a good deal more practical than some of the people who I have identified in the task force from the public statements as those who beat a very old, battered drum.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">It is nonsense to suggest that if one reduces the spending power of people in the region generally, one will somehow have made a contribution to overall economic recovery or development.  This obsession is unfortunate and is something of a latter day fall-out from an old version of economic thinking.  The suggestion is that if one interfered with the minimum wage and those on low income, one would automatically have done something of benefit.  It would be far better to consider the number of graduates emerging from the higher level colleges in the region.  They are available for a series of internships and short-term employments as part of the generation of new opportunities in tourism.  Given its demography, the region is full of opportunities in the caring economy.  Ireland, at its highest point of net income earned, was second from the bottom in Europe in terms of social protection.  One could emerge with a new economy, with social protection enhanced and useful social and caring skills recognised as employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">Others will take the opportunities that exist in respect of the green economy and other opportunities.  As president of the Labour Party, I am disappointed with the response to some of our very practical proposals in the party's document entitled Jobs and Recovery.  The proposal was issued prior to the budget.  This is not simply a partisan view.  Limerick and the entire region has many opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">In analysing the interim report and the Government's response, I failed to see an acceptance of the importance of connectivity between various agencies.  We should all draw breath and consider what we are trying to create by way of a new start towards genuine regional thinking.  This should be something entirely new.  If there is simply a rehearsal of what everyone has done descriptively within the various agencies, it does not constitute a platform for a new departure.  Recently, I visited Limerick and spoke at the university and I noted that regeneration is a crucial part of the recovery and that there must be a new approach towards skills.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">People live in a particular space and that space is not disconnected from the overall quality of life in the region.  Let us consider the European model.  No city recovers without a new connection to its hinterland.  I recall working in the first factories created in the Shannon development area and I travelled in from Newmarket-on-Fergus.  I took part in a debate with Pat McNabb.  He had a choice to make on whether Shannon town should be redeveloped as a new town or whether all the villages in the hinterland should be developed.  There is some connectivity but I do not see it between the authorities, which carry the burden of a fairly authoritarian managerial system.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">I acknowledge what is in the interim report in respect of governance.  However, one wonders whether the capacity for a new start exists.  I refer to what is possible with Limerick.  I took the decision to move the chamber orchestra to Limerick and I am aware of what is possible in the university there.  A connection between the University of Limerick and its hinterland and NUI Galway and its hinterland is immensely rich in opportunities in the creative industries, whether in film, music or the various visual arts.  There is enormous advantage to having airport access and being easily able to relate to the international community.  I wish that could happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">In regard to what I heard in the announcements, what is in the interim report and what to do if one wants to drive this on, I have two quick points to make.  There is immense benefit in seeking to purchase patents, technologies and forms of research and development and putting them into a common pool to which people would have access to develop new kinds of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">Something pathetic, which this House must stop, is underfunded VECs.  Vocational education committees all over the country wish to provide courses for people who want to go back to education.  They are, however, not able to do so because of the staffing cap.  We should take a decision today that where people want to get back to education at several different levels, the cap on recruitment of teachers, which would make that possible, must be eliminated.  That is relevant not only to Limerick and that region but to every other region in the country.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCarey" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_630">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I have raised this matter on a number of occasions by way of Adjournment debate and parliamentary questions and I welcome the fact the Government has provided time to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">Strong regions are a basis for a strong country.  It is in the interest of every citizen in this country that the mid west is allowed to realise its undoubted potential.  Balanced regional development must be much more than a catchphrase.  We need proper, sustained investment in the mid-west region.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The mid-west task force was established February 2009 by the Tánaiste to consider and make recommendations to address the serious economic downturn experienced in Counties Clare and Limerick and in north Tipperary.  Last Friday I attended a meeting called by the chairman of the task force, Mr. Denis Brosnan.  He chose to go public with his frustration at the lack of response to the report shown by Government to date.  The 20 recommendations contained in the report are clear, concise and unambiguous.  The key conclusions, along with the thought process, as presented in his interim report, reflect the difference between one of our most successful businessmen and the manner in which the Government works.  The interim report has been sitting on the desk of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment since last July with no work done on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">We have reached a critical stage in our region — a stage when the Government's attitude needs to change.  That is the stated position of Denis Brosnan, the chairman of the task force.  He said that at the meeting and publicly afterwards.  The interim report could not be more simple in the manner in which it is presented.  It consists of an executive summary with 20 recommendations, which require implementation.  This report and the recommendations were put together to be implemented.  They cannot be ignored.  The report also contains eight key issues to be addressed in the final report along with eight chapters explaining how the task force came to its conclusions.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The report points to a litany of systematic neglect of the region by Government.  The facts speak for themselves.  Net employment in enterprise supported by State agencies dropped by 17% in the mid-west region in 2009 as opposed to 11% in other regions.  There has been a 12% year on year decline in passenger numbers through Shannon Airport in 2008 and 2009 with the same expected in 2010, although it probably will be much worse.  Unemployment in the mid west, from a percentage point of view, is higher than in other regions.  Unemployment is more than 1% higher in the mid west as compared to the national figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The report also highlighted an acute problem developing in regard to unemployment among the under 25s.  More than 7,000 people under the age of 25 are unemployed in the mid-west region.  Tourism, which is a major industry in the mid-west region, is in rapid decline, as was pointed out in the report.  This is just a flavour of the downward spiral of the economy of the mid-west region.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">In his presentation last Friday, Denis Brosnan was direct in his conclusions.  He informed the Oireachtas Members that if no action was taken on implementing his report, we would have a generation of unemployed people who should be encouraged to emigrate because we will not be able to cater for them.  That is a damning indictment of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">This Government is propped up by a considerable number of Deputies who put their political party first instead of their region.  One of the more high profile members of Cabinet, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O'Dea, represents the region, supposedly backed up by a cohort of junior Ministers.  It is time backbenchers and junior and senior Ministers stood up and said the mid-west region counts, deserves investment and that they will not stand for this report being left on a shelf <i>ad infinitum</i> with none of the recommendations implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">A man of the calibre of Denis Brosnan said he is being blatantly ignored by Government.  That is not acceptable.  It is up to political leaders in this country to step up to the plate and ensure the recommendations are implemented.  I would say to Government party members that if the recommendations are not implemented in a timely fashion to withdraw their support for the Government, which depends on their support at every vote.  They are only propping up the Government if they do not insist on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">In regard to the key recommendations put forward, it is essential that the €5 million to €7 million required to establish the Lynx cargo facility at Shannon Airport is provided immediately.  This investment would bring about a project that has potential to bring back life to Shannon Airport and the region.  A state of the art international cargo facility at Shannon Airport would provide substantial employment during the construction phase in the short term and would be a major asset and employer in the long term.  Such a facility, as the report outlines, would be a catalyst for new manufacturing and logistics investment in the region which would be further enhanced if the customs and border facility at Shannon Airport was extended to cargo.  The realisation of this project is a must for Shannon Airport and the mid-west region.  This project has endless potential and requires a mere investment of €5 million to €7 million.  The Government must get on with the job and make that investment of €5 million to €7 million.  It must do that in order to get the facility up and running.  That could be done this evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_644">Priority needs to be given to job creation.  Few new industrial jobs have been created in the region in the past three years by the various State agencies.  I agree with the recommendation put forward that a high-powered mid-west response unit should be established to address the region's alarming unemployment problem.  A temporary derogation to permit Objective One status should be sought to encourage and to stimulate foreign direct investment in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">One of the statements made by Denis Brosnan was that doing nothing is not an option.  Doing nothing has been the <i> modus operandi </i>of this Government but that is no longer an option.  Let today’s debate be a kick-start for the recovery of the mid-west region.  Let today mark the start of a determined effort by Government to stop the haemorrhage of jobs.  Let it also be the day Government commits to implementing the recommendations of this report as a means of helping the mid west to realise its full potential.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_646">I too welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  With my colleagues, I attended the meeting on 22 January with Denis Brosnan and some of his team.  I agree with everybody who attended the meeting that he was very dejected.  He was almost depressed by the lack of action because his group had put in a lot of work.  I have seen members of the task force, who are eminent people.  Bringing them together and deciding who should be on the task force was a very positive beginning to the regeneration and improvement of the mid-west.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Mr. Brosnan spoke at length regarding job losses in the region and referred to net employment and enterprise supported by State agencies such as IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development.  Jobs supported by those organisations dropped by 17% in 2009 and fewer than 1,000 new jobs were created in the region by the IDA from 2006 to 2008.  People have spoken of the impact Dell had on the region.  While many people think of it as a city employer, it employed an enormous number of people from County Limerick, which was severely hit by the closure.  In referring to the State agencies, I am trying to think when they last created a job in Limerick or west Limerick.  I cannot remember when they did; we know they supported industries which have folded over the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I accept the Rahine Industrial Estate is of help and provides employment to the people of Limerick, but we also need employment creation in places like Newcastle West, Kilmallock and Foynes.  There is a marvellous opportunity to create marine industry and employment in Foynes.  This is not a new idea; ten years ago we discussed creating marine employment and industry in Foynes because it has the potential to develop a port and other types of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">Many referred to Shannon Airport.  The task force saw this as one of the keys to the future of the region.  Mr. Brosnan pointed out there was a 12% decline in passenger numbers in 2008 and the 2009 decline was of the same magnitude.  Further decline is anticipated in 2010.  It is necessary to reverse that.  One of the keys to reverse it is to support the Link project to provide funding for the necessary infrastructure to enable it to proceed.  Mr. Brosnon pointed out that this could be the key to the future development not just of Shannon Airport but the whole mid-west region.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">There is concern that from April only one Ryanair plane will be based in Shannon.  The plans for Aer Lingus are unclear and there is a lot of concern about its continued support for Shannon.  It was pointed out to us that other US carriers are also pulling out.  People were quite concerned that the Dublin Airport Authority, which was in competition with Shannon during the development of the aviation industry, did not support the development of Shannon.  The Minister of State might examine the issue.  I do not know what the solution is, but the point was made that the DAA is a hindrance to the development of Shannon Airport and to stopping its decline.  I cannot give the Minister of State the solution but he might examine the relationships between the DAA and Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The cargo hub link is vital.  If the Minister of State announced it today, it would be supported.  It costs €7 million.  He should think of what he had to pay out for the flooding and the big freeze, which was not enough.  A sum of €7 million is small compared to those immediate actions, which were unexpected.  This is planned and the benefit is obvious.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">On tourism, it was pointed out there was a 3% decrease in visitor numbers in 2009, which will increase to 15%.  If the services in Shannon are being reduced, it will have an impact on our tourism business.  I will mix infrastructure and tourism, but I want to raise the issue of Adare, which has a very good tourism product, but could be improved immensely if a bypass was built.  If one stands at the Dunraven Arms most days and looks down towards the road, all one will see are trucks and cars.  I went to take a photograph there a number of years ago at 11 a.m. and I had to go away.  One could not take a photograph of the village as all the cars and heavy traffic destroyed it — I took it at 7 o'clock one morning as there was less traffic.  It would be of enormous benefit to the region.  It is 25 years since the first line was drawn for the bypass of Adare and four have been drawn since then.  I often felt like researching the cost in terms of drawing four different lines for the route for the Adare bypass.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The tourism and economic development plan funding which the task force sought was €53 million, of which €6 million has been provided to date.  The Minister of State might address that in his closing remarks.  A major spend was requested in the Irish market for holidays in the mid-west campaign, which should be completed by Shannon Development and Fáilte Ireland.  It is urgently required due to the expected difficulties as a result of the reduction in passenger numbers in Shannon.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The mid-west has the potential to create much more employment in tourism.  It was pointed out to us that the cost structure for the tourism product must be examined to ensure it is competitive.  We must make sure we are very strong in ensuring the cost base, especially energy, for the tourist product in the mid west is addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">It was pointed out that funding for enterprises, in particular small enterprises, was restricted which caused job losses and resulted in new ones not being created.  It was suggested that a regional venture capital fund be established to provide seed capital to entrepreneurs to create jobs in indigenous start-ups.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">My final point concerns the western rail corridor.  It must not move down the list of priorities in terms of any reduction in capital funding made in our infrastructure policy because it would have enormous benefits for the mid-west and Limerick.  It would also aid the construction of the Adare bypass.  I look forward to the Minister of State's contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">I listened with interest to Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Dan Neville.  Both Deputies made constructive contributions, most of which I agree with.  Contrary to the impression given, however, a great deal has been done since the interim report was produced and considerable work continues to be done behind the scenes.  For example, one of the recommendations in the interim report was that action be taken to address the boundaries of Limerick.  The Government has made a commitment to establish an independent commission to determine whether the current local authority structure for Limerick city, Limerick county and County Clare is adequate and suitable for purpose.  The commission will be established shortly and will be given a limited timescale within which to report.  I cannot anticipate what it will recommend.  While some of its recommendations may not suit Deputies Joe Carey, Dan Neville or me, the commission will be independent and will have a specific mandate to identify what is best for the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">On the proposal regarding cargo, a great deal of work is being done behind the scenes in this matter and an announcement is imminent.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">It will not be made today but it is due shortly.  Significant work is also being done behind the scenes on the industrial park.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The globalisation fund was negotiated with the European Commission by the Government, not by Alan Kelly, MEP, or any other MEP.  The Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, will visit Limerick on Monday to explain how the process will work in practice.  Everyone in the mid west is welcome to attend the meeting, which I also hope to attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The Government also put in place the regeneration process and has spent a substantial amount on regeneration.  While much remains to be achieved, progress has been made in terms of stability in the areas in question.  For example, one of the primary recommendations of the regeneration report was to provide an additional 100 gardaí in the areas in question.  This recommendation has been implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">As I stated, a significant amount of money has been spent, although I am not entirely satisfied it has been spent to best effect.  I am reliably informed that substantial private investment is available and investors are interested in becoming involved in the regeneration programme.  We need to set a target in the near future for attracting this investment.  With this objective in mind, I have called a meeting with all the principal parties for next Tuesday.  I await the outcome of the meeting with interest because there is significant potential for employment creation if the regeneration proceeds with an infusion of private capital.</p>

No Member has a patent or copyright on understanding the difficulties unemployment causes to families and communities.

The Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, outlined some of the responses to the recommendations, noting that action is being taken in Limerick.  We must also consider this issue against the backdrop of international developments, rising unemployment and difficulties in securing foreign direct investment.  The IDA is proactively chasing foreign direct investment.  We must first secure investment and then ensure regional balance by directing such investment to areas where deficiencies exist.  I repudiate the criticism levelled at the IDA.  As anyone who examines what the agency is trying to achieve will understand, it is working in a very difficult international environment.</p>

The fund is a positive step and an acknowledgement by the European Union of the difficulties created by globalisation, its impact on employment and the problems that flow from it.  It should be noted that moneys from the fund are not paid directly to individuals but used to provide training programmes.  I am reliably informed that every person affected will be interviewed to identify his or her needs in terms of training programmes, skill sets and so forth.</p>

          <p eId="para_721">I welcome this debate today on a package of EU legislative proposals which will have wide-ranging implications for the system of financial regulation both within Ireland and at European level.  The Joint Committee on European Scrutiny recognised the importance of these proposals, which form one of the EU's main responses to the global financial crisis.  This crisis has had a terrible effect on the livelihoods of many in Ireland and throughout the Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">The committee, therefore, scrutinised the proposals in detail and held a public hearing with the main stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, the Office of the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank, the Irish Banking Federation, Financial Services Ireland and the Irish Stock Exchange.  We also received a detailed submission from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I would like to thank all those who contributed to the preparation of the committee's report and, in particular, the Department of Finance for its ongoing assistance with the work of the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The main purpose of the committee's report is to inform the Minister's position on these important set of proposals in the Council of the European Union.  Unfortunately, it was not possible for the committee to consider these proposals in detail before the Council came to its position.  Progress on this package of legislative proposals has been swift by EU standards.  The Council's aim is now to reach agreement on the proposals with the European Parliament by the end of its first reading which will probably be completed in May or June this year.  Although I acknowledge the urgency of the situation in respect of the financial crisis and the need to restore confidence in the financial markets with a view to providing credit to the real economy, I am concerned that these very important proposals are being rushed.  More often than not, rushed legislation leads to poor legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The lack of proper scrutiny by the national parliaments may result in unintended consequences.  We must be careful that the proposals do not have a negative impact, however unintentional, on the competitiveness of financial services, especially on smaller and niche activities which are the life blood of a small market like Ireland.  I am confident that our MEPs will ensure that these proposals are subjected to the full rigours of the European Parliament's scrutiny process and that the interests of smaller member states like Ireland are taken fully into account.  I hope that the committee's report will assist them in this important job.  I also urge the European Parliament to organise a joint parliamentary meting with the national parliaments to discuss this package of legislative proposals before it completes its First Reading.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Notwithstanding this concern, there are many aspects of these proposals which should be welcomed.  One of the key failings leading to the financial crisis was that while key macro-prudential risks in the financial area were identified accurately and commented on in the various fora, there was no mechanism to ensure that these risk assessments were translated into corrective action.  That should be emphasised.  The establishment of a European systematic risks board, proposed in this draft legislation, should provide a mechanism to assess and address vulnerabilities at the level of the European financial system which can, as we have learned, have a knock-on effect on national financial systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">In addition, the micro-prudential co-ordination envisaged in the proposals for each of the proposed European supervisory authorities in the banking sector, the pensions and insurance sector and the market and securities sector should offer more robust regulation.  The powers of these new authorities will be extensive, up to and including issuing legally binding decisions to national regulators and even to individual financial institutions.  The proposals will enable the EU, through these new authorities, to act more swiftly and coherently in emergency situations and to intervene in the settlement of disputes which may emerge between national regulators.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">In addition, the authorities will be able to carry out peer reviews of national regulators.  This is critically important in light of what happened in this country, with light-touch regulation.  These peer reviews will cover issues such as the resource and governance arrangements of national regulators and will pay particular attention to the effective application of EU legislation and the capacity to respond to market developments.  I believe that this function should assist the Office of the Financial Regulator in performing its role more effectively and I hope it will ensure that the serious shortcomings evident in our system of regulation will never occur again.  It is to the dismay of so many people, who lost a great deal of money, that so much went on under light-touch regulation.  We now see the fall-out from that, even today, with the NAMA board and the lack of critical funding for small businesses.  Unfortunately, the system is not functioning correctly at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Probably one of the most important duties to be undertaken by the European supervisory authorities is the development of a common technical standard with a view to the preparation of a single, harmonised rule book for Europe.  This is critically important.  This should ensure the consistent, coherent and effective application of EU legislation in the area of financial regulation across the member states.  It should lead to a less fragmented approach to financial regulation as compared to the current approach which is nationally focused and does not reflect the globalised nature of our financial system.  We have been part of the European movement for 30 years but the situation whereby we had no coherent regulation should never to allowed to happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Globalisation is a reality but unfortunately this reality is not reflected in our financial regulatory system.  As a small open economy, Ireland has benefited immensely from globalisation but we have also felt more acutely the effects of the global financial crisis.  We need a globalised financial system to support a globalised trading environment but this requires that we have a matching regulatory system.  National governments were forced to take action in order to avoid a total meltdown of the financial system because there was no cross-border resolutions system to respond to crises in individual countries.  Therefore, it is very important that the reform of the EU's financial supervisory and regulatory structures, as proposed in this legislative package, is pursued in tandem with reforms in other parts of the world, in particular in the United States.  The EU must take a leading role in fora such as the G20 and the IMF in order to influence positively the direction of financial regulatory reforms.  This is also important from the perspective of preserving the EU's competitiveness which is critical in the area of financial services.  We should be careful not to run ahead of others, otherwise we might see financial institutions and, ultimately, jobs leaving the EU to other parts of the world where financial regulation is less stringent.  It is a very fine balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">While this package of proposals is to be generally welcomed, smaller member states like Ireland must remain vigilant, given the inevitable reduction in national autonomy and control.  While the committee is satisfied that EU action as proposed here is justified given that the day-to-day regulation of individual institutions will remain with the national regulators, it is concerned that the interests of countries the size of Ireland can sometimes be lost in the politics of national agendas and the focus on trade.  That is inevitable in initiatives of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I welcome the fact that national regulators and central banks will be represented on the main decision-making boards of the authorities and on the European systemic risk board.  The Office of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland must play an active role in these new bodies in order to ensure that the country's interests are not overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">To guard against any concern that the interests of particular member states would be given priority due to their size, the new bodies envisaged under these proposals must be fully independent and accountable.  They must be able to act without hindrance when they perceive a systemic risk building in a particular member state or institution.  If they consider that an institution is posing a threat, they must be able to say so, without fear or favour, and they must be in a position to take direct action.  They must also be accountable and open to scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I welcome the fact that the regulation establishing the European systemic risk board stipulates that it must report regularly to the European Parliament and the Council.  That is extremely important.  This obligation should also be extended to the European supervisory authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">There are concerns that the structures of the new bodies proposed under the legislative package are too unwieldy.  For example, the main decision-making body of the European systemic risk board will have 61 members.  The size and scale of the new structures may limit their ability to take quick and decisive action necessary during a crisis.  The European supervisory authorities may only serve to continue the fragmented nature of financial regulation in Europe, particularly in view of the fact that they will be divided across three sectors and will also have functions in common.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">An alternative proposal for delivering a more integrated and effective regulatory regime would be the establishment of a single European financial supervisory authority under the auspices of the European Central Bank.  This authority would have effective executive powers over banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions.  While such a structure must be careful to respect the core principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, it would appear to have some merits.  The committee is, therefore, of the view that such an alternative should be at least explored before finalising the structures as proposed in the legislative package.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">I wish to make a number of comments on specific aspects of the EU proposals.  I agree that the safeguard clause which will ensure that the decisions of the authorities will not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of the member states and which is contained in these proposals is necessary.  However, the committee is concerned that if this clause is invoked too often, it could reduce and weaken the effect of the authorities and, therefore, undermine the very purpose of the proposals.  It is important to guard against individual member states abusing this safeguard clause to protect their own national interests to the detriment of the EU's financial system, as a whole, or those of other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The committee welcomes the proposal relating to the establishment of stakeholder groups for each of the European supervisory authorities.  Given the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy and the burden it has imposed on all sectors of society, it is important that all sectors should have an opportunity to influence the systemically important areas of finance.  Supervision and regulation should not simply be left to the closed community of financial networks and experts.  Representatives of the public interest, such as the social partners, should be involved in the area of financial regulation, supervision and risk management.  The stakeholder groups offer an opportunity to cater for this and will also assist in keeping each of the authorities accountable for their actions or lack thereof.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">The committee welcomes the proposal to make the European Securities and Markets Authority responsible for the supervision of credit rating agencies.  This builds on the EU regulation adopted last April which obliges all such agencies operating in the EU to register and comply with a set of rules.  There is no doubt that credit rating agencies contributed significantly to the financial crisis.  Critically, they underestimated the risks posed by complex financial products.  The main credit rating agencies are profit-led companies, the revenue of which comes from the same financial institutions which seek to have these agencies rate their products.  Many of the products to which I refer were subsequently discovered to be toxic.  There is a damaging conflict of interest inherent in the work of these agencies.  In order to overcome this and ensure that the common good is reflected in the rating of financial products, it has been proposed that the EU should establish a public and independent, non-profit making credit rating agency.  This agency would be funded by the EU and would come under the supervision of its regulatory system.  The committee believes this proposal has its merits and should be explored further, either as part of this package of legislative proposals or as a separate initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The global financial crisis highlighted major shortcomings in the system of financial regulation at both EU and national level.  It has had a significant negative impact on the real economy and on the lives of every person living and working in our communities.  Reform is necessary.  Some argue that the reform proposed in this legislative package is not radical enough.  It is true to say that the proposed reforms are more evolutionary than revolutionary.  Some people are concerned that an evolutionary approach will only return Europe and the world to business as usual until the next major financial crisis.  We must be careful to guard against this because we can ill afford to deal with another financial crisis at some point in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">It remains to be seen whether the proposals contained in this package will be sufficient.  However, I am of the view that they offer a good starting point.  Above all, the reforms at national and EU level must seek to establish a regulatory architecture which will provide for a banking system that can deliver stable financing for the real economy and sustainable economic growth.  The aim of any reform must be to ensure that the mistakes of the past are not repeated and that our businesses and households, which are the driving force behind our economies, have access to credit and working capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">With this report, I hope the committee has offered an analysis and recommendations which will assist the Government and our MEPs in securing the best possible result for Ireland and its financial system.  The report and today's debate on it will also help to raise public awareness regarding this important legislation, which will have significant implications for Ireland's financial system and in turn the real economy.  It is vital that important EU legislation such as the proposal we are debating should be subjected to proper scrutiny by national parliaments.  Since 2002, our system of scrutiny has generally been positive in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Lisbon treaty offers real opportunities for national parliaments to become involved in EU law making.  It is essential that this House should take full advantage of those opportunities.  I strongly believe that greater involvement on the part of the Oireachtas and the holding of further debates of this nature in the Dáil will make for better, more understandable EU law that reflects the interests and needs of the Irish public.</p>

        <speech by="#DrMartinMansergh" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_743">On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I welcome the opportunity to debate the proposals put forward by the European Commission and the report thereon by the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, details relating to which were very ably outlined by Deputy Perry.  I thank the committee for its report, which, drawing on the lessons learned from the banking crisis, clearly highlights the importance of these measures for strengthening the supervisory framework for financial regulation in the EU.  In overall terms, as described in the committee's report, the proposals aim to put in place an EU supervisory structure for financial services which will be significantly enhanced and better able to meet the challenges of effectively regulating and maintaining the stability of the single market in financial services in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Commission's proposals are a direct response to the report of the high level group on financial supervision in the EU — the so-called de Larosière report — which was published on 25 February 2009.  This report made significant recommendations on the future direction of financial regulation in the EU in light of the global financial crisis.  In June 2009, the European Council invited the European Commission to make proposals based on the recommendations set down in the report.  This suite of five proposals, which were published on 25 September 2009, represents the Commission's response to the European Council's invitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">These legislative proposals have the objective of creating a strong, robust and more uniform EU-wide system of financial supervision by developing a single rule book for financial regulation and securing better co-operation between the national supervisors in respect of the oversight and supervision of large, complex cross-border financial groups.  For the benefit of the House, the proposals envisage the establishment of a European systemic risk board, ESRB, to monitor and assess risks to the stability of the financial system as a whole — what is referred to as "macro-prudential supervision" — and to provide early warning of systemic risks that may be building up in the financial system and, where necessary, recommendations for action to deal with these risks; and a European system of financial supervisors, ESFS, for the supervision of individual financial institutions — what is referred to as "micro-prudential supervision" — consisting of a network of national financial supervisors working in tandem with the new European supervisory authorities, namely, a European banking authority, EBA, a European securities and markets authority, ESMA, and a European insurance and occupational pensions authority, EIOPA, which will be created by the transformation of the existing committees for the banking, securities and insurance and occupational pensions sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The establishment of the European systemic risk board will address what has been identified as a major priority in the strengthening of financial regulation internationally, by ensuring that there is a strong focus on the stability of the overall financial system alongside closely monitoring the soundness of individual financial institutions.  The creation of the ESRB is in line with several international initiatives that have been put in place for this purpose, including the creation of the Financial Stability Board by the G20 countries.  The heads of the European Central Bank, national central banks, the European supervisory authorities, as well as national regulatory bodies will participate in the European systemic risk board.  To achieve its role, the ESRB will have the power to issue non-binding recommendations and warnings to member states, including the national supervisors, and to the European supervisory authorities, the response to which will be closely scrutinised by a "comply or explain" mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">With regard to the proposed European system of financial supervisors, ESFS, the three authorities will take over all of the functions of the three existing EU committees of national supervisors for banking, securities and insurance which currently have advisory powers and aim to foster supervisory convergence, best practice and the convergence of regulatory outcomes.  It is proposed that the new authorities will have significant additional competences, including resolving cases of disagreement between national supervisors where legislation requires them to co-operate or to agree; contributing to ensuring consistent application of technical Community rules through, for example, peer reviews, developing proposals for binding technical standards that respect better regulation principles, and a co-ordination role in emergency situations.  Furthermore, the European securities and markets authority will exercise direct supervisory powers for credit rating agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">As Deputies may be aware, all these issues were the subject of consultation with key stakeholders in Ireland at the time of the publication of the de Larosière report and received largely positive feedback from stakeholders.  The Government has been a very positive supporter of these proposed reforms, and particularly welcomes the closer involvement of the European Central Bank, especially with regard to monitoring possible instances of systemic risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">A strong robust and credible framework for EU financial supervision will strongly underpin the Government's proposed reform to the existing legislative framework governing the structure of the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator.  The Minister for Finance will very shortly seek Government approval for the heads of a Bill to reflect these proposals.  The intention is to have this Bill enacted by Easter or shortly thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The Commission's proposals were agreed by EU Finance Ministers at ECOFIN meetings late last year, and were endorsed by the European Council of 10 and 11 December 2009.  This agreement at ECOFIN will form the basis for negotiations with the European Parliament as part of the co-decision process.  It is likely that the negotiations with the European Parliament will continue until the middle of this year.  The Commission plans to have the new regime in place by the start of 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I welcome that the joint committee's report strongly supported the broad thrust of the EU proposals, recognising the need for a step-change in the capacity of the current nationally-based supervisory systems to work in concert to address threats to financial stability in the EU overall which in the context of the operation of the Single Market often cannot be contained within national borders.  The committee's report does, however, raise some very important points on certain aspects of the proposals.  One of the most valuable relates to the speed at which the reforms are being introduced and in the context the risk of insufficient parliamentary scrutiny at national level, a matter mentioned in Deputy Perry's speech.  This assessment is clearly worthy of significant reflection.  These reforms will determine the future shape of financial regulation and financial supervision across all EU member states.  Ireland as a significant international centre for financial services in the EU has a particular interest in ensuring that the EU cross-border system works effectively and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The pace at which these detailed proposals have been developed and agreed stresses the priority afforded by all member states to responding to the serious weaknesses disclosed by the financial crisis in existing EU supervisory and regulatory arrangements.  The swift progress in advancing these reforms communicates a clear signal internationally that Europe is responding very actively and energetically, focusing on what is a major element of the very extensive programme of financial sector reforms identified by the G20.  This will help copper-fasten the reputation of the EU financial services on the international stage and has therefore a significant benefit for confidence in and the development of international financial services in Ireland.  It is important to stress that, notwithstanding the speed at which these proposals have moved forward, significant time and attention has been devoted in individual member states and at EU level to ensure that the package of measures is equipped to meet the challenging set of objectives they are designed to meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">As indicated earlier, work on finalising the proposals is now entering a new phase as the European Parliament commences its scrutiny of the Council's proposals and I would certainly expect — and all the indications are — that in line with the joint committee's recommendation the European Parliament is ready "to apply the full rigours of its scrutiny process to this legislative package".</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Clearly, as indicated in the committee's report, in ideal circumstances there would have been more opportunities for further parliamentary scrutiny at national level.  The urgency with which these proposals need to be progressed to underpin confidence in EU financial regulation has constrained what has been feasible.  However, accepting these constraints, it is important to stress that very substantial work has been carried out by our committee system — and in particular by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Scrutiny, as manifested in its report and the debate we are having today — to assess the Commission's proposals.  These proposals have now been examined by three Oireachtas joint committees — the Joint Committee on European Affairs, the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, as well, of course, as the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny.  This examination has helped contribute to Ireland's participation in the negotiations carried out at Council level.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">I also note what Deputy Joe Costello said on the Order of Business this morning with regard to scrutiny, following the implementation of the Lisbon treaty, of the transposition of the EU directives by way of statutory instrument with specific mention among others of the floods directive, which falls under my OPW responsibilities.  I noted, as he did, the broadly positive response of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">To revert to the immediate matter in hand, in terms of finalising the proposals, the ongoing negotiations between the European Parliament and the Council will determine the ultimate shape of the proposed new bodies and agreement by both institutions is required before the reforms can proceed.  Negotiations with the European Parliament will be conducted under the usual protocols for such discussions, whereby the Council as a whole, represented by the Presidency, at present Spain, discusses the proposal with the relevant European parliamentary committee.  We have given our full support to the Council position, and will continue to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">In reviewing the detailed content of the report's conclusions and recommendations there are two issues in particular that are important to comment on, and which the Chairman of the joint committee might consider as part of today's debate.  First, the report notes that the size of the proposed entities might be too unwieldy.  It is important to recall that the membership of the new bodies has been balanced in such a way as to protect the interests of all member states.  Indeed, the committee itself in its report recommends that the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator should play an active role in the new bodies in order to protect Irish interests — a recommendation the Government would strongly support.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">In another recommendation, it is suggested that the merits of a single European financial supervisory authority should be explored, before the proposed structures are finalised, but the following recommendation welcomes the fact that the principle of subsidiarity is being respected by means of the day-to-day supervision of individual firms remaining with national regulators.  If a single European regulator was established, under whatever title, it would inevitably lead to a diminution of national authority and would impact on the principle of subsidiarity.  This is a very significant issue to consider, but it is for another time in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The report also recommended that the possibility of establishing an EU-funded, public and independent, non-profit credit rating agency should be explored.  I remind the House that an EU regulation on credit rating agencies has been agreed, and will come into operation later this year on 7 December 2010.  This regulation will transform the way in which credit rating agencies operate in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">The proposal from the committee regarding the possibility of creating a publicly-funded rating agency has not been discussed by the Government.  However, in view of the imminent introduction of an EU-wide supervisory regime, there is unlikely to be much appetiteamong member states to examine this issue before the impact of the new regime has been assessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">In conclusion, the proposed new EU supervisory system is another important element in the EU's ongoing response to the international financial crisis.  These institutional changes are complemented by a broad range of important regulatory measures designed to address the main factors that contributed to the major disruption of the financial system.  They will require changes to the Irish regulatory structures and these are being addressed by the Government, and will be announced by the Minister for Finance in the period ahead.  I would like to conclude by expressing my thanks to the committee, Chairman and members for their report and I look forward to their contributions on this motion.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_762">I welcome the fact that we are having this debate in the House.  It is an extremely welcome development and I hope it is the precursor to similar debates in this fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">I commend the work of the Chairman and the committee regarding the scrutiny conducted on this particular item.  It has been very close scrutiny involving the large number of stakeholders, including the Department of Finance, the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank, the financial services sector, the Irish Banking Federation and the Irish Stock Exchange.  Unfortunately, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions was not included, but it gave a written submission and had some interesting proposals as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">What is significant about this matter being discussed in the Dáil Chamber is something the Minister of State referred to in the course of his contribution, namely, the fact that normally these matters are debated in committee, scrutinised there, referred perhaps to the relevant line Department for suggestions and witnesses brought in.  All this is done at a relatively early stage and it is then sent back to the Commission and is not seen again until it appears as a statutory instrument or is to be transposed into domestic law.  Literally years can go by so something very important may well be overlooked and we have to deal with it at a later date, but perhaps not adequately.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">In this particular case the situation is even worse.  We are now at the point of dealing with this very important package of proposals, but they will not come back to us when they leave this House today.  That is the end of it; there will be no statutory instrument or transposition.  These will be implemented directly in domestic law by regulation from the European Union.  They are going to the European Parliament and Council, and amendments will be made in tandem with discussions with the Commission, and that is the end of the matter.  We all agree that we have an important package of proposals before us, in the shape of the draft legislative reform of the EU's financial supervisory and regulatory framework, so it is important that we have good scrutiny and a good debate so that we know what we will end up with ultimately.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The background to this particular package is the one we have been dealing with for the past 18 months, namely, the global financial crisis and the fall-out from the light-touch regulatory system that was in operation right across the board in member states, including the Office of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank in Ireland.  Of course, the Irish financial institutions were singing merrily along, dishing out money without any respect for the guidelines.  The situation was similar throughout the European Union and, indeed, the globe.  If I have one crib with the European Union it is that, to some extent, the EU and its institutions — the Commission in particular — should have been more proactive because the Common Market existed even prior to Ireland joining the EEC.  The Single European Act created the Single Market.  The areas we are now discussing could have been dealt with in greater depth by the various EU institutions to provide an overarching framework that might have prevented some of these occurrences had matters been dealt with adequately ten years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">At this stage, the economies of so many countries have been damaged, ours more than most, by light-touch regulation and the absence of a proper supervisory and regulatory framework within Irish financial institutions, with nobody outside looking in to ensure that we behaved properly.  This is where these proposals come from and, as the Minister of State has indicated, it is largely the report of the committee chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière de Champfeu, a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund that is the backbone of the proposals we are examining.  We proposed amendments arising from the intense discussions we had, but essentially the bipartite proposals remain the same, operating on macro and micro levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">First, there is the idea that we put in place the European systemic risk board, ESRB, which would have macro-prudential oversight of the financial system, comprising the heads of national central banks and the heads of the new bodies that are about to be set up.  That overarching body would represent the European Union and its institutions as well as having representation from the member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The second body would involve more micro-prudential supervision, comprising a network of the member states with the three new supervisory authorities, the European banking authority, the European securities and markets authority and the European insurance and occupational pensions authority.  That body would look at more micro-level operations within the member states.  The two levels would be very valuable in ensuring that a proper framework is in place to conduct the business.  The role of the three new European supervisory authorities, ESAs, would be doing most of the work on the ground regarding rule making, enforcement, emergency powers, dispute resolution, peer review, market analysis and information, and would be accountable and transparent before the European Parliament and the European Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">As the Minister of State indicated, it is important in all of this that the principle of subsidiarity is not interfered with.  While the ESAs have binding powers, if they are seen to be an unwarranted charge on the Exchequer, then Ireland, or whatever government is charged with carrying out a particular act, may avoid doing it.  Thus, the principle of subsidiarity is not undermined and the whole area of fiscal responsibility remains with the Minister for Finance and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">There are, however, powers to issue warnings and make recommendations right across the board, both at the micro and systemic levels, and all that is extremely important.  There is a suggestion to the effect that we have a fairly cumbersome procedure in place and nobody really knows how it will work in practice.  To my mind, while the logic is impeccable and the theory fine, what about the practice?</p>
          <p eId="para_772">I believe the system will require regular review and I refer to a suggestion members made on foot of a discussion regarding another eminently logical proposal, namely, that there would be much merit in having a single European financial supervisory authority in place that would be headed by the European Central Bank.  However, although such an authority would be logical, functional and operational, the Minister has pointed out that it might interfere with the principle of subsidiarity by giving too many powers that are not appropriate to the European Union, which might give rise to a charge that something akin to a federal state was being created.  Nevertheless, this proposal should be examined with a view to its introduction, were this possible.  A simple system certainly would be the most desirable system.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">One proposal made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that has much merit is to consider the introduction of the Tobin tax, which is a proposal that has been talked about for many years.  I note that much time has been spent discussing what happened in the banking system and why.  However one central factor is that the financial systems globally, in the European Union and in Ireland let us down and abused their powers.  Some recompense and redress should be made to taxpayers, whose money is being thrown out like confetti at present as though a crock of gold was available to bail out this, bolster that and guarantee the other.  Why should a system not be put in place in respect of finance whereby the polluter pays?  The Tobin tax enables the imposition of a tax on each foreign financial transaction.  The world is full of such transactions every day given all the speculative transactions that take place, most of which are completely unnecessary but which are part and parcel of that complex arena of activity that takes place within the financial sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The ICTU document suggests that even were the current number of global transactions to fall by two thirds, in a single year the revenue accruing globally against the polluters would be approximately €423 billion.  This money could be put forward to address the damage that has been done by the irresponsibility of the banking and financial systems and could be useful for all sorts of desirable social projects.  This proposal should be considered by the global community.  While the participation of groups such as the G20 and the United States probably would be required, the European Union should take the lead in this regard because there is no sanction at present.  The bankers will go straight back to their old ways unless the regulatory framework is put in place with great care.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The other side of the coin is that much time has been spent in Ireland on activities such as bailing out, stabilising and guaranteeing the banks, as well as establishing NAMA to take up the toxic debts.  However, the same attention has not been given to the regulation of the banks.  I refer to institutions such as the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank, the banks themselves and their dysfunctional boardrooms.  Moreover, not enough thought has been given to what is taking place within the Irish Financial Services Centre.  A great number of transactions take place there and it is highly important for the country's economy.  This issue has been left to the European Union to do and it is doing so.  Consequently, this framework forms a major part of the patchwork quilt that must be put in place.  In addition, Ireland must reform its own internal institutions in the context of the principles laid out in this framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">As for the banking inquiry that has been announced, I am unsure whether it will deal with its business in the manner suggested by the Government.  However, we must get to the root of what happened, why and how it happened and why it was allowed to happen.  This must be done to ensure that the structures that are being put in place are meaningful and will prevent crises, the undermining of our economy, the destruction of jobs and of society in many ways, as well as the damage caused to the lives of many citizens.  These are serious issues and I hope the matter under discussion today will be one of the more desirable packages of proposals that will ensure a proper regulatory and supervisory framework with which to move forward in Ireland, the other member states and the European Union as a whole.</p>

This is very important as the committee's members form a small and tight group of people and I compliment its Chairman on his efforts in this regard.  I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to speak for a few minutes on the draft legislative package on reforming the European Union's financial supervisory and regulatory framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Like other Members, I am highly aware of the current situation and the global and international background to the financial crisis.  In much of the ongoing debate on this issue, the Opposition conveniently tends to forget that the international banking crisis caused some of the difficulty.  I imagine that were Fianna Fáil in opposition, its Members would do the same.  I note that Fianna Fáil was not in operation in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain and the United States of America.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">Members should consider the collapse of Lehman Brothers bank in 2008.  Obviously, this initially caused an extreme level of instability throughout the global financial sector.  It also created significant movements of deposits, both corporate and personal, around the world and triggered runs on many banks in various countries.  Ireland had its own domestic difficulties to deal with at that time, which coincided with the international financial crisis.  These obviously included the collapse of the construction sector and the collapse in tax receipts, as well as the consequential heavy job losses and the lack of confidence in the economy that now is evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Previous policy had resulted in a low tax economy.  While there has been much criticism in this regard, I note this is a young economy by world standards and as things had been going well during the previous ten years, people probably were hesitant to make changes as everyone had been enjoying the financial excesses.  However, the country now has an opportunity to correct all this and to go in a new direction.  I believe this is being done and the Government has been obliged to make extremely tough decisions.  While not all Members were very comfortable with such decisions, they had to be made in the interests of the future of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Everyone is aware of light-touch regulation, particularly in respect of the Irish banking system, which in hindsight caused much difficulty.  However, the Government has moved rapidly in this regard.  While I do not know whether other Members share my perception, it seems as though we have been in this crisis for ten years when in fact only a little more than 18 months have elapsed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Connick</from>
          <p eId="para_785">When one considers the scale of what happened and of what had to be dealt with, Ireland has done quite well.  On 20 September 2008, the statutory limit for the deposit guarantee was increased.  At the time, this measure was necessary to prevent a run on or collapse of any Irish financial institutions.  On 30 September 2008, the State guarantee was put in place.  Smaller countries such as Ireland and Denmark opted for State guarantees.  It was easier for bigger countries to apply their own solutions as did Germany and the United Kingdom.  On 3 December 2008, the names panel was set up for the purpose of selecting additional board members to the various banks.  Each bank had to appoint two members to that.  The members were also named for the covered institution remuneration oversight committee.  These were important steps.  On 21 December 2008, we had decisions on recapitalisation of the three major banks.  In January 2009, we had the Government nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and, on 11 February 2009, the recapitalisation terms for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In April 2009, the establishment of NAMA was announced in the supplementary budget and in June 2009 the Central Bank of Ireland Commission was set up, with the reform of institutional structures of financial services in Ireland at the top of its agenda.  The Government also established a single and fully integrated regulator.  In November 2009, the NAMA Bill was passed and it was followed on 11 December by the revised State guarantee.  On 22 December 2009, the NAMA board members were announced.  This brings us up to date, to 19 January when we saw the framework for the banking inquiry approved by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">All of these welcome and necessary measures were taken by the Irish Parliament in the national interest.  However, we are not alone in this crisis.  We were subject to what was happening in the wider world, including the European Union.  The initiatives I have mentioned were taken with the support of international funding markets — we saw the effect of that in the context of the interest rates we are charged on our bonds — and the European Central Bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I would like to mention two of the major factors that affected the crisis in the Irish banking system.  The international credit crunch was a key factor that created severe liquidity issues in Ireland and across the world.  We are a small open economy and we were impacted on very badly in that regard.  Another factor was that markets were concerned with asset quality and the over exposure of the Irish banking and financial system with regard to property loans, particularly in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  However, I would be critical of the EU response.  I felt it was slow and left us floundering.  The US response seemed to be faster and more co-ordinated.  Therefore, I welcome any European initiatives that will see an improvement in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">In 2008, interest rates could have moved quicker and we should have had more joined up thinking on coping and dealing with the financial crisis on a European-wide scale.  At the time it was as if we were watching a car crash about to happen.  Each country was watching every other country, banks were looking to governments and governments were looking at other governments to see how they were going to fix their particular financial difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">It is with that in mind that I particularly welcome the draft legislative proposals which will reform the EU financial supervisory and regulatory framework.  I welcome two proposals that have come forward from that and I also welcome the de Larosière report and its recommendations.  The first proposal arising from proposed EU financial regulatory reform is the setting up of the European systemic risk board, ESRB, which will have responsibility for oversight of the financial system, particularly at the macro level.  The second is the setting up of the European system of financial services, ESFS, which will involve national financial supervisors working with the European supervisory authority, ESA.  It will comprise three authorities, the European banking authority, the European securities and markets authority and the European insurance and occupational pensions authority, the three ESAs.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">It is important the proposed powers of the ESAs are examined and reviewed on a constant basis.  The need for review has emerged from the reform process and is welcome.  The rulemaking power, for example, proposes the establishment of one harmonised rulebook, which is very important.  Enforcement is also important and the ESAs will ensure the coherent application of EU legislation.  ESAs will also have emergency powers so that we are never again left in a position where we are seen to be floundering.  They will have a large role to play in dispute resolution and peer review will play an important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">As someone from the private sector who has discussed these issues with many others, I am aware the banking sector, through the early and mid noughties was all about competition.  Bank of Ireland and AIB had the run of the markets for many years, but when Anglo Irish Bank entered the scene it was more inclined to take risks and provided many people with the opportunity to commence businesses who might not have got funding from the other banks.  This created a situation where banks became competitive.  They were joined by the likes of Rabobank, which took over ACC and the Royal Bank of Scotland.  The frenzy then began towards the end of the noughties and the banks were chasing and competing for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I support all of the committee's recommendations.  We live in a different world now.  If we turned on our televisions we would see the American markets have already opened and later we see the Asian markets open.  The Irish and European markets open on the back of what has happened in Asia the previous night and everybody waits for Wall Street to open.  We live in a small world and economy now in terms of technology.  Therefore, it is vital we are in a position to react as a group in a unified way.  That is the reason the European Union has such an important role to play in the future development and regulation of the financial sector throughout the European Union.  I welcome this particular initiative.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_427">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_793">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this important debate.  I welcome the report and its recommendations and will just make a few comments.  No issue has had more impact on the citizens of Ireland, Europe and the world than that of financial regulation, control and policy over the past number of years.  It is good this House has produced a report and I congratulate the Chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on EU Scrutiny on his involvement in its production.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">As I have often said, I hope we have learned some lessons.  The Chair is aware of how often we have come into the House and spoken about legislation or regulations and hoped it or they would solve our problems.  We hope they will, but we have gone through this process many times and that has not happened.  The system of regulation, as it has unfolded over the past number of years, is a cop out.  It has never worked.  There are more regulators walking around this country and Europe than there were in Texas after the American civil war, where there were a lot of them.  It also had what were called Reconstructionists and boy do we have them here now.  They are ten a penny.  What I cannot understand is why we landed where we did.  What is the cause of that?</p>
          <p eId="para_795">Deputy Connick made a very interesting point concerning access to modern technology and the speed with which actions can take place when transferring assets and selling shares on the world markets.  Many Deputies, myself included, have spoken about this in the House in recent years.  It was possible to have a financial crisis worldwide in 1929 when there was no technology and when everything was done by hand.  There was a previous financial crisis back in 1829 when there was even less technology.  We have had many other financial crises in the meantime.  There is nothing new in having a financial crisis except that it has become easier to do it.  That is our problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">When it happened here, we introduced a regulatory system.  The regulatory system is a step removed from Parliament.  Previously, Parliament controlled financial policy with the assistance of the Governor of the Central Bank and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance.  Then we introduced the regulator and that was to be the solution to all our problems.  I was one of those involved in the DIRT inquiry and this regulatory system emerged from that inquiry.  The reason for this was that things had gone wrong in the banking system.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">This debate took place at a conference organised by the European Union in Brussels two years ago.  We could not understand at the time how it took so long for people to recognise what was happening around them.   It was as plain as the noses on our faces for the past seven or eight years.  Deputy Connick said, and I do not blame him for doing so, that Fianna Fáil was not to blame for everything that happened all over Europe.  It is just as well it was not.  Imagine what circumstances would be like had it been running the whole European scene.  Would that not have been fun?</p>
          <p eId="para_798">Bearing in mind that I am not an expert, there are basic principles to be considered.  Years ago, I was told an expert could be defined as a person who knew when to call in the experts.  I must revise my thinking in this regard and the Chair will agree with me because the experts have failed miserably.  Everything they said and did was wrong.  Their projections were wrong.  They stated the fundamentals were sound, but they were wrong in this regard also.  They said there was nothing to be afraid of and that the graph was correct, but each and every one of them was wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">Of all the Irish commentators, only a small handful, fewer than five, exhorted us to ease up on the grounds that the finances were not in order.  They were dismissed as fools and it was said that they did not know what they were talking about.  They were regarded as unpatriotic and as running down the economy.  It was believed they would cause a run on the euro and such nonsense.  Where in God's name did all the so-called, self-appointed experts come from?  They appear on our televisions every day and night and can be heard on radio programmes in the morning and middle of the day.  They address us in the newspapers.  The only one of them who spoke out against what was occurring was the one who now sits in the benches on this side of the House.  More credit to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">He is one of the few commentators — there are approximately two others — who have been consistent about predicting what would happen to our economy.  He used simple economics to do so.  The rest of the so-called experts were regarded as sophisticated experts, so much so that nobody knew what they were talking about.  It is now clear they did not know themselves.  What an appalling crime to carry out on the unfortunate people.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">What was happening was clear to all who examined the circumstances that pertained.  The marriage between the property market and the banking system was the result of an appalling, abysmal decision.  The Members on the other side of the House must take responsibility for it, although I do not blame any of them individually.  Play-acting and finding somebody else to blame is nonsense.  We can have all the regulations we want but nothing will happen to prevent a similar occurrence unless responsibility is taken politically.  Nothing else matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The problem now is that the politicians are regarded as the people to blame.  The public believe the Members of the House are to blame.  The Members had nothing to do with it whatsoever; the Government, the Executive, had direct responsibility.  Its job is to give direction, or none, as the case may be.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">It is sad that we have so little time to talk about these issues.  The economic downturn is the greatest problem to have affected this country in the past 50 years.  It is likely to remain the greatest problem for another 50 unless some other idiot comes along and makes an even bigger mistake than the one that was made and leads us in the wrong direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Over the past eight years, it was clear to the shopkeepers in every corner shop that what was occurring would not last.  Of course, most corner shops have been got rid of in the interest of so-called competition, greater efficiency and all that kind of nonsense.  Anybody with a modicum of common sense was able to tell the experts where they were going wrong before they went totally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Most Members on the other side of the House are decent people.  I hate to be recriminating all the time in the House against politicians.  It was not politicians who were the cause of the problem but the Government, the Executive.  It will continue to be regarded as the cause.  The repeated failure of the parliamentary system, whereby Ministers refuse time and again to answer questions on matters for which they are accountable to the House, must be borne in mind.  To what are Ministers accountable if not this House?  The longer this takes place, the weaker the regulatory system becomes and the more vulnerable the economy and people become.  I hope somebody somewhere will have the bravery to blow the whistle and blow out of the water the kind of codology that has been evident in this country for the past eight or nine years.</p>

          <p eId="para_808">Let me deal with the end of Deputy Durkan's contribution, which I would describe as political reductionism.  I followed the debate on the banking crisis in many countries.  The explanations being sought in respect of the US banking crisis, for example, do not focus on the role of former President Bush.  The explanations for the British banking crisis do not focus mainly on the actions of Prime Minister Gordon Brown when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer.  There are arguments to be made in this regard, of course, but the problem is far more profound than Deputy Durkan alleges.  This is precisely why the Government has not agreed to a crude, polemical, Oireachtas-based politicising approach interested only in simplistic arguments——</p>

          <p eId="para_815">I thank Members for their considered and useful contributions, except the point made by Deputy Durkan to which I referred.  The tone of the rest of the debate was absolutely sensible and I had no problem with the points being made.  I thank the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny and the other Oireachtas committees for their role in the process.  When dealing with EU frameworks, one very often needs more than one committee.  I will respond to as many of the Deputies' points as possible in the time available to me.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">These proposals aim to put in place an EU supervisory structure for financial services which is significantly enhanced to meet the challenges of effectively regulating and maintaining the stability of the single market in financial services in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">The legislative proposals aim to create a strong, robust and more uniform EU-wide system of financial supervision and oversight by developing a single rulebook for financial regulation and by securing better co-operation between national supervisors in the supervision of large and complex cross-border financial groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The establishment of a European systemic risk board, ESRB, combined with three new European supervisory authorities, will address what has been identified as a major priority in the strengthening of financial regulation internationally.  It will ensure a strong focus on the stability of the overall financial system alongside closely monitoring the soundness of individual financial institutions as well as a more co-ordinated approach to the day-to-day supervision of financial institutions, particularly by the creation of a single rulebook.  It is also in line with several international initiatives including the creation of a financial stability board by the G20.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The heads of the European Central Bank, national central banks and the European supervisory authorities, as well as national regulatory bodies, will participate in the European systemic risk board.  To achieve its role, the ESRB will have the power to issue non-binding recommendations and warnings to member states, including the national supervisors and to the European supervisory authorities, the response to which will be closely scrutinised by a complain-or-explain mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">With regard to the proposed European system of financial supervisors, ESFS, the three new European supervisory authorities for the banking, investment services and insurance and pensions sectors will take over all of the functions of the three existing EU committees of national supervisors for banking, securities and insurance which have advisory powers and aim to foster supervisory convergence, best practice and the convergence of regulatory outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">It is proposed that the new authorities will have significant additional competences including resolving cases of disagreement between national supervisors where legislation requires them to co-operate or to agree; contributing to ensuring consistent application of technical Community rules through, for example, peer reviews; developing proposals for binding technical standards; and a co-ordination role in emergency situations</p>
          <p eId="para_822">These issues have been the subject of much debate for the past 12 months since the publication of the de Larosière report.  The views of stakeholders both at national and European level have been taken into account.  The meeting of the Joint Committee on European Scrutiny in December was the third occasion on which an Oireachtas committee considered this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">The committee's report was published earlier this month and provided a valuable contribution to the debate.  It strongly supported the broad thrust of the EU proposals recognising the need for a step-change in the capacity of the current nationally based supervisory systems to work in concert to address threats to financial stability in the EU which in the operation of the single financial market often cannot be contained within national borders.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The proposed reforms to regulatory structures outlined here today are not to be regarded as the full extent of the EU's response to the crisis.  At sectorial level, several other issues have been addressed, while others are in the pipeline.  A new regulatory regime for credit rating agencies has been agreed and will come into operation later this year.  Shortcomings in how the regime operated have been clear in the past several years.  Capital requirements for banks and investment firms have been agreed and further proposals can be expected.  The Commission has proposed measures to regulate the managers of hedge funds and other alternative investment funds.  These proposals are being examined by working groups in Council and the European Parliament.  Further work is also taking place on insurance solvency provisions.  The Commission is examining the way in which derivative contracts are traded and legislative proposals can be expected later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">It is widely accepted that these reforms are necessary and urgent and they have received support from a wide range of interested parties.  The Government regards them as important measures which will help to restore confidence in the EU's financial systems.  The proposals are in line with G20 developments.  It is appropriate that the reforms be implemented as a priority and the Commission's target for the new bodies to be operational at the start of 2011 is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I thank Members for their comments on this important and urgent issue.  Financial institutions and investors alike know that these reforms are coming down the track and they want to see them implemented.  These reforms are a crucial step in addressing the weaknesses identified in the supervisory framework of financial regulation in the EU and the Government is fully behind them.  I have sympathy with Deputy Costello's comments on discussing and scrutinising legislation, regulations and statutory instruments.  This debate highlights the complex measures required nationally and at European level in this area.  The causes that have given rise to this legislation and the solutions are quite complex and interconnected.  They are not simple matters as they are sometimes represented.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Deputy Martin Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_827">The recent flooding in many parts of the country, leading in some cases to the virtual destruction of people's homes, has highlighted several deficiencies in local planning.  It raised serious questions over where housing developments were allowed to be located and the procedures that resulted in permission being granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">Before Christmas, I raised the issue of the building of houses in locations where there was an historical record of flooding.  There may not have been flooding in some of those locations for many years, maybe even in living memory.  However, where housing development was allowed to proceed in places close to rivers or on water basins that risk was always present.  Some newer developments where flooding did take place were in areas where the actual placenames referred to water.  That might have provided a clue.  Planners and developers should have paused and considered why no one had built in these locations before, even though they were close to or within existing settlements.  We now know the reasons but, unfortunately, that knowledge comes too late for those whose homes were destroyed.  A more vigorous examination of planning applications in such locations clearly needs to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">This can be accommodated in section 5 with its stated intent to create an evidence-based and integrated process based on key aspects of the development of the areas in which the proposals are situated.  Section 3 refers to risk assessment for flooding under criteria related to the use of land, the development of the land, the management of flood risk and changes in climate.  Perhaps a specific clause related to the historical record of the location with a view to detecting possible periodic flooding might also be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Some property developers owe substantial amounts of money to local authorities which provided infrastructure and services for housing developments.  Many of those developers are now claiming an inability to pay.  I understand some local authorities have begun actions to recover these moneys.  While I accept it might not be addressed through changes in planning procedures, it is a serious problem that has left local authorities at a significant loss.  Could it be included under the provisions for taking action against and increasing the penalties imposed on those who violate guidelines?</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The provisions regarding submissions from local authorities seem to be positive and will focus attention on how specific proposals fit in with overall development plans.  I also welcome the provision in sections 7 and 8 to require that any changes to an existing development plan will need the support of two thirds of the members of the authority instead of a simple majority, ensuring that any changes would be accepted across a range of opinion and, therefore, less likely to be contentious or present a possible negative impact on the locality.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">With regard to the changes to local area plans as proposed in section 10I, I will oppose the changes to the population size threshold and will submit amendments which seek to leave the threshold as is. This is the best way of ensuring local area plans are what they claim to be and that they properly reflect the character and needs of the place for which they were framed.  The provisions to ensure that local area plans are consistent with overall county development plans make sense given that any conflicts obviously would lead to contradictory strategies which would be reflected in the planning process.  Section 12 provides for greater linkage and coherence between regional planning guidelines and the national spatial strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">It is important that democratically elected local representatives have an input into how the broader strategies are implemented.  There needs to be some flexibility to account for changing circumstances as it makes no sense to attempt to implement an existing strategy if economic, social or demographic factors have radically altered.  This must be the case, in particular when the economic climate has changed significantly, as is now the case, since the original strategies were framed.  For example, the national spatial strategy should be part of an overall strategy to stimulate economic recovery through a specific focus on indigenous strengths and requirements and planning policy should reflects this.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">Section 17 contains references to the planning authorities' obligation to outline how they implemented the strategy laid down by the Minister.  This could be interpreted as embodying a rigidly centralist approach in which local authorities are expected to simply follow departmental and ministerial directives even when there may be significant issues at conflict.  That is not to suggest the Minister or strategy may be wrong but it is better to ensure that local authorities have a significant input into strategy and planning, reflecting local needs and are, therefore, on board with that strategy and its implementation rather than their having to follow guidelines with which they may have genuine difficulties.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">Section 22 refers to public authorities placing documentation related to an application on its website.  Obviously, the more information available to the public the greater the degree of transparency there will be, consistent obviously with the privacy of individuals who are making planning applications.  It is vital, as we have seen in relation to the proposed Corrib gas pipeline, that the planning process is transparent and open to consultation and persuasion.  This will not be assisted by reducing the number of members entitled to make decisions, many of whom may have a significant impact and some of whom may be contentious.  Again, I will seek to address this issue by way of amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">While I welcome the general thrust of the Bill and will not oppose it on this Stage,  there are a number of areas that need to be clarified or amended and I will seek to do so when the Bill returns to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_440">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_838">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  Like the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Shea, I was a member of a local authority for some considerable time.  I am not sure that the innovations that have taken place in the planning area have been necessarily an improvement.  I will speak more about that issue later.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I am concerned about the conflict of interest and focus in terms of planning between the two Government parties.  The Green Party believes a flood plain to be a potential disaster area which floods on a regular basis and about which nobody can do anything.  It believes that despite the fact that everything comes to a halt during bad weather it is a natural disaster about which nothing can be done.  Of course, that is not true.  Even though we have been trying to address problems in this area for years they occur again and again.  There does not exist an area that cannot be drained.  It has been done all over the world for thousands of years.  That argument is rubbish.  Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, believe a flood plain to be an investment bank, a potential area for unlimited development.  This has led in recent times to intense development in particular areas, an issue on which I would now like to concentrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Not so many years ago, it was believed that developments would be of the type in which people would want to live, that they would include adequate space and recreational areas and would in some way tie in or be in consort with the area in which they were located.  However, that idea quickly went out the window during the boom times.  While there have been some good developments, we have had some atrocious developments some of which look more like what one would expect to find in a Mediterranean resort or like an idea somebody copied from elsewhere and gave up on half way through, leaving the development unfinished.  Some appalling architectural contributions have been planted in the middle of this country during the past ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The Minister of State, Deputy Brady, who is my constituency colleague, knows what I am saying is true.  In the previous era, the quality of development in the area which we represent, although much criticised, was high.  Despite all the allegations in regard to local corruption and so on, it was of high quality and has stood the test of time.  Only one conclusion will be drawn from any comparison of the two when we look back in ten or 15 years' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I have watched with interest the debate during the past few weeks in regard to the demolition of developments in particular areas.  I have never heard such stupidity.  It is stated that this should be done on the basis that these developments should not have been given planning permission in the first instance.  It is proposed that to address what was considered a wrong-doing we should demolish these developments.  The theory is that this will address the problem, but it will not.  It will result in further problems, expense and will become another issue on which people can speculate and chatter for some time to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Another issue of concern is that of people seeking planning permission to build in a rural area.  People in rural Ireland wishing to build on high ground which would not be flooded have been, and continue to be, discouraged from doing so on the basis that they must conform with the aesthetics of an area.  In other words, if the house was built on low-lying ground it would not be seen and would not, therefore, interfere in any way with the aesthetics of an area although it might be flooded.  Somewhere in the middle of that lies a contradiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">In the past, development plans were drawn up by local councillors.  Despite what has been said about them, they were fairly good.  I recently saw a television programme on which councillors gave a good account of themselves.  I would not dismiss them altogether.  During the past few years the "experts" arrived from everywhere and were appointed to every local authority in the country.  Consultants were engaged and they recommended what should be done.  They knew better because they were experts in the area.  It now appears they knew nothing and have been allowed to walk away without blame.  We all know they were but guns for hire.  Neither they nor the Minister has taken responsibility for the situation in which we now find ourselves.  I hope that on the next occasion I will have an opportunity to conclude my remarks.</p>

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_441">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_846">In the normal course there is no requirement for schools to either notify my Department in advance of a decision to close or to subsequently report to my Department on each individual decision taken by a school to close, whether this arises from adverse weather, failure of heating or water systems, or as a result of a bereavement within the school community.  Consequently my Department does not have aggregate or individual data on the number of days schools were closed, either in the recent period of adverse weather or through the earlier problems with flooding.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">The position regarding school closures this month varied from school to school depending on local circumstances.  As the Deputy will be aware, all primary and post-primary schools were closed for at least one day and most schools lost a number of days since the commencement of this school term.  The exceptionally cold weather also resulted in some schools having to close for a longer period after the onset of a thaw due to the lack of heat or water as a result of frozen pipes, burst boilers, etc.  Some schools also had to close before Christmas when they were affected by flooding and were affected again by the cold spell.</p>
            <p eId="para_848">The main focus for schools now must be on ensuring that any impact of the school closures on teaching and learning is addressed in an appropriate and sensible manner.  Since the amount of time lost varies from school to school the impact on teaching and learning is something that can only be assessed at individual school level by the school authorities.  The critical issue is that boards of management consider what can reasonably be done to ensure that by the end of the school year courses and programmes have been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">In doing so boards will need to be advised by the school principal of his or her assessment, formed through discussion with the school staff, of the impact on teaching and learning caused by any disruption.  In considering the position, I believe it is important that school authorities consult with parent representatives and that the school communicates to the parent body feedback on how it is planned to address any impact closure may have had on teaching and learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">Primary schools, traditionally, have had more scope to make up days before the end of June than post–primary schools where the school year is constrained by the commencement of the certificate examinations in early June.  The critical issue is not necessarily that all time lost is fully made up but that school specific measures are taken to ensure courses are completed and that at second level the position of examination classes is given priority.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_851">Would the Minister accept that this, again, highlights the complete shambles of his Department, that he cannot inform Dáil Éireann as to the number of schools that were closed and the requisite number of days that were lost?  There is not a centralised database within the system from which information can be given about that.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">I ask the Minister to be clear about this.  Is he saying to school management and to school authorities that it is a matter for them, in the first instance, to decide whether or not courses have been completed and whether or not additional learning needs to be provided and that, effectively, he is giving no direction to schools?  Can I take it that such is his position?</p>

            <p eId="para_853">Is Deputy Brian Hayes saying to me that I should be micro-managing every school, that I should be aware of what is the lesson content?  I have far more regard for the professionalism, integrity and commitment of principal teachers and school teachers than the Deputy has.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">My Department officials have met with the relevant management authorities.  They have discussed this issue with them.  The management authorities believe that in unison with the principals and with the co-operation of the teachers, they can complete the school year satisfactorily, that they can ensure that the course curriculum is covered in all of the examination classes and that it is correct that teachers will ensure that no child is at a loss in terms of the learning and the education outcome.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_855">When parents sought information from the Department as to the number of schools that were closed, the only information they were given was that contained on an RTE website.  Would the Minister accept that his Department in the recent inclement weather did not give specific information to parents in schools all over this country, and would he ensure that were such an event to occur again, at the very least schools would be able to give information through his Department's website centrally, if that was their choice?</p>
            <p eId="para_856">I would point out to the Minister that he has 13 education centres all over the country.  What effort was made by him to use those centres as a means of informing parents and school boards of management throughout the country?</p>
            <p eId="para_857">When the Minister came to the decision to close schools in the manner in which he did, he issued an embargo, in other words, he did not get the information out at the time and, effectively, as I understand it, he gave it to one journalist.  What was the rationale in doing that?  Why would the Minister put an embargo on a decision when, effectively, schools wanted to hear from him and his Department the advice he was to give them?  Why would he possibly put an embargo on that?</p>

            <p eId="para_860">The report came back from the central committee and the indication from that committee — from a senior official in my Department whom I respect very much — was that the weather forecast for that weekend was extremely bad and would have consequences.  As the Deputy will be aware, a board of management has responsibility within the school itself.  I felt I had a responsibility outside of the school.  I felt that if we had snow of the expected nature on the Sunday night, parents and children would be in danger.  It was on the basis of health and safety that my official advised at the meeting that we would consider closing schools but that he had to liaise with me.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">On the embargo, I took a decision as early as I could on the Friday so that schools and parents would be aware of what was coming down the track and they could make arrangements.  I was in Cork city.  I did an interview with one media organisation, which, I think took place at approximately 4.30 p.m., and which was supposedly for the 6 o'clock news.  The media organisation ran the story at 5 o'clock, which caused difficulty, and we then decided we had better tell all of the other media outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Unfortunately, Mr. Seán Hogan was on Matt Cooper's programme live at 5 o'clock and was not aware of the decision.  He would have been aware of the forecast for the weekend and of the concerns, but we had not communicated it to him.  I had telephoned the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and left a message on his mobile telephone.  I got my Secretary General to telephone the Secretary General of that Department to advise her of this decision.  Therefore, all avenues were covered.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">I will be bringing the report of the panel appointed by the Government to assess the statements of resources submitted by the 18 religious congregations that were party to the 2002 indemnity agreement, together with details of the congregations' offers of contributions, to the attention of the Government shortly.  The arrangements for the publication of the panel's report and the offers of contributions will be considered by the Government.  While some individual congregations have published details of their offers, the Deputy will be aware of my concern to have the collective comprehensive position available for survivors and their representatives in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The Deputy will be aware of the background to the call for a further substantial contribution from the religious congregations and the establishment of an independent panel to assess the financial statements of the congregations.  As the Deputy points out, it is some eight months since the publication of the Ryan report.  It is fair, however, to acknowledge that the work of the panel was complex involving an assessment of financial statements from 18 congregations.  The panel submitted its report at the end of October.  Following examination my Department sought some clarifications and in response the panel submitted an expanded report on 25 November.  Over the same period a response was awaited from the religious congregations to the calls for a further substantial contribution.  These responses were received during the period from late October to early December.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">While an overall offer of a contribution on behalf of the congregations collectively was sought, the congregations' responses have been on an individual basis, and a complete set of responses received by early December, 2009.  These offers are separate from the 2002 indemnity agreement and associated contributions.  The current engagement with the religious congregations does not involve a re-negotiation of that agreement.  The offers are not the subject of any negotiation with the Government but rather are a matter for the religious congregations to make in the light of the findings of the Ryan report, the cost of redress to the State, the resources available to the congregations and, ultimately, for the public to judge.  The uses to which the contributions will be put will be considered by the Government in consultation with the representatives of the survivors and the congregations.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Since early December my Department has examined the panel's final report and the responses from the congregations.  It has also been in contact with other relevant Departments and has commenced the formal consultation process required before I submit the matters to Government.  As I indicated at the outset I hope to do this very shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_882">I appreciate this new found obsession with secrecy and privacy on behalf of the Government, but we are discussing taxpayers' money.  The taxpayer is out to the tune of €1.27 billion in terms of funding the costs of the redress board.  The religious congregations have contributed in the order of 10%.  Whatever about the final destination of the money, the taxpayer has had to pay the balance in the meantime.  Surely, at this stage without prejudice to any decision the Minister may make or to the outturn of the panel's report, the Minister should be able to give an indication of how much has been offered in gross terms either in cash or kind or some combination of the two.</p>

It is for the Government to decide whether this is a substantial contribution, based on what appeared in the Ryan report.  It is only right and proper that the Government should have an opportunity to consider all these elements.  I have circulated the memo to all Ministers at this stage.  I have asked Ministers to consider the matter and I have allowed more than one week for them to revert with observations.  I hope to have the matter before Cabinet in the next couple of weeks.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_470" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_891">Provisions to dissolve the National University of Ireland will be contained in the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Bill, included in the legislative programme.  Recently, the Government approved the general scheme of the Bill and it is hoped that it will be published before the summer recess.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">Several factors were taken into consideration in deciding to dissolve the National University of Ireland, NUI.  Since 1997, the NUI has not been a federal university in any real sense.  All significant powers ordinarily associated with a university are directly assigned to the four constituent universities of the NUI.  They make awards themselves and have their own quality assurance procedures that are externally reviewed not by the NUI, but by the Irish Universities Quality Board.  While the NUI senate provides a forum for discussion, on most major issues the universities make the decisions.  Awards of the four constituent universities may continue to be titled NUI awards and I have commenced discussions with the constituent universities about an appropriate mechanism to ensure the protection of the national and international reputation of the NUI degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">The NUI performs a wider range of functions for its recognised colleges, including the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the National College of Art and Design, the Institute of Public Administration, the Shannon College of Hotel Management and the Milltown Institute.  This includes making awards and acting as an external quality assurance agent.  In the context of the establishment of the new qualifications and quality assurance agency, I consider that the arrangement whereby such a separate awarding and quality assurance framework is maintained by the NUI for a small number of recognised colleges is not sustainable.  When the awarding and quality assurance functions are removed, it is difficult to support the continuation of the NUI to carry out its remaining functions, the bulk of which would most likely be performed by the constituent universities, as they are by non-NUI universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">Most of the five recognised colleges of the NUI have already been exploring possible future options for award making, and when the dissolution is completed these colleges will need to enter new awarding arrangements.  The recognised colleges could enter a quality assurance and award making relationship with the new qualifications and quality assurance agency or with an existing university.  The RCSI is seeking to have its statutory degree-awarding powers commenced and I am moving to have an appropriate review process put in place in this regard.  The international reputation of Irish education must be based on the quality of teaching and research as well as the wider experience offered to international students.  I do not believe the dissolution of the NUI will have any adverse effect in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_895">This has all the hallmarks of a decision the Minister was bounced into taking.  Since he made it, he has been back-tracking all the time.  The Minister carried out no consultation whatsoever with the constituent colleges of the NUI before the decision was taken.  He freely admits this decision will not save money.  The McCarthy report outlined a saving of €3 million but the Minister has put on record already that this is not true because the Department does not provide a subvention to the NUI to the tune of €3 million per year.  Now, the Minister has produced the argument that this is connected with the new quality assurance agency, which we all support in principle.  However, there was never any difficulty with the NUI working with any of the existing agencies when it came to quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">Will the Minister justify to the House the decision taken in the context in which he asked Dr. Hunt and his colleagues to report to him soon in terms of the future of higher education in Ireland?  Would it not be a more sensible arrangement to wait to see exactly what Dr. Hunt comes up with from that expert group review, rather than allow the Minister's officials to bounce him into making this decision?</p>

            <p eId="para_897">First, I will answer the charge that I was somehow bounced into this decision.  I refer Deputy Hayes back to the budget of October 2008.  I refer the Deputy to the intention of the Government at the time to introduce a quality authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_899">Does the Deputy recall that at that time we clearly indicated that we would examine the situation regarding the NUI?  To say I was bounced into this decision is not correct.  Also, I refer the Deputy to the fact that at the time we set out a consultation process in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_901">I advise the Deputy that the NUI made a submission to this consultation.  Some of the universities also made a submission.  Submissions were made to the higher education review group by the NUI.  I find it ironic for the Deputy to say there was no consultation given that his party leader, without any consultation at all, took out of the melting pot a proposal in regard to a much more imperious body, Seanad Éireann, much to the chagrin of the Fine Gael Senators and Deputies.</p>

            <p eId="para_904">One of the reasons the Minister is all over the place on this issue is that he has been caught.  He does not understand the nature or detail of the decision he has taken.  Quite frankly, hundreds of thousands of graduates of the NUI are laughing at him and at his complete failure to justify the decision.  What will happen to the €12 million investment fund which is still within the National University of Ireland and which was set aside for scholarships and awards to students?</p>
            <p eId="para_905">I refer to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland that greatly supports the branding of its college and its degrees through the National University of Ireland, which has an international reputation of which even the Minister should be aware.  At a time when we are trying to brand Ireland internationally, abolishing an organisation which has an international brand of more than 100 years standing seems not only to be an act of stupidity on the Minister's part but an act in which he has not engaged in consultation with any of the players concerned.  This issue has a long way to run and I suspect it will run long after the Minister is no longer Minister for Education and Science.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_921">My Department is examining a range of issues relating to patronage at second level, including the issue of an independent process for the recognition of new patrons.  Given the current trend of an increasing student population and the need to ensure maximum benefit from the financial resources available to me, my Department is considering a number of broad policy issues relating to the recognition process for second level schools.  These broad policy issues are not confined to the current applications from Educate Together but relate to how we deal with the establishment of new schools across the entire second level sector.  The application from Educate Together to be recognised as a patron body at second level is being examined within the context of the relevant legal, financial and other factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">It is important to bear in mind that the establishment of any new post-primary school involves a very substantial investment by the State in terms of the initial capital costs, including the acquisition of land and also the subsequent operational costs of the school.  Before any new post-primary school can be established, regardless of the patronage model envisaged, my Department must be satisfied that the long-term enrolment potential of any such school justifies the level of investment.  New post-primary schools must be capable of catering for as broad a spectrum as possible of the community they are intended to serve in order to be viable and to provide the wide curricular range rightly demanded by parents in modern times.  As a consequence, all factors must be carefully considered, including the implications for enrolment patterns at existing schools, before approval can be given to further expand the present range of post-primary patron models.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">At a meeting last year between officials from my Department and representatives from Educate Together, there was a wide-ranging and constructive discussion about the issues associated with Educate Together's application to become a patron at second level.  The discussion also focused on the blueprint for post-primary education published by Educate Together in June of last year.  This blueprint outlines the approach by Educate Together to providing an inclusive education where all young people, whatever their ability, will be provided with learning opportunities and classroom practices that explicitly take account of the different ways students learn.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">In view of the range of issues involved, it has not been possible to bring this matter to a conclusion as quickly as I would have liked.  However, it is my intention to finalise this matter and convey a decision to Educate Together at an early date.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_493">
            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_925">I am absolutely dumbstruck by that.  This is great stuff.  One of the Minister's senior officials told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science before Christmas that the matter would be sorted out within weeks given that this application is now more than two years old.  In reply to Deputy Quinn on 22 April last year, the Minister stated that the examination of the recognition process for patrons at second level would be finalised before the start of the next school year and that his Department would be in contact with Educate Together when that had been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">Why can the Minister not tell it whether it will be recognised as a patron for post-primary education given the fact this organisation, as I am sure he will admit, is already a well-recognised patron in primary education?  Why is it taking the Department more than two years to come to a view on this matter given the status and standing of this organisation?</p>

            <p eId="para_927">I agree with the Deputy that Educate Together does a very fine job as patron of primary schools.  It is not a simple matter to give new patronage at second level.  There are serious issues, including legal issues.  I had to consult the Attorney General because we need to look at the Education Act 1998 and the Constitution and the effects thereon.  These legal issues relate not only to the application from Educate Together but would arise in the case of any proposed new patron or body.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">The development of a framework under which all proposed new schools would be assessed will need to have a sound basis and underpinning.  There is no provision in the Education Act 1998 for a new patron or for the recognition of a new patron.  Under the 1998 Act, there is a provision for the provision of a new school.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">There are legal implications.  We have had consultations on the matter.  We are, more or less, at the end of the process.  I will bring this to Government because it is a fundamental equality issue on which the Government will have to sign off.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_930">It is my understanding that this is the first time this legal issue has been raised.  Up to this point, the Minister has never raised the question of the legal status of Educate Together as a patron in post-primary education.  When the Minister refers to the Education Act 1998, is he referring to section 10?</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_932">I think the Minister is.  Section 10 gives the Minister the right to recognise patrons which in this case is an existing patron.  There is considerable legal opinion to the effect that it does not have to go through all the hoops again to be recognised given that it is already recognised in the primary school sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">This is a very important intervention by the Minister because the legal question has never been raised before.  If he is now putting this on the table, one can only come to the conclusion that this matter will be long-fingered once again.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The Minister said in his reply that he will speak to Educate Together about this soon.  Will he give a timeframe given that his assistant secretary, Mr. Wyse, mentioned weeks at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science?

            <p eId="para_935">Educate Together is held in very high esteem in my Department.  We take its applications very seriously and we know if it is appointed as a patron it will do an exceptionally good job.  I have a role as Minister for Education and Science to make sure that whatever I put in place has a legal basis and a sound framework.  I also have to examine any new patron, the school it intends to develop and the impact that school will have on other schools.  I have to establish the cost of the various associated costs with the establishment of the school and its long-term viability.  All of these issues have now been considered.  The legal aspects have been considered and I hope to be in a position to bring it to Cabinet shortly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_937">I am very aware of the excellent work being done by the schools in question using music as a key vehicle to promote inclusion and effective learning and I congratulate them on their work in this area.  Other than the additional resources available through DEIS and the school completion programme to schools designated as disadvantaged, my Department is not in a position at this time to provide additional funding to support orchestras in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">Music Network is currently recruiting a project manager to progress an expansion of music education partnerships as a result of a partnership between U2, Music Network, the International Funds for Ireland and the education sector.  As soon as the necessary administrative arrangements have been put in place, it is intended that Music Network will seek tenders for proposals for the establishment of area-based music partnerships on a phased basis to provide vocal and instrumental music tuition for young people throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">Schools in DEIS and SCP projects are provided with additional funding and have discretion as to how best to spend those funds within a framework of guidelines set out by the Department.  The guidelines provide that funding may be used on initiatives to support retention, supporting and engaging parents and the wider community, co-operation with the youth sector, promoting cross-curricular literacy initiatives, music, dance, drama and promoting social, sport and leisure activities which impact on children's learning.  The music education projects in these schools fall well within the parameters of what can be funded under DEIS and the school completion programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The schools in this initiative are funded under band 1 of my Department's DEIS programme and receive additional funding for the delivery of integrated action plans promoting the educational inclusion of pupils at risk.  These two schools receive additional capitation grants of over  €70,000.  In addition, funding is provided under the school completion programme on a cluster basis for interventions to address educational disadvantage.  A local management committee, involving primary and post primary schools, parents and relevant statutory, voluntary and community agencies manages each SCP project.  The school in Dublin 12 is one of three schools in the Crumlin SCP project, while the school in Dublin 10 is one of five schools in one of the Ballyfermot SCP projects.  Both SCP projects are provided with funding of about €398,000 annually.  In addition, €70,000 is provided to the school in Dublin 10 towards an after school project.</p>

            <p eId="para_943">I will refer to it.  The report states children can have more positive stimulation and enjoy music, performance and composing.  It acknowledges that the younger students are, the better their retention, learning, physical and teamwork skills are.  I asked this question because of the wonderful success of the two schools in Ballyfermot and Crumlin.  Music is very important in everybody's life, for young children in particular, because of many reasons.  I have spoken to a number of teachers in my constituency who told me they have had to cancel many of their music classes because of a lack of funding and they would have to scrimp and save from one end of the year to the other to keep the project going.  It fell to parents in the community who have little money to spend, especially on funding music lessons in schools, to solve the problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">I acknowledge that some work is being done in certain areas and schools but music should be available in every school.  I know about the U2 funding and the Irish funds.  It is now ten months since the scheme was launched.  How is it being advertised?  How will the money be allocated?  Some €5 million will be available over the next six years.  What schools will be selected for the scheme?  How can schools access the funding?  None of the schools I have spoken to have those answers.  The Minister of State might be able to answer some of those questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">The Deputy has asked many questions.  Music is a core part of the arts curriculum in all classes in all primary schools and comprises listening, responding, performing and composing activities.  Music is a core part of the arts programme of the primary school curriculum and its benefits are widely known.  On the Music Network initiative, the administrative arrangements are being put in place for it, it will be rolled out in 2010 to 2013 and it will involve the recruitment of music teachers.  That initiative is under way.  The funding is being provided and, in due course, it is intended that the Department will take over the funding to ensure this initiative continues in the long term.  It is open to schools in DEIS and the schools completion programme to use the extensive resources and facilities available under those programmes in whatever way they wish.  Music activities would be a key element of activity to be promoted under those programmes.</p>

There is no sign of any advertising, no schools are aware of it and I have heard nothing in the past three or four months to make people aware of the scheme.  I urge the Minister of State to take action immediately, let schools know exactly what this fund will do and who will be able to avail of it because nobody knows.</p>

The Department is fully supporting it and implementing this initiative is a very definite policy.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_506">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_949">The Deputy will be aware that in November last year I published the Smart Schools = Smart Economy report, which is the new action plan for integrating ICT in schools.  The report, which was produced by the joint advisory group, which the Minister established earlier last year, builds on the earlier strategy group report, Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools.  It makes recommendations to support the integration of information and communications technology in teaching and learning in schools and contains recommendations across a number of areas, such as ICT infrastructure, enhanced broadband connectivity, initial teacher training and continuing professional development, provision of digital content, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">I am in the process of setting up a steering group to advise and oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the report.  It will comprise key interest groups including teachers, parents, industry, relevant Departments and students, and will commence its work shortly.  As a first step in implementing the recommendations of the report, €22 million in ICT grants was issued to primary schools in November 2009.  Funding for post-primary schools will be made available this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">While the opportunities for student participation offered by the use of interactive whiteboards in the classroom are recognised, effective investment in this technology is dependent on an existing positive ICT culture in schools, and on an existing desirable level of ICT access throughout the school.  For these reasons, the priority use of the ICT grants issued in November is directed to ensuring that there is a teaching computer and digital projector in every classroom.  The teaching computer will be connected to the schools' local area network and to the digital projector in order to access and show curriculum-based digital content.  The reports I mentioned, Investing Effectively in ICT in Schools and Smart Schools = Smart Economy, advise that this combination is an extremely useful and effective teaching tool that facilitates a range of learning opportunities in whole-class teaching scenarios.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">Additional information not given on the floor of the House</p>
            <p eId="para_953">However, where a school already has a teaching computer and digital projector in place in each classroom, the school then has discretion to use the ICT grant to purchase other devices such as digital video devices, visualisers, printers, speakers and interactive whiteboards, to further develop the school's ICT infrastructure.  Digital projectors are a prerequisite for subsequent interactive whiteboard purchase and, as such, their purchase as prioritised by my Department, does not militate against purchasing an interactive whiteboard later.  Similarly, if a school already has a digital projector in place in a classroom for use with an interactive whiteboard, there is no need to purchase another digital projector for the classroom in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">All purchasing by schools must be from Department of Finance framework agreements, where available, and in compliance with public procurement procedures generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">Schools welcomed both the announcement by the Minister before Christmas of €22 million in funding and the decision to lodge the funding in school accounts before the Christmas break.  I have been approached by individuals from a number of schools who argue that digital projectors are old hat.  Many schools which have advanced far beyond this technology want to use the money provided by the Department in a creative manner, either by paying back loans for whiteboards or acquiring other technology.  I do not want to discover later in the year that a large chunk of the €22 million has not been or could not be spent by virtue of the rigid conditions the Minister is setting.  I ask him to reconsider the matter and allow schools greater flexibility.  Many schools, thanks to having good ICT co-ordinators and principals, are miles ahead of what the Minister is establishing as a basic requirement.</p>

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_956">All the reports received by the Department indicate that a digital projector is needed in every classroom.  Digital projectors are not old hat if they are not available in classrooms at present.  This is required technology which is regarded as a valuable teaching resource.  The Department is flexible to the extent that it will allow schools which have achieved the basic level of provision, as set out by the Department, to offset the money they spent on doing so against the grants.  That is the key point.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The Department is setting minimum thresholds in terms of the technology available in classrooms for teachers to do their work.  It is not open to schools to indicate they are doing something else.  They must provide a baseline minimum standard in terms of access to technology.  If they have done so and projectors are in place, they can use the money for other purchases, provided these are within the criteria set out by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_960">For the purposes of clarity, will the Minister of State consider issuing another circular to schools because there is some confusion on the matter?  I am not sure if the Minister of State is as familiar with the position as I am given that I visit schools on a daily or weekly basis.  Whiteboard technology is being used in many schools as an interactive tool, in other words, it allows children to get involved in work using a whiteboard.  They cannot do this with a digital camera.  This is what school principals are telling me.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_962">That is correct.  The other important issue principals are raising is that while it is great to have a digital camera and projector or whiteboard, if one does not have broadband or if one's broadband connectivity is poor, the type of equipment available in a school is irrelevant.  Schools must be given a little more flexibility and clarity.</p>

            <p eId="para_972">The passage of the Student Support Bill will facilitate progress on the two significant pillars of an overall programme of legislative and administrative reform of student grants.  These are the development of a single unified grant scheme and reform of the administration of student grants.  A number of amendments to the Bill in relation to legal and policy issues which have arisen since Second Stage are being advanced by my Department in close consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for a unified student grant payment scheme to replace the four existing schemes.  The Bill, as published, also makes provision for the transfer of administrative responsibility for student grants to the VEC sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">In light of the commitment to put all student grants on a statutory footing, I am anxious to provide a statutory basis for all student grants for any interregnum period that may arise, pending transition to new administrative arrangements.  This transitional period will necessitate retention of the existing administrative structures in the immediate term.  In bringing amendments to Committee Stage I will, therefore, endeavour to provide for existing administrative arrangements for this transitional phase, while progressing to a single scheme of grants as provided for in the Bill at the earliest possible date.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">In the context of the Government's wider programme of public service reform, I am also reassessing organisational options for the grants administration function in the longer run, with a view to revisiting the current proposals provided for in the Bill.  Possible options for a more significant centralisation of functions are being explored with a view to streamlining operations and maximising administrative efficiency.</p>
            <p eId="para_976">These developments have required consideration of a complex set of legal options regarding further amendment to the Bill and my Department has been working closely with the Office of the Attorney General to address the issues in that regard.  These proposed amendments are at an advanced stage of preparation.  Subject to the technical, drafting and legal considerations arising, I hope to be in a position to have these amendments advanced sufficiently to move to Committee Stage early in the current session.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I believe I am correct in observing that the Minister inherited the Student Support Bill from his predecessor who moved the legislation and the debate on Second Stage.  Many of the issues surrounding the legislation have been resolved.  For example, the Irish Vocational Education Association has proposed a centralised system of administration which would, by and large, give new legitimacy to the organisation by finding a new role for it, while also delivering the efficiencies sought by the Department.  Why is it that the Department is able to provide a five page reply to every parliamentary question it receives but is incapable of showing the same level of productivity when drafting legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_978">A new sense of urgency surrounds the Student Support Bill.  The downturn in the economy has created acute problems for students seeking to secure grants under the existing system.  Will the Minister speed up the review and establish the centralised system, for which a plan has been drafted but left on a shelf in the Department?</p>

The Deputy will be aware that a judicial review which was taken created some issues for the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">He will also recall that one of the fundamental issues that arose during the Second Stage debate was a grant system for part-time courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">On the issue of having the administration and operation of grants located in a single co-ordinated area, we had to leave the Bill in its current form owing to the economic downturn.  This meant we had to address various legal definitions and changes.  It is my intention to bring the Bill to Committee Stage in this session.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">Deputy Quinn asked a fundamental question about students waiting for grants to be paid.  I am concerned that the payment of grants is taking such a long time.  As a result of a 30% increase in the number of grant applications this year, the vocational education committees and local authorities are having great difficulty in processing applications.  I am examining ways to make the system more user friendly in the meantime.  I have asked my Department, the local authorities and the Higher Education Authority to examine ways to speed up the process. For example, I will make the applications available earlier in the current year and we will try to do much more work on-line with regard to applications.  When one considers that 50% of all returns to the National Educational Welfare Board are made on-line——</p>

It makes absolute sense that at very least applications would be cleared pending the CAO's offer.  The Minister might get that information out to the 66 awarding bodies.  Presumably they will still be in place next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">Will the Minister confirm to the House that, according to information I recently received from his Department, there are still 6,500 applications pending?

        <b>Deputy Jack Wall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science,</b>
         further to Parliamentary Question No. 1053 of 19 January 2010, the amount of moneys spent on grants aiding the purchase of temporary prefab accommodation for schools in respect of the years 2008 and 2009; the number of schools that spent more than €100,000 renting temporary prefab accommodation in 2009; the number of schools that spent more than €50,000 renting temporary prefab accommodation in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [4149/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" eId="spk_535" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_994">Since the beginning of 2008, 557 schools have been approved for funding to purchase prefabs, with an alternative option to build permanent classrooms.  To date, 201 schools have indicated a preference to build rather than purchase or rent prefabs.  A further 249 have opted to purchase prefabs; the remainder have yet to indicate their preference.  In 2008, just under €26 million was spent on purchasing prefabricated accommodation.  This reduced to €7 million in 2009.  In addition, just over €2 million was spent in 2009 on buying-out existing rental contracts in respect of 105 units in 15 schools, arising from my Department's review of the provision of temporary accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">Of the 790 schools renting temporary accommodation in 2009, 92 schools received over €50,000 in rental grant aid and 73 schools received over €100,000.  It is a key priority for my Department to reduce rental costs and achieve better value for money.  Significant progress has been made in reducing spending in this area in the last year alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">In 2009, expenditure on the rental of temporary accommodation fell significantly to €39 million, a saving of €14 million over 2008.  This is a clear indication of my success in tackling this area of expenditure in 2009.  Furthermore, the number of schools which are renting temporary accommodation has reduced by almost 10% in the last year and I intend to make further reductions in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">A specialist firm has been engaged to review and develop new procedures and systems for the provision of temporary accommodation with a view to achieving best value for money.  The work of this review is now well advanced.  The target outputs of the review include a set of standardised specifications and a suitable generic contract for the rental of prefabricated accommodation.  These will be in place before the end of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">Another important strand of the review is to buy out existing rental contracts.  Fifteen of these, involving 105 units, have already been terminated.  A further group of schools will be targeted in 2010, with a view to identifying and achieving the most cost-effective solution for bringing to an end the relevant rental agreements.</p>

            <p eId="para_999">I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I shall go through some of the detail in due course and table supplementary questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">In the light of this welcome departure in terms of policy, which I support, and speaking in a broader context, is the Department aware of the massive demographic cohort of new pupils coming through?  The Central Statistics Office predicts an increase of as much as 20% within the next seven to ten years, depending on circumstances.  The problem has not gone away, therefore.  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that schools can have permanent buildings, now that the building industry has a massive capacity to respond very quickly?  There would be three solutions: employment and tax revenue for the State and for those lucky enough to get back to work; decent accommodation for the pupils involved; and permanent building structures rather than the temporary structures that exist.  For example, St. Oliver Plunkett's in Malahide is an absolute disgrace.</p>

            <p eId="para_1001">Deputy Quinn raised this issue with me and when I examined it I was not satisfied with what was happening within the Department in its regard.  We have made dramatic improvements.  I understood that Deputies Quinn and Hayes were invited to look at the Department's geographical website which shows the precise anticipated growth.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1003">Both Deputies have seen it.  Obviously, it is a major step forward and in terms of forward planning it identifies very clearly for us where the demand will be and gives us an opportunity to ensure we have proper school structures in place to meet that demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Taking my capital programme for this year, despite all that was said last September about my not spending the money I received, the Deputies will find there was a 79% carry-over.  I was allowed to carry over 10% of the overall budget and all the spending took place.  There is a carry-over of projects to be completed this year.  In the capital budget overall, I will have €789 million this year which is on a par with last year.  If I continue to get the 30% extra value for money that will obviously increase the output in terms of the number of schools we can build.  I am very anxious to progress matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">In addition, I have asked my Department to speak with the various entities, whether architects or engineers, and go through the new contract process.  There was a delay last year and the last thing we want is to have delays in projects arriving on site.  A good number of these projects are coming on site in January and February but I want to ensure that when I make an announcement on the capital programme within the coming weeks people will go ahead with plans and we will be able to sustain jobs.  We reckon that with the current programme we will sustain approximately 7,500 jobs in construction.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_1006">I am pleased that the Minister is to announce more capital projects.  He normally does this every February.  Will he radically increase the number of announcements this year?  The real problem we have had is that we do not get the schools through the planning, tendering and construction stages as quickly as we should.  Some of that is down to the tendering process employed since 2008 in the Department of Finance.  The big problem last year was that the Minister did not make enough announcements in February 2009.  Will he ensure there are more announcements this year?  Not all schools will get through to completion stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The Minister referred to the fact that €39 million was the rental charge for last year.  That was a substantial improvement on the previous year but it is very far ahead of the sums for 2006 and 2007.  Some of the money spent last year was in buying out the prefabs in question.  Will the Minister agree to make public the findings of the expert group which was appointed by the Minister on foot of considerable parliamentary scrutiny by Deputy Quinn and me during the past 12 months?  It would be good to see exactly what the group had to say about the way in which the Department of Education and Science's building unit organises itself.</p>

Expanding this programme could act as a stimulus to the economy and could assist in returning people to employment.  Has the Minister considered segmenting some of the projects, which would thereby allow them to come in under the EU's radar, in order that local builders and developers and, by extension, local economies might benefit?  There are four schools in my constituency which are paying out in excess of €100,000 for prefabs.  That is money down the drain.</p>

            <p eId="para_1017">I am sure the Deputy will communicate further with me regarding the four schools in his area.  I met representatives of the Construction Industry Federation recently and discovered that some smaller building firms are concerned about the level of turnover they must have to qualify to tender for projects.  I am sympathetic to their plight in that regard.  I do not believe a high level of turnover is required in respect of some of the smaller projects.  My officials are involved in discussions with the Department of Finance at present in an attempt to reduce the turnover figure to a much more realistic one.</p>

The application from Educate Together to be recognised as a patron body at second level is being fully examined within the context of the relevant legal, financial and other factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024">At a meeting last year involving officials from my Department and representatives from Educate Together, a wide-ranging and constructive discussion relating to the issues associated with Educate Together's application to become a patron at second level took place.

Does the Minister accept that Educate Together schools provide a unique and high quality form of education?  Everyone is of the view that there is a difficulty with Educate Together becoming a patron at second level.

            <p eId="para_1032">As Minister, I want to be in a position to ensure that if we make provision for something, it will stand up to scrutiny and that the legal framework relating to it is correct.  Through my officials, I established that the Education Act does not contain a provision with regard to establishing a new model of patronage at second level.  We were, therefore, obliged to consult the Office of the Attorney General to discover how we might put in place a proper legal framework.  The latter has now been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">The position relating to second level is much different from that which obtains in respect of primary level.  In the first instance, it is much more expensive to procure a site, much more land is required and the cost of building a school is high.</p>

            <p eId="para_1035">It is then necessary to ensure the various curricular activities are provided.  It is also necessary to consider what will be the impact of the opening of a new school on existing schools in an area and whether the former will be viable in the long term.  We are obliged to consider all these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">I made it clear, in my reply to a previous question, that we will shortly be making a decision on this matter.

Educate Together did a great deal of work in respect of removing impediments to recognition and with regard to having its existing patronage extended.  Is the Minister prepared to publish the legal advice he received in respect of the impediments and difficulties that exist in order that we might be of assistance in resolving this problem?  I do not believe he is opposed to Educate Together becoming a patron at second level.  However, a barrier exists somewhere.  For as long as that barrier remains secret, obscure or incapable of being explained, all sorts of suspicions will be bandied about in respect of the Minister and his stewardship of the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">Two issues arise.  First, it became clear that there was no provision in the Education Act in respect of establishing a new model of patronage.  In such circumstances, I was obliged to ask my officials, in conjunction with the Attorney General, to consider the position in order that we might overcome that difficulty.  The provision contained in the Act related to the provision of new schools rather than developing new models of patronage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">The second issue is that surrounding the making available of legal advice.  Deputy Quinn has served as Minister for Finance and he is aware that it is not normal practice to make the advice of the Attorney General publicly available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">Section 10 of the Act imposes an obligation on the Minister for Education and Science to provide parents with a variety of options in respect of their children's education.  That is his constitutional and legal responsibility.  This issue does not merely relate to Educate Together.  There is a view among many of the partners involved in post-primary education that any new post-primary school established is ostensibly a VEC.  There are many Catholic and Church of Ireland education providers who ask why they cannot provide post-primary schools in emerging areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">The Minister's assertion that legal advice has been sought in respect of this issue is new.  I was of the view that the Education Act makes it clear that patronage is there for all to see.  This is especially true of Educate Together which has already established its patronage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1045">One of the criteria to which the Minister referred is the fact that any new patron would be obliged to cater for a broad spectrum of individuals from the communities it intends to serve.  Does he accept that Educate Together is probably to the fore in catering for the needs of the broadest possible spectrum of such individuals?</p>

            <p eId="para_1046">I accept that Educate Together is very expansive in the context of what it does.  I am of the view, however, that the other patrons are equally expansive and forward-looking.  Therefore, I tend to place them all on the same footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">If another organisation had sought to be established as a patron at second level, I would still have had to consider the legal framework — a process I have now completed — in the same way I was obliged to do in respect of Educate Together.

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1051">Significant support is given to schools by way of language support provision.  The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible pupils enrolled and the associated assessed levels of those pupils' language proficiency.  This is done through an annual application process in the spring and summer of each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">Following the Government decision in budget 2009 on language support provision, my Department published circular 0015/2009 which sets out a structured and transparent process for the allocation of up to four language support teachers to schools.  Additional support is available for those schools which have at least 25% of their total enrolment made up of pupils who require language support.  Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the staffing appeals process.  In the current school year this additional measure for those with a minimum 25% concentration of pupils needing additional support saw 73 additional language support posts allocated to 64 schools with some of the schools having up to five or six English as an additional language, EAL, teachers because their specific needs were deemed to warrant such intensive support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">Overall, the total number of EAL teachers in the current school year is approximately 1,185 at primary level and approximately 365 at post-primary level.  The challenge for schools is to ensure that this very significant resource is used to maximum effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">My Department is carrying out a value for money review of expenditure on the EAL provision for those primary and post-primary students who do not speak English as their mother tongue.  This review is complemented by the evaluation of the quality of teaching and learning as it relates to EAL being carried out by the Department's inspectorate.  The review and evaluation are expected to be finalised in the coming months.  An OECD report on migrant education in Ireland was also recently published and this will be another source of advice and guidance on EAL provision for schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">It is important to note that the resources allocated to schools to meet the needs of pupils learning English as an additional language are additional to other supports and funding provided for schools.  All pupils including migrant pupils, irrespective of their English language proficiency, are counted for the regular pupil-teacher ratios in schools.  Schools have flexibility in how they deploy their EAL teachers to meet the needs of pupils that require language support.</p>

            <from>Deputy Batt O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1069">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 11 and 13 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">I stand by the Government's decision to dissolve the National University of Ireland.  Since 1997, the NUI has not been a federal university in any real sense.  All significant powers ordinarily associated with a university are directly assigned to the four constituent universities of the NUI.  They make awards themselves and have their own quality assurance procedures which are externally reviewed not by NUI but by the Irish Universities Quality Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">While the NUI Senate provides a forum for discussion, on most major issues, the universities themselves make the decisions.  Awards of the four constituent universities may continue to be titled NUI awards and I have commenced discussions with the constituent universities about an appropriate mechanism to ensure the protection of the national and international reputation of the NUI degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">NUI performs a wider range of functions for its recognised colleges — Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), National College of Art and Design, Institute of Public Administration, Shannon College of Hotel Management and Milltown Institute.  This includes making awards and acting as an external quality assurance agent.  In the context of the new qualifications and quality assurance agency that is being established, I consider that the arrangement where a separate awarding and quality assurance framework is maintained by NUI for a small number of recognised colleges is not sustainable.  When the awarding and quality assurance functions are removed, it is difficult to support the continuation of NUI to carry out its remaining functions, the bulk of which would most likely be performed by the constituent universities themselves, as they are by non-NUI universities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">The three then constituent colleges became constituent universities of NUI, along with NUI Maynooth, in the Universities Act, 1997.  Two of those universities chose to use "NUI" in their working title.  I have no objection to their continuing to do so. No re-branding arises.  Most of the five recognised colleges of NUI have already been exploring possible future options for award making and when the dissolution is completed these colleges will need to enter new awarding arrangements.  The recognised colleges could enter a quality assurance and award making relationship with the new qualifications and quality assurance agency or with an existing university.  However, the names of these colleges will not change and I expect that any re-branding costs would be minimal. Furthermore, the RCSI is seeking to have its statutory degree-awarding powers commenced and I am now moving to have an  appropriate review process put in place in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">The international reputation of Irish education must be based on the quality of teaching and research as well as the wider experience offered to international students.  I do not believe that the dissolution of the NUI will have any adverse effect in this regard.  Indeed, the new qualifications and quality assurance agency will be uniquely placed to employ an integrated approach to  securing international recognition of Irish qualifications on the national framework of qualifications and providing external assurance of the quality of our educational institutions.  In addition, the new agency will be given statutory responsibility for the administration of a new code of practice and quality mark for international education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Provisions to dissolve NUI will be contained in the qualifications and quality assurance (education and training) Bill, which is included in the legislative programme.  Government approved the general scheme of the Bill recently and it  is hoped that it will be published before the summer recess.  Article 18.4 of Bunreacht na hÉireann states that three members of Seanad Éireann be elected by the National University of Ireland.  However, it goes on to say that this franchise may be reassigned to any or all of the institutes of higher education in the State.  In fact, it specifically provides that nothing in Article 18 can  be invoked to prohibit the dissolution by law of any University mentioned in the article.  I acknowledge that alternative arrangements to the NUI's role in electing members of Seanad Éireann need to be put in place in law in advance of NUI dissolution but a constitutional referendum is not required.  I will work closely with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government on this issue in the context of wider work on Seanad reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_1078">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 14 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">A response has issued to the correspondence from the Justice for Magdalenes group and my officials have been in touch with the group to arrange a meeting with its representatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">The residential institutions redress scheme was introduced as an exceptional measure to provide compensation for people who were sent as children to, and who were victims of abuse while resident in, industrial schools, reformatory schools and other institutions in respect of which a public body had had a regulatory or inspection function.  The Magdalene Laundries were privately-owned and operated establishments which did not come within the responsibility of the State and were not subject to State regulation or supervision.  Accordingly, the laundries do not come within the scope of the redress scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">In recognition of the fact that some children were transferred from State-regulated institutions to laundries, section 1(3) of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 provides that a child who was resident in a State-regulated institution and who was transferred to a laundry where they suffered abuse while so resident, will be deemed, at the time of the abuse to have been resident in the State-regulated institution.  This provision was included on the basis that the State was still responsible for the welfare and protection of children who were transferred to a Magdalene laundry from a State-regulated institution provided that they were not officially discharged from the institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">While the Justice for Magdalenes group acknowledges that the State did not license, regulate or inspect the Magdalene Laundries, it is calling for a distinct redress scheme for the former residents, including children and adults, on the basis of the State's failure to meet its constitutional responsibility to protect them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The Justice for Magdalenes group has also raised the issue of girls being referred to the Magdalene Laundries via the criminal justice system.  This issue is being examined by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the results of the research so far were outlined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the replies to parliamentary questions last week, to which Deputy Rabbitte's question referred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">My statement in a letter last September to the effect that the State did not refer individuals to Magdalene Laundries nor was it complicit in referring individuals to them was based on my Department's understanding of the position.  This was also the understanding of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Following an inquiry from my Department and contact from others, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform examined the matter and has since confirmed that some women were referred to laundries via the courts system.  I accept that this was the position as opposed to the position regarding referrals outlined in my letter of last September.  It remains the case that these institutions were not subject to State inspection or regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">My officials are continuing to liaise with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding its inquiries and expect to meet representatives of the Justice for Magdalenes group at an early date to discuss the issues raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_1091">I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  I am asking the Minister for Health and Children to establish an all-party Oireachtas committee to review the background to the decision to centralise medical card applications and renewals.  I do not call for that lightly; I do so because the system is simply not working.  That is the experience I have had with my constituents and I hear anecdotally that most of my colleagues have the same experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">We need to review carefully how and why the decision was made, how the system is operating and what we can do to resolve the matter.  Since the system has been centralised there seems to have been a sharp increase in the length of time it is taking for people applying for medical cards to have their applications processed.  The centralisation has also caused confusion and unnecessary hardship to many who are applying.  Nearly a year ago a unilateral decision was made to centralise all medical card applications and renewals.  All medical card applications and renewals are now being processed by the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS.  The PCRS was not designed for this purpose and has been forced to try to cope with the extra and unfamiliar workload.  The medical card system was previously based around the local health care providers who made decisions on a case-by-case basis.  This system was effective because those who were making decisions had a personal knowledge of the applicants and their needs.  The new centralised system does not have this advantage and this could mean that people who are in need of medical cards may not receive them or may receive them only after a long waiting period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">Centralisation has caused chaos to the medical cards applications and renewals process.  The PCRS was not set up to deal with medical cards and has struggled to cope with the influx of applications.  Some 10,000 people have had to reapply for medical cards since centralisation.  The PCRS was not consulted on the plan to centralise the medical system and place it under its control.  Now the Minister for Health and Children has had to provide it with extra resources and personnel.  Even with these extra resources the PCRS is struggling to cope.  The public is finding it extremely difficult to contact the medical card section and when they do finally manage to talk to someone that person is often not the one in charge of that particular case.  This situation is made worse by the fact that there is no way to meet a representative of PCRS in person.  There is no public office, no reception  and anyone who calls to PCRS is turned away by security personnel.  It is like the Dark Ages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">My office has been inundated with calls inquiring about medical card applications and renewals.  One constituent who contacted me applied for a medical card in February 2009 in her local HSE office.  When she subsequently changed her address and contacted the PCRS, it did not have her file so could not amend her address.  Neither was the file in local office, so it had disappeared into thin air.  On 22 January 2010 I contacted the PCRS about her situation.  She still has not received a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">A second constituent who applied to renew her medical card in August 2009 by registered post is still awaiting a response.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children on 8 December and it was passed on to the HSE.  I am still awaiting a reply, almost two months later.  These are just two of many cases that have been brought to my attention and they seem to be commonplace, as may be gleaned, anecdotally from the experience of colleagues in the House.  It is the sick, elderly and the vulnerable who are suffering.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">There is a need for an all-party Oireachtas committee to investigate the situation.  It needs to look at the preparation and planning that went into making the decision to centralise the medical card process, examine the problems the system is now facing and decide how best to deal with them.  Also, the committee needs to investigate the affects of the delays and numerous lost or mishandled applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">The Minister for Health and Children told the House on 24 November 2009 that the turnaround time for applications was 15 working days.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1098">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">Following the change in medical card eligibility for persons aged 70 and over in the Health Act 2008, the HSE through its service plan for 2009, advised the Department of Health and Children of plans to introduce a centralised national processing centre for medical cards and community drugs schemes as part of its value for money programme.  The centralising of the medical card application and review process is facilitating a number of enhancements to the level of customer service associated with these applications</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">The HSE has informed the Department that its decision to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Dublin was in the context of its requirement to make efficiencies in business practices that could realise savings in a very challenging economic environment and provide a modern service to the public within sustainable levels of expenditure.  The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin city to the PCRS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">The phased implementation will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  In 2009 the PCRS processed over 72,000 medical card applications which included nearly 42,000 reviews.  With regard to these reviews, 85% of cases where the required information was supplied were completed within 20 working days and 95% within 30 days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">The HSE has recently put in place a national online system to allow local health offices track the current status of applications in the PCRS.  The HSE has also advised that it has recently launched a facility, where a person who has applied through the PCRS can view the status of their medical card application or review online, using a unique reference number that is provided on the acknowledgement sent to him or her.  In addition if a mobile telephone number is supplied with an application, updates by text message will be delivered to the applicant's phone.  The PCRS is also finalising the development of a facility which will allow people to apply online if they wish.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The Minister for Health and Children in her letter to all members of the Oireachtas on 19 January 2010 stated that she fully supports the decision by the HSE to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented, this measure will ensure improved turnaround times for processing of applications — under the new arrangements the HSE will be aiming for a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately; consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision; clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information; and a reduction  in  the  overall  number  of staff required  to  process  medical or GP visit card applications, thus freeing up staff for other service needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The decision to centralise the medical card application and review process will, when fully implemented, enhance the delivery of services provided to the public and realise overall savings through the greater usage of shared services.  This decision is in line with the Government's Transforming Public Services' Programme <i> </i>announced by the Taoiseach in November 2008.  Therefore, it is not envisaged that the establishment of an all-party Oireachtas committee is required to review this initiative.</p>

            <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_1105">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this matter.  In 2003, Ireland came close to introducing a chewing gum levy.  However, ultimately this move did not go ahead and I believe now is an opportune time for the issue to be revisited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">Chewing gum residue is unsightly and very difficult and costly to remove.  In an ideal world, people who chew gum would dispose of it properly in litter bins but unfortunately, this does not happen, and like cigarettes, the residue ends up on the streets.  Reports indicate that chewing gum accounts for a quarter of all food litter dropped on streets, and last year Dublin City Council spent some €37 million cleaning up the streets.  In the current economic climate much-needed funds should not have to be spent on cleaning up chewing gum and other litter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">An article in one of the Sunday newspapers last week indicated an unexpected side effect of the bad weather was that all the grit spread on the city's streets to combat the ice had the duel effect of lifting away much of the chewing gum.  However, I believe the Minister of State would agree that this is not a solution to the problem.  Earlier this month a survey carried out by An Taisce pointed to the fact that although many towns around the country have done a great job in reducing litter, our cities are not particularly clean.  Dublin ranked 51 out of 60 towns and cities surveyed, and was found to be "littered" by European standards.  Dublin, and Ireland generally, rely heavily on tourism and having clean, litter-free streets is crucial to ensuring overseas visitors are attracted here.  Businesses in the city centre pay a host of rates and levies including BID fees.  Dublin City Council relies on these moneys to provide essential services.  Chewing gum is an enormous problem on our city streets, and a levy could be directly used towards cleaning this product from our pavements, allowing council finance to be diverted to other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government indicated to me in reply to a parliamentary question that negotiations with the chewing gum industry are currently underway following the expiration of an agreed three-year awareness campaign.  I believe that while the gum litter taskforce has done great work in raising awareness of this problem and educating people about disposing of their litter, a levy is the only way forward and I would ask that the Minister to strongly consider this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">While I welcome the raising of on-the-spot fines for littering from €25 to €150, it is critical that these are processed in order to be effective in deterring people from littering.  Reports in June of this year pointed to the fact that more than half of litter fines imposed by local authorities remain unpaid, which is unacceptable and I believe this matter must also be addressed to deter people from littering.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanHaughey" eId="spk_593" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1110">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">In 2006 that Minister's Department entered into a three-year negotiated agreement with the chewing gum industry to address the problem of chewing gum litter on our streets.  The agreement constituted a commitment by industry to a €6 million, three-year education and awareness programme aimed at tackling the gum litter problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">A gum litter task force, GLT, was established as part of the agreement and a full-time executive was appointed to co-ordinate gum litter awareness and education programmes.  The GLT organised three nationwide gum litter action campaigns in 2007, 2008 and 2009.  These campaigns included extensive outdoor advertising, an educational secondary schools programme entitled "Bin It", the development of a dedicated GLT website, local radio, in-store and around store advertising, and the distribution of point of sale and promotional materials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">This campaign has achieved much success.  For example, monitoring of gum litter levels in the five main cities has demonstrated a 37% overall reduction in gum litter over the course of the 2009 campaign, with all five cities recording significant reductions.  Monitoring results in 2008 demonstrated a 36% reduction over the course of the campaign.  This shows that the campaign is gathering momentum over time and is having a positive effect on gum litter levels nationwide.  In addition, consumer research demonstrates that the campaign has been successful in increasing awareness of the gum litter problem with significantly greater numbers of respondents since 2006 agreeing with the propositions that "it is wrong to drop gum", "spitting gum is disgusting" and "I would feel guilty dropping gum".  Overall the researchers concluded that there has been an overwhelming positive trend in attitudes and claimed behaviour in respect of gum disposal since 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">It must be recognised that a levy would not address directly the actual cause of the problem, that is, the incorrect disposal of chewing gum.  The value of the chewing gum market in Ireland is estimated at €30 million.  Therefore a levy pitched at 10% of the retail price would raise approximately €3 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">The removal of chewing gum is more problematic than other litter items.  The prohibitive cost of cleaning chewing gum from our streets means that many local authorities do not engage in this activity.  Therefore the funds raised from the imposition of a levy would not provide anything close to the amount that would be required to fully cleanse the country's streets.  There would also be substantial administrative costs involved, leaving aside any potential legal challenges which might arise.  Furthermore the levy would have to be paid by all consumers of chewing gum, not simply those who dispose of their gum incorrectly, thus punishing all for the behaviour of a few.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">It is clear that the imposition of a levy alone will not change the behaviour of those who dispose of their gum irresponsibly.  This is the reason the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government believes that even were a levy to be introduced, it would remain crucial to continue to educate and raise awareness of the damaging environmental consequences of dropping gum on the streets.  Short-term cleansing solutions do not tackle the root cause of the problem and are unlikely to improve the position in the long term unless one can influence the behaviour of those who continue to dispose of their gum irresponsibly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">The Minister is actively considering what steps to take in the future regarding the gum litter problem, including the possible imposition of a chewing gum levy.  All options are being considered and he is currently engaged with industry to establish whether a re-energised education and awareness campaign, funded entirely by the industry and building on the success of the previous agreement, is a viable option.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_1118">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this most important issue on the Adjournment.  My request can be simply stated, namely, that funding be provided for sign language interpreters for five deaf people who wish to participate in a course at Waterford Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">The Unite trade union has been working with Waterford Institute of Technology on the development of education courses for workers who lost their jobs when Waterford Crystal closed.  An information evening was held at Waterford Institute of Technology on 23 September 2009 and there have been subsequent meetings between the college and the Unite trade union.  Waterford Institute of Technology has developed a programme to address the educational needs expressed by the group from Waterford Crystal who attended on the information night.  There are three main areas in the programme, namely the recognition of prior learning from life and work, personal development in study skills and the opportunity to taste higher education programmes.  This pilot initiative, which has been developed by Waterford Institute of Technology, is funded by FÁS.  It is to be run on a part-time basis from the end of this month until May.  The target group are those who wish to up-skill and return to education and this constitutes an innovative approach to life-long learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">It aims to inform participants about new opportunities and developments in the education system.  It provides the opportunity for individuals to map and evaluate their life and work experience to date.  This facilitates educational progression and will involve the exploration of relevant educational pathways.  It will allow participants to sample a range of the programmes provided by Waterford Institute of Technology in order that they can identify programmes of interest to them.  There will be individual guidance and support sessions while learning will be provided within a group context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">The college states that the aims of the programme are to enable learners to review their perceptions of themselves as learners, to increase participants' levels of confidence in their learning abilities and to enhance skills and identify progression routes appropriate to the individual learner and to assist in developing in participants the confidence to undertake further study at an appropriate level.  I greatly welcome this pilot project and see great potential in it as an example to be implemented widely in the interests of those who have lost their jobs and who wish to enhance their prospects of re-entering the workforce as the economy recovers and employment opportunities come on-stream.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">Given the kinds of employment that are likely to emerge in the future, the whole area of enhanced qualifications is a major factor.  Both the Unite trade union and Waterford Institute of Technology perceive this pilot project as being vital in the context of the participants taking up full-time courses in the new academic year, starting in September next.  This course is fully accredited and will allow participants to build additional credits to further their education options.  As for the five people who are deaf, I consider having the opportunity to participate in this course to be their absolute right.  I call on the Minister to provide the funding for the sign language interpreters and ask him to make an urgent positive decision in this matter in order that the course can go ahead and the five people who need the services of sign language interpreters are facilitated.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1123">I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I wish to thank the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to outline the Department of Education and Science's position on the provision of supports to students with disabilities who wish to attend higher education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">A fund for students with disabilities is administered on behalf of the Department by the national office for equity of access to higher education, which is a unit of the Higher Education Authority.  The purpose of the fund is to provide required assistance and equipment to students who have a disability to enable them to access, participate and complete their course of study.  Support under this fund is available to any student who has specific support needs arising from a disability.  It is available to students who are enrolled on a full-time course in a further or higher education institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">I am pleased to report that approvals under this fund have increased significantly in recent years.  For example, in 2003-04 a total of 1,499 students were approved for support from a total allocation of €5.8 million.  In 2008-09 the number of students approved for support increased to 3,844 with the total allocation increasing to €11.7 million.  In 2008-09, 179 deaf or hard of hearing students in further and higher education benefited from the fund for students with disabilities.  The total amount of the benefits to these students amounted to approximately €2 million.  Among the students to benefit were eight deaf or hard of hearing students in Waterford Institute of Technology.  The number of students with a disability enrolled in higher education continues to increase.  In 1998 it was estimated that slightly more than 1% of all undergraduates were students with disabilities.  Recent data available from the Higher Education Authority indicated that 4.2% of first-time enrolments in higher education in 2007-08 were students with a disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Applications for support from the fund for students with disabilities are made to the National Office for Equity of Access by the institution on behalf of the student.  Students must supply appropriate documentation relating to their disability for approval.  Funding is made available to the institution, which in turn puts in place the various supports required by the student.  Common supports required by students who are deaf or hard of hearing include Irish sign language, note-taking and academic learning support.  As an initial course of action, it would be advised that any third level students requiring support of this nature should contact the access or disability officer in the institution in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">I understand that decisions on some applications made to the fund for students with disabilities for 2009-2010 are still being processed.  Information on the fund for students with disabilities and on all other State supports available to students at third level is available from the HEA website, <i>www.studentfinance.ie.  </i>I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
            <p eId="para_1128">I thank the Minister of State for his attendance.  It is appropriate that he is here as he has children who attended and some of whom still attend this august institution.  I am sure he will agree the parents of children at this school have been extraordinarily patient.  They have sought an extension to the school since 1988.  They were promised the extension and it was approved in 1998 and they were told the building would start in the year 2000.  Now, as we enter the second decade of the third millennium, they are still without their school.  Their patience has rightly snapped.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">St. Oliver Plunkett national school is the third largest national school in the country with more than 900 students.  It depends on ten portakabins for classes for approximately 300 of its children and a further three portakabins for learning support.  The problem is these portakabins are old and poorly sealed.  They are very draughty and the badly hung doors cannot be shut properly.  The portakabins are poorly insulated and are too cold in the winter and too hot in the summer.  If the doors and windows are left open, the noise from the road and surroundings is too great and interferes with pupils' ability to concentrate and learn.  Children in the portakabins have an increased number of complaints of aches and pains as a result of sitting in draughts.  Owing to the fact the portakabins are poorly ventilated, air becomes stagnant very quickly and children find it difficult to focus and concentrate.  Low ceilings do not help the situation.  There is no sound-proofing in the portakabins which means that noise levels from neighbouring classes are distracting and frustrating.  There is poor lighting due to the position of some portakabins and fluorescent lights are on all day all year around and cause headaches and eyestrain for some.  Windows have no blinds or covers and children are easily distracted by outside activity, especially when pupils are moving from classes for PE and other activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130">Basic services for the portakabins, such as water, light and heat, are unreliable.  In winter it is a common occurrence to suffer a power failure due to over-reliance on electrical heaters in portakabins.  Valuable time is lost from the timetable each day at junior yard time or when PE classes take place.  At infant dismissal time, noise levels make it impossible for those in classrooms near the road to work as parents gathering at the gate for the 2.30 p.m. early dismissal cause distraction for children.  Time is also lost when going to PE, the library or computer room as the portakabins are a good distance from the rest of the building.  In inclement weather the children get wet when moving and suffer health problems as a result.  The health and safety of children and teachers are compromised every day, and because of tight space and poor ventilation, sickness spreads quickly from one child to another.  It has also been asserted that children in portakabins have a higher absentee rate than those in proper classrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">Portakabins are a poor environment for children who suffer from asthma, bronchitis or compromised immune systems.  Their health is not being helped by an environment where mould and fungus grow on the walls and ceilings.  There is a lack of space for hanging coats and in inclement weather wet coats must hang on the backs of children's chairs, causing their health to suffer.  Dust and condensation increase in such conditions and this has obvious health implications.  Special needs children cannot be accommodated owing to steps, limited space in bathrooms and insufficient room for special needs assistants.  The list goes on.  To cut to the quick, on account of the appalling toilet facilities, many children will not use them, leading to urinary and faecal retention.  There have been many admissions to Temple Street Hospital for non-specific abdominal pain and increased attendance at local general practitioners who say there is a much higher incidence of respiratory tract infections and medical problems among these children.  One child was admitted to Temple Street Hospital recently with pneumonia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The Minister of State cannot be happy with this situation.  These people have waited patiently.  We are supposed to be a modern society.  When we had very little in the 1950s, we could afford stone and brick to house and educate our children.  Today we are stuck with portakabins.  I urge the Minister of State to expedite the building of this school and to alleviate the shock it has suffered in finding it has slipped back to band 2.2 when it should be in the 1.1 band, having waited so long.  The parents cannot take much more of this.  I expect there will be serious disruption in the area.  I must offer them 100% support because their children's welfare is at stake, from the point of view of both health and education.  I appeal to the Minister of State to use his undoubted influence to progress this matter.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey</from>
            <p eId="para_1133">I declare a vested interest in this matter.  Two of my children attended this school and two are still being educated there.  Therefore, I am familiar with the issue.  I am taking this debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  I thank Deputy Reilly for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and the current position regarding St. Oliver Plunkett national school, Malahide, County Dublin, roll No. 17914S.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">Modernising facilities in the existing building stock and responding to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth present significant challenges.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings and site capacity.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects which were devised following consultation with the education partners.  The original criteria were revised and refined in 2004.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the schools building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need, as reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  The building project for St. Oliver Plunkett national school has been assigned a band 2.2 rating.  The project is at an early stage of architectural planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">With regard to the Deputy's concerns regarding the temporary accommodation units at the school, these have been reviewed recently as part of a strategy adopted by the Department to achieve best value for money and to reduce overall rental costs for schools in general.  One aspect of the review involves negotiations with prefab suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts or to negotiate reductions in annual rent, as appropriate.  An initial group of 46 schools with rented prefabricated accommodation has been identified for priority negotiations with suppliers to buy out existing rental contracts.  A number of these prefabs have now been bought out, including the prefabs at St. Oliver Plunkett's, and negotiations are ongoing with a view to ending rental contracts for as many schools as possible in 2010.  The chartered surveyors engaged by the Department to assist in this process carried out a site visit at St. Oliver Plunkett's on 26 June 2009 and provided the Department with a report confirming that the units are in good condition and well maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_1138">The school authority was advised that this change in the funding arrangement for its temporary accommodation would not affect any application the school may have for permanent accommodation under the schools building and modernisation programme.  The brief for the current project is to provide accommodation on the current school site for long-term projected staffing of a principal, 32 mainstream teachers plus ancillary staff.  Representatives from the board of management have been invited to meet Department officials to discuss the current school building project and their current proposals in this regard.  That meeting will take place next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.  The proposed building project will be considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2010 and subsequent years.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the delivery of the project at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1143">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is at present carrying out a review of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) allocations in all schools.  The purpose of this review is to ensure that all SNA posts meet the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's Circular 07/02.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">As part of this review, the NCSE will identify and suppress any surplus posts  which do not meet the scheme's criteria — for example, posts that have been  retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or when the pupil has left.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The allocation for any school, and any adjustments to that allocation, depends  on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs  leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any  surplus identified. Furthermore, schools can make applications at any time with  the result that the individual situation of any school can change and allocations are not static for a school year in the same way as are, for example, classroom teaching posts. The NCSE is independent in the making and issuing of its decisions relating to SNA allocations. SENOs are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">The NCSE has advised that the review will be completed by end March 2010. I  will be glad to advise the Deputy of the outcome of the review once it is complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">I wish to assure the Deputy that SNA support will continue to be made available  to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1158">Over the course of the operation of the scheme, a total of €177m was spent on  almost 400 schools throughout the country, leading to a very welcome  improvement in the standard of accommodation available in these schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">Under the Value for Money Framework, the operation of the Small Schools Scheme was reviewed and reported on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">The review was carried out to determine the value to the building programme of  the Small Schools Initiative (SSI) and the Permanent Accommodation Initiative  (PAI), devolving funding and responsibility on school management authorities  (SMAs) to enable them to manage and complete their own building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">The review found that the schemes provided value for money for the taxpayer  with effective funding control mechanisms.  The schemes met accommodation  deficits in schools in a satisfactory manner.  The review found that devolution  of funding and responsibility to SMAs worked well but suggested additional  advice and information on their duties be provided to the SMAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1162">The majority of the recommendations contained in the review have been  implemented resulting in increased administrative efficiencies in the  administration of the schemes which allowed almost 400 schools to benefit from  funding under the SSS between 2003 and 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_1166">As announced in the Budget, a reduction of 5% is being applied to the rates of student grants and scholarships.  This reduction is being implemented in respect of all existing and new grant-holders from January 2010.  This reduction is broadly in line with reductions in other income maintenance payments including those for the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">The reductions in the rates of student grants were necessary to ensure that the  system is not extended beyond what current resources will allow in a climate of  overall pressures on public finances and a background of reducing rental and  other costs of living for students, as evidenced by latest CPI figures which  indicate that deflation is now running at 5.0% (December 2008 to December 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_1168">Students who qualify for maintenance grants will continue to receive  substantial grant funding, together with full support for payment of the  student service charge. Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to  receive a "top-up" in the special rate of maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1169">In addition, some €5m will continue to be made available through the access  offices of third-level institutions to assist students in exceptional financial  need.

            <p eId="para_1180">I am aware that some students are experiencing delays in the processing of their grant applications and appreciate the individual difficulties this can involve.  It is understood that both local authorities and VECs, the awarding bodies for student grants, received an unprecedented number of student grant applications this year with increases in applications up by 30% in some areas.  In some instances, late applications are still being received.  Both VECs and local authorities are experiencing pressures due to the increased workload associated with the increased demand for the schemes, particularly in the context of the recruitment moratorium in the public sector.  In some instances, this is affecting the processing of grants.  However, every effort is being made by these bodies to ensure that students get decisions on their grant applications and are paid as soon as possible.  The current difficult economic circumstances have necessitated tough choices to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run, including the need to implement a recruitment and promotion moratorium in the public sector.  It is inevitable that staffing constraints on public bodies will lead to certain pressures on services.  However, these bodies, even in these challenging circumstances, are endeavouring to ensure that the work associated with the processing of grants is prioritised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">Apart from the pressures associated with the volume of applications, a significant number of outstanding grant applications have not been processed in full because the applications were incomplete.  I remind students and their parents to return all necessary supporting documentation as early as possible to help the awarding bodies make prompt decisions on entitlement.  On my request, the Higher Education Authority has also asked institutions to be flexible in respect of requests for payment of the student services charge from students who are still awaiting a decision on their grant application.  In the longer run, I am assessing organisational options for the processing of grant applications with a view to streamlining operations and achieving more effective administrative efficiencies.  Possible options for a more significant aggregation of functions are now being explored in the context of budgetary considerations and the Government's overall programme of public service reform.  In the interim, my Department is working closely with local authorities and VECs on a number of initiatives, some of which are already leading to service improvements for students as well as alleviating some of the pressures on awarding authorities.  These initiatives include the provision of advance payments for student grants to all awarding authorities, migration of grant payments directly to students on a phased basis by way of electronic funds transfer and improvements to the grant application process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1183">The supply teacher scheme will cease from the start of the 2010-11 school year.  The teachers concerned will be redeployed in accordance with the existing redeployment arrangements to other schools that have vacancies.  It is expected that this measure will save €400,000 in 2010 and €1.1 million in a full year.  There are 60 posts allocated to the scheme.  A value for money review was published in July 2006.  The review found that approximately 60% of these teachers' time was used to cover sick leave absences with the balance on various other school duties.  This reflects the unpredictable nature of sick leave absences.  While there are benefits for schools in having these full-time teachers, it is considered more cost-effective to use the normal substitution arrangements that apply to all other schools to cover sick leave absences instead of having a cohort of full-time teachers ‘‘on call'' all the time in these schools to cover sick leave absences that may or may not arise.</p>

Similarly, the withdrawal of the Millennium Partnership Fund was considered necessary to ensure that the system is not extended beyond what current resources will allow.  The Millennium Partnership Fund, introduced by the Government from 2000, was disbursed by local partnership companies in disadvantaged areas, mostly in the form of small grants to individual students to cover costs of items such as books and travel.  Most students in receipt of support from the fund will continue to qualify for the means-tested student maintenance grant and many will benefit from the significantly higher special rate of grant.  In addition, the Student Assistance Fund, administered by access officers in individual academic institutions, will continue to be available to meet costs in hardship cases for items such as books and travel at third level.</p>

            <p eId="para_1187">The Government is committed to ensuring that all children with special educational needs, including those with autism, can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local special educational needs organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special educational needs.  I attach, for the Deputy's information, a list provided by the NCSE of schools approved for ASD classes.  When a school is approved for an ASD unit, and its existing accommodation does not meet this need, the school may apply to the Department for funding for such accommodation.  All such applications are afforded a high priority.  I can confirm to the Deputy that all schools establishing new ASD classes in September 2009, and that applied to my Department for funding, were provided with funding to enable them to do so.  In some cases, as it was not possible to carry out a major extension to the school in the time available, temporary accommodation was put in place.  Major projects involving the provision of ASD facilities are assessed under the prioritisation criteria for large scale projects and, where appropriate, assigned a band 1.2, reflecting the high priority attached to such projects.  Consideration is also given to the inclusion of ASD facilities in all new school buildings based on advice from the NCSE.  A band rating of 1.2 is assigned not only to ASD units but to special schools and projects with any element of special needs provision.  The Department currently has in the order of 75 applications with a band rating of 1.2 and a further 17 such projects in architectural planning.  A number of projects with a higher band rating of 1.1, assigned to projects in rapidly developing areas, also include ASD units.  The Government is committed to ensuring that all children with special educational needs have access to appropriate facilities and, as such, will continue to prioritise the provision of funding to capital projects providing facilities for such children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1195">The Deputy will be aware that the home tuition scheme provides funding to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme funds tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also provides funding for early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism where a school-based placement is not available.  Information on the scheme including criteria for eligibility for tuition is detailed annually by circular to schools and parents.  The circular clearly states that home tuition funding for children awaiting placement, or for children with autism eligible for early intervention, is only provided where a school based placement is not available.  The letters of sanction also advise parents/guardians that funding ceases once a school based placement becomes available.  My Department encourages parents and school authorities to engage locally with the NCSE regarding children's education. School placements do become available during the academic year as new classes open, pupils leave or are successfully mainstreamed.  Careful planning between the NCSE, school authorities and parents can assist in making a smooth transition from home to school based tuition for the child in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1197">The Pupil-Teacher Ratio in respect of all primary schools is only available at national level — it is not disaggregated by county or by any other variable.  Information on pupil-teacher ratios is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The data for the current school year (2009-10) are being compiled by my Department.  The final outcome will be available later in the year.  The ratios for the previous four years were 2005-06, 16.6; 2006-07, 16.0; 2007-08, 16.0; and 2008-09, 15.9.  The Deputy will be aware that the Revised Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.  Under the revised programme there is a commitment to provide 500 teaching posts between primary and second levels over the next three years.  These posts will be allocated to the schools that are most seriously affected by the recent increase in the pupil-teacher ratio, using objective criteria.  Following consultation with the education partners, it is proposed that 200 of the teaching posts will be allocated in the current school year, 100 to each of the primary and post-primary sectors.  My Department has met the education partners to discuss the criteria to use to allocate the posts within each sector.  All the education partners are anxious to ensure that the allocation criteria are clear and transparent and, where possible, the posts should be allocated in a manner that minimises the administrative burden for schools and the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_1199">Provisions in relation to school closures are set out in my Department's circulars; 11/95 (for primary schools) and M29/95 (for post-primary schools).  In accordance with these circulars, decisions on the need for and duration of exceptional closures rest with individual school authorities. The circulars provide that, in general, a school closure due to unforeseen circumstances should be compensated for later in the school year.  I have already said I will not be dogmatic with schools on the issue.  While schools should make all reasonable efforts to make up for lost time, it is accepted that there are practical considerations for boards to consider when making their decisions on the issue.  It is important to recognise that this has not been a normal year and that the appropriate response of the Department in the circumstances is to allow school boards and school principals determine what can reasonably be done to ensure that by the end of the school year, courses and programmes have been completed.  Senior officials from the Department recently held separate meetings with the primary and post-primary education partners.  Those discussions took account of the strong tradition by schools and teachers of looking after the interests of their pupils.  I am confident that any impact on teaching and learning can be addressed through good co-operation between school management, teachers and pupils supported by their parents.</p>

            <p eId="para_1201">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of Special Educational Needs Organisers, is carrying out a review of Special Needs Assistant allocations in all schools with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts, as outlined in my Department's circular 07/02, are properly met.  This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left.  Special Educational Needs Organisers are communicating the outcome of the review directly to schools as the review progresses.  The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care or medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils, the changing needs of the pupils and any surplus identified.  It is expected that the NCSE will have completed the review by the end of March 2010.  I assure the Deputy that Special Needs Assistant support will continue to be made available to schools which have enrolled pupils who qualify for such support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1205">The industrial dispute involving workers from the company in question resulted from workers' concerns over the company's cost cutting proposals, involving redundancies and the introduction of new contracts of employment for the remaining workforce.  The issues were referred to the Labour Court under section 20(1) of the Industrial Relations Act 1969.  The union undertook to be bound by the court's recommendation.  The Labour Court hearing took place on 28 September 2009.  The company did not attend the court hearing, but provided a written statement setting out its position on the matters in dispute.  The Labour Court issued its recommendation on 12 October 2009.  The Labour Court recommended that the company should pay redundancy terms of six weeks pay per year of service, inclusive of statutory entitlement.  Any outstanding issues that could not be agreed between the parties, including the issue of selection criteria for redundancy, should be referred to an arbitrator for final decision.  I understand that the company agreed to accept the Labour Court recommendation.  Subsequently, a resolution to several issues in dispute was achieved at talks between the company and the union.  In November 2009, the Labour Court nominated Mr. Finbarr Flood as arbitrator to consider the remaining outstanding issues.  The arbitrator met the parties and issued his final and binding decision to the parties.  In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court undoubtedly offers the best avenue for resolving the issues in this difficult dispute.  In this context, I urge the company to give positive consideration to the court's recommendation on the dispute and to abide by the final decision made by the arbitrator appointed by the court in this matter.  In view of the renewed contacts pursued in a constructive spirit between the parties subsequent to the Labour Court's recommendation, I urge both sides to bring that same spirit to bear on the current situation.</p>

There are some paid claims on this Department's files dating from some years ago as well as in 2009 in the case of Sigma Telecom.  There is also one single outstanding claim from Sigma Wireless dating from 2009.  The Redundancy Payments Scheme established under the Redundancy Acts 1967–2007 provides for payment of redundancy entitlements in respect of eligible employees as defined in the legislation.   It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation exists and to notify this Department using an RP 50 form which can be downloaded from the Department's website.  Under the Insolvency Payments Scheme, established under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984, payments may be applicable in respect of certain entitlements owed to employees by their employer at the time of liquidation.  Claims in respect of such entitlements can be processed if a company is insolvent within the definition of the Act and a "relevant officer" — normally, a receiver or liquidator — has been appointed and certifies the claims.  On 18 January 2010, a group of approximately 25 staff from Sigma Wireless presented voluntarily to register with FÁS.  No formal notification of receivership has been received to date by FÁS and local attempts to contact the company have been unsuccessful.  The full range of FÁS services is available to any affected staff in a group or on an individual basis.  These services include interviews, individually and/or in groups, with affected workers to outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a Skills Analysis Report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral by FÁS of redundant workers to jobs, training courses or other options; and arrangement by FÁS of special or customised courses where necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_1245">FÁS employment services division, through its network of offices, provides vocational guidance and support to individual clients who are seeking to re-enter employment or avail of training.  To facilitate this process FÁS employment services can fund certain training requirements through a FÁS technical employment support grant.  The technical employment support grant has been designed to provide FÁS employment services officers with a tool to implement a range of responses within the context of a client's agreed career action plan.  The aim of the technical employment support grant is to meet the training needs of the client, where these cannot be met by FÁS directly or any other state provider, within a reasonable timeframe or at a location convenient to the jobseeker.  In relation to the two training programmes highlighted by the Deputy, support could be made available if they were identified in the context of the guidance process and the client's agreed career action plan.  FÁS has recently reviewed the guidelines, which underpin the technical employment support grant, with the aim of ensuring a consistency of application and it should now be available from all FÁS employment services offices.  The amount available under the technical employment support grant for training interventions is €950. In exceptional circumstances, when jobseekers are experiencing extreme employability barriers, an upper limit of €2,500 may apply. In 2009 in excess of 12,000 clients received support from FÁS through the technical employment support grant scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1249">There have been a number of developments relating to the Government's commitments in the renewed Programme for Government on protecting the family home and helping those in debt.  I particularly refer to the recent Government decisions on matters relating to indebtedness, mortgage arrears, personal debt management and enforcement.  I approved the establishment of an interdepartmental mortgage arrears review group, chaired by my Department, for the purpose of collecting information and examining options, including initiatives in other jurisdictions, in relation to mortgage arrears and repossessions.  This group has met on a number of occasions.  Work has commenced on bringing forward options for dealing with these matters.  In addition, in my budget speech in December, the Government refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market, many of whom find themselves in negative equity.  A home owner whose entitlement to mortgage interest relief would have expired in 2010 or after will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.  The Deputy will be aware of other supports in place, including the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the mortgage interest subsidy scheme and the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Service, all of which I have spoken about extensively in this House over recent months.  Since my budget speech, I have written to the Financial Regulator to ask that consideration be given to extending the moratorium on mortgage arrears from six months to 12 months for all mortgage lenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">The Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on personal debt management and debt enforcement, which was published in September 2009, contains an extensive list of provisional recommendations for reform of the law on personal debt that includes provision for a system of non-judicial debt settlement.  The Commission has indicated that the date for completion of submissions on its paper is the end of January 2010.  It is aiming to have its Final Report available by end of August 2010.   The Government has also approved the establishment of an interdepartmental working group on personal debt management and enforcement, chaired by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the commitment under "Helping those in Debt" envisaged in the renewed Programme for Government.  In addition, the working group will agree a plan for implementation, where appropriate, of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations, assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive administrative and legislative response to the issues arising, and determine those administrative and legislative measures that can be implemented in a cost efficient manner for early effective results.  The Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Act 2009, provides that certain safeguards will apply to the provisions under which a court may hear an application or grant an imprisonment order against a debtor who has failed to comply with an instalment order.  The Act ensures that the court will not imprison the debtor unless it is satisfied that he has the means to pay and may also postpone the execution of an imprisonment order until such time as it thinks just.  In addition, the court will inform a debtor of the risk of imprisonment and of his entitlement to apply for legal aid.  The Act gives the court a clear power to vary the terms of an order to pay by instalments or alternatively to refer the parties for mediation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1264">As is the norm in the course of the Budgetary preparations my Department carried out various technical analyses, including an assessment of the impact of falling consumer prices on households by social type and income decile.  The Department's technical analysis suggested that prices were falling — on average — for all households both by income decile and head of household type.  While there are statistical caveats associated with this type of technical analysis the methodology is in line with work already carried out by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI).</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">In relation to the impact of falling consumer prices the methodology involved consumption weights for different types of household from the most recent Household Budget Survey which was carried out in 2004-05.  Rates of change for various categories of consumer prices were then applied to these weights to get consumer price changes for the different household types.</p>

            <p eId="para_1273">The Deputy will be aware that in my role as Minister for Finance, I set out the legislative framework within which offences and penalties are contained.  The Financial Regulator is empowered under the Central Bank Acts to initiate administrative sanctions procedures (ASP) where it suspects, on reasonable grounds, that a prescribed contravention may have been committed by a regulated financial service provider.  Breaches of the obligations under the Market Abuse, Prospectus and Transparency Regulations are subject to a separate, but equivalent, sanctioning framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">The following sanctions may be imposed:</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">Caution or reprimand;</p>

            <p eId="para_1279">Direction to cease the contravention if it is found the contravention is continuing;</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">Direction to pay all or part of the costs of the investigation and inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">Obviously, it is important that where offence and penalty provisions are provided for in law that they are properly enforced.  In this regard, the Financial Regulator has imposed fines amounting to €7,372,500, 7 Disqualifications ranging from 1 to 5 years and 19 Reprimands.  Details of all sanctions in any given year are published annually in the Annual Report of the Financial Regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">The sanctions imposed to 2008 are broken down as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_1389">I have always accepted the consensus view of the relevant expert bodies that the introduction of a universal high uptake vaccination programme in young girls, in conjunction with population based cervical screening, could significantly reduce overall cervical cancer incidence.  The issue was not, therefore, whether the case for a cervical cancer vaccination programme was accepted by myself and the Government — because it always was — but how to place such a programme in order of clinical priorities for the allocation of scarce resources available for public health services and for the cancer programme in particular.  Recently I requested the HSE to initiate a tendering process for the procurement of a HPV vaccine with a view to commencing a HPV vaccination programme for all girls in first year in secondary school and until this process was completed I was not in a position to say if or when I would introduce this programme.  This tendering process for the vaccine is now complete.  We can now purchase the vaccine at a price much lower than we expected to pay in 2008 and at a price much closer to what is being paid in other countries.  In these circumstances, the programme can now be delivered from the extra resources committed in this year's budget to the overall Cancer Programme.  The HSE is committed to starting this campaign during the current school year.  This will involve the free vaccination of up to 30,000 girls mainly in school settings and an announcement of the details of the full programme involved will be made by the HSE in the near future.  The programme will continue with vaccine being offered to all girls in first year in secondary school each year but it is not proposed to extend the vaccination programme to other classes at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_1441">I have responsibility for the implementation of the free pre-school year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which commenced earlier this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">Approximately 4,000 pre-school services are participating in the ECCE scheme and are currently making returns to my Office giving details of qualifying children attending their services.  As the deadline for service returns is 29 January 2009, the number of children participating in the ECCE scheme at this point will not be known until next week.  However on the basis of the returns received to date, it would appear that some 50,000 children, or 80% of children in their pre-school year, are availing of the scheme.  This would represent a very high take-up of the scheme, particularly in its initial period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">Even if the take-up of the scheme was not as high as would appear to be the case, I do not understand why this would give rise to a reduction in the number of staff employed by pre-school services.  It would appear to me that the scheme will have the opposite effect in that the number of children attending these services will increase, given that the scheme provides a free pre-school year relieving parents of the cost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">As the Deputy is aware, the scheme is open to children aged between three years three months and four years six months at 1 September each year.  The most generous interpretation possible is being applied to this age range so that all children aged more than three years two months and all children aged less than four years seven months (i.e. born on or between 2 February and 30 July in the relevant year) will qualify.  Children who were aged three years two months or slightly younger at 1 September 2009 will not qualify for the pre-school year until September 2010.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">While the majority of children commence school between the age of four years six months and five years six months, it is accepted that some parents choose to send their children to primary school at an earlier age and the ECCE scheme allows for children to attend the pre-school year and still commence primary school when they are just over four years two months of age.  However, the objective of the scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school, with appropriate age related activities and programmes being provided to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the pre-school year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will participate in the scheme each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">I am satisfied that the age range set for the scheme achieves a reasonable balance between supporting the provision of appropriate age related programmes and activities and providing flexibility to parents and their children and there are no plans to review the position in this regard at this stage.</p>

         the reason he has appeared to ignore the pleas made during the second stage of the Adoption Bill to facilitate those applicants who are already at an advanced stage to proceed with adoptions from Vietnam, subject to strict monitoring on child welfare issues in view of the concerns expressed by her regarding two recent reports, before closing the door until Vietnam ratifies the Hague Convention; the efforts that will be made to facilitate such individuals in view of the investment they have made financially and personally in preparing to adopt from Vietnam; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_1448">In the process of re-negotiating the bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption with Vietnam serious issues came to light in relation to the Vietnamese adoption process.  The issues were contained in the report on inter-country adoption commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and carried out by International Social Services (ISS).  An earlier report published last August by the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) was also considered in this regard.  The UNICEF/ISS report, which was accepted by the Vietnamese Government, "proposes that Vietnam suspends inter-country adoptions for the necessary period during the year 2010 that will enable it to ensure optimal implementation of the Hague Convention and to prepare for the entry into force of the new law on adoption in 2011".  The report also raises serious questions regarding adoption practices in Vietnam, including as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">(a) inter-country adoptions from Vietnam are essentially influenced by foreign demand, i.e. the availability of children who are "adoptable" abroad corresponds more to the existence of foreign prospective adopters than to the actual needs of "abandoned" and orphaned children;</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">(b) the circumstances under which babies become "adoptable" are invariably unclear and disturbing;</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">(c) the inter-country adoption system is grounded in a remarkably unhealthy relationship between the mediating agencies and specific residential facilities; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">(d) Governments and central authorities of "receiving countries" collectively at least, and individually in many instances have not effectively committed themselves to applying the basic principles of the Hague Convention or the recommendations of the treaty's practical operation, in their dealings with Vietnam.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">Having considered the contents of the two reports the Government decided, on 13 January, to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral inter-country adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.  As a result of this decision, all inter-country adoptions from Vietnam will be suspended until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 has been enacted and both Ireland and Vietnam have ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention.</p>

I am unable to provide figures for attendance at union business by grades at assistant principal level and higher who are not on flexi-time but in proportionate terms they would be quite similar to other grades.  I can assure the Deputy that in all cases the terms of circular 14/1980 are adhered to.</p>

It deals comprehensively with the issue of safe cycling, including the need for basic cycle training and behaviour and awareness of road users towards the needs of cyclists.  It also provides for the improvement of the legislative framework around cycling and progress has already been made on the implementation of this objective, beginning in December last when I signed the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 2009 (S.I.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 24 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is in the final stages and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

Such students are not required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and therefore statistical information in relation to this cohort of students is not available.  However, non-EEA national students attending courses for longer than 90 days are required to register with the Garda National Immigration Bureau and therefore certain limited statistical information is available in relation to such students.</p>

            <p eId="para_1708">I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">As I have previously informed the House, special funding of €2.5 million was allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the appointment of 20 Sports Inclusion Development Officers (SIDOs) in Local Sports Partnerships (LSPs) in 2008.  The SIDOs were appointed on two-year contracts to provide opportunities for persons with a disability to participate in sport and physical activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">A network of 33 LSPs have been set up throughout the country by the Irish Sports Council (ISC) to coordinate and promote sport at local level especially amongst specific target groups such as older people, girls and women, people with disabilities, unemployed people, and those who live in identified disadvantaged communities.  The special dormant accounts funding was in addition to the annual funding provided to the LSPs by the ISC for programmes and initiatives aimed at increasing participation in recreational sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">Of the €2.5 million allocated from the dormant accounts fund for the SIDO scheme, €800,000 was provided through my Department's Vote in 2008 and over €1.3 million in 2009.  The final provision of €395,000 from the dormant accounts allocation is included in the 2010 Vote of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">The continued funding of the SIDO scheme is being considered by the ISC in the context of the distribution of its budget for 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1714">In my view, Garda vetting of all sports leaders and coaches who work with children is of the utmost importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">The Irish Sports Council (ISC), which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body responsible for the promotion, development and coordination of sport which includes responsibility for dealing with the recognised sporting organisations and allocation of funding to same. The ISC was established on a statutory basis on 1st July, 1999, and the functions of the Council are outlined in Section 6 of the Irish Sports Council Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">This includes recognition, for purposes of funding or for any other reason, of any sporting or recreational activity, including dealing with sporting organisations and allocation of funding to same. All recognised National Governing Bodies of Sport (NGBs) now have access to Garda vetting through the Irish Sports Council.  National Governing Bodies are now implementing vetting across their organizations, on a phased basis, based on their own needs and priorities and their capacity to manage the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">The Irish Sports Council provides support to National Governing Bodies (NGBs) to implement the recommendations and policies of the Code of Ethics and Good Practice for Children's Sport in Ireland.  NGBs are required to comply with these requirements in order to access ISC funding but as Garda vetting is only recently available to NGBs this compliance has not yet been extended to vetting.  However, the ISC would hope to make Garda vetting a requirement for NGBs in order to secure ISC funding, in next year's applications.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1725">As I outlined previously to the House, my Department has seen the need to redesign its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the Local Development Social Inclusion (LDSIP) and Community Development Programmes (CDP), drawing on good international practice and to support the ongoing evaluation of the programmes.  Both programmes have a community development element and were delivered through separate local delivery structures. These programmes came to an end on 31 December 2009 and have been superseded by a new programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">The aim of the new programme is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government and its agencies and people in disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">The new programme will preserve elements of good practice from the CDP/LDSIP Programmes and will enable groups to objectively demonstrate the positive impacts they are securing for local communities.  An implementation strategy, involving the stakeholders, is underway in preparation for LCDP roll-out over the course of 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">In advance of proceeding to establish a single programme across CDPs and Partnerships, my Department undertook an evaluation of individual community development projects. Many of these projects span across two decades, with quite diverse activities. The objective of the review was to identify those projects that produce tangible, appropriate benefits for the communities they serve. The vast majority of projects, including the project referred to by the Deputy, fall into this category and have been offered funding under the new programme in 2010. Where projects were not recommended for continued funding, an appropriate appeals mechanism has been provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">I am pleased to have been able to ring-fence funding for community development projects for 2010 and to maintain it at 2009 levels. In few other areas of public spending has it been possible to do this. The Deputy will appreciate that ongoing funding for 2011 and beyond will be subject to budgetary considerations at the appropriate time.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy John Curran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1735">I have voiced my concerns in regard to the activities of headshops — and substances represented as "legal highs" — on numerous occasions since my appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy.  My concerns in relation to these substances centre on:</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">the potential health hazards arising from the use of these products; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">the possibility that their use may act as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs;</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">This issue is causing concern across Europe and a number of countries, including the UK, have taken action, each adapting their approach to reflect their laws and experiences.  However, no EU Member State has come up with a comprehensive response thus far.  The National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, which I launched in September 2009, will be addressing the issues involved through two specific actions. These will involve:</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">monitoring the activities of headshops and all businesses involved in the sale of psychoactive substances, with the objective of ensuring that no illegal activity is undertaken and taking appropriate steps to reform legislation in this area, where it is deemed to be appropriate; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">keeping drugs-related legislation under continuous review, with particular focus on new synthetic substances and new or changed uses of psychoactive substances, against the background of EU and broader international experience and best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">As provided for under the new Strategy, I held a number of meetings in late 2009 with the Ministers for Health &amp; Children, Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform and Education &amp; Science.  I have also met with the Garda Commissioner and with senior officials of various Departments and Offices.  Headshops and the sale of "legal highs" were discussed at many of these meetings and some possibilities for addressing the activities of headshops were suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">More recently, I have asked my colleague, Mary Harney T.D., Minister for Health &amp; Children, who has overall responsibility for the Misuse of Drugs Act — which is the primary legislation through which these substances can be regulated — to ensure that every effort is made to expedite the response to this issue through the early control of substances under the Act.  I am of the view that immediate steps should be taken to progress this, with the matter being addressed in two tranches if there are particular complications in regard to some substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">Furthermore, it should be noted that the activities of these establishments are being monitored on an on-going basis by both An Garda Síochána and Revenue's Customs Service with a view to ensuring that no substances that are currently illegal are being sold.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">I have also been in contact with the Attorney General about other possible approaches to the matter.  Associated with this, I have raised issues around public liability insurance, product liability insurance and consumer protection with the Department of Enterprise, Trade &amp; Employment, as well as planning issues with the Departments of Environment, Heritage &amp; Local Government.  I have also asked the National Advisory Committee on Drugs to carry out some research in this area, taking account in particular of the approach adopted in the legislation recently introduced in the UK.  Reflecting the concerns being expressed throughout society, the Midlands Regional Drugs Task Force hosted a conference, which I launched earlier this week, to explore the issues involved.  Arising from all this activity, I expect to be able to co-ordinate a full and appropriate response to counter the potential threats involved.</p>

In these cases both spouses are liable to pay PRSI (Class S) contributions in a timely manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, ‘Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements', has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008.  The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.  In this way, both spouses incur a liability to pay self-employed PRSI and build up entitlement towards a contributory state pension and other social welfare benefits.  It is open to any person to apply for recognition of a commercial partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">The qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) require the applicant to:</p>

            <p eId="para_1790">(b) all self-employment contributions payable by him or her have been paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">Section 110(1) (a) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005, has been on the statute books for over fifteen years and there has not been a change in policy in relation to the requirement to have paid at least one year's self employment contributions prior to reaching age 66, in order to qualify for a State Pension (Contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">All claims for State Pension (Contributory) arising out of the retrospective recognition of a commercial partnership are decided in accordance with Section 110(1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005.  Section 110(2) has not been applied to these cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Approximately 1,000 people applied for recognition of a commercial partnership with their spouses.  Of these, 579 cases have been decided on the basis of whether or not they qualify as a partnership.  Some 508 of those were deemed to have a partnership in existence.  Of these 268 applied for a State Pension (Contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_1794">However, following a review of pension claims, it was found that in certain cases, the self employment contributions were all paid after the persons concerned had passed their 66th birthday.  They therefore had no an entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory), and should not have been paid under this scheme.  85 claims for State Pension (Contributory) which were in payment have been disallowed and 16 customers have had their rates reduced.  A further 46 customers failed to satisfy the qualifying conditions for State Pension (Contributory) and accordingly their claims have been refused.</p>
            <p eId="para_1795">The total amount of overpayments arising in these cases has not yet been determined.  However, overpayments will be determined in the above cases and the customers will be notified and requested to repay the amounts involved.

            <p eId="para_1803">His means were calculated as follows: Spouses' gross weekly pay of €1,054.00 less allowable payroll deductions of €411.67 giving a net weekly pay of €642.89.  This figure is further reduced by €60.00 for days worked and then the remainder assessed at 60% giving him a weekly means of €350.00, to the nearest euro.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">His entitlement was calculated as follows:  Personal rate of €204.30 plus a qualified adult allowance of €135.60, giving a total of €339.90 less weekly means of €350.00, derived from spouse's income.  As his means figure exceeded the amount payable he is not entitled to a jobseeker's allowance payment.</p>

If a favourable commercial partnership decision is reached the person may incur a PRSI liability for the years in question.  In addition, I have arranged for a copy of this person's PRSI contribution record and a ‘Work it out' guide, which explains how the State Pension (Contributory) is calculated, to be issued to her home address, to assist her in assessing her pension entitlement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1839">On foot of a Programme for Government commitment an information leaflet, <i>‘Working with your spouse: how it affects your social welfare contributions and entitlements’ </i>, has been developed between the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to set out the social welfare and tax implications of families co-working in a shared business.  It was published on the 25th of June, 2008. The leaflet clarifies that spouses who operate in a commercial partnership may be brought into the social insurance system, subject to certain criteria.

The person concerned was awarded a State Pension (Contributory) from 10  October 2007.  According to the records of the Department, the self-employment contributions were all paid by the person concerned after their 66 birthday.  The people concerned did not therefore satisfy the condition at (a) above and has no entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory) based on her self-employment contributions, and should not have been put into payment under this scheme.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1945">I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 144 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has for many years now worked towards assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country. Between 1992 and 1999 the RPII carried out a National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objectives were to measure the scale of the radon problem in Ireland and to identify areas at higher risk of radon concentrations above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre<b> </b>cubed<b> </b>(Bq/m3).</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by the build up of radon in the home. Householders, particularly those living in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">Almost 38,000 homes have now been measured for radon by the RPII. The results of these tests have been compiled into a central database, which has greatly aided our knowledge and understanding of the extent of Ireland's radon problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">Furthermore, the RPII has carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas and, in some instances, where areas with particularly high radon levels have been found the RPII has written directly to householders. This approach will be continued so that householders in high radon areas are encouraged to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department: Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options. The RPII has also issued guidance: Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householder's Guide. In addition, the website of the RPII provides a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and the RPII can offer specific advice and recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">The Radiological Protection Act, 1991 (Ionising Radiation) Order 2000 sets a radon concentration of 400 becquerels per metre<b> </b>cubed (Bq/m3), measured over any consecutive three-month period, as the reference level for radon in Irish workplaces. When this Reference Level is exceeded, the employer must take measures to protect the health of workers. Under the legislation, employers can be directed to have radon measurements carried out in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 requires employers to identify all hazards in their workplace, including radon, to assess the risk to health and safety from these hazards and to put in place measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. According to the Heath &amp; Safety Authority, all indoor workplaces in High Radon Areas located at ground floor or basement level must be measured for radon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">Members of the public can access information on radon on the RPII website, <i>www.rpii.ie</i>. Publications and information leaflets about radon can be downloaded free of charge. The RPII can also be contacted on freephone 1800 300 600.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">My Department will continue to work closely with the RPII, the HSE, local authorities and other relevant agencies to raise public awareness and to promote radon testing and remediation. This multi-agency approach to dealing with radon is in line with international best practice, as recommended by the World Health Organisation's International Radon Project which was co-funded by the Irish Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1959">On 29 October 2009, the European Commission decided to refer Ireland back to the European Court of Justice seeking the imposition of fines for failing to implement fully an earlier ruling in relation to Directive 2006/113/EC on the quality of shellfish waters.  The main reasons for escalation of the case related to the designation of shellfish water sites and the absence of Pollution Reduction Programmes for all sites — although these were in the process of being developed.

            <p eId="para_1960">On foot of the original ECJ ruling, 49 new shellfish water sites were designated in February 2009, bringing the total number of designated sites around the coast to 63.  An additional site in Cork Harbour was designated in November 2009.  Pollution Reduction Programmes were completed for all 64 sites in December 2009 and these have since been formally established by me.

            <p eId="para_1964">HCFC-22 (or R22) is a refrigerant gas that has been commonly used in refrigeration and air-conditioning systems for more than four decades. Unfortunately, releases of HCFC-22, such as those from leaks, are damaging to the environment as they contribute to ozone depletion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">R22 gas (HCFC22) has been banned from use in tanks used for the storage of milk in consequence of EU Regulations, which are directly applicable in all Member States, on Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS).  Regulation 2037/2000 (EC), on ODS, essentially banned the use of HCFCs for the manufacture of new equipment in all refrigeration and air-conditioning applications. Furthermore, it prohibits the use of virgin HCFC gases, including HCFC-22, also known as R22, in all existing refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump units from 1 January 2010.  This does not prohibit the use of existing equipment containing HCFCs, but only recycled or reclaimed HCFCs may be used during its service and maintenance. This will be permitted until January 2015. The ban is considered appropriate due to the damaging effect of ODS and because cost effective alternatives are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">The Environmental Protection Agency is the competent authority for the implementation of the ODS Regulations and provides advice and guidance on the controlled use of ODS through its website.  The EPA also produced guidance notes for end users of HCFCs to raise awareness and assist in the phase out process. The guidance notes are available on the Agency's website, <i>www.epa.ie</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1967">There has also been ongoing consultation with the refrigeration industry on ODS through its representative body, the Institute of Refrigeration Ireland, to keep members up to date on developments, and information and guidance is also available on its website, <i>www.instituteofrefrigerationireland.ie</i>

            <p eId="para_1978">Farmers selling bogland to my Department do so under a voluntary scheme where property rights in raised bog Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs) are acquired. There is no compulsion on landowners to sell their interest and there has been no prohibition on cutting for domestic purposes prior to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">Following the end of a 10-year derogation, turf cutting is now due to cease on 32 raised bog Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). Eight of these are wholly or partly in Co. Roscommon; none is in Co. Leitrim.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">Turf cutting is permitted to continue, under existing restrictions, on a further 23 SACs until 2011. Five of these sites are in Co. Roscommon.

            <p eId="para_1986">Split Hills and Long Hill Esker is a site of botanical and ecological importance. It was originally surveyed in 1993 and again in 1994. The proposed designation was advertised in March 1997 and incorporated a quarry at Cuilnamayor as well as an intact ridge further west and an area known as Cuilnamayor Bog. The qualifying criterion for the selection of this area as a candidate Special Area of Conservation is the presence of the priority habitat, Orchid-rich calcareous grasslands.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">The survey carried out in 1994 made reference to the quarried area. The area in question was included on the basis that the fringes of quarried eskers invariably contain interesting remnant grassland and annual communities and that it serves to connect the location of the rare Narrow-leaved Bittercress (<i>Cardamine impatiens</i>) with the main body of the site. On the basis of this survey work proposals to designate the site as a candidate Special Area of Conservation were publicised in March 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_1988">My Department notified the landowners in question about the designation status of this site by registered post in February 2006. The notification pack issued included a map of the area and outlined the ecology of the site, any potential restrictions for landowners/land users and details of compensation measures available to those affected. Regional conservation staff have made a number of visits to the landowners in relation to this designation and have also met with their planning advisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1989">It is not unusual for houses and commercial premises such as quarries and yards to have been included within the boundaries of SACs. This does not imply that such uses, operations or activities must cease, simply by virtue of designation. Change of use, such as the expansion of quarrying, is subject to planning permission and the planning authority must consider the impact of the expansion on the SAC before reaching a conclusion.  My Department has not sought the termination or closure of any business on this site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">Compensation for loss of income due to the designation of a site as a Special Area of Conservation is available to landowners by way of agri-environment schemes where applicable. Compensation may also be payable in accordance with Regulation 20 of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations 1997 — 2005.</p>

A subsequent appeal of this decision to my Department's Agriculture Appeals Committee proved unsuccessful. The person named then appealed to the Agriculture Appeals Office and, during an oral hearing, undertook to furnish my Department with medical evidence in support of his claim for force majeure in 2005. The medical evidence, which was subsequently furnished to my Department on 21 August 2009, was deemed to confirm the claim of the person named for force majeure, on foot of which the 2005 application form, submitted by the person named to my Department on 26 August 2009, was accepted.

It is necessary, therefore, to establish who had use of the land and, in this regard, both parties have been written to in order to clarify the matter. The other claimant to the land insists that he rented the lands in question from the person named for 2005. He has again been requested, as a matter of urgency, to forward documentary proof to this effect to my Department. On receipt of the documentation, the matter will then be further examined, following which an official of my Department will be in direct contact with the person named.</p>

            <p eId="para_2481">The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years.  This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social &amp; Family Affairs in addition to recent schools' enrolment data.</p>
            <p eId="para_2482">The study indicates that the requirement for additional primary provision in years 2010, 2011 and 2012 is likely to be greatest in a total of 42 locations across the country based on significant changes to the demographics of those areas.  The North Kildare area is included in these locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2483">Forward Planning Section is in the process of carrying out an analysis of each of the identified priority locations to establish the school accommodation requirements up to and including the school year 2014/2015.  Following this analysis, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area including North Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_2484">In the interim, it is open to any school authority to apply for temporary accommodation to meet any needs they may have in the intervening period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2486">As the Deputy is aware, I have established a High Level Group to develop a new national strategy for higher education, which will examine how well Ireland's higher education system is performing, how it ranks internationally, how well existing resources are being used and how the system should be configured to best meet the many challenges it faces over the next decade having regard to the key role it has to play in contributing to Ireland's economic recovery.  As part of this work the Group is examining the structure of the higher education system including the number and roles of institutions within it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2487">An open call for written submissions was issued during the summer that elicited over 100 contributions from a wide range of key stakeholders.  These submissions were of relevance to a range of issues that are integral to the formulation of a strategy for the future design and configuration of the system.  In addition to this first round of consultation, a series of discussion forums with academics, students, enterprise and 2nd level as well as bilateral meetings with other stakeholders, including the institutions have been held.  The outcomes of these consultations and other ongoing discussions are feeding into the current deliberations of the Strategy Group who are expected to finalise their report after some further meetings.</p>

            <p eId="para_2898">There is no requirement for local school authorities to report incidents or allegations of bullying to my Department, nor do I believe that this should be the case.  Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school, as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established and at that level that actions should be taken to address allegations of bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_2899">My Department does, however, receive a number of complaints and queries from parents regarding matters such as bullying, involving schools.  It important to highlight that in many instances, parents may be seeking guidance from the  Department on how to resolve an issue or an alleged incident within a school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2900">In 2009 a total of 438 telephone or written complaints/queries were received  from parents regarding bullying in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2901">It should be noted that as the term bullying can be difficult to define prescriptively, complaints/queries logged under the category of bullying are done so based on the terminology used by the parent, as opposed to any  judgement applied by staff as to the nature of the complaint.</p>
            <p eId="para_2902">As details of complaints for the years 2008 and 2007 were not recorded by  individual topic and nature of complaint, accurate statistical data on the  number of complaints or queries received from parents in relation to bullying  is not available for these years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2903">Under the Education Act 1998, legally, all schools are managed, on behalf of  the school Patron or Trustees, by school Boards of Management who employ the  teachers at the school. Whereas as I, as Minister for Education and Science  provide funding and policy direction for schools, neither I, as Minister, or my  Department have the power to instruct schools to follow a particular course or  direction with regards to individual complaint cases.   Accordingly, in dealing  with complaints the Department's role is to provide advice to parents and  students on the operation of schools' complaints procedures and to clarify for  parents and pupils how grievances and complaints against schools can be  progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2904">I am, however, anxious to support schools in tackling bullying and it is for  that reason that a number supports have been put in place in recent years to  assist schools in dealing with this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2905">The Board of Management of each school is required to prepare a code of  behaviour in accordance with Section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. To  assist schools in formulating such a code, the National Educational Welfare  Board (NEWB) has developed guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2906">My Department further requires each school to have in place a policy which  includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the  framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code,  developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly  implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying  behaviour in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2907">The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation  to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a  compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of  post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2908">My Department has also issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising  measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to  increase awareness among school management authorities of their  responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following  consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents,  and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to  suit the particular needs of their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2909">My Department has additionally published policy templates for post-primary  schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying on its website of as part of  our ongoing efforts in this regard. The template documents are not  prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material  for inclusion in school policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2910">The anti-bullying policy template is based primarily on the key document  Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour. However, it does take account of  more recent legislative and regulatory changes, and reference is also made to  issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying,  cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_2913">I propose to take Questions Nos. 194 and 195 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2914">I wish to assure the Deputy that the provision of appropriate educational intervention and supports for children with special educational needs continues to be a key Government priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2915">The Deputy will be aware of my commitment to ensuring that pupils in each disability category can have access to an education appropriate to their needs preferably in school settings through the primary and post-primary school network. There has been unprecedented investment in providing supports for pupils with special needs in recent years. There are now about 19,000 adults in our schools working solely with pupils with special needs. This includes over 10,000 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) — compared with just 300 in 1997. There are over 8,000 resource and learning support teachers in our schools compared with just 2,000 in 1998. Over 1,000 other teachers support pupils in our special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2916">As well as this significant increase in the numbers of additional teachers and SNAs directly providing appropriate education and care supports for children with special educational needs, much investment has taken place in the provision of teacher training, transport, specialist school accommodation, home tuition, assistive technology and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2917">The Deputy will also be aware that the Renewed Programme for Government commits to the expansion in the number of psychologists employed directly by the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS). This will allow for the assignment of a NEPS psychologist to every primary and post-primary school in the country and for the deepening of support therein with particular emphasis on special needs units, classes and special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2918">In relation to autism-specific provision, the Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 380 classes have now been approved at primary and post primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2919">An initiative in November 2006 expanded the level of administrative support available to large schools and schools with high numbers of special classes or a specialist autism unit. The measures included the allocation of additional teachers to allow Deputy Principals in mainstream schools that, in addition to their ordinary mainstream class teachers, also have five or more special classes for children with the more complex, low incidence, special needs, to operate as Administrative Deputy Principals. Where a school has a Principal and four or five mainstream class teachers and also has a specialist autism unit established under approval of NCSE, the Principal will be appointed on an administrative basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2920">My Department will invest further in continuing professional development for teachers of students with special educational needs in 2010 through the Special Education Support Service (SESS). The service consolidates, co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2921">This service provided training to over 23,000 teachers in 2009. Specifically in relation to autism-specific training, my Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the SESS.</p>
            <p eId="para_2922">The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and SNAs will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2923">I want to take this opportunity to emphasise that children with special educational needs will continue to receive an education appropriate to their needs. I intend to build on the progress that has been achieved in recent years which has seen a huge increase in resources for special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2925">The Deputy will be aware that all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), where schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2926">Service to County Kildare is provided by staff in the NEPS Naas office and I can inform the Deputy that over 96% of the counties' schools have a NEPS psychologist assigned in the current academic year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2927">In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2928">The deputy will be aware that the provision of speech and language services is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant Health Authority region.</p>
            <p eId="para_2929">In relation to the further development of the NEPS service the Deputy will also be aware of the commitment within the Renewed Programme for Government to an overall expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers to 210, currently NEPS staffing numbers stand at 154.</p>
            <p eId="para_2930">I can inform the Deputy that my Department and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) is currently actively engaging with seven prospective recruits to NEPS, from an existing recruitment panel, for assignment in the immediate future (two in early February).</p>
            <p eId="para_2931">Discussions are ongoing with the PAS in relation to the setting in place of a new recruitment competition to establish a new panel from which the remaining vacancies may be filled. It is envisaged that this new competition will be announced shortly. When formed, recruitment to the service from this new panel will proceed as quickly as possible.</p>
