          <p eId="para_15">Ar son an choiste, cuirim fáilte roimh an ambasadóir, H.E Mr. Vincent Guérend, agus a chomhghleacaithe go dtí an cruinniú inniú. I welcome the ambassador and his colleagues to this meeting today and look forward to the engagement.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Before we begin, I will read a note on privilege and some housekeeping matters. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or against an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I remind members of the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I am looking at Deputy Harkin there. The train is not on the complex yet. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I would ask members partaking by MS teams prior to making their contribution to the meeting to confirm they are in the Leinster House campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> I call on the ambassador to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">I thank the Chairman for inviting me to this Joint Committee on European Union Affairs meeting. I had the chance to meet many of the members before becoming French ambassador in October 2020. Every day I am enjoying tremendously this function. Now that France is nearing the end of its Presidency, I thought it would be useful to exchange with the committee about and look back at the five, soon six, months of our Presidency. I am delighted to be with the Deputies and Senators. I will make an introductory statement and be glad to answer any question afterwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> As the committee members well know, the French Presidency of the Council of the EU started on 1 January and will end on 30 June. France took the baton from Slovenia and will hand it over to the Czechia. We are part of a so-called trio with Czechia and Sweden.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> As the committee well knows, holding the Council Presidency is a tremendous responsibility for any member state, including for France. In my own career, I have had the chance to follow this in 1995, 2000 and 2008. It has been 14 years since we last held the Presidency.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> As the committee well knows, France sees its destiny very much in the EU and wants the European Union to grow as a political union based on democracy and the rule of law ensuring peace and prosperity to its 450 million citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">That is why France had an ambitious agenda for this Presidency, focusing on three key objectives, namely, recovery, strength and sense of belonging. </p>
          <p eId="para_25"> We believe the recovery chapter of the Presidency remains essential after two years of duress due to the Covid pandemic. We also believe that the EU has taken up the challenge by adopting and rolling out an historical recovery package of more than €800 billion and by co-ordinating the response against the pandemic, on vaccines in particular. As the committee well knows, where there is very little on health in the EU treaties except from a product quality or consumer protection point of view for pharmaceuticals, we have seen a remarkable political mobilisation around, first, vaccines, with procurement, but also with market authorisation and distribution to developing countries. The committee will remember that the EU has been not only ensuring a high degree of vaccination of its own population but it also has been the biggest donor worldwide. In addition, there has been co-ordination around free movement of people and as little limitation as possible to the free movement within the EU for sanitary reasons. On both accounts we believe the EU did well. Certainly, before the French Presidency, but including in the past months. </p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Second, high on our agenda, as kind of a catchword, is strength. It is vocabulary which was not necessarily very associated with the EU before, but we believe that this was very much needed. War is very sadly back on the European Continent and the threats are many. Against this background, the European Union has been remarkably united, swift and resolute in front of the Russian aggression on Ukraine by imposing unprecedented sanctions on the decision-makers in Russia, by supporting Ukraine militarily with a €2 billion military aid package and by extending up to €9 billion in financial and macro-financial aid for the years to come. The EU also has made a leap forward by adopting the so-called EU strategic compass back in March, which is a roadmap to beef up the European defence with as many as 72 concrete projects to be implemented in the three years to come, based on a common strategic threat analysis. </p>
          <p eId="para_27"> The EU is also affirming its strategic thinking by reinforcing its dialogue in co-operation with Africa. A summit between the European Union and the African Union took place in Paris in February to intensify co-operation across the board with Africa as a whole as a political organisation. </p>
          <p eId="para_28"> A ministerial conference between the EU and European ministers from the so-called Indo-Pacific region took place in March to share analysis and reaffirm the opinion and interest in the Indo-Pacific region, which is a region that is strategically so important for peace and prosperity in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> After recover and strength, our third kind of catchword, if I may call it such, is the sense of belonging. The European Union, as the committee well knows, is a political union designed to serve its citizens, not against their wish and will, but with their democratic support. In this respect, the French Presidency has launched several cultural initiatives, with writers, thinkers and youths to nurture the human dimension of the European project, based on diversity, pluralism and multilingualism. I will name two initiatives. We invited, for example, two pupils from each and every member state, certainly also including from Ireland, to go to Strasbourg, spend a few days there and share their expectation on education and Europe's future. We also invited academics from all EU member states to share their thinking about Europe’s future. For Ireland, it was the provost of Trinity College. Also, the Conference on the Future of Europe, which was concluded on 9 May, certainly was a unique opportunity to let European citizens express directly their expectations and aspirations about Europe. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Beyond these key political objectives, the French Presidency was also about pushing the ambitious European legislative agenda built around climate and digital transition. Just perhaps to remind members, as they probably well know, at a given day in Europe, there are as many as 200 or more legislative texts in the legislative pipeline. Therefore, when we started our Presidency on 1 January, we knew that we would not be able to, of course, adopt all the 200 texts, because the legislative process in Europe takes more than six months between the Commission proposal, the First Reading by the Council, the First Reading by the Parliament and, if necessary, a trilogue and Second Reading. We wanted and were determined to push certain agenda, certainly on climate and digital transition. We believe that the result now, close to six months later, is pretty impressive, because many landmark items of legislation have been adopted or have been subject to political agreements between Council and European Parliament. Again, just to name a few, on climate action, there were as many as 13 texts to translate legally the so-called Fit for 55 agenda. We are pushing this across the board. We also achieved a political agreement on the establishment of a so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism, which will create a level playing field between businesses established in the EU and subject to carbon pricing on the one hand and those located outside the EU that are currently not subject to the same rules and climate-friendly measures on the other. There was a political agreement on this, even though of course this text also now will be considered within the larger package of climate change legislation, particularly what we call the emission trading system, ETS, for buildings and transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> On trade, the EU has added a so-called anti-coercion mechanism to its toolbox and will have greater leverage to get access to international public procurement markets. This was much needed to restore a level playing field between, in particular, Europe on the one hand, but also the US and China on the other where, as the committee knows, our companies had no access to public procurement in those two big trade partners, but asymmetrically, American and Chinese companies had full access to our public procurement. Public procurement in Europe is a multibillion euro market. </p>
          <p eId="para_32"> On digital, the political agreement on the so-called Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, two key pieces of legislation to ensure fair competition in the digital industry and increase accountability of large players on harmful content, were very important decisions which will not only better protect European citizens and competition in Europe, but also set benchmarks globally. Agreements were also found on the establishment of a minimum wage around the same principle in all EU member states. This measure is socially progressive and will prevent a race to the bottom at European level when it comes to salaries. Anecdotally, even though it is probably important also in the long term for citizens and consumers, an agreement was found on a universal charging cable. This is also a decision that will prove that the EU is delivering for citizens and setting global standards. </p>
          <p eId="para_33"> More generally, and I will conclude with this, the French Presidency was the occasion, thanks also to the receding pandemic, to organise hundreds of meetings in France at Head of State and Government level, ministerial level and high official levels to share analysis, compare approaches and set common objectives. This is what ultimately the EU is about on a daily basis for decision-makers and officials. </p>
          <p eId="para_34">The Taoiseach, Tánaiste and many members of the Irish Cabinet participated in these events organised throughout France. Ireland's point of view and contribution are much sought after and important in the decision-making process. Ireland's testimony after 50 years of EU membership is a superb illustration of what EU belonging can do best.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Here in Ireland, the French Embassy co-ordinated the work of EU member state embassies around three kinds of activities. First, at ambassadorial level I had the privilege to chair meetings twice per month with high-level guests. We invited the Tánaiste and several Cabinet Ministers, including Deputies Eamon Ryan, Paschal Donohoe, Michael McGrath and Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Senator Hackett. We also involved other political figures, the chairwoman of Sinn Féin and high-ranking officials like the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces and the Data Protection Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> These were closed-door meetings between ambassadors and guests but we also had events for members of academia. We held a conference on plurilingualism in March, introduced by the Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, and one on how to feel European while having national and local identities. This conference was held in Galway with guest speakers from Galway, the west of Ireland, Brittany and Galicia in Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> We had a few events for a broader public. On 9 May, Europe Day, the screening of so-called short shorts took place online and physically in Dublin and Cork. Those short films were directed by various European directors. On the same day, it was an honour and privilege for me and my fellow European ambassadors to join Cabinet Ministers, Deputies Coveney and Michael McGrath, in Cork and visit some schools. Our message to the pupils was simple: Europe is a project of peace and prosperity, based on values. In the current global context, our message was to say we are stronger together. </p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I thank members for their kind attention, belatedly congratulate Ireland for 50 years of membership and, with my national hat on again, say how pleased we are to be Ireland's closest EU neighbour. </p>

          <p eId="para_39">I thank the ambassador. We are close and many French live in Ireland. I think there are more than 11,500, and more than 8,000 Irish people live in France, so there are good connections there.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I welcome the ambassador and his team. I think they have possibly been our closest European neighbour since 1798 but we can discuss that again. I will not mention the protocol because I am sure the many experts on it in attendance will mention it.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I will come back to the themes of the Presidency - recovery, strength and belonging. They were the themes on 1 January and today Europe is in a very different place. What are the lessons to be learned from how Europe allowed itself to become so dependent on Russia that we are now struggling and our people are paying an enormous price, and will pay a bigger one in the coming months to take ourselves away from that, economically and politically?</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The ambassador mentioned that the threats are many. The biggest threat at the moment to European solidarity and unity is economic. What are the lessons from the Presidency? What is the view, as France begins to move on from the Presidency, of how that will be managed? The ambassador mentioned European unity and since the invasion it has been superb. Before the invasion, I criticised it and felt the Commission and President were <i>laissez-faire</i> and there could have been far more intervention at an earlier stage. Since the end of February there has been an excellent response. Does the ambassador feel that will continue as the pressures grow and we go into a winter where our dependence on energy, in particular, will be tested? What is the view of the French Government regarding lessons to be learned?</p>

          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_43">I thank the Deputy for those important and difficult questions. When we prepared for the Presidency in my previous job - until summer 2020 I was chief of staff of the French Minister for European affairs so was part of the preparation - we were heading towards Covid and so on. It was the French Presidency's agenda that we had to reconcile Europe even more with its citizens. In Ireland, you do very well; in France, we do less well, hence the agenda of belonging and connecting with citizens. That was one challenge and the other one was to assert Europe more at international level and beef up European tools against a more and more challenging, not to say hostile, environment, including the close environment. As the Deputy said, events in the Ukraine have made this much worse than we anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> On dependency, I believe there are two kinds of dependency. The dependency of some European countries is not really a choice but is inherited from the past. I think particularly of all the eastern EU member states, which inherited gas, oil and coal supplies from their old connection with the former Soviet Union and which have been slow in transforming this, even though the climate change agenda was a driver of change. This was not really their choice and now they face an extremely difficult timeline in which to transform this. We see that some for political reasons have been very swift, like Poland and the Baltic states. Others, like Hungary, consider it is too quick and difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> The other category of countries, in particular Germany and Italy, for political reasons which are perfectly legitimate but are now showing their limitations, believe that engagement with Russia was the right way to ultimately find a shared prosperity agenda on the European Continent. Speaking about Germany, it dates back to the early 1970s. For Italy, it is probably an even older agenda if you look at all the industrial joint ventures between Italy and Russia in the 1960s in the automotive and other sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> This agenda has blatantly shown its strong limitation and it is extremely painful for all European countries, and those in particular, to be faced with this limitation. It is difficult to blame them because the whole EU and the whole world had the same agenda with regard to China. In the 1990s and 2000s - and it continues to a lesser extent - we engaged heavily with China, considering that shared prosperity and globalisation was, as our Chinese friends would say, a win-win and would create a <i>de facto </i>solidarity which would prevent war, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> When considering what we have done with Russia, mainly on energy but also in the context of other kinds of commodities, we should not forget that we do the same with China on a broader range of products. Against this background, we will have to respond rapidly and strongly to the challenges of climate transition and the transition in our energy supply. There is, therefore, the double challenge of accelerating peace. It is also an opportunity, even though we know there are bottlenecks in terms of being able to equip ourselves with wind turbines, solar panels and this and that. In a way, it strongly reinforces the call for renewable energy sources and energy autonomy in Europe. We in France believe this has strongly reinforced our agenda of energy autonomy with nuclear energy. It has more generally reinforced our agenda for the so-called strategic autonomy of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> I will say clearly that this is not about building a fortress Europe or an autocratic Single Market cut off from the rest of the world. It is not at all about that. France is a big exporter of goods and services. We need trade on goods and services and there is no intention whatsoever to close this exchange with the rest of the world. There is, however, an intention to say that on certain critical commodities and products, we can no longer just believe that our trade partners will respect their contracts. Remember the kind of extremely dramatic scenes we saw relating to the supply of masks two years ago. It became a terrible race to get a supply of masks, etc. It does not mean necessarily that we need enormous production of masks but we must think more strategically about what is critical for business continuity in Europe and where we have to act more strategically without being overly dependent on supplies from overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> The war in Ukraine is far from over. It has taught us that we can be united and should remain so. European strength is based on values. We have the financial and legal tools to remain united. Economically and in terms of defence, we want to beef up capacity. We have a roadmap now and it is important to roll it out. There are 72 measures included in the strategic compass, 48 of which are to be rolled out in 2022 and 2023. It is now about implementation based on a shared analysis and the best analysis of the need of the day. It is now about implementation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_50">I thank the ambassador for coming. I apologise for being a couple of minutes late in attending. I was listening to the meeting on my way in. I had to deal with logistics relating to children this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Many of us would say that if we were dealing with the European question during the financial crisis, we would not necessarily have got support on the street for the European project due to the conditions at the time. I ask Mr. Guérend for a comment on the present circumstances. There has been solidarity across Europe which to a degree has been unexpected. The old argument that was always made was to ask what would happen when German carmakers or French winemakers wanted to sell into Britain but we have seen the colour of the European Union's money in that regard. We are dealing with Boris Johnson, who increasingly appears almost to fall into the category occupied by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Viktor Orbán and others. I ask Mr. Guérend for a comment on where Boris Johnson stands at the moment. We are all guessing as to whether he is serious or not. The European Union has probably set out a slightly more robust response.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> It is not only a matter of solidarity around Brexit. How we dealt with the pandemic and the response to the war in Ukraine showed a level of co-operation and cohesion that was higher than people may have expected, particularly, I imagine, Vladimir Putin. We have also shown that as difficult as it is, we can come to agreements, including an element of opt-in co-operation. Deputy Richmond and I, among others, were involved with the Conference on the Future of Europe. The timescale was a bit restricted. The French presidency was somewhat chaotic in the beginning. It fell into a better structure as it went along. Some citizens came up with some very innovative suggestions but at times possibly fell into a need for greater context in respect of the European institutions. Beyond that, there was almost expert testimony on particular niche issues. Due to the difficulties with the likes of Hungary, there was a focus on qualified majority voting versus unanimity. I am asking Mr. Guérend for a view. We have shown how opt-ins work. We know that this is to go somewhere and that there are varying views. I am asking for the French view.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> There has been certain commentary about it taking 20 years for the accession of Ukraine to the European Union, which probably make people ill at ease. That notion existed previously and I can understand some of the reasoning behind it. Where does France stand on a two-speed Europe?</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Mr. Guérend said we are dealing with the particular crisis in Ukraine but we know we are also dealing with impending issues relating to climate change and all the rest of it. Supply chain planning is something that must happen without Europe becoming a protectionist bloc. The one thing the pandemic showed was that the State is required to do the heavy lifting if we are going to make real change. We have seen in French politics that if people do not buy into the necessary moves on climate change, the door will be left open for certain non-progressive people and space is allowed in that regard. It is vital that we bring people along. Some of that will involve considering fiscal constraints and understanding that the constraints are greater now. When I am talking about supply chain planning, I am also talking about energy, food and all those other issues. I think that is a sufficient amount of questions to put in front of Mr. Guérend. It will probably take the rest of the meeting for him to respond.</p>

          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_59">I thank the Deputy for his interesting points. He asked about the relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom and the latest announcement by the British Government concerning the protocol and this draft law.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">There was a public reaction from the EU institutions and the vice-president of the European Commission, Mr. Maroš Šefčovič. There have also been reactions from many European governments, including the French Government, in full support both of what Mr. Šefčovič said and the Irish Government's concerns. There is strong unity regarding those concerns and a strong sense that what the British Government is now tabling is in full contradiction of its own commitment to the signing and ratification of the protocol two and a half years ago. Again, we are fully supportive of the efforts of the Commission and in full solidarity with Ireland on this very important subject. I think that is clear enough. There is no ambiguity in respect of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> When it comes more generally to the Conference on the Future of Europe and how we want the debate to continue, I realise the timescale was very packed initially. The pandemic and virtual meetings probably did not help either, including with national debates, but ultimately we believe it was a useful exercise. The point was not to again open the Pandora's box of the institutional debate in Europe, even though it was an expectation, particularly in respect of the European Parliament, to move the lines with this right of initiative, which France supports. We believe Europe has to work and function. We do not have to fix something that is not broken. We never said that Europe has a broken engine but in view of the extremely fast developments we mentioned previously, nobody should be complacent and should consider that just because it works and broadly delivers a good service to European citizens, Europe should just stand as it is in light of the upcoming enlargements. In this context, the French President made a speech on 9 May in Strasbourg at the close of the conference, where he called on European citizens and institutions to see how best to serve the European citizen with no taboo on institutions. Even though it is certainly not the priority of the day to have a new institutional debate, it should not be a red line either.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> When it comes to EU enlargement, it is about what we said on the French side before the presidency and now that we have it. In 2019, before France held the presidency, I was part of the decision-making, or at least the thinking on this on the French side. The accession procedure that had been developed in the 1990s and early 2000s, before a large number of central and eastern European countries joined, was no longer fit for purpose for the new applicants, including the current applicant in the western Balkans. As we can see, the negotiating process with the western Balkans is, in a way, stalled because of the many challenges faced by these countries but also because the process is just too heavy and not political enough, in a way. As members will probably well know, the process is based on 35 chapters with many sub-groups and sub-meetings, which I should certainly not criticise as being too bureaucratic. I am a bureaucrat myself and, at the end of the day, papers and analysis etc. are needed. It is just a very heavy process because, ultimately, the applicant countries have the impression of being drawn into procedures about internal markets, the Single Market, and the TETRA project, without having a political vision. The process then stalls.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> We wanted to propose in this new scheme for accession negotiations, which was partly taken over by the Commission, the ability to propose to these countries a mechanism of better and stronger political dialogue with the EU on foreign policy issues, values and the way the EU works on the one side, and keep a certain track on technicalities that are ultimately key. If these countries want to be member states, they have to have policies on transport, social issues and the environment that fit and match with EU standards and, generally, keep to this double track. In a way, by extension, what the French President proposed on 9 May to Ukraine, but also to non-EU countries such as Norway, Switzerland and, why not, the UK, was a little the same. We need a basis of political dialogue with these countries, including Ukraine, on foreign policy, where we have shared interests. This includes the UK where we have a shared foreign policy interest to have the UK be part of continental foreign policy and security thinking, and also in respect of values and the fact that on the European Continent we all share the same democratic values - at least we hope so - on the rule of law and are part of the Council of Europe. I exclude Russia, of course. This is one political platform.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> When it comes to Ukraine, we will have to continue to see when and if we start negotiations for accession. On the French side, we really believe it would be deceiving to let the Ukrainian people believe Ukraine will be a member in five or ten years' time. We consider this not to be the case, not because we do not want it but because Ukraine is not ready for it. Look at the extremely high standards we Europeans have on everything. We have the highest standards in the world. How do we want a country, which has a GDP of probably not even €1,000 per head, to comply with this? It is just not realistic. We certainly have to find a mechanism to bring Ukraine closer to Europe on everything, including on political and foreign policy issues in particular, but the shortest way for this is not EU accession.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> On supply chains, as I mentioned previously, as Europe is a major powerhouse at global level, it should remain the case our own interests are completely plugged into global supply chains. I am not sharing a scoop here, but when we see that close to 90% of the supply of microchips comes from Taiwan, the risk that is can be measured. The fact is the EU is correct to now develop a strategy on microchips. It cannot be that we are so over-reliant on one single site of production that is marred, whether we like it or not, by some risks.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I thank the ambassador for his presentation. I congratulate the French Republic on its presidency. It has driven the EU forward with very ambitious plans, many of which are being realised. I also acknowledge the President of France, Emmanuel Macron, is giving real leadership to the EU at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I have two questions following on from my colleague, Deputy Ó Murchú, on the Conference on the Future of Europe. What are France's plans, or aims and objectives, for the post-conference scenario? In particular, given the ambitions of the French Republic for the EU, I am especially interested in the issue of unanimous decision-making. Treaty change is linked to that. As the witnesses will know, we have unanimity on a number of issues, including taxation, accession and defence, which is a national competence. We have unanimous decision-making in a number of areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">What is France's ambition now that the 49 proposals have been presented and the conference has concluded with 300 concrete measures?</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> My second question is about the war in Ukraine. We are told that the French President is in communication with Putin regarding a negotiated settlement. What is the policy objective of France in that regard and its strategy in dealing with Putin? We are told the Baltic states are not happy with the constant communication involving France, Germany and Italy in particular. What is Emmanuel Macron's strategy regarding his communications with Putin and bringing this war to an end or bringing about a negotiated settlement?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_15">
          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_72">On the Deputy's first point about the Conference on the Future of Europe, the conference has published a report. Now the ball is back in the court of the various European institutions to see how to bring this forward. As for the substance, it is true, as the Deputy mentioned, that the French President, in his speech on 9 May, endorsed pretty strongly many of the proposals, including probably the most innovative, which would see the European Parliament having a right of initiative. He has also said very strongly, however, in his national capacity that he believes we should generalise qualified majority voting, including in areas where there is still unanimity voting, including on foreign policy, which until now has not at all been the French line. Yes, he has made pretty remarkable moves compared with the traditional French position on this within the context of an EU which he believes needs to adapt to the challenges of the day and which is delivering, as I said and as we have seen, but also facing too many obstacles, including generally with some member states. Frankly speaking, the difficulties we have with Poland and Hungary in particular not only on some human rights issues but also on some policy issues - energy and other things - are a real obstacle to swift decision-making. Yes, the French President has been pretty clear on this. He now wants this agenda to be moved forward by the EU institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> When it comes to Ukraine, the French strategy with Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, certainly since the 2000s, has not changed. It is a strategy based on engagement and shared interests in the sense that we have an interest in seeing Russia being as close as possible to Europe. There is also, however, a lot of realism. We have been constantly criticising, condemning and sanctioning Russia since 2008, after the aggression involving Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, etc. Now, since January, in a way the three objectives are similar. We want to stop this war and want the conflict to stop. We want to see a negotiated solution but not on the backs of Ukrainians. It is for Ukraine to decide whatever it wants to settle with Russia or otherwise. This is not just the starting point. We will not compromise on the full territorial integrity and the full sovereignty of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> Ultimately, we also believe that we will need, at a certain stage, a channel of communication open with Mr. Putin himself, not just his foreign minister or some other decision maker in Russia, because he is probably the only one in Russia who decides. Why should we now break this communication, which is already so challenging, only to resume it with even more difficulty in three months, six months or five years? We need that channel of communication open, as difficult and as frustrating as it is because we realise very much that he has been, frankly speaking, lying to us over the past six months. We believe, however, that it is important to keep that channel of communication open. Ultimately, one day, be it in five years, ten years or 15 years from now, it is our strong conviction that we will need to find, as difficult as it is, a security architecture with Russia. We have to find a way to bring Russia back to the various treaties on non-proliferation, conventional forces in Europe and non-aggression, which Russia has been either violating or quitting over recent years. We must have such a long-term perspective. We certainly do not want to compromise anything at the expense of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> In the meantime, we have to pass strong messages. We also pushed very hard for the Secretary General of the UN, Mr. Guterres, to go to Russia. It took a long time for him to go there. He went there only in early April just because the Russians did not want him to come. We had insisted with other Security Council members that he go there. Again, as frustrating and as unfruitful as it was, it was important. That is why we also considered that it is important to keep a channel of communication open with Mr. Putin.</p>

          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_85">I am glad to answer that question, which is very important and has been the subject of many comments in the press, including here in Ireland. When the President said that, it was in reaction to many remarks and comments made, particularly in the United States three weeks or a month ago, when things were looking a little better for the Ukrainian army than they do now. There was a sense that a victory for Ukraine was within reach pretty soon and that we should teach Russia a lesson once and for all in order that Russia should not be tempted anytime soon to cross the line again. There were some very high-level US decision makers making such remarks. We still believe not only that those remarks are slightly dangerous but also that the idea of teaching Russia lessons is dangerous. That is not because we believe that what Russia has done over the past six months is permissible or admissible but, rather, because the history of the European Continent over centuries, certainly over the past 100 years, has taught us very painfully that if one teaches a country a lesson for having invaded a neighbour, it bounces back very strongly a generation later.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> Just look at the First World War in this respect. Looking at the Franco-German conflicts, there was a war in 1870 in which the Germans humiliated us and we fought hard to recover the province we had ceded. The idea of teaching one's neighbour a lesson is very dangerous. As much as we support sanctions and strongly consider that the full territorial integrity of Ukraine should be restored, including Ukraine, as well as that of Georgia, with the provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia at the same time, we believe it is dangerous, when speaking about Russia, though not Mr. Putin, to engage in a narrative and strategy with an objective of humiliating a country. We would then, in one generation's time, see serious consequences. We have to defeat Russia. We want Ukraine to win.

          <from>Senator Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_87">I thank the ambassador. I agree with his comments about having a bigger picture, longer term view. We should apply the same thinking to Brexit and not rise to the bait. The EU has to be the adult in the room. Matters are playing out domestically in the UK. One could be forgiven for wanting to throw in the towel, because it is challenging. Maroš Šefčovič has done a good job. He has been patient, as has the EU, as have we in Ireland. We have to find a way forward that is agreeable to the UK as well as the EU, so that nobody feels like they have won or lost. There are concerns in some quarters in Ireland that there is such growing frustration on the Continent that there is a temptation to retaliate or to regress from our adult-like position. We should be conscious to not do that, as tempting as it might be. That is my only comment on Brexit. It has been dealt with well. We are on the same page with regard to our views on that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> It is unbelievable and remarkable that we are discussing the UK breaching international law. I agree that the legislation published does exactly that. No matter how it is spun or interpreted on the other side, it is disappointing, to say the least, that the dispute resolution mechanisms within the withdrawal agreement and treaty are not utilised, because they were intended to deal with these conflicts and disagreements, which were expected to take place. We knew we would have disagreements and we will again at some point in the future. It is important to use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the agreement to deal with those so that no side goes off to do its own thing, for want of a better phrase.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> We had reports in our country discussing the docking of two Russian ships in our ports to deliver grain and fertiliser under a derogation of the sanctions, which are supposed to not allow these ships to dock, but we can use those derogations where there is a necessity under the principle that we should not seek to do more harm to ourselves than we are doing to Russia, which I understand. It brings into question the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. The intention behind the CAP was to have a level of self-sufficiency and to have access to good quality, sustainably produced food that is as carbon neutral as possible. It suggests we have not done a great job on that front if we find that we still have to import grain and fertiliser because of our over-reliance on Ukraine and Russia. I am not disagreeing with the ships coming in. It was a necessity to not create bigger problems for ourselves further down the track. We need to have a conversation at EU level about the Common Agricultural Policy and what we need to change to encourage our farmers, which we are trying to do domestically. Our Minister announced €56 million to deal with that issue, to try to encourage farmers to grow more grain. That needs to happen across the Continent. The CAP is the way to achieve it. I would welcome the ambassador's comments on that. It is the same as the problem with microchips, but with a different product that is even more vital. Food is a necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> I am probably straying a little. I think this issue concerns Ireland because we all share the same values of human rights, protection of refugees, how we treat them and the dignity that we treat human beings with. What are the ambassador's views on the UK's policy on Rwanda? My view is that it is disgusting, disgraceful and abhorrent. It breaches the European Convention on Human Rights. It flies in the face of human decency and dignity. It clearly breaches the UN Refugee Convention. There have been allegations in the UK, some quite direct and other more nuanced, that the French are to blame. They say people are travelling from France to the UK and ask what the French authorities are doing about it. I do not agree with that narrative. That is clever spin they are putting on it to sell it domestically and say that whatever problems are happening domestically, somebody else is creating them. The latter seems to be the <i>modus operandi</i> of the UK Government. It is deeply concerning to all who hold those values close that the intention is to put people on planes and send them to Africa to be dealt with. It is a disgraceful policy. I welcome the ambassador's comments on how France is dealing with that and about his engagements with the UK. Does he see a path to address that from an EU and from a French perspective?</p>

          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_91">I thank the Senator for raising those important points. On the matter of the CAP and ships, I do not have specific information on those ships, but some exceptions are provided for in the sanction regime, and I am sure it is all legal. From a French point of view, we believe that after 60 or 70 years of the CAP, it has been a huge success, even though it has to be changed to be more friendly to the climate, environment and biodiversity. We are fortunate to have developed this policy for the past 50 or so years. As the Senator probably knows, the EU is a strong net exporter of food and agri-products. We are able not only to feed our population but to export, which is good. We may need to import certain products. We are a bigger importer of sunflower oil and maize, which Ukraine is a significant producer of in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> We need to remain open to exports and imports of food products. It is in our own interest as a net exporter. From a French point of view, we want to put an emphasis on not being too lenient towards big exporters which are not complying with the Paris Agreement requirements relating to climate change and are pushing deforestation or are exporting products which do not match our sanitary standards. We need to import some grain or some fertiliser and I believe that will remain a necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_93"> I have a couple of remarks on migration and the recent developments in the UK. The EU in general, the UN agencies and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have stated clearly what they think of this policy. We strongly disagree with the policy. As has been said, it is probably in breach of several conventions.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">Certainly it is not in the spirit of the way we in the EU want to deal with illegal migrants. Within the EU, as the Senator knows, over the last number of years there has been a new proposal on the table called a migratory pact. It is made of various subtexts of regulation on asylum, legal migration and how to fight illegal migration. There has been some progress, by the way, under the French Presidency, even though we have not been able to push this through completely because they are extremely politically sensitive documents. However, we have made some progress. Ultimately, we on the French side strongly believe that first, Europe needs migrants in the long run because of our demographics, second, that we must manage this migration and remain a Continent that provides asylum for asylum seekers for the values we mentioned before and third, this has to organised, managed and with some solidarity mechanism within the EU between the front-line countries and those that are less on the front line. There is a financial burden etc., so there has to be a mechanism or at least redistribution solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> This being said, when it comes more precisely to the UK and France and also the situation in the Channel, and with Calais and Dover, this is not new. We have had these problems for at least 20 years or more. It is true co-operation with the UK was always difficult and it has become really difficult since Brexit, basically, and particularly over the last two to three years with the new British Government. We believe that we are a little bit too easy to use as a scapegoat of some of the difficulties it may have. The co-operation on a practical, daily basis is less smooth than it used to be. The British Government is also now indulging in some practices we believe are in breach of international law, the law of the sea, rescuing people at sea etc. In certain cases - we have seen this even with the Ukrainians - some of the basic factors like accepting families to reunite and others have not necessarily been swiftly followed by the British.</p>
          <p eId="para_96"> At the same time, we see our responsibility as a kind of last point before the UK on the Continent and we are working closely with our other European partners and neighbours like the Benelux countries, Germany and others to see how to reform this because ultimately, the whole system has to be reformed. You have some of the asylum seekers who ask for asylum in Germany, let us say they are from Afghanistan or another country, they stay in Germany for a couple of months or years then are for different reasons denied asylum in Germany. Then they move to the next country and then through to France, whereas they should stay in Germany and be deported. Then in France they ask for another one and then they try to go to the UK. This mechanism needs the full co-operation of the UK within the EU. Even though Brexit has occurred it should still, in its own interest, remain at the table and it is not at the table. It does not want to address this very complex and very humane situation with us and I mean humane in the sense that we are talking about people here. The situation means there are often very tragic cases, so the UK should remain at the table and it has not and that makes it extremely difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_97"> In short, we need more co-operation on this from the UK and over the last couple of years, we have seen a lack of co-operation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_98">I thank the ambassador. The Senator has covered a very broad agenda, one probably well beyond the scope we have asked the ambassador here to discuss. I am probably going to add to that. I have three questions. My first builds on the initial commentary by Deputy Calleary. He talked about a sense of a lack of cohesion, if you like, on the day France took over, though it was not France's fault. Since then, because of events, the degree of focus, determination and solidarity has astounded even ourselves. There has been the focus on the vaccines, on our response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine and indeed on solidarity with Ireland in the context of the protocol. The French Presidency coincided with the French election cycle and there was a real battle, if you like, over what the outcome would be and a belief in and significant vote for those who want to withdraw from the European Union itself. This is an organisation Ireland has been a member of for 50 years and has invested so much in. I cannot think of any parallel organisation that is so fundamental to our well-being to which there is periodically an existential threat. I do not know whether the ambassador has a view on that. It cannot be that an institution that is so structurally important to us in Europe can be undermined by a particular election cycle at any event. Is that to be a permanent feature of the Union? Is there a thought on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> My second question is related to that. I wish to amplify a question Deputy Ó Murchú asked because I am not clear on the vision of France in relation to how it envisages connecting non-EU core members to Europe. The phrase used as shorthand is "two-tier" Europe. Is it a bilateral relationship on an individual country basis that is different in each case and unique in each case? How does France see the deepening of the core members and how a relationship with non-core members might be developed in the future? I just am not clear on the French vision on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> My final question is on Africa. The ambassador talked about the dialogue that was very important between the EU and Africa. What was the outcome of that in terms of the normal declarations and so on? Is there a real strategy to ensure Europe is as competitive in Africa for the hearts and souls of people as China clearly is at present? We have been talking for a very long time about the migration issue and the solution being an investment in Africa and the European neighbourhood such that there is not an economic imperative on people to migrate to Europe because there is an economic future for them at home. What is the ambassador's view on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_101">I thank the Deputy. I would probably need another hour to answer all those very important points. On the first point on a lack of cohesion and what was mentioned before by Deputy Calleary, I am not sure precisely what the Deputy referred to. Was is a lack of cohesion within France and other member states or within the EU group?</p>

          <p eId="para_102">No, the EU itself was seen to be riven by internal strife. We were all looking at the Conference on the Future of Europe debate in the context of whether the fundamental principles of Europe were being abided by and whether we could do something about that. Then, suddenly, we were almost in lockstep on the critical issues, which was heartening for us all.</p>

          <from> H.E. Mr. Vincent Guérend<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_103">I am not sure how to answer the Deputy's question here but when it comes to Poland and Hungary in particular, nothing has been set aside. In the EU institutions, the Commission and so on, the various legal proceedings against Hungary are still running and we have not put that aside just because of the difficult hour of the day due to the war in Ukraine and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">There is no compromising on values, human rights and rule of law in Poland and Hungary, because of our concern about Russia and energy supply and the need to have both Poland and Hungary on board. When Commission President von der Leyen visited Warsaw very recently, she again stressed that the share Poland should receive from the recovery package was still conditional on reforms to its justice system.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> Cohesion within the EU is still strong. Yes, we have difficult debates with Hungary on sanctions in terms of various aspects or individuals. The Deputy will recall that Hungary has asked that the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church be excluded from the sanctions. It has also asked that sanctions not go to 100%, but to 90%, on fuel supply etc. Hungary is a difficult partner but it is still around the table and, ultimately, it is still supportive of the general move. When one looks back, the cohesion of the group is still remarkable and the reaction was very swift and united, all in all.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> When it comes to the French Presidency and its cycle and, more generally, I felt the heat in respect of how great the hazard was that the whole EU, which is such an important project, could be jeopardised by a few million voters in France or elsewhere. I see what the Deputy means. I can only speak for France here but I guess it is the same in other member states. Time and again, we have to make clear that the EU delivers, is close to the citizen and, ultimately, is the best answer to the problems and not the root of the problem. I confess this is especially challenging to make clear in France, for many reasons. The only heartening lesson in France over the past couple of years is that even Ms Le Pen is no longer talking about exiting the EU or the euro. She is now just talking about reforming the EU. The so-called Frexit is no longer an issue in France.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> One may say that, on the left side, Mr. Mélenchon is basically openly calling, not to leave the EU, but to disobey the rules and to become rogue when it comes to the EU institutional framework. He does not have the majority of the vote in France and is still far from a majority. If one combines the left and extreme left or the right and the extreme right, it is true that they add up to quite a significant number of French voters but, if one looks at the presidential election, even though many voters did not show up, a strong majority was for a very pro-European president. I see that the ice is sometimes thin but the agenda of the French President has been remarkably constant in continuing to push EU integration and the EU agenda, rather than weakening it.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> I see the broader perspective and the points of view of Ireland and other member states that our prosperity is shared and of the risk it can be jeopardised by one member state. We have to continue to make sure that policy delivers and that the citizens feel part of the debate and that, with all its limitations, was very much what the French President tried to do. Of course it was a kind of a bet to have the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the same time as our electoral cycle. The President won that bet and he will win again on Sunday. Being pro-European remains a winning ticket in France. He also wanted to consolidate this EU anchor in France by having the two coincide this semester.</p>
          <p eId="para_109"> When it comes to a two-speed Europe or core members and others, we all know that all member states want to be in the core. Nobody wants to be on the fringe. Those who are on the fringe are gradually coming to the core. I am thinking of Denmark in terms of defence and Croatia, which will soon join the euro. Some member states are still not willing to join the euro. Czechia and Sweden are part of the trio. When France presented this Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, a couple of years ago, all but one member state joined. Ireland also joined. We see that everybody wants to be in the first league and not the second, which is reassuring. </p>
          <p eId="para_110"> However, it is true that the more the EU evolves and the more member states there are, the more it will be difficult to keep the same pace for all. We believe the answers to that are more qualified majority voting or, indeed, depending on the policies and the agreement of all, structured co-operation in certain cases. When it comes to European non-EU member states, such as our Swiss and Norwegian friends and maybe, one day, the Ukrainians, we will have to see other mechanisms of co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> The French Government over the past 30 years, basically since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the early discussion on EU accession enlargement in the early 1990s, has been invoking a two-speed Europe. It has not done so as a threat to all those who are less convinced by deeper integration, but an appeal to the need for further integration and not to necessarily just adopt the pace of the slow ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> Maybe I was a bit short on Africa in my introductory remarks. Within the EU and, certainly, in France, the feeling is that for the 20 years and more to come, the importance of Africa is such that we cannot devolve enough resources to it, because of its size, proximity and the many challenges it faces. Moreover, all the efforts made over the past 50 or 60 years have been very important but probably not sufficient to address these challenges and that the format of the previous EU-Africa summits were not necessarily delivering in terms of substance and dynamics.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> This time, we decided not to have all African heads of state. There were also, in fairness, issues as a result of coups etc. We wanted to concentrate on the institution of the African Union, which is also a very good dialogue partner. We also wanted to focus more on civil society because in many African countries where states' institutions are weak, there is a very vibrant civil society in business, culture, education and youth. There was a whole forum on civil society.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Ultimately, we wanted the delegation led by the European Commission to be a little less dominated by development issues, although they are important, and more driven by a political agenda, where we really address political and security issues of these countries. I do not say this is a magic wand and there is a magical way to complete the relationship in the 20 years to come. The strong attempt was to establish a more political dialogue with the African Union and help it even more in being the kind of driving force for the continent.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">I have two brief questions because we are more or less out of time. The ambassador has been very kind and generous in giving full answers and I will not ask anything new. I just wanted to pick up on two matters and ask two supplementary questions to the comments already made by the ambassador.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> In his first intervention the ambassador referred to the strategic compass, the 72 projects and 48 of those in the short term. There was a huge discussion during the course of the French Presidency at Versailles on the future of security arrangements in the Union. That issue is becoming ever more apparent as a result of the war in Ukraine and everything else. Beyond the strategic compass and in the longer term, what is the ambition of France as we go through the next decade of greater European co-operation? Where could Ireland play a role, taking into account our constraints?</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> Senator Chambers referred to the understandable reaction to the nonsense, for want of a better word, going on in London currently. The response of the European Commission is to be expected if it potentially unpauses legal action and commences new legal action, depending on how this legislation progresses. What is the feeling of the French Government, with the ambassador as its representative, about this Commission action? How supportive of it will the French Government be and how fast should it occur?</p>

          <p eId="para_119">The strategic compass is a very important document and very much fit for purpose. We are very happy with this outcome. Again, it is based on shared analysis and it is a roadmap with very concrete steps to move forward. On this basis, Europe should first continue to have a shared analysis of its environment. It is not just about the French with the Sahel, the Greeks with Turkey and the Poles with Ukraine; it should be a process that we enter together. That is happening now.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> We should have the proper tools, specifically the proper defence equipment. There is even more thinking and money going into the European Defence Agency and, as members know, more money coming from the EU budget to research into defence in order to increase our European capacities. We should use these rapid deployment elements to be able to act on the ground with military troops whenever that is needed. Much progress has been made on this over the past 20 years but we are not completely there yet in terms of the ability to intervene. It is fair to say the extreme difficulty we had in Kabul in August in evacuating our staff was a big wake-up call.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> That is the direction of travel. All member states that are willing to participate are, of course, very much welcome. Ireland has so far been an active contributor, with limited caveats expressed in the declaration and through the Lisbon treaty accession. As I keep saying, it is really for the Irish debate to take place at its own pace on whether the country should see an evolution of its neutrality stance when it comes to the certain limitations in the engagement with EU defence. The more this is integrated and the more members will fully participate, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> On the UK and the very regrettable developments of the past couple of days, as I have said we are fully behind the Commission. Senator Chambers also mentioned the need to have a strategic approach to the UK, which is a close neighbour and important player. It is a country with which we want to have the best relationship. We did not want Brexit, as members have repeated. We want the best relationship possible with Britain, and that is important, but we cannot just let one partner violate the rules without any consequence. We will have to see what occurs as this draft law progresses in the British Parliament, ultimately becoming law, how we can raise our concern, our voice and ultimately take some action to draw a line. Again, we fully support the Commission and in solidarity with Ireland on this. We very much follow Ireland on this and we are liaising very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of the Taoiseach on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">Most of the ground has been covered but it is always a pleasure to welcome a <i>voisin</i> to the Houses of the Oireachtas and acknowledge his generosity of time, as the ambassador has made himself so readily accessible to Members of the Oireachtas. He has communicated clearly, including when over a year ago he wrote an excellent piece in <i>The Irish Times</i> setting out the new opportunities.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> No opportunity should be lost to say the Good Friday Agreement, as we all know, has saved a countless number of lives. It is a precious peace. I know I am preaching to the converted but I cannot emphasise enough how much umbrage many people in Ireland have taken that this amazing, historic and solemn peace agreement has been bandied around and it is somehow purportedly being used as an excuse or a justification to proceed to breach international law. It is reprehensible. There are certain non-party political agreements that are so solemn and precious, we do not mess around or play politics with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> We are now at our most vulnerable stage since the Good Friday Agreement. France is an old friend of Ireland and we go back way beyond what is now called the European Union. Ireland has taken its place in Europe for over 1,500 years, having much of an input into culture, heritage and security. We have a special relationship with America but, relatively speaking, it is only a couple of hundred years old. The French and Irish go back longer than that. If I am put to the pin of my collar, I cannot think of a country that Ireland has closer links to over centuries. France came to our aid and it is a bulwark of democracy. It is a pivotal part of the EU and we need the French voice and continued support like never before at this defining and precious point. I ask the ambassador to use the influence of his office.</p>
          <p eId="para_127"> The other question that has not been answered is whether this section of unionism wants the internal UK market. Have unionist leaders explained to their people that if they exclusively want the internal market and to ditch the protocol - as some do, although moderates want to amend it - that they will lose out on the EU market, the Single Market? I do not know if that has been communicated to their supporters. Doing so might help them see sense and see that this is a wonderful opportunity. I cannot say this often enough and have I said it in the Seanad. The Alliance Party in Northern Ireland is constitutionally agnostic. A lady who won a seat for that party, Sorcha Eastwood, was asked after she won the seat if the protocol came up on the doorsteps when she was canvassing. She said it came up twice. There is another narrative that is not getting out there. The Green Party is an all-Ireland party. We canvassed in the North and it never came up. There is something missing here. We are not putting people before politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> France is very influential in the European project. Ukraine will be demoralised and devastated if it is told it has to wait ten, 20 or 30 years. That is not what it wants to hear now. France has articulated a two-speed approach. I hope there is some good news in the post for Ukraine because it is clinging to hope. It wants to take its place among the nations of Europe like France and Ireland. France has huge influence in making that happen. It has been reported in the media that Germany and France are a bit nervous about it, for obvious reasons. There are very strict criteria. That said, surely in a time of emergency some preliminary and concrete steps can be taken on that road to European membership. I would ask France to please give Ukraine something concrete in the next few days through the mechanisms and workings of the European Union, of which it is a central part.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">On the last point, I will see what happens in the coming days at the European Council. We believe, for the reasons I explained, that full membership is probably not the best answer to the problems Ukraine is sadly facing. Its legislation is very far from being able to comply with everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_130"> I have already responded to the points on Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. Regarding the resilience and recovery package for Poland, we have the full support of the Commission and for any restrictions that may be put on the payment of this fund to Poland as long as the situation with the judicial system remains unsatisfactory. On Ukraine again, it is good to see so much solidarity here in Ireland and in many other member states. In France we have close to 100,000 Ukrainian refugees and we are ready to host more if needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> I extend my heartfelt thanks to the committee and the Chair for their interest. I stand with my colleagues and my capital willing and ready to share analysis and documents. I would also be more than happy if the committee were to visit its counterpart in the French Parliament, where we also have an EU affairs committee. The role of Parliament in the EU institution, and of national parliaments, is extremely important, as members well know. It was good to be here today. I remain open to all engagement. I am just next door in Merrion Square if any bilateral context is needed and to pursue the discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">I welcome the delegation and all those in the Gallery, with their different roles and representing various regional authorities and cities. It is great to have them all here. Cuirim fáilte ar son an choiste roimh an uachtarán, Mr. Apostolos Tzitzikostas. He is very welcome. I hope I am pronouncing his name correctly. It is very good to see the head of the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions, Councillor Michael Murphy, and his fellow delegate, Councillor Kate Feeney. They are all very welcome. The European Committee of the Regions has three political priorities: bringing Europe closer to the people; managing fundamental societal transformations; and cohesion, our fundamental value.</p>
          <p eId="para_134"> All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the statement of a witness is potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, the witness will be directed to discontinue these remarks. It is imperative that he or she comply with any such direction.</p>

          <from> Mr. Apostolos Tzitzikostas<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_136">I thank the members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs for meeting today. I also thank my colleagues, the members of the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions, which is one of the strongest and most active delegations of our house and whose dedication and hard work both on the ground and in our committee have been so important and valuable during these very challenging times.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> Just take a moment to think about what we have been through in the past two and a half years. The crises we have gone through have turned our longer term challenges into urgent priorities. Digitalisation has made a difference between having students attend their classes and not, and having companies survive and not. Energy transition and building a sustainable green Europe are no longer only an environmental challenge but a geopolitical necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> All this time, from the utmost horror of the war in Ukraine and the ongoing suffering of Covid to the impact of Brexit, and from the ultimate threat of climate change to Europe's unhealthy dependence on Russian gas and crude oil, European regions and cities have been on the front line. During these historic crises, they have been protecting citizens, delivering vital services, accelerating green and digital transitions, diversifying energy sources, saving businesses and jobs and, of course, providing help and shelter to the millions of Ukrainians who have fled their country because of the war. It is regional and local leaders in Europe who have, right from the start of the attack against Ukraine, organised humanitarian aid and welcomed refugees in the regions bordering Ukraine and in every other corner of Europe. At the same time, the European Committee of the Regions has swiftly created and put in place a web-based Ukraine info-support hub, a platform that can be visited on our website and that matches needs in Ukraine and its bordering regions with offers for help. We have called for an improvement in access to emergency EU funding to make it easier and faster for regions to access it and to provide rapid support and manage the humanitarian crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> We have also introduced an important initiative to host children from Ukraine in summer camps across Europe. Now we are building a big European alliance of cities and regions for the reconstruction of Ukraine, linking local and regional authorities in Europe in order to co-ordinate and facilitate contacts and co-operation with the Ukrainian local and regional authorities, following the proposal of President Zelenskyy and the support of President Michel. My call to the Irish regions and cities today is to join this alliance and our initiatives for the children and the reconstruction of Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_140"> All these consecutive and parallel crises have shown that no matter one’s size, strength and power, no one alone can deal with the challenges and meet the real needs of the people. This is how the European Committee of the Regions sees our European house of democracy: the EU being the protective roof; the member states, the strong walls; and the regions and cities, the solid foundations. All levels of government must work together to bring results. There is no other way to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> I welcome the fact that, with the Irish programme for Government, there is for the first time a clear commitment to regional development as a policy implementation objective. I trust that the role of regional and local administrations will be enhanced to deal with the huge challenges all across Europe, including the access to affordable housing and the crisis of the rise of the cost of living. </p>
          <p eId="para_142"> At the same time, I have to admit that I deeply regret that the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement lacks "territorial depth" and does not duly recognise the role of local and regional authorities in the EU-UK relationship. As I understand it, internal political matters are the reason the United Kingdom failed to assure a local democratic voice in the EU-UK partnership council. Moreover, we support a joint and responsible approach to the implementation of the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, including the Northern Ireland protocol, and respect for the level playing field. For this reason, I am deeply worried about the unilateral interpretation by London of the protocol, which could turn into a de facto hard Brexit, a disruption of the UK-EU trade with very strong repercussions for Ireland and risking the jeopardising of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> For us, one thing is clear. There are many regions in Ireland and all over the rest of Europe that are so heavily impacted and so heavily invested in partnerships with UK devolved nations and local governments, so there are so many untapped opportunities in areas of mutual interest — such as providing humanitarian assistance and managing sustainably the North Sea, the Channel and the Irish Sea, as well as fighting against climate change and implementing the sustainable development goals — that the role of regional and local authorities is irreplaceable.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Let me conclude by saying that our Union can survive and move forward only if our citizens care about it and believe in it. More than ever before, we must build a bottom-up future for Europe with more democratic representation of the people's vote and less institutional complexity. We must win back the trust of the citizens. This involves their trust in all three levels of government and the three levels of elected politicians - European, national and regional and local. These three levels of trust are interconnected and can only succeed if they reinforce each other. If one of these levels is missing, the whole European house of democracy collapses. To put it in simple words, we need a lively parliamentary democracy with a stronger European Parliament, stronger national parliaments and the European Committee of the Regions, as well as Europe's 240 regions and 90,000 municipalities, at its core. This is how we view the future of democracy in Europe and the future of Europe. </p>

          <from> Mr. Michael Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_146">Yes - Contae Tiobraid Árann. I thank the Chairman and the committee for facilitating and hosting us this morning. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here. As head of the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions, CoR, I am delighted to give a céad míle fáilte to my dear friend President Tzitzikostas and to thank him for taking the time to visit Ireland. From the outset, I reiterate his call for a reformed Europe built from the bottom-up on a model of a European house of democracy. I thank him for his words of solidarity on this week's worrying developments regarding the Northern Ireland protocol. I want to be very clear on my behalf and that of the Irish delegation to the CoR and put on record our complete opposition to the decision taken by the UK to table legislation disapplying core elements of the protocol. As stated by Vice President Šefčovič, unilateral action damages mutual trust. The Irish delegation to the CoR calls for a calm and measured joint approach to addressing any outstanding issues with the protocol. Protecting peace on this island is paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> In the CoR, I sit alongside President Tzitzikostas in the European People's Party Group, which is the largest political group in the CoR. President Tzitzikostas often reminds us of the following and I must reiterate it here now. Local and regional authorities implement 70% of all EU legislation and represent half of public employment, more than a half of public investment and a third of public spending. The CoR is the EU institution that is closest to European citizens. Sometimes it is forgotten that we are the second of only two EU institutions with elected members so we have clear democratic legitimacy. </p>
          <p eId="para_148"> Since the start of this mandate in February 2020, I have had the privilege to lead the work of one of the legislative committees of the CoR as the chair of the economic policy commission. The European Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, ECON, has examined legislative proposals from the European Commission on the implementation of free trade agreements, the Brexit adjustment reserve, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, to mention a few of our reports, and has sent them on to the co-legislators to influence colleagues and impact laws that take account of regional and local assets and challenges. As an example, I highlight the work of a recently adopted opinion for which I was rapporteur entitled "Strengthening the EU-UK relationship at subnational level and remedying the territorial impact of the UK's withdrawal from the EU". There was much concern from local authorities across Europe about how the UK exit from the EU would impact their regions. On the UK side, I did not find the same tired political rhetoric we hear day and night from Westminster, rather the opposite. UK local and regional authorities have genuine concerns about the future relationship and have a real desire to work with Irish and EU local and regional authorities to ensure the smoothest and safest transition for their regions. I have copies of this opinion with me and would be delighted to take the committee through it bilaterally. I think my colleagues have copies. </p>
          <p eId="para_149"> There are significant opportunities for Ireland - for our communities and our citizens - but we need support for local authorities. We are very lucky to have the Irish regions European office in Brussels, which acts as a bridge between Irish local and regional government and the EU explaining and guiding its stakeholders through the Brussels scene and promoting Irish interests and best practices at the European level. This includes strong networks - place-based networks with regional offices representing large swathes of Europe - that often have legislative powers and fiscal autonomy for certain areas of competence. </p>
          <p eId="para_150"> I believe more can be done at local level. We all know the benefits of having a European officer in each local and regional authority. An example of what can happen when supports are given is the Chairman's own constituency of Donegal. Donegal County Council has installed a full-time European office. The same can be said for Cork City Council and Limerick City and County Council. I call on the committee to support the allocation of funding for European officers in local and regional authorities across the country. It is no surprise that it is those local authorities that have a full-time EU affairs officer that are the ones best positioned to access the great opportunities that exist at European level. </p>
          <p eId="para_151"> Before handing over to my colleague Councillor Kate Feeney, who will outline in more detail the work of the Irish delegation, I will conclude by paying tribute to my CoR colleagues - the members and alternates in the Irish delegation to the CoR. It is a genuine pleasure to lead this group of dedicated public representatives, who are working tirelessly in Brussels on behalf of local communities of Ireland. I invite the joint committee to Brussels to see at first hand the work of the Irish delegation in the CoR. </p>

          <p eId="para_153">I like to say that I am a Sligo girl but a Dublin woman. I thank the Chairman and members for inviting us to appear before them this afternoon. I also welcome President Tzitzikostas to Dublin and thank him for bringing the sunshine with him from Greece. I hope he leaves it behind when he goes back home.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> As members of the CoR - and I see Deputy Richmond, a former member, is here - we are in a unique position to see the workings and interactions of the EU institutions up close but we also have an opportunity to see how they impact local communities at home and across the EU. This is something that not all local representatives are exposed to. </p>
          <p eId="para_155">Because of this, two weeks ago, when the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, Party conference took place in Dublin, we decided to bring together local councillors from throughout Ireland to discuss how to bring Europe closer to the local community. I moderated the session and one point that was raised repeatedly related to the need for all levels of governance, European, national, regional and local, to work better together. This is a point Mr. Tzitzikostas raised previously during European Committee of the Regions debates and again today with his apt analogy of building a house and ensuring all the parts support one another.</p>
          <p eId="para_156"> The model of a two-dimensional Europe based simply on the European institutions and national governments has shown its limitations. Citizens who are passionate about Europe, and who like all of us in this room want to see the European project succeed, are rejecting the model we have had to date. Citizens from community groups to small business owners, farmers and, in particular, young people have voiced their desire to be part of Europe, of the decisions that are made and of drafting policy priorities and, importantly, of defining Europe's identity on the world stage. All of this starts by making Europe accessible to people at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> This is all the more relevant when we consider that this month marks six years since the Brexit vote. Brexit rightly continues to occupy much of our time and discourse in Ireland as we try to minimise its impact, but that can make it difficult to take time to stop and find learnings from it. If Brexit has taught us anything, it is the need for citizens to understand what Europe is doing for them. This means bridging the gap between Brussels and communities, moving beyond the bubble, acronyms, lingo and jargon and, if I can be bold, moving beyond rooms such as this one. It is about making Europe available and visible to everyone, in every community on our island, and about giving those communities a sense of ownership of Europe, and the key is accessibility. This point about making Europe more accessible was raised during the Conference on the Future of Europe, and it is about doing so at a local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> We in the Irish delegation to the European Committee of the Regions are playing our part in doing this. We play a leading role in the work of the European Committee of the Regions by influencing EU policies on citizens' dialogues; the Conference on the Future of Europe; free trade agreements, which Councillor Murphy mentioned; the New European Bauhaus; UK-EU relations; digital education; the inclusion of cities in COP27, small urban areas for a just transition; and, in my own work, building a Europe of equality and protecting LGBTIQ+ rights throughout Europe. Our delegation chose and championed these issues because we know how important they are to people at home. I am proud of the work we do as a team but, unfortunately, the lack of supports and frameworks available to our local councils mean we are not fully participating in the programmes and initiatives of the EU. We are not maximising the benefits of this work for the communities we represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> Ireland has been a net contributor to the EU since 2013, but even as net contributors, we supported a larger budget for the European Union. We do this because, as An Taoiseach told the European Parliament last week, we have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact membership has delivered for all dimensions of our society, and because our membership has been an historic enabler of sustained progress for Ireland. Again, however, when it comes to supports and partnerships for our local communities, there is much more we can do and get.</p>
          <p eId="para_160"> This is my key point, which Councillor Murphy also made. Our local councils need to be empowered to work not only vertically but also horizontally. They need to be empowered such that when they are faced with challenges such as the Covid-19 pandemic and smaller challenges such as managing libraries and parks, they can access wealth, knowledge and resources from other councils in Europe just like our own that are facing similar issues, but to do this we need proper supports, resources and frameworks, which are currently lacking. I ask, therefore, that the committee support our local councils, work with us and help us develop the tools and networks we need in order that our councils and communities can access Europe and feel truly part of the European project.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">My first question relates to the post-Brexit scenario. When I was a member of the European Committee of the Regions, there was significant input from members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and councillors from Northern Ireland to our work and it was very important in the build-up to Brexit to hear those voices, whether unionist, nationalist or other, ringing in about how it would impact on the ground in terms of local application, bearing in mind the level of devolved responsibilities to the Executive and the Assembly for implementing the protocol. A proposal at European Parliament level, suggested by Barry Andrews MEP, was that observer status be given to representatives from Northern Ireland. Is that something the European Committee of the Regions could do? Could it be pushed for across political parties?</p>
          <p eId="para_163"> All three of our guests referred to the Conference on the Future of Europe, which I attended with Mr. Tzitzikostas, Deputy Ó Murchú and Councillor McCarthy. I recall that some of Mr. Tzitzikostas's interventions were very similar to points made by Councillor Feeney. Many of the suggestions we received from citizens related to actions the EU was already taking, although perhaps it was not doing them well enough or perhaps it simply was not telling people about them. One point I have been making long term in regard to the European Union and all the institutions in its collective is that it is great at telling people how they can give out about the European Union but it is not great at telling people how they can benefit from it. This relates to citizens as well as elected representatives, and it is clear that in our local authorities, a dearth of information and resources is available to officials to ensure they can draw down enough funding and work with other local and regional authorities throughout the European Union. Both Councillor Feeney and Councillor Murphy have made a fairly direct challenge to the members of this committee, but the challenge in reverse relates to what the European Union and its institutions - whether the European Committee of the Regions, the Commission, the Parliament, the Council or the European Economic and Social Committee, our guests' co-tenants - are going to do. How can we ensure they will also seek to burst the bubble in Brussels, Strasbourg or wherever it may be?</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> I thank all our guests for attending. We had a great meeting in the previous term with one of Mr. Tzitzikostas's predecessors, Mr. Markku Markkula. Now that Covid has lifted to an extent, being able to have these meetings in person and not over Zoom is a very welcome change.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I might take the first question. Like Councillor Feeney, I acknowledge the Deputy is a former member of the European Committee of the Regions and a former head of the Irish delegation. He asked specifically about the newly established Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, PPA, which has met for the first time. I mentioned the opinion on which I worked on behalf of the European Committee of the Regions, which was adopted unanimously, strengthening the EU-UK relationship at a sub-national level. During the course of the drafting and adoption of that opinion, I worked closely with the Northern Ireland Local Government Association, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, COSLA, the Welsh Local Government Association and the Welsh senate, and the UK Local Government Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_166"> One of the key conclusions of the opinion relates to a strong willingness at local and regional level to work closely to strengthen co-operation at a local and regional level. The narrative at the local and regional level is completely different from the rhetoric coming from Westminster, and we in the European Committee of the Regions are working closely with local government associations throughout the United Kingdom. One issue on which we worked very closely related to obtaining observer status at the PPA and, thankfully, that was a big win for us. The European Committee of the Regions has observer status at the Parliamentary Partnership Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have observer status at the Parliamentary Partnership Assembly, PPA. Regrettably, the UK has decided not to include its local government associations or give speaking time to local and regional government at meetings of the PPA. Following on from the PPA's first meeting, though, I hope that the UK's local and regional government will have speaking time, and there are sounds coming from the PPA's administration that it will get speaking time. It is crucial for the implementation and governance of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement that local and regional government have some input. Local and regional government in the EU is represented at the PPA by the Committee of the Regions, but local and regional government on the UK side not being involved is a decision for the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The narrative at local and regional level across the UK is different from the narrative at Westminster. Local and regional government there wants to co-operate further, particularly on matters that know no boundaries, for example, climate change and protecting the environment, tourism, security and energy. They are beating that drum, so it is regrettable that the UK has decided to stop participating in territorial co-operation programmes, which are at the heart of the EU project. The macro issues must be sorted out, but if we move beyond those, perhaps we can revisit territorial co-operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_169"> That addresses the PPA element of the question. Perhaps Ms Feeney wishes to address the question's two other elements.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">I thank Deputy Richmond for his question. Regarding what the institutions are doing, breaking the bubble is a major challenge. National and local politicians in Ireland have a tendency to take credit when Europe does something well and to blame it when things go wrong. This does not help when we are trying to communicate Europe's message. With the help of the Irish Regions European Office, we ran a series of seminars over the past 12 months on communicating Europe across each of the regional assembly areas. We have also partaken in a number of citizens' dialogues. Indeed, we are taking part in another tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_171"> Undoubtedly, trying to make the benefits of EU membership tangible for people on the ground is a challenge. For instance, many do not know that the Erasmus+ programme or the free Interrail passes that are handed out to 18-year-olds across the Union are connected to the European project. This is about reinforcing such messages.</p>
          <p eId="para_172"> The Committee of the Regions is seeking an expanded budget from the Commission. Something we would like to do with that budget is to set up satellite hubs across the Union. They would be similar to the offices that the European Parliament has in various capital cities, but we would like to have ours out in the regions. We could use them as hubs from which to communicate our message.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> Communicating the message is a challenge for each of us. Every person in this room must take on that challenge and check our language and messaging when communicating matters concerning Europe.</p>

          <from> Mr. Apostolos Tzitzikostas<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T12:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_174">I will add some ideas about the future of Europe. Last month, the Conference on the Future of Europe ended. It was an interesting discussion in which Deputy Richmond and other Irish Members were active. However, a significant question has arisen since the end of the conference, and that is, what now? For a year plus some months, citizens, organisations, societies and teams of people across Europe gave us their ideas and voiced their concerns. After all of that, if Europe ends the discussion at this point and does nothing, it will be a disaster. It is clear, not only to those of us who participated in the conference but to all citizens of Europe, that Europe's last chance might be now. Now that the conference has concluded, we must realise that we have no more time to lose. Europe must change now. This is the only way to stop the anti-European sentiment that we are seeing across Europe, for example, Brexit, the French presidential election and yesterday's parliamentary elections in France. We see anti-European voices rising in most of the 27 member states. Why is this the case? It is simply because citizens – the people – feel left out of the process that is happening in Strasbourg and Brussels. We need to build a more open, more democratic and more transparent Europe and bring our citizens on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_175"> How do we do this? It is not possible for more than 400 million citizens to be involved in a process. That is why we are here. We represent 240 regions, 90,000 municipalities and 1.2 million elected politicians at regional and local levels in Europe. We can be the actors who help to bring Europe closer to the citizens and the citizens closer to Europe. Let them understand, and give them the feeling that they are part of, the decision-making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> We made specific amendments to the final conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe, which were included in the final draft. They deal with the need to change and upgrade the strength and role of the European Committee of the Regions, which not only includes regions, but also cities. It is not a committee, but an assembly. We are the only chamber outside the European Parliament that is directly elected by the citizens. We are divided into political groups, have 329 members and function just as a parliament. However, we do not have decisive powers. We can only advise the European Parliament. We are asking for a more decisive role, especially when it comes to issues that have territorial aspects. In this way, not only will citizens feel more involved, but cities and regions will be able to tell Europe the best way to provide solutions to real problems. Regions and cities have the most proximity to the lives of citizens. As such, we have a deep knowledge of what the real issues and problems are and what the solutions to them should be.</p>
          <p eId="para_177"> We support the idea of a convention in Europe that will open some of the treaties and see what can be changed in order to make our Europe more democratic, more open and better functioning. In this new era, the European Committee of the Regions and, therefore, the cities and regions of Europe want their role to be understood as one that can not only help to bring Europe closer to the citizens in the regions and cities, but can also make citizens believe and trust in this European vision again.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_179">I thank everyone for attending. I believe this may be the largest delegation we have ever had at a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. Maybe some of the online meetings during lockdown were bigger but they were different. It is important to have this dialogue. I thank the president of the European Committee of the Regions, Mr. Tzitzikostas, for his presentation and kindness in not pointing out the weakness of Ireland's local government system, which is the weakest in Europe. We need to do something about that. Mr. Tzitzikostas made the point, perhaps as a result of his natural diplomacy, that we must strengthen the European Parliament, national parliaments and local government. In truth, we need to rebalance the functionality of each of these and that is a job of work for us in Ireland, in particular. Those of us who served in Government bear responsibility for the weakness of local government in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> Members of the committee engage all the time on Europe and I was taken by the point on communicating the vision and principles of Europe to the citizenry. Everyone has a solution when they appear before us to discuss this. I wonder how many people in Wexford would know what the Committee of the Regions is if I stopped and asked some of them. If I were to ring around the councils, how many councillors would be able to answer that question? That is a very profound issue for those involved to answer. The committee is an intrinsic and fundamental part of the European democratic structure and we need to do something about that collectively as well. Perhaps this dialogue is the start so that those of us interested in European affairs are not in little echo chambers talking about grandiose notions. Even when we go on roadshows on Europe, how many people come to the seminars apart from those who are interested and knowledgeable from the start? There are fundamental issues in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I have another point to raise before I ask a question. It was said that empowering local authorities is the way to deepen appreciation of Europe and combat growing nationalism or xenophobia. There are an awful lot of elected councillors across Europe who are xenophobic and are sending a different message out. The solution is more complex than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> From an Irish perspective, I thank the Committee of the Regions for the solidarity shown on Brexit. Many people believed there would not be solidarity from across the Union on the unique requirements of Ireland and did not expect the ongoing expression of solidarity we heard today. We have a very intimate parliamentary system because, as everyone knows, Irish Members of Parliament are very close to the ground. We provide clinics all the time and hear people in a way that is not replicated in every European country. How do parliamentarians link in better with what is happening at European level in terms of the Committee of the Regions to advocate for the sort of direct contact between people, which it has been said is so important?</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I thank Deputy Howlin for his question. I am glad he raised the subsidiarity issues because I was certainly not going to mention the war. A joke is often made that we are probably sitting in the biggest county council in the country here in Dáil Éireann. That is something we need to address when talking about the rebalancing of powers. The Deputy is right. If you speak to county councillors in any part of the country, you will find councillors who do not know what the Committee of the Regions is. We have reporting structures but we are sitting in committee rooms such as this. We report to our regional assemblies. It does not trickle down to our council chambers and that is a problem. We have newsletters that go out to councillors who have signed up to them. We are relying on people to sign up for the newsletter and then relying on them to open it once it lands in their inbox. We are trying to find ways around that.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> The Deputy Howlin raised the issue of trying to use local and regional authorities to fight xenophobia in cities. It is a message we in the Committee of the Regions champion. Of course, there are local representatives who do not sign up to that message in the same way that there are national representatives who do not, and they can be found in every member state. It is, however, a message we try to champion. This year, the president, Mr. Tzitzikostas, awarded the first Pawe Adamowicz award. Pawe Adamowicz was a mayor who was a strong supporter of LGBTQI rights and was murdered in his home city. The award was given to Ms Henriette Reker, Mayor of Cologne, who was the target of a xenophobic attack that nearly took her life on the eve of her election. She was elected while she was in a coma. She was the first recipient of the award. We use our position and committee to champion those ideals and award those who sign up to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_185"> On how we can further the dialogue at home, meetings like this are important. We should hold them more often. We should get them out of rooms like this and engage with people who are not always engaged in the conversation. That may be done by choosing subject matter. I know when Councillor Fintan Phelan in Carlow held a local dialogue meeting he chose a local issue to discuss, which meant people who would not normally care about the EU came along and learned about it as a result. We have to find better ways of doing it but today is a good start. </p>

          <from> Mr. Michael Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T12:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_186">Deputy Howlin is absolutely right. If I were to walk down the streets of Clonmel and told citizens that I am a member of the European Committee of the Regions, they would ask what that is about. One could say that about a lot of institutions at European, regional or national level. The reason we are here today is try to communicate our work in Europe at a local level. We do that through different mediums. We communicate our work to the regional assemblies. We also talk to local authority members. We publish and distribute newsletters. It is a real challenge, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> I return to the concept of having a European affairs officer in every local authority. That would be very important. I would love for the Joint Committee on European Affairs to invite in the County and City Management Association, CCMA, for example, and ask what the local authority chief executives are doing. I will give a different analogy. The appointment of a broadband officer in every local authority was a new initiative introduced some years ago. I cannot emphasis enough how successful that was and we could do the same by having an EU affairs officer in every local authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_188"> I continuously make the point that all the citizens we represent are concerned with what they perceive to be national issues, such as infrastructural deficits. The irony is that Europe is playing a key role in delivering on those challenges. LEADER funding is spent at local level but local authorities do not communicate that this money comes from Europe. I think members understand the point I am making. It is a real challenge. We are trying and doing our best, which is why we are here today and taking a number of different steps. There is real engagement between the Irish Regions European Office and local authorities on creating awareness. If I have one message I would like delivered today, it is about the work this committee can do in delivering EU affairs officers to each local authority.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">Mr. Murphy is right on his assessment of the lack of knowledge of institutions, generally speaking, and not only of ours. If we broaden it out a little, things are not getting any better if we think about it. Does the Deputy think the average European citizen knows his or her Commissioner, and there is only one Commissioner for each member state? I doubt it. Does he think the average citizen knows his or her country's Members of the European Parliament? I doubt it. Very few do. Some will know their members of national parliaments if they are vocal. However, does the Deputy know who they certainly do know? They know their mayors. They know the presidents of regions. They deal with them every day. The regional local governments in most European member states engage not only in words but in actions. We implement many public works today using European funding. We transform anonymous European funds to life-changing public works for the citizens in their citizen regions. This is exactly why I said I believe citizen regions can play this role - because of our proximity to the citizens and their issues and the fact we are using all this European funding, especially Cohesion Funds, to build schools, hospitals and roads, to support SMEs and people in difficulty, to create environmental works and to carry out transport, culture, education and tourism projects. We are able to show the average citizen what Europe is all about and how it influences his or her everyday life, and that the notion Europe is something distant that does not affect us is wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">Ta fáilte roimh gach duine atá anseo. It is great to have this interaction. In fairness, Deputy Howlin probably dealt with the first issue I was going to deal with, which is the weakness of our local government. Certain powers lie with us or with the Executive, and not with local representatives. Beyond that, there is a general under-resourcing of those areas for which there is a responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> Solidarity for the Northern Ireland protocol has been stated and I add my voice to that. </p>
          <p eId="para_193"> We need to follow up on Councillor Murphy’s proposal to have an EU affairs officer at each local authority. If we need to bring in representatives of the County and City Management Association, CCMA, or of some other body, perhaps that is a job of work we should consider doing. What have been the advantages where such an officer has been in place? </p>
          <p eId="para_194"> To follow up on the conversation we have had previously on the distance from politics felt by the people, it is not only at a European level. That distance is major at this point in time and it has left a vast vacuum. I would say we, and that includes all of us, were not the most representative group of people in the room at the Conference on the Future of Europe. If public meetings were held anywhere across Ireland, and I imagine throughout Europe, a range of issues would have come to the fore that did not come to the fore at that forum. I refer specifically to the drugs issue, drug addiction and crime. I can point to the number of times those issues are spoken about in these Houses and at local level. What item of work can be done from the point of view of bridging that gap? Europe has sold itself to the vast majority of us - particularly those of us here who may have had a difficulty with it at the time of the financial crash - in dealing with the pandemic, the Ukrainian crisis and, hopefully, the cost-of-living crisis and what mitigations Europe can provide in that context. What item of work can we do to bridge that gap with people? We have skirted around some of that issue. I acknowledge it is not the simplest of questions to answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I thank the delegations for their presentations. This engagement has been very informative regarding the work of the Committee of the Regions. I thank the president of the committee for his comments on the protocol and the solidarity he has shown to us. I also acknowledge the comment he made about the challenges with regard to the Ukrainian refugees, and children in particular, and the work he is doing there.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I am conscious of the time factor and I have only two questions. The first one is for the president. He spoke about the need to bring Europe closer to the citizens, how that can be done and the role of the Committee of the Regions in that regard. I wish to expand on that with regard to geopolitics generally. President Biden has spoken about the battle between democracy and autocracy throughout the world. We have some experience of that manifesting itself in Europe with respect to rule of law issues and the Brexit vote in 2016. I refer to the battle between internationalism and unilateralism and the need for a rules-based international order. The president spoke about bringing Europe closer to the citizens. Does he envisage the Committee of the Regions having a role to play in that wider debate between autocracy and democracy? Are the two concepts related? </p>
          <p eId="para_198"> With regard to Councillor Murphy and Councillor Feeney, we have touched on the issue of local government reform. We are in the presence of a former Minister with responsibility for local government. We realise we have a very centralised form of government in Ireland. Does the Irish delegation of the Committee of the Regions have a view on having a directly elected mayor for Dublin or any other local authority? Perhaps there is considerable division among the delegation about that. I do not mean this in a condescending way but have the councillors made a submission to the Citizens' Assembly on having a directly elected mayor?</p>

          <p eId="para_200">All the delegates are welcome here today. I am delighted they came before us and made presentations. One of the first issues I spoke about when I became a member of this committee was having a bottom-up approach when it comes to Europe. I have very much advocated for a European strategic policy committee, SPC, for every local authority, which is important, and for there to be a European department in every local authority in the country. The top-down approach does not work. It does not provide for engaging with the citizen as much. That should happen locally. I come from a local government background and I know how distant the gap is from local government to European affairs. It is all very well for us to haul in before this committee the Minister with responsibility for local government, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Byrne, but the money has to come from somewhere for funding SPCs. Some counties already have a European affairs department. They have not only a European affairs officer but also a department. Some councils are doing it really well. What would the delegates' message be today for other councils, and for the Minister with responsibility for European Affairs, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister with responsibility for local government, as to how best they can work with them to have a bottom-up approach to Europe that is not there currently?</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary<recordedTime time="2022-06-15T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_201">I thank the delegates not only for their presentations but also for their ongoing work. We have been set a challenge and, in fairness to Senator Keogan, she was the first to advocate for having European affairs officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">We have been set a challenge. In fairness to Senator Keogan, she was first regarding the EU officers. It would be a wonderful way to mark Ireland's 50th anniversary as an EU member if every local authority had a fully-funded EU officer. I was struck when attending an event recently, hosted by the Bonniconlon Irish Countrywomen's Association to mark Ireland's 50 years of membership. It was the biggest event in an Irish town I had seen for a European event. It was not put as some sort of technical lecture about the EU. On the day, people were encouraged to provide their memories of the referendum, those who were around at the time of the referendum, and their memories of the debate. Yes, there were the usual inputs from the bubble, as Councillor Feeney said, about how great we are and how great we have become because of the EU. It was, however, the personal inputs and the personal stories and reflections on the difference that EU membership has made to families and to farms that had resonance on the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> As a committee we must take the challenge. I was particularly struck by the warnings in Mr. Tzitzikostas' final remarks. As we get into our 50th year let it not be a year of ribbon-cutting and patting ourselves on the back. Let us actually leave something behind. Moving forward with the EU officers might be some way to do that. Mr. Tzitzikostas used the phrase "anonymous European funds". They have become more anonymous here since we have become, as Councillor Feeney remarked, a net contributor. We no longer seem to want to realise that EU funds, including the LEADER fund and the European Social Fund, fund much of our third and fourth level education. This has made the disconnect worse. Obviously there is the EU officers' role, but what other initiatives could we take to address this disconnect?</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> Councillor Murphy was at pains to emphasise that the narrative at local level across the UK was different from that in Westminster. They were also told this before Brexit. We were told this before the referendum, and that the vote was not going the way the media saw it. The regions that benefited most in financial investment by those anonymous EU funds voted to leave in the biggest numbers. I am referring to the fishing regions and the port regions. Holyhead, for example, had massive investment in its port from those anonymous EU funds, yet the region had one of the biggest leave votes. How are we going to correct that disconnect?</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> On a completely unrelated question, one of the biggest consequences of the war in Ukraine is the number of local representatives who have been kidnapped or murdered just because they were local representatives and had a mandate. This question is for the president or the delegation. What role has the council taken in highlighting this since 24 February, in keeping attention on that? They are like you and they are like all of us here. They are local representatives. Some of them have paid with their freedom and some have paid with their lives because they are local representatives. </p>

          <p eId="para_209">I thank the Chairman. I have listened intently to all of the conversations. I agree wholeheartedly that there is a disconnect between the people on the ground and the EU, even among local representatives. I am chairman of the regional assembly in Waterford. The question we are often asked is: "What are you crowd doing down there?" The point that has not come up today is the fact that a massive Covid recovery fund has been handed from the EU to Ireland, which at the moment is being distributed and orchestrated. This is more than €500 million. This is real money coming from the EU but as some members have stated, we do not have a full-time EU officer in all of the councils. I believe there are only three or four currently. It is very necessary because the paperwork is complex. It would not be complex to a person who was full time at it. As Mr. Tzitzikostas said, we need real connectedness between the EU and the people on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> In most of the EU regions, 40% of control is devolved to the local councils, but in Ireland it is less than 9%. That is something we must balance a bit. We do need a bit more control from the ground up to give people the connection they need. The EU has been very good to Ireland and I believe we can give something back. We are a very democratic society. Ireland is probably one of the longest lasting democracies, excepting that we have a problem with our Border at the moment. As the Chairman knows, this has the potential to implode badly if we do not bite the bullet on this.</p>

I will just touch briefly on Deputy Haughey's question on the directly elected mayor, as he is the only Dublin-based Oireachtas Member present, while I acknowledge the presence of the sitting Lord Mayor of Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> As a delegation we would struggle to come to a defined consensus and make a joint submission on this. We are 18 members in total with nine full members and nine alternate members. All political parties are represented and we have Independent members in the group too. While we wear the green jersey and speak with one voice when we are in Brussels, the debates are a little more interesting when we are at home and we would struggle to find a common message on that. I am glad the assembly has brought in mayors from different cities, and mayors with different structures and different executive powers. The way the assembly is being run is very good. Personally, I will make a submission but a joint submission will not be coming from the delegation in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I am aware that time is of the essence here, so I will make just a few brief points, including if anything can be done to restore the Borough of Clonmel and the other boroughs as well. The Borough of Clonmel was granted by royal charter in 1608. It is something we held on to, despite our famed resistance to Oliver Cromwell in 1650. If there is anything the committee can do to restore that and give independence back to Clonmel, I would be very grateful.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> In my introductory speech I gave the example of Cork city, represented here by Councillor Kieran McCarthy, and Cork county, Donegal and Limerick, all of which have full-time EU affairs officers. My local authority in Tipperary had such an officer but for whatever reason of staffing challenges and so on it just petered out. The local authorities with full-time EU affairs officers are accessing EU funds. Cork city is one of 100 cities, along with Dublin, that will be a climate-neutral city under the Horizon Europe funds. These are pots of money. Notwithstanding the networking opportunities, it is complex to access them. This is why we need these EU affairs officers. Ms Teresa Lennon and Mr. Tadgh Browne are here representing the Irish Regions European Office. It is a resource for the Irish authorities to engage with, but it is very important that we would have EU affairs officers who can connect with the Irish Regions European Office, which can guide the officers and help them through the complex processes involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I work in the private sector and I am a full-time public representative. I work also with the European Committee of the Regions. I see that local authorities can get a lot of things wrong, but they can also get a lot of things right. I was very proud of the way my local authority responded to the Covid-19 pandemic, with precision and in a timely manner. All the other local authorities were the same. They were at the epicentre of the Covid-19 recovery and response. I will give the recovery and resilience instrument as an example.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">It was a big pot of money that came from Europe. Regrettably, local authorities in Ireland were not consulted to a great extent on the preparation of the recovery and resilience facility. It was really just a box-ticking exercise. They certainly were not involved in its implementation. Local authorities cannot simply be executors. If the Minister was here, I would deliver a simple message to him. Let us empower local authorities. Let us have cross-party and cross-departmental support to empower local authorities because they can deliver.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">Most of the questions were answered by my colleagues. I have a few words to say concerning Ukraine and the atrocities happening there. It is not that the Russian regime abducted mayors in Ukraine. It also killed some of them. It is true this is a human tragedy that we never thought could happen in the 21st century within Europe and right at the border of the European Union. From the very first minute, we did all in our power to convey the message that this needs to stop immediately. I personally visited the border between the European Union and Ukraine and saw the struggles of the people. I saw millions of people fleeing from Ukraine trying to find shelter. I saw the difficulty encountered by but also the vision and will of regional and local leaders of European regions and cities at the border with Ukraine, and how they were trying to help with all the resources, in order to strengthen these people during this humanitarian disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_220"> The Ukrainian situation and Russian war were the main topic of our previous plenary. We had the chance to discuss this with several mayors of Ukraine who were online. They described the situation, the atrocities happening in Ukraine and the need for support. What we have done, as I said, is create this platform in order to help. Cities and regions throughout Europe have been sending humanitarian aid. We did something to convey a strong political message as well. After consulting our colleagues, I have given honorary membership to the Mayor of Kyiv and president of the municipalities of Ukraine, Mr. Vitali Klitschko. He is now an honorary member of the Committee of Regions, which is a strong political move. We will not stop here.</p>
          <p eId="para_221"> As I said, the discussions about the reconstruction phase are under way. Cities and regions are getting involved in this project and alliance. We will be able to help with technocrats, engineers, mechanics and others. Help has developed in cities and regions and we will use that for Ukraine as well. Cities and regions will be involved. I already discussed this matter with President Zelenskyy. With the support of the European Commission and the Council of Europe, we will go forward and help these people who have been suffering.</p>
          <p eId="para_222"> I thank the Chair and dear members of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. It has been a privilege and an honour for me to be here today. Being from Greece, the other end of the European Union, I know how you feel being located here. I know how it is to sometimes feel like things are happening far away. I believe in Ireland. I see people with vision here. I see a great country with great prospects. I admit that I see a lot of things in common between the Greek and Irish people even though we are miles apart. Ireland can count on one more friend and ally from now on.</p>
          <p eId="para_223"> I thank the committee for its invitation and congratulate our great members of the European Committee of Regions who have been of tremendous help throughout these past two and a half years, holding different positions of interest in the committee, and helped to achieve all the goals we set from the beginning.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">On behalf of the committee, I thank the president of the Committee of the Regions, Mr. Tzitzikostas, as well as Mr. Murphy and Ms Feeney. Today was much more than just a conversation. It was more than politicians telling one and other how great a job they are doing. A number of challenges came from both sides and that is healthy and refreshing.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> We will follow up on the matter raised about the sitting of the committee. We always meet in the committee rooms. Formally, we have to meet in the precincts of Leinster House but we may have a conversation in private session about visiting Tipperary, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown or Sligo. Maybe Councillor Blaney will have us in Donegal with his big connections up there. We will leave that decision to the delegates. Members of the committee would be happy to meet them formally or informally. That would be very refreshing.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> I acknowledge the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alison Gilliland, and all the councillors from the different regions in the Public Gallery, including Councillor Pip Breen for his intervention. There was no shyness from the Wexford man intervening from the Gallery. Ar son an choiste, guím gach rath ar na finnéithe leis an obair thábhachtach seo. Gabhaim buíochas leo as díospóireacht an lae inniu agus as an obair atá déanta acu fosta. Beidh an todhchaí níos difriúla ach beimid le chéile ag obair, agus táimid anseo fá choinne thacaíochta amach anseo fosta.</p>
