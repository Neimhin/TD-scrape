          <p eId="para_4">The Order of Business is No. 1, the European Convention on Human Rights Bill 2001 – Committee Stage, to be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 1.30 p.m.; No. 2, statements on the OECD economic survey of Ireland of May 2003, to be taken from 2.30 p.m. until 5 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons to be 15 minutes and other Senators ten minutes and on which Senators may share time; and No. 3, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 – Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 5 p.m. There will be a sos between 1.30 p.m. and 2.30 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">There is no way that we can take the Intoxicating Liquor Bill before statements on the OECD report because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be taking oral questions in the Lower House during the time allocated for those statements.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_6">I wish to continue my protest in respect of No. 3, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill. We are not giving this Bill enough time. The dilemma for the Opposition is the shortage of time between Second Stage and Committee Stage. There is evidence that, where we do not spend enough time on legislation, mistakes are made. This is an important Bill which, as a colleague said yesterday, involves seven other items of legislation. We need more time and I ask the Leader to reconsider that matter, particularly in light of the considerable workload justice spokespersons' on all sides had yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">No. 16 on the Order Paper is a motion requiring that the Offences Against the State Act 1998 continue in force for another year until 30 June 2004. Will the Leader give a commitment to debate this motion next week? This draconian legislation was introduced as a result of the Omagh bombing. A commitment was given to the Opposition at the time that the stringent powers it contains would be debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas on a yearly basis. We should continue this practice because the Government should give us its assessment as to why there is a need for this legislation to continue in force and we should always remember the reason this legislation was introduced, namely, the appalling atrocity at Omagh. There will be an opportunity next week for the Leader to arrange a debate on the motion in question in order to allow the Government respond to points raised. I am aware that, at present, there is an individual before the courts on foot of the provisions of the Act. I will not comment on that, other than to say that there is at least one case before courts as a result of the legislation and it would be good if the House was to debate it at some point next week.</p>

This is an issue that we must address. I have not heard an adequate explanation as to why it was not accepted. This matter is being discussed in the Lower House tomorrow. When will the Seanad be given an opportunity to discuss the health report, which is crucial, and the detail contained therein?</p>
          <p eId="para_9">It is also crucial that Members put on the record what they wish to see in place. I do not know exactly what we need to look for in a health service, but making structural and administrative changes will not improve the position. We should have a full day's debate or, at the very least, a half day's debate on this matter. It cannot be put to rest without being dealt with by both Houses of the Oireachtas. I do not fully understand what the Government has in mind, but we are entitled to get an outline of what is intended and to respond to it as best we can.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">No. 5 on the Order Paper is Committee Stage of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Bill 2003, on which we recently had a long debate at Second Stage. The Bill seems to have been dropped into limbo. Perhaps the Leader could indicate whether there is some difficulty with it. Serious issues were raised, not least by people on the Government side of the House. I am wondering what the problem is. Many questions are being asked about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_11">I hope the Leader can assure us that the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2002 will not be taken before the summer, so that it is not sprung on the House. I share fully Senator Brian Hayes's view that whatever the urgencies of Government positions, the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003 makes reference to 14 other pieces of legislation. The Minister has made it clear that the whole area of regulation of intoxicating liquor sales is desperately in need of codification. To his credit he has said he will do so. It makes it difficult for spokespersons for the Opposition in particular. There are probably some people in Fianna Fáil who can remember when they were in Opposition and therefore realise the difficulties. The Opposition does not have the resources of the Civil Service to do all this work. To take Committee Stage so soon is not the way we should do our business. In this I do not blame the Leader because I have evidence of her willingness to stand up for this House on this matter. I want to emphasise that this is not the way this House should do its business.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">I want to raise only one real issue on the Order of Business because it is hugely important. Last night I was looking at RTE's website and I saw a little headline in the corner of the business section which indicated the Railway Procurement Agency had now discovered that the Dublin metro could be constructed for €2.6 billion. This morning that had gone up to €3.4 billion, but it was originally €4.8 billion. The report indicated the construction time could be 2.5 years instead of seven. It said agency officials came to these conclusions because they had been in touch with Professor Manuel Maynar Melis, the director general of transport infrastructure in Madrid, who had supervised the construction of the Madrid metro.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">If a State agency is capable of that level of erroneous estimations, it should be sacked. I wish to be explicit: if a student of mine did a crude assessment of the capital cost of a chemical plant and forgot to compare it with what was happening in the real world, he or she would fail. What happened here is that some genius decided to do an estimate, obviously without reference to what was happening in the rest of the world. As far as I am concerned, that is incompetence on a scale to which there is only one response. They should be sacked and replaced by somebody who can do the job properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">I fully support Senator Ryan's remarks about the metro. We had a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport this morning which was addressed by Professor Melis, the man responsible for constructing the undergound in Madrid. It is important that we look at it again because it was this House, on foot of an amendment of mine, that initiated the whole question of the metro. We have in the Leader somebody who has very considerable experience in this area. Professor Melis also said there were five times too many people involved in the project. He has got it down even further. We were told €4.8 billion; it is down now to €1.05 billion, in other words one quarter what we were told and it can be put in, with his advice, by Christmas 2006 – forget 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">There are certain things we need to do and this is what I want to propose, because I believe it is extremely important. Professor Melis said they cleared the way and they could not have done it without the co-operation of their parliamentary colleagues, the legislators, because they had to make certain provisions in Madrid with regard, for example, to the ownership of the ground. Here, as in Paris, the ownership goes right down to the centre of the earth. It is one of these legal fictions. We need to amend that so that everything below 25 metres, for the purpose of public infrastructure, belongs to the State. They were able to do that in Madrid. I suggested to the joint committee that we should establish a group to look at all the legislative proposals that need to be put together for them to clear the decks completely in a compendium-type Bill. I suggest that with the expertise of the Leader, a former distinguished Minister for Transport, the Seanad could be the House to introduce the legislation to clear the way. It needs to be done immediately, if we are going to start in spring, as Professor Melis suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">A concerned constituent has written to me because of an apparent decision by An Post to cease the sale of international reply coupons. These are used for returning a manuscript to a foreign country, for example. It is a disadvantage to certain elements of our society if An Post has decided to stop them.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">I ask that the Parliamentary Bulletin, which will do damage to the Oireachtas, be withdrawn. It contains a couple of paragraphs about the election, pictures which take up half a page and a chapter on the parliamentary committees, in which Members, with the exception of university Senators, are listed by order of election. This means that I come last, but never mind. There is then another picture which takes up half a page, followed by the number of days on which the Houses sat. The latter shows that the Dáil sat only once between 1 July 2002 and 30 September 2002. It sat for a total of five days during the entire period, while the Seanad only sat for two days.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I support the comments of Senator Ryan and those of Senator Norris – with whom I am in agreement for the second time this week – in regard to the Railway Procurement Agency. The Minister should be commended because he took the initiative to involve the Spanish and draw a comparison with their experiences, thus giving rise to the potential savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I agree that the future of the Railway Procurement Agency must be in serious doubt. Unfortunately, this is symptomatic of a total disregard across the public services for any commitment to obtaining value for money. I am disappointed that we have not had a debate on value for money in terms of capital and public expenditure in the public service, particularly as I have requested such a debate on three occasions. I again appeal to the Leader to have an early debate on this subject. Such a debate would provide an ideal opportunity for the House to leave party politics aside and lead the way in respect of this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">I support Senator Brian Hayes's request for a debate on the Offences Against the State Act 1998 and its draconian provisions and the stark contrast between the security forces in the South, which are taking all the necessary steps, and those in Northern Ireland, which are going in the opposite direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Will the Leader give way to calls for a debate on the health strategy and the health reports? If we want value for money, it can be sought in a range of areas, including the health services and local government. Professor Brennan's comments about consultants' contracts and all the vested interests and professions call into question much of the public comment on the strategy to the effect the removal of councillors will, in some way, benefit the health services. If the vested interest of the professions were removed and we made the health services accountable to councillors at local level, we would be going in a better direction.</p>

This is a serious issue and it is important that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, keeps his eye on the ball in negotiations at the Council of Ministers. Greencastle and Killybegs fishermen already received a hammering in respect of the nine day rule.

Many elderly people manage to maintain an independent living because of home helps. There has been a huge reduction throughout the country in the number of hours that home helps can spend with people. This is having a knock-on effect, meaning that those who could be independent at home are finding themselves in casualty departments. Some are trying to do work they are unable to do and others are being neglected. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House to explain exactly how much money is being saved by curtailing the number of hours that home helps can spend with people? We will then be able to see if this is having a much more serious knock-on effect than was expected.</p>

The credibility of the senior executives of the agency has been seriously strained. How much research did they carry out to establish the values involved and to what degree did they examine better practice in other countries which have established a similar service? I compliment the Minister and his officials on having the initiative to bring in representatives from Madrid and exposing the problems that exist. It begs many questions when we see a headline stating that the financial quantification should be €1.4 billion less than that which was originally envisaged. The degree of the research carried out in estimating the costs of projects of this nature calls into question the value for money we get from such projects.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_47">I support Senator Brady in his call for a discussion on the road safety aspects of motorcycles. There was a tragic accident last week in my county of Clare in which a young man on a motorbike was killed. The attitude to motorcycle accidents does not seem to be the same as that to other accidents in terms of the introduction of penalty points. This should be examined at the earliest opportunity. There are far more motorbikes in use in rural areas that there were in the past. This may have to do with the high price young people have to pay for insurance. Their only affordable means of transport is the motorbike.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Another aspect of road safety which is of concern to me – it is evident at this time of the year – is the illegal sale of strawberries, apples, etc., on some of the main roads. I have seen a number of quite dangerous late braking manoeuvres involving people who decided, at the last possible moment, to stop to buy these products.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">I support the calls for a debate on health. The proposal that the Minister made yesterday seems exciting and interesting. With the changing of the structures in the health service and the demise of the health boards, the House should recognise the huge input of local politicians and councillors on those health boards over the years. There is almost an inference in some media commentaries that the problems in the health service had a lot to do with councillors and the people that worked on the health boards. We should ignore this and pay a debt of gratitude to those who served selflessly on the boards for many years.</p>

Roscommon County Council has only €40,000, yet 300 or 400 houses are being listed on the council register, which works out at not more than €100 per house.

Such a debate is not taking place in the Dáil tomorrow, but rather tomorrow week. The Minister is coming to the House for the debate before the recess.

He asked also about the speed with which the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is being debated. It is a good Bill and the Minister has said it is part of a process. Committee Stage of the Bill will be debated this afternoon. He also mentioned the Rail Procurement Agency and said it should get the boot. I sound a note of caution. While the figures today look good – and I would be delighted if that was how the project proceeded – sometimes the promise of such reductions is not fulfilled. The learned professor said it was done in Madrid. We need legislation to deal with matters relating to the depth under the ground, who owns what and so on. There will be no system of appeals or tribunals in these cases. Whether Ireland is ready for the swift changeover is another matter. Any reduction in costs would be welcome. We are all full of courage about the Rail Procurement Agency today but we may not be on another occasion.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">Senator Jim Walsh called for a debate on value for money, with particular reference to the ongoing debate about the Rail Procurement Agency. He agreed with Deputy Brian Hayes on the call for a debate on the Offences Against the State Act. Also he called for a debate on the health strategy and the health report. It was a pleasure to listen to Professor Brennan this morning speak about consultants' contracts. She was a good speaker to whom one would listen carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Senator McHugh raised the issue of the Irish Box. The MEPs voted in favour of it and he said the Commission is working to diminish it. I hope to have the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, here for a debate before we break up.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Senator McCarthy asked about the level of accountancy in the Brennan and Prospectus reports. We have to get value for money or we will not have enough to put into the health services. Senator Henry raised the issue of the home help service. That is a recurring theme right across the country. It arises from the fact that the elderly can remain in their homes provided there is adequate home help. In its own way it is a money saver if beds are not taken up.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">Senator Scanlon echoed Senator Leyden's call for a debate on North West Radio. Senator Finucane raised the Rail Procurement Agency. Senator Dooley called for a debate on the road safety as it pertains to motorcyclists and the illegal selling of vegetables at the side of the road. I do not know whether it is legal but it is causing people to stop quickly to buy their produce. Perhaps there should be some regulation governing it. He supported the call for a debate on the health services. Senator Dooley also wished to pay tribute to local councillors. They are not gone yet but I am sure we will do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">Senator Feighan asked about the listed buildings in each county and said Roscommon County Council has received €40,000 which will not go far.

          <p eId="para_75">Although I read the Minister's Second Stage contribution carefully, I am at somewhat of a loss regarding the process by which certain sections of the convention, which are not incorporated in Irish law, will be incorporated in this legislation while others will not. Amendment No. 1 proposes to insert Articles 34 and 46 into section 1.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">Article 34 involves individual applications to the European Court of Human Rights. It states that "The High Contracting Parties undertake not to hinder in any way the effective exercise of this right.", namely, the right to make individual application. Article 46 concerns the binding force and execution of judgments. I do not understand why we would enable a position to persist where Irish law or practice could hinder somebody's right to make an individual application or not operate a final judgment of the court. There would be no remedy in Irish law for either of those situations. If, for example, the prison system interfered with the right of a prisoner or somebody appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, received a judgment in their favour but the State declined to implement it, there would be no remedy in Irish law because of the omission of the two articles to which I refer. The person would be obliged to return to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">I am at a loss to understand how it could be regarded as fair that two of the basic individual rights would be essentially kept at arms length from this country. Therefore, our proposal in amendment No. 1 is that Articles 34 and 46 be added to the list of articles to which section 1 refers.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_78">Article 34 of the convention provides for the right of individuals to apply to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in cases where they claim to be victims of alleged violations of convention rights. This is the right of individual petition. The related Article 35 of the convention enables the court to deal with such cases only after all domestic remedies are exhausted and within a time limit of six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_79">The convention entered into force almost 50 years ago and Ireland and Sweden were the only contracting states which accepted this important right of individual petition. That has been our unvarying practice ever since. It is something with which the State has engaged itself in international law. We have always accepted this right of our citizens and it is not at issue in this legislation. The legislation does not affect the current position in any way because the practice has been established. As a matter of individual obligation, our citizens have always been permitted to make an individual application to the court at Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">At the time, the thinking on international jurisprudence was that the sovereignty and equality of the state should be paramount and that nationals should not be allowed to invoke the protection of international tribunals against the sovereignty of a particular state. Ireland, along with Sweden, was one of the first states to disagree with this. We laid our marker in that respect many years ago. The Minister outlined yesterday the ten cases which have already been instituted and taken in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The Bill provides for cases under the convention being taken before our courts. However, that in no way prejudices or interferes with the right of individual petition to Strasbourg, under the provisions of Article 34, if a person so wishes. Our original acceptance of the right of individual petition to the court remains in full effect. The international law on the matter is self-executing in our law. It does not require to be added to by express statutory restatement. It is an international provision, one of the first of its kind in the world, to which the State undertook to be bound before an international tribunal in respect of its own citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Article 46 is a related provision and deals with the issue of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. Many of the state signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, at the time it was drawn up, were unhappy with the idea of an international court having compulsory jurisdiction in matters pertaining to fundamental rights and freedoms. It was, therefore, decided that it would be optional. Ireland exercised that option. The State bound itself in international law, since the date of its signature and ratification of the convention in 1953, to accept the binding force of judgments of the Court of Human Rights and the supervision of the execution of those judgments by the Committee of Ministers of the contracting states. The Committee of Ministers is the sheriff in this particular operation and at one stage the sheriff had to be brought in to deal with the Greek Government when the colonels took over and abused people's fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">These provisions have been part of our consistent international practice since 1953. My party was in Government, exclusively, when these particularly wise decisions, which have no bearing on this particular legislation, were taken. The addition of the references to Articles 34 and 46 would add nothing to the legislation. We were careful to ensure the substantive rights in the convention were what legal effect should be given to in the Bill. These substantive rights are contained in Articles 2 to 14 and Articles 16 to 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">The other articles in the convention fall into two general categories. They are either technical and procedural or they already have full binding effect on convention states such as Ireland by virtue of our signature and ratification. It is not necessary to include every article of the convention because many of them are technical in nature and deal with the procedures of the court or, as in this instance, with matters that have always been accepted by Ireland as consistent international law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_47">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_85">Much that the Minister of State said reflects what I said yesterday in respect of the considerable pride this country should take in its early ratification of the idea of extraterritorial jurisdiction for an international institution. I agree with him in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">Our commitment to human rights dates back further and, as I have said on many occasions, is manifest in the much-maligned 1937 Constitution, which people must always remember was written at a time when human rights were far from fashionable. As such, it is extraordinarily progressive. However, if some organ of the State interferes with a citizen's right to make an individual petition to the European Court of Human Rights, that person has no domestic remedy. The provision that judicial notice shall be taken of the convention provisions in section 4 refers to the convention as defined in section 1, which specifically excludes Articles 34 and 46. This means that judicial notice does not have to be taken of the individual's right to make a petition. Therefore, the only place a person can get redress, if the right to make an individual petition is interfered with, is through the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">I fully accept that was and continues to be the position. However, it seems a great pity that the only remedy a citizen of this State can have, if that right is interfered with, is via the European Court in Strasbourg, with all the cumbersome procedures that involves. The same applies to Article 46, which deals with the binding force and execution of judgments. Again, it seems extraordinary that the only remedy a citizen would have is to return to the European Court in Strasbourg, rather than seek a domestic remedy which would be simpler, less expensive and probably much quicker. The Minister of State did not address that in his reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">I fully appreciate that the State has been an impeccable participant of the convention, apart from a couple of incidents of internment when we derogated from it. The State has a good and credible record in human rights. However, it would be much easier for citizens if those two sections were incorporated into domestic law, the way the rest of it is, in order that they would have a domestic remedy.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_48" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_89">The Lawless case was the first individual petition to Strasbourg, on which occasion the State's position was upheld. I take the point the Senator makes but, in a sense, he has missed the point that the rights in the Bill are rights in international law – the right of individual application to a body in Strasbourg and the right of that body to exercise compulsory jurisdiction. It is factually inconceivable that one could have an attempt to frustrate a right which is an international right. For example, there is clearly nothing any Irish citizen, national, company or person can do to frustrate the court from exercising its compulsory jurisdiction. The Irish courts would never have a function in regard to the compulsory jurisdiction of a court located in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">In regard to the right of individual petition, the Senator suggests the possibility of that being frustrated and the individual having no domestic remedy in Irish law in the event of a frustration or interference with that right. However, this is a right to go to Strasbourg, not any court in Ireland – it is not a right to go to the Four Courts. Rather, it is an international legal right, enjoyed by Irish citizens, to go through the European convention system. In a sense, there is no domestic court involvement in that matter at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">The treaties themselves have been part of international law for many decades and the courts take full judicial notice of their provisions. They accept, without further proof, the existence of the treaties as international legal norms.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">When this issue was debated in the Lower House on Committee Stage, I understand the Minister said it was not appropriate to insert an anti-death penalty measure into the Bill. However, I have not read the Official Report and am, therefore, unsure. There already is an anti-death penalty measure contained in, I think, Protocol No. 6. However, this protocol is being superseded by Protocol No. 13, which incorporates a much less exception-focused death penalty provision, and comes into force on 1 July this year. The Minister has the proud record of having drafted the constitutional amendment which prohibited the death penalty and deserves credit for such because it copperfastens a principle of our society. Protocol No. 13 of the European Convention states that no one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed, no derogation from the provision shall be made and no reservations may be made. In this manner, it is a much tighter and more demanding protocol than the previous one. It is coming into force and we have accepted it. Therefore, why is it not incorporated into the legislation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_51" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_97">Ireland has signed and ratified Protocol No. 13, as the Senator pointed out, which abolishes the death penalty in all cases. Protocol No. 6 to the convention, which is in the Schedule to the Bill, also makes provision for the abolition of the death penalty, but in Article 2 it permits states to make provision for it in time of war or imminent threat of war. We have amended the Constitution to remove the possible use of the death penalty in times of emergency. We are now a totally abolitionist State in the context of the death penalty. This has paved the way for us to accept, as a matter of international obligation, Protocol No. 13. It is reasonable to ask why Protocol No. 13 cannot be brought within the ambit of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Protocol No. 13 is not yet in force and our advice from the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that it will not come into force until 1 August next. We anticipate that the Bill will have been enacted before that date and it is not the practice to include prospective provisions in legislation. In any event, the inclusion of Protocol No. 13 in the Bill would have no effect, a point with which the Senator agrees. However, he seeks to ensure consistency between the constitutional and statutory provisions. The Constitution, as the superior law, has already dealt with this matter. Therefore, the matter is unstateable in Irish law in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">Given the constitutional provisions, the repetition in a statute would be superfluous. That said, I understand the Senator's intention, but it is not the practice to include prospective provisions in legislation. I assume that we are not supposed to play God with what might happen in the next few months.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">If I had time, I am certain I could find an exception where a protocol which was not in force was incorporated into legislation because it was expected that it would be so in the not too distant future. I do not accept that this is a universal rule. However, I will not fall out with the Minister for State over it. It is a wonderful feature of Irish politics that, as far as I am aware, there is an absolute consensus on the death penalty and its barbaric nature. Therefore, I will not push the matter further.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">In page 4, subsection (1), line 17, to delete "or a court".</p>
          <p eId="para_103">This amendment goes to the nub of the views expressed on the degree to which the European Convention on Human Rights will be incorporated into Irish law. The definition of "organ of the State", set out in page 4 of the Bill, specifically excludes, "the President or the Oireachtas or either House of the Oireachtas or a Committee of either such House or a Joint Committee of both such Houses or a court". The Minster's argument against the incorporation of a court was concerned with the separation of powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The separation of powers is a universal principle by which a functioning democracy can be identified, which is the reason I sometimes wonder about the neighbouring jurisdiction which has not yet managed to achieve the kind of clarity in this area we take for granted. The effect of the amendment would be no more than to provide that courts must operate according to the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is argued that this would be seen as interfering with the courts. However, there are other areas where we are happy to prescribe to them how they deal with people's rights. An example would where a person wishes to speak or have a trial conducted in Irish. The Judiciary is required to facilitate the request by doing the business of the court through Irish or providing interpreters. We expect the Judiciary to operate according to certain procedures and it does so because we have a good Judiciary and courts system.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">I do not understand the reason the courts cannot be incorporated into the definition of "organs of the State". It might be better to make separate provision for this because if the amendment is accepted in its present form, there may be an implication that the Judiciary is no more than another "instrument of public policy", to quote a term used by an eminent former Fianna Fáil leader when referring to RTE. It is argued that the courts are bound by the Constitution, which is superior law. However, if other countries as committed as we are to the separation of powers can do this, I am not persuaded that we could not.</p>

Both amendments seek to include the courts in the definition of "organs of the State", set out in page 4 of the Bill. I understand the reason the Minister wishes to have them excluded because they have a duty to uphold the Constitution and the law. However, there is a good case for including them in the definition and giving rights to individuals to have the convention upheld in domestic law. The similar legislation passed in the United Kingdom includes the courts, where they are referred to as being included within the term "public authorities" rather than organs of the state. If we take the same approach, we will give people the right to have the convention upheld when they take cases in this country. Rather than provide for this, the Minister is taking a minimalist approach.</p>

          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_110">I support this amendment. This legislation is similar to that passed in the United Kingdom. The Good Friday Agreement encouraged that approach. The UK legislation has managed to include the courts, down to the Magistrates' Courts, in this area in a satisfactory manner. The main reason for bringing this forward is to ensure judgments could be given without undue delay and also that people would be given the reasons for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">When the Minister spoke about this on Committee Stage in the other House he said the problem regarding judgment delays had been solved by section 46 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002, which provides for the establishment of a register of weighted judgments and a review procedure to ensure they are delivered. While that is as good as far as it goes, it is not a remedy against the State in the event of a breakdown of the system, which could happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">The Minister argued that reasons for judgments would be required by the rules of courts being interpreted in accordance with the convention principles, which are commonly given. Sometimes when the reasons are given, they are not adequate enough for the person trying to appeal the judgment to a higher court. In view of this, the amendment would ensure the convention would also apply to the courts. I hope the Minister of State will accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I support the amendment for the reasons outlined. People are entitled to a speedy judgment and the reasons for it. There appears to be no provision for this in the Bill. There are delays. A document I have received from the Law Society states:</p>
          <p eId="para_114">It is not the experience of many practising lawyers and their clients that reasoned judgments are commonly given in all courts. This issue has arisen in a number of recent Supreme Court cases, for example, T <i>v.</i> T, judgment of Denham, J., and K<i> v.</i> K, judgment of McGuinness, J.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">We have on record situations where the complex of events the amendment seeks to resolve has arisen and judgments have been given. In view of this, the amendment is a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The Law Society document goes on to state this may increase the number of reasoned decisions. Is this a cause for alarm or regret? I would not have thought so. The more reasoned decisions we get from the courts, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">Without this amendment there is no effective remedy for citizens in a situation where there is this kind of dereliction. The Minister indicated his concern that this may lead to perhaps even vexatious actions against judges. We know that judges like to stay on one side of the bar and not get into the box reserved for the accused, which is a natural human tendency. I have tabled an amendment which would address this problem. The Minister of State can, therefore, accept this amendment without having any worries about the possibility of judges being impugned for corruption, because this would be looked after by a subsequent amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Tribunals, which are a form of court, are not excluded from the definition of "organs of the State", set out in page 4 of the Bill. If they are not excluded, why should a parallel situation, where courts are involved, be excluded? There are a number of reasons, including those effectively advanced by the Law Society, for accepting this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Requiring judges to have regard to the principles of the convention would also be very effective and a useful effect of the amendment. Given the arguments advanced by this side of the House, there is strong case for the Minister of State to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">While I understand the motivation behind the amendments, it should be recognised that section 2 places a statutory obligation on the courts to make decisions compatible with the State's obligations under the convention. This provision appears to be quite adequate. Given that people will have to return to the courts to seek recourse and compensation, to remove the courts from the exemption might be a little incestuous. On the other hand, I have sympathy with the argument that while it is essential the courts are separate in a democratic system such as ours, there should be some form of accountability in terms of ostensibly strange decisions and derogatory, snide remarks by judges which have nothing to do with the cases being processed. While there is a need to examine these matters, I am not sure it would be prudent to take matters as far as the amendments suggest.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_121">The effect of this amendment would be to bring the courts within the definition of "organs of the State" in section 1 of the Bill. It would ensure they were bound by the obligations imposed by the Bill, specifically the requirement in section 3 to perform their functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention. This matter has been debated at length in the Dáil and was referred to by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in this House yesterday. I will speak but not in the same detail of the reasons the Government has decided not to include the courts in the definitions section of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">The courts are ordained and obliged by the Constitution, statutes and statutory instruments to perform their functions in accordance with the Constitution, statutes and statutory instruments. Critics of the omission of the courts from the definition of "organ of the State" seem to forget that every rule of the court is a statutory instrument. Every decision of the courts and the Courts and Court Officers Act must be interpreted under section 2 of this Bill in a manner compatible with the convention. The courts do not operate as an autonomous area of unregulated power. They are constrained by the Constitution, statutory instruments and the legislation the Oireachtas has enacted to regulate the conduct of court proceedings. The rules of court constitute a statutory instrument which the courts are obliged to follow. Under this Bill, all of these provisions will have to be interpreted in the context of the convention in a manner compatible with it, if at all possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">As the Minister pointed out, the notion that the courts will be wholly strangers to the convention and not be obliged to comply with the Bill is wide of the mark. When the Bill becomes law, it will be incumbent on the superior courts, the District Court, the Circuit Court and the Special Criminal Court to apply their own rules and the statutes under which those rules are applied in a manner compatible with the convention in so far as those texts permit them. The phrase "in so far as possible" in section 2 of the Bill is not a limitation. The relevant United Kingdom provision reads, "so far as is possible to do so". In both jurisdictions the intention is not for the courts to ascertain the true meaning but to strive to find a meaning which will prevent the making of a declaration of incompatibility. In other words, they are being asked to apply a rebuttable presumption in favour of the convention rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">It is acknowledged that individuals have brought the State before the Court of Human Rights over the failure of courts to deliver a judgment within a reasonable time. Since the last occasion of such a failure, steps have been taken to deal with the matter. The Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 obliges a court to deliver judgments within three months. The registrar of a court must enter on a register any reserved judgment, one not handed down immediately. If the court does not deliver the judgment within three months, the registrar is obliged to re-list the case before the judge to allow him or her to fix a date upon which judgment will be given. The Minister has indicated that the provisions in question will be brought into effect shortly and that he will be making regulations providing for the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">More generally, the Minister has made it abundantly clear that the policy underlying the exclusionary approach with regard to the courts is based on the fact that the convention and the rights protected under it are framed in a vertically effective way. They deal with private individuals and the State rather than private disputes between private individuals. There is no question of experimentation in this area. The Bill will not create a parallel system of tort law within the State to regulate transactions between private citizens except in so far as statutes and the rules of court will be interpreted in a convention compatible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">If the amendment was accepted, one of the most obvious consequences would be that the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of section 3 the Bill would apply. Individuals would be allowed to sue the courts in the courts in respect of court decisions. The Minister has made it very clear that he will not go down that road as to do so would open up a wholly unpredictable and chaotic scenario. The doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>, according to which judicial decisions cannot be revisited, would disappear as every action would give rise to a subsequent action. The decision in the case of the first action would be found to breach someone's convention rights allowing them to reopen the issue to sue the court in respect of the court's decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The point has been made that we are somehow out of step with the United Kingdom whose courts are included in the definition of "public authority" and caught by the requirement to act in a convention compatible way. There is an important difference between our two jurisdictions. Members of the judiciary in the United Kingdom are bound by an oath to the sovereign power of parliament and obliged to do whatever parliament instructs. The courts here are bound by a written constitution to uphold the Constitution and laws.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Senator Norris referred to the practical rather than theoretical problems. He raised the practical matters of the delay in court judgments and the lack of an obligation on courts to provide reasons for their decisions. I have outlined the Minister's position as it relates to the delay in judgments. He is satisfied the legislative arrangements which have been put in place and will be implemented through statutory instruments will address the matter. The strict common law position is that a judge of a superior court is not obliged to give reasons for his or her decisions. It seems extraordinary but the judge is obliged to give a judgment and make an order while not necessarily explaining the reasons he or she does so. This has been the traditional common law position. I am not aware that the issue has been visited—</p>

The Minister waffles rarely but when he does, he gives a bravura performance. For him to say a court is not a stranger to the European convention is a great relief for the people. I realise that the phrase is a legal one but we are talking about implementing the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights as far as possible in Irish law and would not expect the courts to be strangers to them, even though they may have held their noses when they passed them from time to time.</p>
          <p eId="para_135">With regard to judgments being vexatiously challenged if we remove this exemption, amendment No. 31 would remedy that. This is the point of the amendment. All the Minister need do is accept both amendments.</p>

Is it animal, vegetable or mineral? Common sense tells us that the courts are an important organ of the State and they are so defined and referred to in official literature. Why go through the fiction of saying that, for the purposes of this Bill and to protect certain fossilised sensibilities, they are not an organ of State when we all know they are? If the Minister is telling the House that the courts are not an organ of the State, what are they? A clear definition would be useful.</p>

I have always believed that British citizens are more vulnerable to the power of the state than Irish citizens. In Ireland, there are clear limits beyond which the State cannot go. That was evident with the Prevention of Terrorism Act. Many of its operations could never have been implemented in this country.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">The Minister said that the convention is primarily a vertically effective instrument, by which he meant that it is designed as a means of redressing human rights violations as between the individual and the state. The prohibition on slavery is not a matter between the individual and the state. It is not a prohibition on slavery implemented by the state but a prohibition on slavery <i>per se</i>, which is a horizontal right according to the Minister's terminology. It is not simply that the state is prohibited from allowing slavery but that any citizen is entitled to redress if he or she is in a position <i>vis-à-vis</i> another citizen of slavery or servitude. The principal plank of the Minister's argument, that he does not want this to have a horizontal effect, is in contradiction with Article 4 of the convention, which has horizontal effects. By excluding the courts, we are making that more difficult.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">I am not aware of a prohibition on slavery in the Constitution, although I am sure it is implied in the provisions on personal liberties. However, there is a prohibition of slavery in the European Convention on Human Rights and our courts should be required to enforce that right. We are effectively diluting the capacity to enforce it by not including the courts in this provision.</p>

In that case, the litigant can obtain no other legal redress and the legislation remains in force. By continuing the way the Minister is proposing, we are not providing the best and clearest opportunity to citizens to defend their rights and that is central to these two amendments.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_149">This debate relates to section 3 of the Bill, which will create a new remedy in Irish law. It will allow a person who has suffered injury, loss or damage as a result of a contravention of the convention, if no other remedy in damages is available, to institute proceedings to recover damages in respect of the contravention in the appropriate court, the High Court or the Circuit Court under a certain limitation. That right of action for damages is predicated on an organ of State performing its functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">Under section 3 a new right of action for damages accrues in respect of a breach by an organ of State of obligations under the convention. We must define "organ of State" for the purposes of this new right of action in damages and we are excluding the courts from the definition. We are not allowing the courts to be sued in that respect for the reason I have outlined. To permit the courts to be sued in respect of a breach of obligation in that respect would be to re-open litigation and encourage a multiplicity of lawsuits. Essentially, it would allow persons to relitigate, in the guise of an argument about the convention, a law case which the person had already lost. The Government agrees with the Minister that the introduction of such a measure would cause considerable difficulty in the courts and considerable relitigation of issues which are already concluded as far as litigation is concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">It should be remembered that the High Court is established by the people in the Constitution. It is the centrepiece, subject to the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, of the judicial system. The High Court has sole and original jurisdiction under the Constitution to deal with all matters. In contemporary Irish law the High Court cannot be sued in respect of its decisions. To introduce this provision would permit it to be sued in respect of its decisions. The other courts referred to by Senators – the Circuit Court, District Court and Special Criminal Court – can all be corrected by the High Court and can be party to litigation in the context of judicial review proceedings. The High Court can ensure that they act within their jurisdiction. To introduce into Irish law the principle that a court can, on convention grounds, be sued in respect of its decisions would, in effect, revolutionise our system of jurisprudence and would be a very remarkable departure.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">The incontestable fact remains that, under this Bill, the courts will be obliged to construe all legislation they must operate under in accordance with the statutory principles and instruments governing their jurisdiction. The point is theoretical, but to concede it could cause much practical difficulty in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I return to one argument used by the Minister of State. The issue he raised about suing the courts could be dealt with by, among other things, the procedure that Senator Norris suggested. The other argument being used is that the convention is "a vertically effective instrument designed as a means of redressing human rights violations between the individual and the State."</p>
          <p eId="para_154">I raise the question of Article 4 of the convention. Does a victim of slavery sue the State? What would the State have done wrong? It may not have known about the act of slavery. As far as I am concerned, this means that if I am in a condition of slavery and certitude and I am a citizen of a party to the convention, I am entitled to sue the person who subjects me to servitude or slavery. The Minister of State does not want the courts to be drawn into a development as a horizontally effective means of resolving rights-based disputes between individuals. The issue of slavery is a rights-based dispute between individuals, not between an individual and the State. I would like the Minister of State to address that point before I indicate what I propose to do about the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">The Senator canvassed the possibility of slavery. Under this legislation, if the State or an organ of the State – other than the excluded organs of the courts and the Oireachtas – had failed to prevent slavery from taking place, the State could be sued. The State could be sued if a health board, for example, had demonstrably failed to ensure that slavery did not take place in the context of a particular group of individuals living in its functional area. There could, in such circumstances, be a possible right of action against the health board. The Senator is canvassing a far-fetched scenario. Rather than examining these contingencies, we should look at the practical working system of government that operates in the State. The High Court is established by the people in their Constitution and has that protection from having its issues re-litigated.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">I support this amendment. I, too, was briefed by the Law Society which advised Senator Henry and me. Many amendments have in common the fact that they come from the same unimpeachable source. Although it is possible that the legislation might be interpreted to include such institutions, that is by no means certain, which is a powerful legal view. In other words, a court could interpret this narrowly. The lawyers' view – that of the collective body of lawyers – is that it is possible that the Bill might be interpreted narrowly and exclude schools and hospitals, the very areas where we have had so much trouble with the violation of children's human rights. That is the reason we have had all the tribunals.

          <p eId="para_166">Although my colleague, Senator Henry, has anticipated the Minister of State's reply that they are probably included and there by implication, a legal view, that of the body representing a very significant group of lawyers, is that the Bill is capable of a narrower interpretation than that which the Minister of State has supplied to the House. In that case, and in view of the fact that it could scarcely do any damage to include those groups, I urge that the amendment be accepted.</p>

          <p eId="para_169">Regarding the precise point raised by Senator Henry, it appears that the amendment is based to some extent on an equivalent provision in United Kingdom human rights legislation where there is a provision that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The term "public authority" is not defined in the United Kingdom Act. We are trying to define the boundary between purely private behaviour, not captured by the convention, and public or State matters, which are. In the United Kingdom the "public authority" phrase, comprehended, more or less, in Senator Henry's amendment, has been used, whereas in this jurisdiction the Government has proposed that the phrase "organ of the State" be used as the definition to demarcate the boundary between the public and private spheres.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">I see no advantage in mixing two legal concepts and making the distinction between what is in the public and private realms even more difficult to ascertain by setting up two standards. Were I to accept Senator Henry's amendment, I would be introducing into the legislation a second standard for defining what was in the public and private spheres. Reference was made to concerns that a very narrow interpretation could be placed on this matter by the courts. Equally, however, a very broad interpretation could be made by the courts, and the judgment of the Government was that it would have to be left to them as an exercise in interpretation to determine whether a matter was in the public or private sphere.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">It is impossible to attempt an exhaustive list. The legislation lays down a standard, namely, "organ of the State". The Bill places a positive duty on organs of the State to perform their functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the convention. The definition of an "organ of the State" is designed to address the problem of the public and private spheres. The test under the Bill is simple: if the organ of the State is established by law, it falls within the definition. If it is not established by law but exercises the legislative, executive or judicial powers of the State, it also falls within the definition. To accept this amendment would be to mix two completely different approaches to the issue. For that reason, I am not prepared to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">Perhaps I might comment with regard to one thing the Minister of State said about the difficulties often pleaded by Ministers that, if we try to get into this area, we will create a list system, and it is impossible to create an exhaustive list. That is not what the amendment tabled by Senator Henry and me would do at all. It produces a definition which would catch in the net those bodies which we are concerned might fall outside it such as schools, hospitals and so on. There is still a very good case and the Minister of State is defending himself against a situation which does not occur. We are not suggesting, attempting or trying to encourage the Government to create lists. We are trying to create a form of words that would obviate the need for the creation of lists, instead, by its operation, including elements not currently included or may not be so.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The Minister of State indicated that the Government had taken a "judgment call", as the Americans describe it, on the matter and believes there will be a broad interpretation. However, he has not excluded the possibility of a narrow one – or at least, that is how I understood his remarks. He said he felt the courts would interpret the legislation in a particular way but that is only the Government's view, and Governments have been wrong in the past, particularly in assessing such legal matters. The Minister of State has accepted that there is a possibility, which he and the Government regard as minimal, but they still accept that it is a matter of judgment and that there is a possibility that a narrow interpretation might be placed on the legislation by the courts. All our amendment would do would be to resolve the situation in advance of going to court and finding that the law was defective.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">When the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was here yesterday and some of us pointed out that we had received considerable briefings from the Bar Council and the Law Society, he said he was not going to do a head count of who was in favour of his Bill and who against among his legal colleagues. However, it is worrying that there appears to be such concern that these areas could be interpreted narrowly. Senator Norris has quite rightly pointed out that hospitals and schools are where there have been problems in the past, and I certainly do not want to introduce any list system. It was because those organisations were privately run but had a public function that we ended up with a list system with the Laffoy commission. That is the reason I would really like to see the amendment accepted by the Minister of State. It is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">The Senator has raised the practical problems that can occur in the context of hospitals and schools. If one examines the issue of hospitals, one sees that a health board is a body established by law under the definition provided by the Act. In the case of a private hospital, other considerations would apply. It is not possible in legislation to provide an exhaustive list of whether a body is public or private in character. All one can do is lay down a test for the courts to apply. The test proposed, about which the Government made the "judgment call", was that the body should be established by law or a body through which any of the legislative, executive or judicial powers of the State were exercised. All I have said on this amendment is that it would add an additional test to the present one based on another standard and criterion, thus making the test confused and difficult to apply were the matter to fall for determination in the courts.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_185">The proposed section goes to the heart of the legislation. It is a Second Stage matter and the Minister outlined his views on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The amendment would make a fundamental change in the way in which further effect is to be given to the convention in Irish law. The Government decided that the best course open to us is to provide for a form of incorporation based on the interpretative model. The mode of incorporation chosen by the Government was arrived at only after the most searching examination of the various options open to it in the matter. The force of law as part of the law of the State model, as canvassed in this amendment, was studied in great detail before any decision was taken by the Government. Possible Constitution-based approaches and other legislative approaches were also examined. In this regard, the views of the Human Rights Commission and other human rights-based organisations were examined. Those views were presented to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and many of them were published to inform and stimulate debate. They were discussed at different fora, seminars and conferences. Nevertheless, the position of the Government is that, in our constitutional scheme of things, the interpretative approach is the best and most suitable choice of model for us. There are several reasons for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">First, we already have a written bill of rights in Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution. We do not need a shadow constitution in the form of a convention. Second, by giving the convention the force of law in the State, the courts would then be empowered to operate such a shadow constitution. Such a provision would be directly contrary to the provisions of the Constitution in Articles 5.15, which provides that the Oireachtas has the sole and exclusive power to legislate for and in the State. No other authority has the power to make laws for the State. The courts have the power to interpret the law, but they cannot be instructed by the Oireachtas to disregard the clear intention of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">Giving the force of law to the convention would amount to an uncertain amendment of existing legislation. Therefore, issues concerning Article 34 of the Constitution, which restrict to the High Court and Supreme Court the question of the validity of any law, would arise in every court. Giving the convention the force of law would require all courts to decide whether existing statutes were valid by reference to the exterior law of the convention. Under the Constitution, legislation enacted since 1937 enjoys a presumption of constitutionality and the District Court and Circuit Court have to act on the assumption that the Acts enacted by the Oireachtas are valid, effectual and constitutional. A vast amount of the legal business of the State is transacted in the District Court and Circuit Court and they must operate on the assumption that the Acts are valid. Were we to introduce a provision of this type and make it directly part of the law of the State, these courts would then have jurisdiction to invalidate Acts of the Oireachtas on the basis of an exterior law based on the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">The force of law model then admits the possibility that any court, including the District Court, could decide that highly important legislation relating to serious crime or subversion, matters of fundamental importance to the security of the State or the safety or well-being of its citizens was to be repealed on the basis of a Strasbourg ruling in a similar case or because of that court's interpretation of a provision of the convention. This would introduce a huge element of uncertainty into our law and the view of the Government is that the doctrine of separation of powers is a cornerstone of the Constitution. Giving the convention the force of law would interfere with the delicate balances inherent in that doctrine and would be to our detriment.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_92">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_190">Is the Minister of State suggesting that the Government will be churning out enormous amounts of legislation that conflict with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights? I do not believe so. This is a completely artificial situation. If, by accident, such law was enacted, it would be very proper for an Irish court to strike it down.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I have nothing to fear from the European Convention on Human Rights. Ireland was one of the first signatories to it, the first state to have a case tried under it and Irish citizens have used it extensively since then. Why should we fear our legislation being brought into accord with it? That is our objective, so of what are we afraid?</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Regarding the different models, the Minister of State tried to justify the model chosen by the Government and referred to the various bodies that gave evidence on this. The Government seems not to have listened to what it was told. Professor William Binchy recently criticised the indirect mode of incorporation used for its weaknesses, anomalies and drawbacks. In this regard, he is reiterating the views of the Irish Human Rights Commission, of which he is a member, the Bar Council and the Law Society as well as numerous NGOs. The Minister of State was coy about that matter, saying that the Government had consulted. It consulted, but it did not listen to those bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">Three models were given: the constitutional model; legislative incorporation; and this model, which was described by the bodies consulted as being unequivocally the worst. We headed unerringly for that model, which was brilliant. Even the phase used to describe it, "interpretative incorporation at a sub-constitutional level", gives one an idea of its nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">I do not want to return to Second Stage, but I made the point that this is a minimalist approach. We chose the United Kingdom precedent, but we did not even go the whole hog with that approach and watered it down somewhat. We have nothing of which to be afraid if we are serious about this. We were put in this situation because we were embarrassed and ours was the last European country to formally incorporate the convention. Many other states have incorporated it, legislatively or constitutionally, but I am not sure how many other countries, apart from the UK, have gone for the delights of the interpretative incorporation at sub-constitutional level. Perhaps the Minister of State knows, but I imagine the number is quite low.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">If we are serious about bringing Irish law into conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, what have we got to fear from letting the courts interpret it? That is fine by me and I have no problem with it. I wish it were incorporated fully into Irish law.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_196">As the Minister of State said, this is the nub of the argument. He is not going to agree to this, which is a great pity, but I will deal with some of his arguments. What is singularly unimpressive is neither the goodwill of the Minister of State today, nor that of the Minister yesterday, but the fact that the arguments which are far from convincing are being drawn up to justify a position.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">One of these is the idea that we cannot incorporate a convention into Irish law. How many European directives do we incorporate into Irish law every week? I have never figured out the logic behind that. Some directives are incorporated via primary legislation while many others are not even incorporated via primary or secondary legislation. I have seen numerous documents go through this House which have incorporated various bits of international conventions and given them effect in Irish law.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">In the first referendum on the Constitution, the amendment, which essentially wiped out any conflict between the Constitution and European commitments, stated that nothing in the Constitution can be interpreted to prevent the State from fulfilling its obligations under the European treaties. The people decided to amend the Constitution in that way but it was quite an extraordinary change to the Constitution. It is a bit rich to come into the House having made that amendment in respect of our membership of the European Union and to state that we cannot incorporate international law into our domestic law. We have been doing that for 30 years via the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">My preference would have been to incorporate the convention through a constitutional amendment. As I said, unfortunately, Seanad Éireann cannot introduce constitutional amendments. Much to the relief of the Minister of State I suspect, we cannot go down that route. The Minister of State's arguments on the constitutional route are even weaker than those on this route. The fundamental issue is a deep-seated conservatism about the European Convention on Human Rights which is being defended by arguments which do not hold much water.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">Like Senator Norris, I wish to ask the Minister of State, as I did the Minister yesterday, although I did not get a reply, why the Minister is standing alone on this issue and disregarding advice given to him by the Irish Human Rights Commission, the Law Society and the Bar Council. How often does the Minister disregard their opinion? I do not really expect an answer to that question. I expect their opinion is worthwhile and it is difficult for us to understand why the Minister has disregarded advice from those three organisations and other NGOs and is going it alone. All the other countries have incorporated this convention into their domestic law but this country will be different in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">The Minister of State might like to comment on a quote from a lecture I attended by Donncha O'Connell in November of last year. He stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The model of interpretative incorporation is premised on the same principle that underlies the presumption of constitutionality – the presumed intent of parliament. In other words, impugned legislation or acts of certain public bodies will enjoy a presumption of compatibility with the ECHR unless and until a litigant rebuts that presumption. This judicial technique, based on an idealised view of the role of parliament in the legislative process, is often something of a legal fiction and can, according to commentators like Gerard Hogan, lead to quite artificial findings by the courts in their determination to uphold challenged legislation. This deficiency is especially apparent when the Double Construction Test is applied and makes it difficult to conceive of situations where future litigants under the 2001 Bill will have any reasonable prospect of establishing incompatibility with the Convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">I take seriously the last sentence in particular, in the sense that litigants may have difficulty under this kind of legislation. By incorporating the convention through Senator Ryan's amendment, this situation might be cured.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">We covered a lot of this ground yesterday on Second Stage when the Minister made the point, to which many Members subscribed, that our Constitution is a document which has stood the test of time. There are probably no additional rights within the European Convention on Human Rights which are not explicit or implicit in our Constitution. Section 5, dealing with the declaration of incompatibility, will address any perceived difficulties or contradictions which may arise. They will have to be addressed in the context of both Houses of the Oireachtas being notified and will be raised if it is considered that the matter should be dealt with in subsequent legislation. It comes back to whether we accept the primacy of the Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">As Senator Norris is only too well aware, litigants face difficulties in all legal proceedings. This Bill is drafted in such a way as to at least give clarity to litigants as to the precise status of the convention in Irish law. The provision in the Bill of a right of action for damages is an innovation and is not provided for in the equivalent United Kingdom legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Senators asked about the practice in other states. Practices vary depending on the view other states have taken on the incorporation of international law into their domestic legal systems. Those states which subscribe to what is called the monist view of a total assimilation of international and domestic law naturally tend to favour the direct application of the convention in their municipal legal systems. This State has always subscribed to the dualist view in international law, namely, that no international arrangement is part of the law of the State unless it is so decided by the Oireachtas, the people's representatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">In regard to Senator Terry's intervention on the Bar Council and the other groups, we are coming close to the heart of the issue. The Minister and the Government have a strong view on this question based on their conviction that the Constitution of 1937 provided for a basic law for this State even before the Second World War took place. It is one of the oldest constitutions in Europe and it provides for a clear vesting in the people of a right to control their Government through the referendum procedure. It also provides for clear organs of State, the legislative Executive and judicial domain. It contains a bill of rights which has been interpreted and developed by the courts over the decades to create an impressive scaffolding of rights which, as Senator Jim Walsh mentioned, is virtually identical to the substantive content of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">In those circumstances, the Minister's decision to opt for this form of incorporation was based on the conviction that the Constitution has served us well over generations and that we should not seek, as these professional bodies are seeking, to bypass our constitutional arrangements by introducing far-reaching provisions which would, for example, have the effect of judges operating a parallel set of rights to those already conferred by the Constitution. That would be the effect of making the convention a direct part of our law. It would empower the courts to have a shadow bill of rights in operation as well as the bill of rights already contained in Articles 40 to 44.</p>

I do not want people suing for things that happened twenty-five years ago, although this country is awash with people attempting to do that for very good reason. However, a maximum time period of one year, not from the coming into force of the legislation, but from the time an alleged breach happened, is very short.

          <p eId="para_222">The cases involved in proceedings of this character will involve serious matters for all parties concerned, including the State. It is in the public interest that the exposure of the State to potentially large awards and damages should be reasonably short, commensurate with the rights of the individual. For the sake of comparison, if a person wishes to invoke the right of individual petition under the convention and take proceedings in Strasbourg, the time limit is six months.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">That said, it is important to realise the context in which this limitation is imposed. It is one in which a contravention of the convention must be established. In all probability, the establishment of that contravention through judicial proceedings will have already taken a substantial period of time, so that in a sense the one year limit comes into effect at that stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">In section 3(5)(b), there is a provision where the court can extend the period if it considers it is appropriate to do so in the interests of justice. The one year is not an absolute limit, as the Senator is no doubt aware. Generally statutes of limitation provide for an absolute limit. There is a very limited category of exceptions to that, generally based on ignorance of matters, disability or minority, as in lack of full age. In this case, while the limit is one year, the period may be extended by order of the court if it considers it appropriate in the interests of justice. In the context of limitation periods that is a very broad discretion to give to a court. If the court believes that justice requires it, the relevant period may be extended.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" eId="spk_110" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_228">I think the Minister said he would have a look at it, but he took the advice of the Attorney General and decided to resist the amendment. I will outline the general views of the Minister in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The purpose of section 4 is to provide that judicial notice be taken of the jurisprudence of the Court of Human Rights, as well as the other Strasbourg organs relating to the provisions of the convention and the relevant protocols, Nos. 1, 4, 6 and 7, to which further effect has been given in the Bill. The section also provides that a court shall, when applying and interpreting the provisions of the convention, take due account of the principles laid down in that jurisprudence in all its various forms. In other words, the provision is a persuasive one.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">It has been noted that the provision does not provide that the Strasbourg jurisprudence should have binding effect similar to that of the European Court of Justice in so far as European Community law is concerned under the various EC treaties. The approach which has been adopted in the case of the convention is that it should have a persuasive effect. I would like to set out the reasons for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The convention system recognises that it is possible to satisfy the requirements of the convention and give effect to its provisions in a number of different ways, particularly where social values of contracting states may well be different. The European Community system, on the other hand, is geared towards harmonisation. Convention case law represents a minimum threshold of rights which convention states themselves may well wish to exceed. The "take due account" requirement in section 4 allows for this. There is no imperative that the convention countries should adopt a uniform solution. I would not expect, for example, that an Irish court would wish to follow a decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Reyntjens and Belgium in 1992, which decided that the obligation to carry an identity card and to show it to the police when requested to do so does not as such constitute an interference in a person's private life within the meaning of Article 8 of the convention. It is possible, therefore, that given our very well developed case law on fundamental rights and freedoms based on the Constitution, that Irish courts might give a lead to Strasbourg and show that standards and respect for the rights of the individual in this jurisdiction are higher than those required by the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">A more serious objection to binding an Irish court to follow a decision of the Strasbourg court is that we then have to apply the doctrine of the margin of appreciation in the same way as the Strasbourg court applies it in a case involving another state, even though the circumstances can be quite different. The doctrine of the margin of appreciation in Strasbourg is that within each member state there must be a wide discretion as to how the rights can be applied, given the cultural and social differences between the states.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">In so far as the amendment moved by the Senator is concerned, the phrase has been queried in the other House, and it refers to a jurisdictional requirement in the case of each of the bodies mentioned in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the section. It was suggested that the bodies concerned should be deemed to have had jurisdiction until the contrary is proved. I note that the Minister said in the other House he was receptive to making a change on the lines proposed by the Senator in his amendment. However, the point was discussed in some detail with the Attorney General, who was of the view that the words that the amendment seeks to delete should remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">This is not really an evidential matter. The provision relates entirely to the matter of judicial notice, and as such it is not correct to say, in supporting the deletion of the words in question, that their inclusion would prevent problems of proof. What that means, in essence, is that the section dealing with the doctrine of judicial notice defines, as far as the Oireachtas is concerned, that the courts must accept all these matters without further proof, so it is not necessary to accept the amendment along the lines advocated by the Senator.</p>

I was briefed by an expert legal body and I am assured that the amendments I bring forward have been subject to expert legal and drafting advice. I am interested to hear the Minister of State's response.</p>

          <p eId="para_240">The matter raised by the Senator is the same as that which related to amendment No. 15. Essentially, section 4 deals with the doctrine of judicial notice. The Oireachtas frequently includes a section of this type in legislation. Effectively, we are instructing the courts that they do not have to have all the matters set out in the section proved as a matter of evidence. They just need to realise that they are there. Judicial notice can be taken of a wide variety of matters commonly taken in respect of the days of the week, the currency, historical facts and personages. The advice we have received from the Attorney General is that the particular formula used to describe the matters, of which notice should be taken is the appropriate one because it refers to the concept of jurisdiction. This would seem the appropriate way to define a judicial body such as the judicial bodies in Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">The lawyers from whom I take advice indicate a slight gap in the process. Therefore, amendment No. 18 proposes that, where a declaration of incompatibility is made, there should be a clear process of transmission of that declaration from the judicial process to the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">On amendment No. 20, my legal advisers tell me that the making of an order is not the final stage of a judicial process. The order has to be perfected, which means that any process of appeal, or otherwise, has to be completed. Therefore, orders only have legal effect when perfected, not when made because there is a period left for appeal etc. These two amendments are not in any way central to the Bill but are genuine attempts to be helpful.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_247">While I accept that, I am not convinced of the need for amendment No. 18. The Bill provides that, before a court decides whether to make a declaration of incompatibility under section 5, the Attorney General and the Human Rights Commission must be given notice of the proceedings in accordance with the rules of court that will have to be made following the enactment of this legislation. Upon enactment, the rules of court, statutory instruments adopted under the courts of justice legislation, will require to have a provision regulating the curial side of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The Attorney General will have a right to appear at and become a party to the proceedings. As the Senator pointed out, when a declaration is made, certain obligations are placed on the Taoiseach under section 5(3) of the Bill regarding the laying of copies of the declaration before both Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days. The inclusion of a provision along the lines of this amendment would descend into a level of detail not required in the Bill. However, I will ensure the Senator's view on this matter is brought to the attention of the rules committee in order that an appropriate provision can be made in the rules of court, if it is deemed necessary to do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_250">I apologise to the Senator. He wants to insert the word "perfection" rather than "making". This point was considered during the drafting phase of the Bill but section 5(3) refers to the "making of the order" containing the declaration of incompatibility rather than the "perfection of the order" for purely practical reasons. This is because there may be a period between the making of the order and its perfection or, to use another term, writing it down. In some cases, this period could be up to six weeks. The Government's intention is that the making of the declaration should be notified to the Oireachtas at the earliest possible opportunity. The Attorney General is a notice party to the proceedings. Therefore, the Government has, within the knowledge of its legal adviser, knowledge of the proceedings. We see no reason to change this.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">Were the concept of perfection to be used, the obligation to lay the matter before the Oireachtas would be relaxed rather than strengthened. We take the view that there should be a strict duty to account to the Oireachtas in this matter and that the Government, having been represented in the proceedings by the Attorney General, should be in a position, within the relevant period after the making of the decision, to lay the matter before it.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">I will not argue with the Minister of State about amendment No. 18 which I am quite happy to withdraw. I take it that his undertaking is perfectly reasonable. However, I am not sure that unfinalised judicial decisions should be the basis for communicating with the Oireachtas. If a judicial decision is made in the High Court that something is incompatible with the convention and if the State appeals it to the Supreme Court, why should we tell the Oireachtas in a formal fashion about an incomplete judicial process?</p>
          <p eId="para_253">I do not know how long an appeal takes but why should we not wait and notify the Oireachtas only when matters are finalised? It is only after the final decision that the Oireachtas must take heed of it. Amending legislation should not be introduced on the basis of a decision made by the High Court only to discover it is appealed to the Supreme Court. The Oireachtas would have to wait until the latter court had made its decision. It would be a lot simpler to address the problem in the way I propose, which seems more clear-cut.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">I confess that I have some sympathy for the point advocated by the Senator but, under the Bill as proposed, it remains that there will be a greater amount of information submitted to the Oireachtas. If, for example, the making of an order of the High Court was notified to the Oireachtas and an appeal taken to the Supreme Court, the Oireachtas would be perfectly well aware that it could not act in respect of the matter until the Supreme Court had considered it.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">One of the extraordinary points – the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform dealt with it on Second Stage – in respect of the Bill is that if a declaration is made and perfected by the courts to the effect that some legislation in the State is incompatible with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, we do not appear to have obliged the State to do anything about it, other than to inform the Oireachtas that it has happened. I realise that there are provisions for individual damages, but surely it is logical that if legislation is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, the State should either seek a derogation under the procedures that are available in certain circumstances or it should change the law to bring it into a position of consistency with the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">To simply say, where a declaration of incompatibility is made, that the Government will tell us about it and, perhaps, compensate the individual if it chooses to do so, is not adequate. The most obvious thing, apart from the person whose case has to be addressed, in terms of the law is that we cannot have legislation continuing in force which has been found by the courts to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. It is, therefore, a necessary consequence that the Government should tell us what action it should take. In that regard, our amendment suggests the insertion of the words "and, unless the declaration was made by the High Court and has been appealed, a statement as to the Government's proposals (if any) to address the incompatibility". I do not understand why there is not such a provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">It is extraordinary that, for what will almost certainly be a small number of cases, the Government or the Minister involved is not obliged to do anything if incompatibility is discovered. We face a situation where there could be a recurrence of previous difficulties. All that will happen is that a person will receive an <i>ex gratia</i> payment if the Attorney General and an adviser consider it a good idea. As I said on Second Stage, I thought it would be much better if the court gave advice in this area. It is peculiar that this issue is going to be addressed in this way, that there will be no remedy for dealing with future cases and that the person involved in the current case will be referred to some adviser to see what will be the position in terms of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment. This provision was included in the United Kingdom legislation. I understand that it has not caused a great deal of trouble and that there has not been a large number of cases. I do not know why we are not prepared to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In a later amendment in my name and that of Senator Norris, which we may not reach, we propose that the Taoiseach should inform the Dáil about what it was proposed to do if incompatibility went wrong.</p>

I refer to a well-established principle of law to which I referred yesterday, that is <i> ubi ius ibi remedium, </i>wherever there is law or a decision given, there must be a remedy. The person who goes to court already knows damn well that they have the victim of injustice. That is their conviction. The attitude in respect of people's rights being trampled on appears to be of the “So what?” variety. These amendments are a classic test of the Government's real commitment to the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights. If it is serious about implementing them and giving citizens redress, it is not sufficient to merely state that an injustice has taken place. If there has been an injustice, surely it is right to at least indicate the steps that will be taken to remedy it. That much appears clear to me. However, I notice the crocodile smile emerging on the Minister of State's face so he may well have some answer that will enrich our learning in respect of the law.</p>

          <p eId="para_267">It is unacceptable to place the courts in a position where they can identify a breach of human rights and not be in a position to give an effective remedy. The whole procedure set out in Section 5 of the Bill is of questionable constitutional validity. Moreover, the Commission finds it difficult to understand how one can purport to incorporate Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which requires the provision of an effective remedy at national level, into domestic law while withholding a domestic judicial remedy for a breach of the Convention. Strasbourg case law establishes the principle that a discretionary remedy is no remedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">In amendment No. 21, I am mandating the Taoiseach to come to the Government within two months with his remedy, whatever that may be.

The amendments envisage that it may not be necessary to take any action, which could well be the case. In that scenario, surely the Oireachtas can prompt the Executive in the same way as the Executive can give a lead to the Oireachtas. I have no doubt that once this is laid before the Houses, if it is considered to be a matter of general concern, surely it will be raised in the Houses. We should have sufficient confidence in ourselves in that regard. There are provisions in the Bill to compensate the individual party where this declaration arises. Provision is being made to deal with the specific case that will come before the courts. Therefore, we are showing a lack of confidence in ourselves—</p>

If somebody comes before the Supreme Court and obtains a ruling that what was done to them was done by legislation which is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, our response is that we might give the person compensation but we reserve the right to continue to use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I would not mind if an attempt was made to ensure that some actions taken in the past could not be challenged. I might not agree with that, but I could understand it. However, it is brazen to say that it shall not affect the continuing operation. The item of legislation which the Supreme Court has interpreted as being incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights will continue in force until somebody gets around to doing something about it. In the case of our constitutional law, once the Supreme Court decides that something is not constitutional that is an end to it and it cannot apply in the future.</p>

The argument being made by Senator Norris and others is that when we get a declaration of incompatibility, the human rights convention should take precedence over all other law, whether it cuts across constitutional law or otherwise. That is not the premise upon which this legislation is framed. However, there is provision to deal with issues of incompatibility, which will be assessed and judged on their merits. There is nothing precluding the Government from coming forward with legislation. Equally, there is nothing forcing it to do so. However, there is nothing stopping the House, or any Member, from raising it as an issue. The way the Bill is currently framed is the essence of democracy.</p>

We are not saying that it must do something, but we would like an assurance that it will at least be looked at and not left on the long finger. As Senator Norris said in respect of his case, the Taoiseach of the day said that it was not a priority. We want to be sure that an issue will be considered. We will have a situation where the only remedy being offered is discretionary, which is against the convention. This section is peculiar. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_287">I understand the thinking behind this amendment, but it provides for something which is not practicable. We are dealing with declarations of invalidity of legislation enacted by the Oireachtas, or previous legislation continued in force under Article 50 of the Constitution from the pre-1937 era. Senator Norris encountered such an item of legislation. In his passionate intervention, the Senator confirmed my thesis that the reason we should not accept this amendment is because it relates to matters of passion and political debate and concern. Once the report is made to the Oireachtas, it is for these Houses to address the difficulties that arise, in accordance with the conventions and procedures that apply here.

          <p eId="para_293">As the Senator enriches our legal learning, I want to enrich his political learning and recall the case of Mrs. McGee, who instituted proceedings in the early 1970s under our Constitution and obtained a declaration from the Supreme Court that the legislation prohibiting the importation of contraceptives was unconstitutional. The matter then lingered for some time in these Houses. One particular Government in 1974 brought proposals forward on the matter and the Taoiseach had made a secret mental determination not to deal with the issue of the incompatibility at all. That illustrates the point that the matters in question here are political in character.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Once a declaration of incompatibility is laid before the Houses, I have no doubt it would be permitted in either House to raise on the Adjournment the issue of what the Government proposes to do about the incompatibility. While the incompatibility the Senator established related to legislation, it does not always relate exclusively to legislation. That is where complex issues can arise. For example, in the Airey case, concerning the failure of the State to provide an effective system of legal aid, the State was obliged to put in place a scheme of legal aid which involved financial provision, rules, procedures and guidelines. In that situation, a different arrangement or response was required to the judgment of the court in Strasbourg.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">There is no doubt that complex issues can arise on a declaration of incompatibility. It may not be possible for a Government to come to a decision as to what should be the possible response to the declaration, within the period of 21 days, or even in the two months permitted in Senator Terry's amendment. This is the main concern of the Minister regarding these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">There are also other considerations. There could be several options open to a Government in the matter. The Oireachtas could decide that it will not change the impugned law. The ultimate nightmare could arise where an incompatibility was established with constitutional provision in Strasbourg. That does not arise under this legislation. However, such a scenario would oblige the Government to institute the referendum procedure. A wide variety of circumstances could give rise to declarations of incompatibility. The making of the declaration is formally before both Houses. This is a sufficient safeguard to ensure that the Government pursues whatever solution to the problem is necessary.</p>

It seems extraordinary that someone could be convicted of an offence which was subsequently found to be a violation of fundamental human rights and that no remedies are provided.

          <p eId="para_318">The Bill provides that there can be a determination that something is a violation of human rights, but it does not provide for a remedy. Someone may be imprisoned under a statute that is found to be counter to the convention's provisions. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that many of these remain and, if that is the case, it will not make any difference for this amendment to be made. However, it seems wrong to permit a situation to continue where someone who has been convicted under a law which is found to be in violation of human rights may remain in jail.

          <p eId="para_323">The person who drafted this amendment knew well that the power of pardon is vested exclusively in and may only be exercised by the President, strictly on the advice of the Government. That procedure is written into the Constitution. Therefore, there is little one can do to hedge around it. If it was established that a person was wrongfully convicted in breach of the European convention, the Government would make such a recommendation to the President. However, to provide in this Bill that a person can write a letter to a Minister who can make a recommendation to the Government is surplusage and unnecessary in the circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">I understand the spirit in which the amendment was tabled, but it is excessive of Senator Norris to suggest that because the Government does not accept this amendment, it shows a blatant disregard for the convention. That is not the case. I am wary of accepting provisions such as that proposed in the amendment because it attempts to regulate the power of the Government to advise the President on this matter – a power which is expressly conferred by constitutional provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Amendment No. 28 is interesting since it seeks to refer the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. A great deal more consideration would have to be given to the precise drafting of an amendment of that character and how this jurisdiction would be conferred upon the Court of Criminal Appeal. The problems which can arise are not confined to the province of criminal jurisprudence. There could also be a civil judgment where a wrong has been done in breach of the convention procedures. In the case of the criminal law, there is a matter pending in the Supreme Court. The Minister is of the view that it would be better to await developments and the clarification the court will bring to that issue.</p>

There is a substantial difference between amendments Nos. 28 and No. 26. Senator Henry and I are not seeking to allow somebody to write a letter to the Minister; anybody can do that. We are proposing that the person whose rights have been vitiated has the right to apply to the court for it to set aside the conviction. That is different. It is a legal entitlement and provides an extra right. It gives the citizen the right of enforcement. That is why it is important that the Minister of State considers amendment No. 28, in particular. I hope it will be reconsidered for Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">The Minister of State underlined the reason for our concern when he said that acceptance of amendment No. 28 would restrict the Government's right to advise the President.

There is a conviction in issue and the entire matter is before the Supreme Court, where it will be examined in due course. I did not give an extensive textual exegesis on the amendment because the Minister would prefer to leave the matter until the Supreme Court clarifies the legal position. It is easier to draft legislation when the precise position is known.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_338">Section 5 is structured in such a way that when the High Court or the Supreme Court, on appeal, make a declaration of incompatibility, the person in whose favour the order is made will be faced with two choices. He or she can decide to take the case to Strasbourg on the sole issue of damages. In deciding whether to take that course, the person will receive legal advice on the issue. It might be to the effect that, as in many cases, the Strasbourg court takes the view that the decision is just and satisfactory and merely awards the applicant his or her legal costs. Senator Norris may have a view on that point and on the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court in that connection. In other cases, the court may make an award of damages under Article 41 of the convention, but, as the Minister stated, the amount of these awards is not overly generous.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">An alternative is to apply under section 5(4)(<i>b</i>) to the Attorney General for compensation from the Government on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis. There has been some confusion about this. The role of the Attorney General is merely that of a conduit for the processing of the application. He or she has no function or role in the matter, other than to bring it to the attention of the Government. The Government may appoint an adviser to advise it as to the amount of compensation payable and in coming to a decision. The adviser will be obliged to take appropriate account of what the principles and practice the Strasbourg court would apply under Article 41 of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The amendment does not fit easily with that procedure. It allows the High Court or the Supreme Court to grant relief for a non-monetary remedy or to make such offers as it considers just and appropriate. The problem, as the Minister went to great lengths to explain on Second Stage, is to decide how the courts can give such a remedy when the legislation involved is valid, having been enacted by the Oireachtas under the Constitution. This is why section 5(2)(<i>a</i>) provides that the validity or continued operation of the statutory provision cannot be affected by the making of the declaration. This is the fundamental principle on which the Bill is based. Senator Ryan referred earlier to this section, but no amendment has been set down in that connection. The same position applies in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The use of a legal mechanism such as declarations of incompatibility to deal with a case in which legislation is incompatible with the convention and which cannot be resolved by judicial interpretation, is a novel way of ensuring that the doctrine of the separation of powers is retained. Only the Oireachtas has the power to change the law. There is no doctrine of implied repeal. The Bill respects the sensitivities of the Judiciary about being given an overriding constitutional power of explicit legislative repeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The question of damages under the convention rightly and properly must take account of the jurisprudence of the court in Strasbourg. In effect, if the amendment was accepted, following a declaration of incompatibility, we would provide a different scale of damages in the Irish courts than the quantum that applies in Strasbourg. This would open two different systems of convention law on the question of damages.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_343">The Minister of State has neatly underlined the fact of the matter by suggesting that there could be two parallel systems, which the Government would wish to avoid. It could have avoided it if it taken the constitutional route or, failing that, opted for full legislative incorporation. The European Convention on Human Rights and the Constitution would then have been synchronised. We seek a synchronisation to demonstrate that the country has a real commitment in this area. The Minister of State said that the Government has opted for the worst option which, if the amendment is accepted, might lead to a parallel situation. The Government has created this problem because it chose what it was advised was the worst possible option.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The proposals on <i>ex gratia</i> payments are patronising. If people win a case in which their fundamental human rights are trampled upon, they will be told that any compensation accruing to them will be a matter of grace and favour and that the lordly figures of the Government might deign to patronise them with a little charity, which it is not compelled to do but which it will provide out of goodness. It will fling a few coins at the plebs. No, thank you. That is not republican justice. We did not fight for our independence for that.</p>

For years I have endured lawyers giving me medical advice, so I will not start to give the Minister of State legal advice. However, Article 13 of the convention provides that people are entitled to an effective remedy and it does not specify that it must be financial in scope. The Minister knows my views on the role of the adviser. In saying this, I do not cast aspersions on a person who has not yet been appointed. However, it would be better if the court decided on the remedy.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">To address the point by Senator Norris about the right in republican justice to have a large sum of money paid to one on the establishment of a violation of one's rights as a result of a legislative violation, there is not always such an automatic right. When an Act of the Oireachtas is declared unconstitutional, there is no automatic right to damages. The plaintiff in proceedings which establish unconstitutionality does not have an automatic right to damages. The same position obtains as far as the convention is concerned. In certain circumstances, the court in Strasbourg has awarded damages and that is the legal context in which this provision has been drafted. One always has the right to seek damages in Strasbourg under the system that operates there. We have interposed the option and the authority for the Government to make a settlement of an issue before it gets to that stage. We have not provided for a jurisdiction in the Irish courts as that is a separate jurisdiction to the jurisdiction which exists in Strasbourg. That is the essence of the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I appreciate complexity and I understand the complexity of this section, but that is no excuse for section 5(2)(<i>a</i>), which provides that the declaration of incompatibility shall not affect the validity, continuing operation or enforcement of the statutory provision or rule of laws in respect of which it is made. The wording is appalling. Essentially, this means that the while the declaration is fine, we will nevertheless carry on as before. The fact that we may have done this in the past is irrelevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">By means of this section, the Government is saying that while one can have a declaration of incompatibility and, perhaps, receive damages in the courts, it will carry on until it is ready to do otherwise. There is no timescale involved. That is an affront. I was fascinated by the Minister's reference, on section 7, to the expanded human rights protection provided in the Bill. If there is no remedy, one has no extra rights other than the right to go to court at, presumably, one's own expense to get a declaration that one's rights were violated. Nothing will be done about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_354">(<i>a</i>) make a statement to the effect that in her or his view the provisions of the Bill are compatible with the Convention provisions (referred to in this section as a ‘statement of compatibility'), or</p>

          <p eId="para_356">(2) The statement must be in writing and published in such a manner as the Minister considers appropriate.".</p>
          <p eId="para_357">This amendment seeks to ensure that any legislation being brought forward is declared to be compatible with the convention in order to avoid a scenario in which future law is incompatible with it. If the Minister who brings a Bill before the House wishes it to be enacted, despite the fact that it is incompatible with the convention, the amendment provides that the House will know that this is case. As the Minister of State is aware, such a provision is included in the United Kingdom legislation as the Minister of State knows. I thought the Minister would consider making the provision in the Dáil.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I agree with Senator Henry that this is a useful amendment. According to the record of the Dáil, the Minister gave an undertaking to examine this matter on Report Stage in that House, but I am not sure what conclusion was reached at that point. It seems reasonable to fire-proof legislation. While past legislation may, by historical accident, come into conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights while being held to be compatible with the Constitution, incompatibility can be avoided in the future. We should provide for a fire-proof certificate or a something similar to the national car test. If we are prepared to test cars before allowing them on the roads, surely we should be prepared to test legislation. A statement should be made to the effect that legislation has been tested against the European Convention on Human Rights and is believed to be in accordance with its provisions. It is not much to ask that a certification be provided with legislation to indicate that is the intention of the Oireachtas to avoid, at all times, conflict between its legislation and the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

When we discuss the convention provisions to which the amendment refers or those to which the section refers, we are speaking only about those provisions that will be referred to in European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003. Does section 7 restrict the Human Rights Commission to the defence and vindication of those sections of the convention that are incorporated in the Bill before the House? The convention is defined differently here to the full convention. Are we saying in the section that the Human Rights Commission can defend only those rights provided for in the Bill, as distinct from those provided for in the full breath of the convention?</p>

          <p eId="para_362">The commission will have a role in testing legislation, which is one of the reasons I am not accepting this particular amendment. Under section 8(<i>b</i>) of the Human Rights Commission Act 2000, the Minister can request the Human Rights Commission to examine any legislative proposal and to report its views on any human rights implications it might have. That provision has already been used by the Minister in regard to several Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Senator Norris referred to a vehicle testing centre for legislation, but that role is, of course, performed by the Attorney General. The Attorney General advises the Government on these matters and has had a long practice of doing so due to the existence of a written constitution. While there is a provision in the equivalent United Kingdom legislation that is similar to the proposed amendment, a very different constitutional structure exists in that jurisdiction and the British Attorney General does not advise on compatibility with basic law. Our Attorney General advises on compatibility with the basic law and also with our obligations under the European convention. That procedure and advice are already available to the Government. The Attorney General, as guardian of the public interest, must protect the Constitution and vindicate constitutional rights. That comes into play in any analysis of draft legislation.</p>

        <heading>OECD Economic Survey of Ireland 2003: Statements.</heading>
        <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_369">On behalf of the Minister for Finance, I am pleased to have this opportunity to open the debate in this House on the recently published OECD Economic Survey of Ireland 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">The OECD undertakes an examination of the economies of its 30 member countries at up to two yearly intervals. Such examinations involve a visit by a team from the OECD's economics department to the country being examined. During the visits to Dublin the OECD team met officials from a number of Departments and representatives from organisations in both the public and private sectors, for example, employers, unions, the banks and economists from academic institutions. The OECD team is well placed to obtain a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the state of the economy and how it is likely to perform in the short and medium term. More importantly, the OECD is in a position to see how similar issues are dealt with in different countries and weigh the advantages of various approaches. Members of the OECD team are also able to see how the global economic situation evolves and the economy of a particular country is likely to be affected by international developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The draft report by the OECD team is reviewed by the economic development and review committee which is made up of representatives from the 30 member countries. The OECD's analysis and advice are a very valuable contribution to the development of economic policy. It is not surprising that most of the coverage in the media of the OECD economic survey tends to highlight specific recommendations in one or two areas rather than the broad thrust of its analysis and recommendations. However, I hope the debate in this House today will focus on the central themes of the OECD's examination and its key recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">The OECD notes that Ireland's remarkable growth performance, which began in the mid-1990s and continued into the start of the new millennium, has led to rapid convergence of productivity levels towards the EU average, while employment growth has also been exceptionally strong. Living standards have increased dramatically as a result. It goes on to note that the unemployment rate fell from as high as 15.7% in April 1993 to a low of 3.7% in the first half of 2001 which led to recruitment difficulties. In the view of the OECD, the above potential growth has resulted in growing infrastructural pressures as evidenced by rapid house price increases, congestion and longer commuting times.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Competitiveness has been reduced by price and wage inflation which has been reinforced by infrastructural constraints. The OECD concludes its analysis by stating that, given these considerations, growth had to slow sooner or later, even though the downward shift in economic growth has undoubtedly been linked to the slowdown in the international economy and its impact on the ICT sector. It notes that the apparent resilience of economic activity is somewhat surprising given the series of economic shocks that affected the economy between mid-2000 and 2002. It attributes this resilience to the diversification in FDI investment in recent years as well as housing construction and the expansion of economic investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">According to the OECD, after showing remarkable resilience up to the third quarter of 2002, the economy seems to have lost momentum as export growth slowed and confidence weakened substantially. The economy will, therefore, have entered 2003 with little momentum. However, given the expected recovery of world economic growth and the negative impact of the earlier appreciation of the euro fading, Irish GDP growth is forecast by the OECD to increase from 3.25% in 2003 to 4.25% in 2004. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is projected to edge up. Inflation is forecast to fall due to wage moderation and the impact of the euro appreciation. The HICP rate is forecast by the OECD to fall from 4.75% in 2002 to 4.25% in 2003 and to fall more sharply in 2004. The Department of Finance will be updating its economic projections for this year in its economic outlook and review, which will be published later this summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">The OECD considers that the long-term prospects for the economy remain broadly favourable. Some of the structural forces underlying the economy's recent slowdown remain of great importance when examining its future prospects. These include the prospects for business investment, for responding to the economy's infrastructural constraints and for future labour force growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">One of the OECD's most significant conclusions is that prospects for business investment will depend on the extent to which regulatory reform opens up latent business opportunities domestically and the extent to which Ireland remains an attractive location for foreign direct investment. Ireland will face competition for inward foreign direct investment from the new members of the EU. It will face competition in respect of the skill level of the workforce and cost competitiveness. However, the OECD acknowledges that the rapid improvement in infrastructure and the skill levels accumulated should help Ireland to remain an attractive location for foreign direct investment and that the enlargement of the EU is also likely to increase total foreign direct investment flows substantially. As regards infrastructural constraints, the OECD acknowledges that those are rapidly being dealt with under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Having set out its analysis of Ireland's current economic situation and medium-term prospects, the OECD goes on to identify the key challenges which the economic situation now presents. First, it refers to the need to ensure that the public finances adjust to the slower growth environment so that their soundness is assured. This involves reconciling continuing large demands for public expenditure with smaller increases in tax revenues. While the report acknowledges the substantial improvement in public expenditure monitoring and control arrangements in recent years, it also recommends ongoing reform in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">The second challenge identified in the report is that of minimising the risks of a weakening in growth performance. This requires safeguarding competitiveness and maintaining the attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for inward investment. Finally, the report identifies the need for regulatory and environmental policies to focus more clearly than before on consumer interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The OECD sees these challenges as being related and mutually reinforcing. It says that reform of the public expenditure management system should entail an improvement in the quality of public services and help preserve the low tax environment. These should then contribute to safeguarding competitiveness as well as enhancing welfare. Regulatory reform in non-traded sectors should result in a better quality of services as well as lower prices. This should contribute not only to better welfare, but also to improved growth prospects by limiting the deterioration in competitiveness and supporting labour force growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">This year's OECD report has a special chapter on enhancing the effectiveness of public expenditure management. The Minister for Finance welcomes this initiative by the OECD and views its recommendations as a positive and practical contribution to the ongoing improvement of public expenditure management arrangements. Members will be aware of the ongoing challenge of matching very genuine demands for improved public services with the Government's overall responsibility to ensure sustainability of the public finances over the medium and long term. This challenge is now being faced by many of the other OECD members and the organisation, therefore, has much valuable insight to offer based on best international practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I would like to deal specifically with some of the key recommendations of the report in that regard. The report acknowledges the reforms introduced to the budgetary process in 2002 and 2003, including the setting of expenditure targets by the Government for individual spending Departments at an early stage in the process. It welcomes moves towards a multi-annual capital framework for investment to facilitate greater planning of our infrastructural spending over the medium term. The Minister welcomes the recommendation of the OECD that we continue to build on these reforms. He intends to examine ways of further strengthening our budgetary and expenditure management arrangements in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Members will be aware of the Minister's strongly held views on the need to achieve results for the money invested in public services. He secured the agreement of the Government last year to strengthen the expenditure review process to enable better quality information on results to be available in respect of key programme areas. To enhance accountability and public debate, completed reviews will in future be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Senators will be aware that the national development plan accounts for more than 80% of our capital investment. A mid-term evaluation of the entire plan is currently underway and will be published in the autumn.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">To progress further the agenda on results-oriented budgeting, the Department of Finance is currently leading a pilot project with three other Departments which is focused on linking resource allocation with outputs. Following this study, the Minister will consider whether the approach should be mainstreamed across other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">The OECD also refers to the need to strengthen the accountability framework further. The management information framework currently being implemented across Departments will represent a significant step forward in this regard. It will also be a key tool in moving towards a focus on results rather than inputs, with the availability of better quality performance information. Members will be aware of proposals announced this week to strengthen the accountability framework in the area of health.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The report raises the issue of reform of the funding systems of local government. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated his intention to carry out a fundamental review of local authority financing. That review will provide an opportunity for consideration of those and other views in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">The OECD is a supporter of market instruments, including user charges, to help generate higher efficiency and better delivery of publicly funded services. The report points out that Ireland is unique among OECD countries in not charging domestic consumers for water services. It highlights the heavy subsidisation of third level education in Ireland, a topic which has been the subject of much intense debate in recent weeks. It also suggests that serious consideration be given to raising local revenues by reintroducing a local property tax on residential housing. The OECD's views on the introduction of water charges, for example, are based on its view of best practice around the world. It is interesting that it echoes, in some respects, the views of the independent Estimates review committee – or the "three wise men"– which made its report last October.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">While these issues are undoubtedly sensitive and tend to draw a range of strongly held views right across the political spectrum, the OECD makes a useful contribution to the debate. It is the Minister's hope that the report will inform mature public debate on all these issues in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">As regards competitiveness, the OECD notes that the increase in prices in the non-traded sectors of the economy has been quite pronounced in recent years. The cost base of that sector is substantially determined by wage growth. Higher prices in the non-traded sectors increase the cost base for the traded sectors of the economy. The traded sector cannot easily pass on higher costs through higher prices. The profitability of firms in the traded sector risks being curtailed, with the potential to lead to retrenchment in their operations and job losses. The rising cost of living in the economy is also likely to reduce the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for high value added investment and associated high-skill workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The OECD is somewhat critical of the role of the social partnership agreements regarding wage increases. However, it acknowledges that the agreements have forged a common understanding of the problems facing the country and have contributed to industrial peace. The report also points out that there are signs that an adjustment in income expectations has begun to take hold and points to the new national agreement, Sustaining Progress, as a welcome example of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">As regards regulatory reform, the OECD acknowledges that we have had some success in introducing competition in certain sectors, particularly in telecommunications and aviation. Such competition has yielded greater choice, improved services and led to lower prices for consumers. It notes that there has been progress in substantially strengthening the power of the Competition Authority and that new reform initiatives have been taken in the energy and local transport sectors as well as in the professions. The OECD concludes that success in pursuing reforms in the sheltered sectors of the economy will be the key to safeguarding cost competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">It is clear from what I have said that the OECD conducted a wide-ranging and incisive examination of the Irish economy and of the prospects for the future. The Minister for Finance shares the same vision for the economy as that put forward by the OECD. He also shares most of its views on how to make that vision a reality. However, he might differ with some of the more detailed and specific policy prescriptions in one or two areas. This is not tantamount to criticising or rejecting the OECD's valuable report. It is simply a recognition of the fact that, as Minister for Finance, he, together with his colleagues in Government, must decide on the best approach to be adopted in seeking to achieve our goals. The Minister agrees with the broad thrust of the OECD's advice regarding the need to safeguard our international competitiveness and the associated requirement to ensure sound public finances and foster greater competition in the non-traded sectors of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">We must recognise the budgetary implications of lower economic growth. Lower economic growth means lower tax revenue growth and, as a result, the funds we have available to spend on public services will grow at a slower pace than in recent years. We must adjust our expectations to this new reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_393">I welcome the Minister of State. I am pleased that we can discuss this report. It is, however, only a report; it is not a Bible of economic certainty, nor is it the only economic road map charting the country's fiscal future. It is simply an analysis. the report provides much food for thought and we need to study it, picking and choosing from it where appropriate, but the bigger political picture must also be taken into account.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_188">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_396">—but regardless of whether it is a dismal science, economics is certainly not rocket science. The challenge for the country in the years ahead, in an economy without the Celtic tiger, is to ensure that whatever taxes we collect are gathered in the fairest and broadest fashion possible. We will face the challenge of ensuring that public moneys are spent in such a way as to get the best possible value for money. We must also ensure that we have a system of administration at national and local level which delivers. Those are key challenges which must be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Money alone will not solve the country's problems. We all bemoan the fact that the Celtic tiger appears to have officially disappeared. This means that the choices and revenue available to the Government are more restricted and limited than heretofore, but, as we have seen in the past five or six years in various sectors – such as education, social welfare and health, in particular – pouring money into trying to solve problems is not always the best solution. While revenue will be down and the Government's options may be fewer, that does not mean that we are facing financial ruin or disaster. It means that, politically, we must face new challenges. We must look for new ways forward and ensure that money is well spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">Value for money is a crucial issue when we look at our public projects. Oireachtas committees, particularly the Joint Committee on Transport, are investigating in detail the way our road and rail works – including the metro – are undertaken. We must face the fact that all over Europe these projects are carried out at a lower cost and a faster rate. In North America, the authorities do not talk about taking so many months to build a kilometre of road, but rather about how many kilometres per month can be built. Ours is not a second rate country and we should not accept second rate standards. Value for money in public construction projects is an issue that requires urgent attention. I appreciate that the Minister for Transport seems to have taken this on board as his number one priority and he recognises that it will take time to achieve results. However, it is important that action is taken so that results are seen quickly for the billions of euro in taxpayers' money that are being spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Public expenditure is not bad. There is a certain political philosophy which tries to give the impression that all public expenditure is bad, which is not the case. However, bad public expenditure is very bad and that has been seen in recent years, particularly in the waste of resources on infrastructural projects such as delayed road projects. We must abandon the notion that public expenditure is somehow bad, but we must ensure that we get value for money for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">I welcome recent progress made in this regard, particularly in terms of the health strategy. It may be an issue for another debate, but the way we spend money on health services over the next five or six years will be the key to getting value for money. In light of the way the Department of Health has swallowed resources in recent years without delivering services, there must be agencies and people with major questions to answer. It is not the Government's money which is being squandered, it is that of the public. The Minister for Health and Children and the Government – and the rest of us – face a big challenge in responding to the recent health proposals and in bringing about the required improvements. The Government will be obliged to ensure that every cent spent in the health service produces results. Sadly, that has not been the case in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The report mentions inflation, particularly that relating to wages, and there have been several calls from Senators for an extended debate on benchmarking. This is a matter of one's idea of public service. We deserve public services of the highest quality and they should be as good as those of any other country in the developed world. One does not get public services of the highest quality unless one has public servants of the highest quality. One cannot expect to employ public servants of the highest quality unless one provides them with top rates of pay. I have no difficulty with the way pay was addressed as a stand-alone issue in the benchmarking process, but we are missing part of the jigsaw in that we have not yet dealt with quality of delivery of services. As a member of a local authority, I have seen huge changes in the past 12 to 18 months in the grading of staff and their pay structure. However, has there been a change in the way services are delivered to the public? Have those services improved? To date, the answer seems to be no. Improvements in performance and service as a result of increased pay, which in turn lead to an improvement in quality of life among citizens, is a matter that needs to be examined. We are talking about the taxpayers' money. Public service delivery should not just be about public servants; it is about the public as well as public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The report refers to local government and local taxation. Some people regard this as a minefield, but as society progresses, we must look at how local government works. The Cathaoirleach has been involved in local government but, sadly, since the 1960s, while Ireland incorporated has moved ahead, local government Irish-style has moved backwards. The current Minister seems willing to look at local government anew, but obviously the delivery of services at that level must run in tandem with local taxation and charges. Imposing local charges to substitute for national taxation or to plug holes in State finances is not enough. If we want to debate the issue of local taxation, we must discuss the quality of local government seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">We must look at the fact that, as of now, if one is a local councillor, one is almost politically irrelevant. One has no power whatsoever. If one is a member of an unelected Leader group, local development organisation or ADM group, then one has millions to spend. Local government can take back the important roles of community development and expansion, though that will require resources and funding. As we go down the road of talking about local taxation, we must put down a marker that local taxation and charges must only be considered in the context of making local government real and strong as it was in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s until we changed our minds politically in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The report mentions waste management and waste charges. In recent months we debated the Environmental Protection Bill which was debated in the other House in recent days and in which the Minister took back from councillors the power to make waste management plans and handed it to council management. Sadly, while this may have been necessary in the case of a few county councils in which councillors were unwilling to take tough decisions, it certainly was not necessary in the case of Cork County Council. Where local councillors are willing to lead on matters such as waste management, charges, etc., this power should not be stripped from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">There is a recognition among the public that waste management costs money and that it is not the county or city council which creates waste but rather the public. There is a recognition that if one wants a clean environment, one must pay for it. However, a balance must be struck. There is little point in a national diktat being issued instructing local charges on issues such as waste management unless one gives local councillors the power and responsibility to decide on such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">I note with satisfaction that the report mentions sustainable growth, which is not the preserve of any political party in the House and concerns us all. Young people, in particular, have taken to these buzz words and it is a course we can follow with effect. Sustainable development should be kept to the fore in economic debates because if considerable growth rates occur at significant cost to the environment, they will come back to haunt us in the long run. Checks and balances must be kept to the fore. Again, this should be a job for strong local government. I look forward to the day when we will have strong local government delivering on many of these issues locally and having powers, responsibilities and resources. It will take a changed mind-set at national level. Perhaps we are moving slowly but surely in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">Small business is an issue which did not receive particular attention in the report. It would be remiss of us not to note that small business persons appear to be struggling. The main issue they bring to my attention and I am sure that of many of my colleagues, is insurance. The report is not about insurance but insurance costs have a considerable impact on economic development or lack thereof. It is an issue which needs to be kept firmly on the Government agenda. While there have been numerous reports and there seems to be a Dáil, Seanad or committee debate on the issue almost every week, the action required has not been taken. I encourage the Minister of State to keep the issue at the top of his agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">In regard to regional and balanced development, I wish to comment on decentralisation, a chestnut which has been around for many years in this House and elsewhere. The Government has indicated, as part of its programme and as promised, that decentralisation will occur in the coming months. There is a large number of submissions before the Minister for Finance. While I appreciate there must be political dilemmas for all concerned, if we want strong, regional and balanced growth, we must make positive moves in this direction. Decentralisation is one of the more straightforward routes. When the matter was debated in the House in recent weeks, there was a clash over the number of civil servants inquiring about decentralisation. In response to a parliamentary question, the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, was advised that 18,000 civil servants wished to be considered for decentralisation. Even if only eight civil servants are involved, not to mention 18,000, the sooner we move them to the regions, the better from the point of view of sustainability, transport and regionalisation. I hope the Minister of State will respond to this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">I welcome the opportunity to have a mini-discussion on the economic options facing the Government. If value for money, fairness in taxation and quality administration at local and national level are kept to the fore, we will not go too far wrong. I suppose we have all had too easy a time over the past five or six years in that money was available to plug the odd gap but this covered up some of the many problems. Money might not be available in such abundance now but the problems still remain. We must solve them and look at new ways of doing so. It is a challenge for all of us in respect of which I wish the Minister of State well in his endeavours.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_413">Economics and politics were very much out of kilter 20 years ago but have become much more closely aligned. I pay tribute to the economics profession and the economic institutions which have made a significant and important contribution to the prosperity we enjoy today.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I welcome this debate on the OECD report on the economy, which is always valuable reading. I called for this debate on the Order of Business last week and I am glad the response has been so quick. The OECD has always been respected for the quality of its analysis. As the Minister of State said, it is a body comprising about 26 developed countries. The only parallel of which I am aware – I am not sure the European Union reports in this detail on individual countries but its annual economic reports are valuable – is the International Monetary Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I note the Minister of State said the OECD met officials from a number of Departments and various organisations. He will forgive me if I observe that, not for the first time, the tone of this report is rather more that of, say, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank than, say, the Department of Health and Children, for example. In fact, one can often read into OECD reports the ideal world as the Department of Finance and the Central Bank envisage it but, as the Minister of State said, Ministers hope – I think he was referring to Ministers for Finance – that its input will inform mature public debate on these issues. That is one of the values and purposes of such reports. The Minister of State went on to say that he shared the same vision for the economy – surprise, surprise – and most of the views on how to make this vision a reality. However, political pragmatism comes into the equation in that the Government must take the decisions. Needless to say, some of the prescriptions could, either singly or together, bring down a few Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">One of the values of the OECD is that it brings a comparative perspective to bear and, therefore, provides a basis for a more objective debate on the economy. I wish to highlight a few parts of the report that I regard as significant. It notes the slowdown and elements of overheating, particularly in the past two years and states:</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The policy challenge facing the Irish economy in the immediate future is to ensure that both income expectations and public finances adjust to a slower growth environment. The former is necessary to guard against deterioration in international competitiveness, while the latter is required to ensure fiscal sustainability and the maintenance of a growth supportive tax environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">There certainly is no support that may be read into that – or into the remainder of the report – for the type of prescriptions that come, perhaps, from the Green Party or the Labour Party, for substantially raising levels of taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">Surprisingly, or perhaps not so, the OECD praises the social partnership process. Even if social partnership is not in keeping with neo-liberal orthodoxy, the organisation appreciates and recognises the contribution it has made to Irish economic and social progress in the past 50 years. They praise it specifically for promoting "the common understanding of the emerging economic reality, even without a tax concession as offered by the government in the past". That is significant because a few years ago the view was that social partnership would hit the buffers once there were no longer tax concessions to offset against income moderation. However, that was not the case at the outset and the position remains the same. It is a great tribute to the good sense of the social partners that it continues to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The OECD points out that, as far as the public finances are concerned, we have a debt-GDP ratio in the order of 35%. Public finances are, therefore, quite healthy at present and it is important that they should remain that way. As Senator Bradford observed, the organisation puts great emphasis on the importance of value for money, be it in the area of health or that of public transport. We have had examples of matters involving both areas in recent days. The thrust of the health reports and the recommendations they contain is that we must get better value for the level of health spending. Increased health spending has not necessarily been ruled out, but there is a strong desire that it should be more efficient when, and if, it is increased. The position is similar with regard to public transport, in respect of which a number of alarming estimates have been doing the rounds for a year or two. Before we embark on projects in areas such as those to which I refer, it is essential to ensure that we are getting what we need at a reasonable, as opposed to an absolutely astronomical, price. While I am all in favour of a metro, I do not think the country should bankrupt itself several times over to obtain it.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The OECD also lays emphasis on the importance of regulatory reform in the sheltered sector. One of the issues that has emerged clearly from the report is how much better the Irish economy and employment are doing than was expected. In light of current conditions, an unemployment rate of 4.5% is a remarkable achievement. There is no doubt that in the euro zone – I had the benefit this morning in my home town of talking to the chief executive and other representatives of a US multinational – Ireland compares well. It was pointed out, for example, that in terms of wage costs in France, one would add on 50% in social costs, while in Germany one would add 30%. In France, employers also have to contend with the 35-hour week.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">The strength of the euro, which is a cause of difficulty for some indigenous industries such as, for example, the mushroom industry, can, on the other hand, be a benefit for some multinationals. I was informed this morning that the ideal situation for the firm to which I referred earlier would be a strong euro, a weaker sterling and a weak dollar. The company's prices are calculated in dollars, so if it get more dollars for its euro, it will obviously make gains.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I wish to refer to another passage from the report which states:</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The slowdown in world economic conditions in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, corporate overheating scandals and the ongoing threat of war throughout 2002, suggested that an open-ended economy like Ireland's would have been expected to experience a much more pronounced slowdown in economic activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">This part of the report explores why we have not had more of a slowdown and more job losses and why we have not been poised on the brink of recession. It gives various answers, one of which is the strength of the diversification that we have had into the biomedical pharmaceutical industry in particular, the strength of the housing market, the level of public investment and, perhaps, the very low interest rates we enjoy within the euro zone. The report's net point is that, in light of current circumstances, the economy is – one must not jump to conclusions – doing quite well to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The OECD takes take a positive view of the way that we will be able to solve our infrastructural problems. Anyone who has been on the Drogheda bypass will know that it is a fantastic addition to our infrastructure. There might be a grain of truth in the criticism that until now we have not had much to show for the boom. That is because the things in which we have invested are only now coming on stream. In two or three years we will have a great deal to show, in infrastructural terms, for the boom. I agree with Senator Maurice Hayes that there ought to be a lane on the Drogheda bypass tolling booth where sterling is accepted because the road is, after all, on the North-South economic corridor.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Inflation is decreasing towards the EU average. The OECD's report states that "The Irish economy is operating at or close to full employment and participation rates are now close to the EU average." This places the onus squarely on underlying productivity and the key determinants of the potential growth rate. The organisation stresses the importance of retaining Ireland's attractiveness as a location for investment. I am pleased that, under the negotiations on the Convention on the Future of Europe, it seems as if the right to set our own corporate tax rates will remain reasonably secure in the short to medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The OECD comments – I would probably agree with it – that Ireland still suffers from the legacy of a policy orientated towards protecting producers' interests at the expense of consumers. It does not anticipate any difficulty in terms of Ireland complying with the growth and stability pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">I have a number of reservations. It is popular to say that when we had money we spent it. However, that rhetoric is not strictly true because we put aside money into pension funds and we ran a surplus.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">I have to skip over other interesting points. I do not agree with the assumption that community employment schemes should be run down further as quickly as possible. I do not believe there is adequate appreciation of the importance of these schemes – if there is, it is not being acted upon. I can speak only for the less developed parts of rural Ireland where the schemes make a contribution both to the individuals who participate in them and also the community. They are particularly important in the RAPID programme towns. In County Tipperary these include Tipperary town, parts of Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir. I hope there will be a rethink of this issue in the deliberations about where we go next year and in the Estimates. It is true that unemployment is low overall but there are pockets where this is not the case. The OECD report paints a reasonably positive and encouraging picture of the economy but, at the same time, makes it clear that we have a lot to do.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMinihan" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_431">The first thing to be said about the OECD report is that it paints a very positive picture of the economy. There has been a huge amount of gloom and doom over the past 12 months or so with commentators and Opposition politicians vying with each other to see who can best talk down our economic performance. While it is true that conditions have become a lot tougher and the economy has slowed down compared to the hectic days of the Celtic tiger, as the report makes clear, this is normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The outlook the OECD projects for the economy in the years ahead is very encouraging. It agrees with the view that the trend growth rate in the medium term is between 4% and 5% in real terms for GDP and a shade lower for GNP. This is economist-speak but in plain man's language the OECD is saying the economy is due a period of very healthy growth and that it has the capacity to out-perform the rest of Europe over the next four or five years. This is a slower growth rate than we have been used to in recent years but very impressive nonetheless, and sufficient to allow for a very significant improvement in living standards and substantial extra investment in public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The OECD report makes clear that we have the capacity to achieve growth but that this growth cannot be taken for granted. Specifically, it itemises two key areas in which we will have to pursue the right policies if we want to get the right results. The first concerns income expectations and the second, management of the public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">To all intents and purposes, market forces drive income expectations in the traded sector of the economy. If an exporting firm allows its costs to run out of control, jobs are lost. The real challenge is to ensure responsible pay growth in the sheltered sector, that is, the area of the domestic economy, which is not open to outside competition, particularly in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The benchmarking process has substantially increased the public service pay bill. My understanding of the process is that we benchmark pay in the public service in return for significant improvements in performance. It is vital from an economic perspective that we secure the reforms necessary to deliver these improvements in return for the multi-billion euro investment we are making in the benchmarking process. The OECD clearly states: "It is important that future wage adjustment in the public sector should be strictly conditional upon the demonstration of higher efficiency." This sentiment would command widespread respect on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">Public service pay is the single largest component of overall public expenditure. It follows that if we can manage the public sector pay bill well, we should be able to manage the public finances well. The OECD report devotes considerable attention to value for money in public expenditure, as Senator Bradford stated. It argues that we should move from an input-oriented system to an output-oriented one. This is a very valid point, on which we should concentrate. Consider the health service, for example, into which massive resources have been put since 1997. This is because the coalition parties genuinely wanted to improve the quality of our public health service and were willing to invest money to achieve this. However, the political debate about health was too narrow and always focused on resources – another word for money. There was so much talk about money that we were inclined not to talk about patients. The Government proclaimed how much it was spending as a badge of its commitment to health while the Opposition and media lambasted it for not putting enough into the system. "Underfunding" was the key buzzword.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Almost without noticing, we discovered that we were spending very heavily on health but not getting a lot for it. France is often put forward as a role model for us to follow in the area of health. However, it now transpires that we are spending more than France on health on a per-head basis, yet our health system is nowhere near as good as the French model. If we had focused on achieving outputs from the start, we might be in a much better position now. I am glad the Government is now taking decisive action to reform the health service and put new structures in place. The new structures will enable us to establish a clear and transparent relationship between inputs and outputs in the service. This is not too much to expect when one considers the money being invested. The treatment purchase fund serves as a template for what can be done. To the best of my knowledge, this fund represents the only area of the health service in which it is possible to allocate a defined amount of funding and be confident that one will get a defined level of output in the form of patient treatments in return. The debate on health will now focus much more on issues of reform, value for money and accountability and move away from a crude emphasis on funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">The OECD makes a number of recommendations to promote greater competition in the sheltered sectors of the economy. The Government is working on this agenda and we are likely to see further considerable progress on competition in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">The report makes only a brief reference to the subject of infrastructure. I was somewhat surprised by this. One does not have to be an economic guru to realise that the lack of adequate infrastructure, particularly in the area of transport, is one of the major constraints on the development of the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">We have made a lot of progress in recent years but when it comes to the efficient planning and delivery of major transport projects, we still have a long way to go and are falling well behind our continental counterparts. We had an extensive debate in the House last week that covered subjects such as Luas and the Red Cow roundabout. We now have to add to our list the south-eastern motorway in Dublin – the final section of the M50. It seems that we will have two sections of new motorway with a gap in the middle. In other words, one will not be able to drive on it because there will be no through road, no way of getting onto the route and no way of getting off it. This is a €500 million project, one of the most important projects, not just for transport in Dublin but also for the national road transport system. The road may be completed in 2005 or 2006 or it may not be completed at all unless a way can be found around the archaeological obstacle which is Carrickmines Castle.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">It defies belief that we could have created a mess such as this and that a motorway could have been routed through an historic site. I strongly urge the Government to do everything possible to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, otherwise Carrickmines could become a tourist attraction. Visitors would come not to view the meagre remains of the castle but to look at the road to nowhere, the two sections of motorway which do not meet in the middle.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We have made considerable progress on the roads infrastructure in recent times. The Drogheda bypass has just opened and the motorway from Dublin to Dundalk will be completed when the other two sections open in the next week or so. The rate of progress still leaves much to be desired. It may be that we need to subject the roads programme to the same kind of rigorous review and far-reaching reform that is now being applied to the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The OECD report makes no mention of any crisis in the Irish economy. That is a matter on which we should concentrate. It views our economy as being in basically good shape, but more importantly, as having excellent prospects for future growth. It allows no grounds for complacency. Clearly, we have to stick to the task of managing the public finances, getting a better return for public expenditure, promoting competition. The report does not paint the kind of negative picture of Ireland that we hear from so many media commentators and from so many people on the Opposition benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">We have always been a great people for talking ourselves down. Negative thinking has never achieved anything. It has never opened a business, created jobs or won a football match. This country has changed a good deal in recent years. Ireland is now a more confident place than ever before. Our young people are more confident. They see opportunities, not difficulties. They feel part of a modern, dynamic, European economy that is capable of competing with the best.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">We as politicians must recognise the energy, enterprise and enthusiasm that is out there. Let us stop talking our country down and start talking it up.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_449">In page 6, subsection (1), line 10, to delete "includes –" and substitute "includes unreasonable behaviour which is so likely by reason of the fact that the behaviour constitutes or includes one or more of the following behaviour –".</p>
          <p eId="para_450">We are seeking to amend the definition of disorderly conduct in order to make it clear. At the moment it sets out a general principle of unreasonable behaviour by a person, having regard to the circumstances likely to cause injury, fear or distress to any person. It then goes on to list five particular circumstances, most of which are self evident and uncontroversial. They include, for example, "quarrelsome or insulting behaviour". It is not clear whether the test of reasonableness, or unreasonable behaviour, applies to those five circumstances listed in 2(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>).</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The implication of the way in which the definition is formulated suggests that it is not subject to that test. It suggests that quarrelsome or insulting behaviour is of itself unreasonable, and likely to cause injury, fear or distress to any persons. We seek to amend the definition of disorderly conduct in order to ensure and make clear that the requirement of unreasonableness is also required in the case of the five listed incidents.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_452">The present definition states:</p>
          <p eId="para_453">"disorderly conduct" means any unreasonable behaviour by a person on licensed premises which, having regard to all the circumstances, is likely to cause injury, fear or distress to any other person on the premises".</p>
          <p eId="para_454">It must be that it is in the light of all the circumstances that it would be likely to cause these things. For instance, in the boisterous aftermath of a football match something might not amount to disorderly conduct, whereas if it was a quiet afternoon's trading and a person was shouting and roaring at the television it might turn out to be disorderly and likely to cause harm. We must bear in mind that the District Court judges are reasonable and must have regard to all the surrounding circumstances before this particular condition is met.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">That is one meaning for disorderly conduct. It is extended to mean all the other things included in paragraphs 4(1)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) in the definition. The proposed amendment suggests including “quarrelsome or insulting behaviour”. There can be occasions when this does amount to disorderly conduct. The running of a bar or a pub – people here are more experienced in this matter than I am – is a skilled occupation requiring an experienced manager. Different approaches must be taken to situations, depending on the circumstances. On a quiet occasion, behaviour which would not be noticed on another occasion could amount to disorderly conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I am trying to strengthen the hand of the licensee in these matters. Licensees should have a greater capacity to remove people, to bar them or to ask them to leave the premises. I want to make people understand that they go into pubs to drink and that the management lays down the policy and if, in those circumstance, behaviour is disorderly they can be asked to leave. This is what I seek to bring about.</p>

          <p eId="para_457">I do not want to detain the House because where the Minister and I differ on this matter is really down to the drafting of the definition. As currently drafted, the test of reasonableness in all the circumstances effectively does not apply to the subsequent definitions. As the definition is currently formulated, one can be quarrelsome or boisterous in the aftermath of a match and by virtue of that fact be deemed to be disorderly. I do not think that is what the Minister intends, but that is what comes across in the legislation.</p>

The only two words in which one might find some leeway as to how they are defined are “quarrelsome” or “insulting” behaviour. For example, someone might be having a disagreement in a loud voice, which would not necessarily be such as would cause fear or distress to anyone else. It is not difficult to imagine circumstances where that might happen. This refers only to the word “quarrelsome”.</p>

          <p eId="para_467">We must carefully examine the tests of the terms "drunkenness" and "drunken". It struck me that one might be of the reasonable apprehension that a person was intoxicated and also be of the view that the person would not be a danger to himself or herself or others, but would be utterly incapable of doing anything to himself or herself or others and should not under any circumstances be served any more drunk. I am concerned that the interpretation of the term "drunken" would require a person to conclude that a person might endanger himself or herself, whereas a person could be completely incapable without there being a risk of endangerment.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The amendment seeks to change the provision in order that it should read, "A drunken person means a person who is intoxicated to such an extent as would give rise to a reasonable apprehension that the person is incapable or might endanger himself or herself or any other person in the vicinity and "drunk" and "drunkenness" are to be construed accordingly".

          <p eId="para_469">I have some sympathy with this amendment because drink has a different effect on different characters of people. Some get aggressive, while others lie back and fall asleep. An argument could be made that if the person was not considered to be a danger to himself or herself or others, although he or she might not be able to sit up straight – and people can get messy but may not be endangering anyone else or himself or herself – it comes down to the fact that he or she has consumed too much alcohol which has given rise to their being drunk. We do not want to go around pubs with breathalysers. However, if we gave a little more scope to the licensee, where someone might be no danger but not a nuisance, the publican might deem that he or she has had sufficient drink and should vacate the premises. Perhaps the Minister could examine this issue, if not now, then on Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_471">In this context, we are dealing with people committing an offence of being drunk, but we are also dealing with the question of the publican committing an offence by permitting a person in this state to be on the premises. If anyone thinks they are doing a favour to publicans, they may be doing the exact opposite. The benign, smiling fellow snoozing in the corner may, if I extend this definition, turn out to be the occasion of a prosecution when he is doing no harm to anyone. I accept Senator O'Toole's point that he should not have been given drink to bring him to that point. However, bearing in mind that closure orders are floating around in this context, gardaí do not want to get involved. I am concerned with public order and the like and I do not want to close a pub because some fellow falls asleep in the corner and the gardaí cannot arouse him from his slumbers. I do not want to go down that road unless I am forced to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">Senator O'Toole's phrase "incapable" begs the question – incapable of what? The Senator may think the term "incapable" is a free-standing adjective, however, I do not think it is. The first question that would be asked of me if I left this place having accepted this amendment is, "What does this mean?". Does it mean incapable of standing, sitting, speaking or keeping one's eyes open? If someone got to the point where he or she was incapable of standing, he or she would be a danger to themselves and would satisfy the other proposition. On the other hand, if they are quietly ensconced in a corner of the pub, having had one too many, it is not my great priority to get at those kinds of people. I and the public are more concerned with someone who is going to hit someone, damage someone else or damage him or herself or be so incapable that, in the cases of young men, they could be mugged or, in the case of young women, they could be the victims of sexual assault. I do not want to widen this definition to increase the liability of publicans to be prosecuted for having the old josser in the corner falling asleep over his pint. That is not what I intended to outlaw.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_473">I have listened to the Minister and bow to his superior knowledge on the definition of "incapable", which I mistakenly understood to be a well-established and understood legal term. It is obviously just a journalistic term. What concerns me is how section 4 and others sections are interpreted. Section 4 provides that a licensee shall not supply or permit any person to supply intoxicating liquor to a drunken person or permit a drunken person to consume intoxicating liquor or permit drunkenness to take place in a bar or admit any drunken person. Section 5 provides that a person shall not purchase intoxicating liquor for supply to or consumption by a drunken person and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">What worried me about the definition was the interpretation of the test. There is well-established experience in the courts that where there is a test – in this case a reasonable apprehension – somebody has to adjudge and conclude that in his or her considered view a person is drunk. The question then arises what does it mean for a person to be drunk. It could be argued to mean that a person sleeping benignly in a corner, having consumed two gallons of porter, is not drunk under the terms of legislation. There is a problem. While I accept the Minster's argument on the wording of the amendment, the evidence of a garda in court could be stitched up by a smart member of the legal profession. I am more worried by this aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">I have explained that the terms "drunk" and "drunkenness" are to be construed according to what is meant by the term "drunken person". That may assist a little.

Perhaps I am missing a point but the words "in the vicinity" are not germane to the definition. It almost suggests that if it was considered that a person was to behave in a certain manner, it would be acceptable, provided it occurred beyond the vicinity. The wording implies a leeway not contemplated by the Minister. I recognise that the publican should and cannot be held responsible for something a person might do beyond his or her premises. That would be wrong. However, I fail to see the reason the test should be based on the possibility that a person might do something in the vicinity. No reasonable person would accept that is a proper or necessary provision. It adds nothing to the Bill, nor does it address the Minister's concern.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">I, and those I represent, welcome the Bill which is excellent legislation in many respects, although we would be concerned about a few aspects. On the question of drunkenness, we would like to see stiffer penalties applied to those who are drunk. We had a dreadful occasion recently in Swinford where people visiting a pub refused to leave when asked. They wanted more drink but were refused. The publican is caught in such circumstances. If he or she serves drink, he or she breaks the law but if he or she refuses to serve because he or she considers the patrons may have taken too much drink when they say they have not, he or she will be in trouble with the Equality Authority. The penalty should be increased from €300 to perhaps €1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Senator O'Toole referred to disorderly behaviour within the vicinity of a pub. Where a number of pubs are grouped together, the committal of a crime by a person within a few yards of one premises does not necessarily mean he or she has been in it. It may be possible to prove it in court but that is an expensive business. CCTV cameras are installed in most venues, which means that if a person had been drinking somewhere else but was at the centre of a problem outside a pub, the publican could be in trouble. Apart from these concerns, this is a good Bill. We are happy the Minister is dealing with the problem of drunkenness, including those who refuse to leave a pub when asked and cause a row when they are refused further service.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">When a person is in a drunken state, he or she can be very contrary and obstructive and will generally not accept he or she is drunk nor take kindly to being asked to leave a premises. He or she may have been getting drunk but not causing any trouble, yet when asked to leave, he or she could become troublesome. How does the Minister envisage publicans coping with such individuals? How long would the publican wait for the arrival of the Garda if he or she decided to call for assistance in effecting an eviction? Does the Minister consider that publicans will be able to enforce this measure?</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_488">Section 6 deals with this aspect. A drunken person is required to leave a licensed premises on being required to do so by the licensee or a member of the Garda Síochána and shall not seek entry to the bar of a licensed premises. Sections 5 and 6 create criminal offences punishable in accordance with section 5(2) and section 6(3) and arrestable by a member of the Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">As matters stand, the licensee of a premises faces a difficult situation where somebody becomes inebriated and is requested to leave. It is one of the reasons we have monopolies, pub licenses and the present law. It is not an easy task. Children cannot carry it out. Those of infirm psychological constitution should not be behind the bar of a pub because this kind of situation sometimes requires the licensee to lead people out of the premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The Bill is centred on the proposition that it is an offence for somebody to get into a state of inebriation and attempt to enter a pub or refuse to leave a premises. A legal consequence of it being an offence of that kind is that a publican is entitled to refuse admission where he or she believes the consequence of allowing a person to enter the premises would be that he or she would allow the person to commit an offence. It strengthens the hand of the publican in respect of refusing admission. If sections 4 to 7, inclusive, are considered together, it will be seen that they are designed to strengthen the hand of licensees to maintain order in their premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">Although section 4 imposes a liability on licensees not to permit drunkenness on their premises, that is again designed to strengthen their hand. It means that a person behind the bar can tell a patron that if he or she serves another drink, he or she will not be able to keep his or her pub open. He or she would be able to tell the patron that if a garda saw him or her in his or her drunken state, he or she stands to have his or her pub closed for a day, or whatever. In those circumstances, these provisions also strengthen the hand of lounge staff and the employer when he or she tells the staff that if they serve drunk people when, or to the point they are drunk, it is a serious matter to be dealt with seriously by the licensee as an employer. This will strengthen the hand of young lounge staff when confronted with a patron they consider to be in trouble. They can say they may lose their job if they get another drink. If we talk about 10 shillings under the 1872 Act, there will be no teeth in the law at all. This effective provision is intended to give the law teeth.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I move amendment No. 4:<entity refersTo="#bill.2003.24.seanad.3.amd_4" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p eId="para_494">In page 7, subsection (1), line 19, to delete paragraph (c).</p>
          <p eId="para_495">When I spoke to this legislation last night I was very agitated, but the thought struck me that I would hate people to think I was approaching this matter from an academic perspective. Not only do I enjoy a bar, but I learned well the way in which to tap a barrel of Guinness with a metal tap and a wooden mallet before I was a teenager. I have served my time in that territory and I have had to make judgments on fair days in Dingle. I am not speaking from a purely intellectual or academic viewpoint.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">There is a requirement and a test on the publican in this Bill which is unfair, though I am sure it was never intended to be so. The provisions in sections 4(1)(<i>a</i>) to 4(1)(<i>d</i>) follow a particular line. Subsection (<i>a</i>) provides that the licensee shall not supply intoxicating liquor or permit any person to supply intoxicating liquor to a drunken person or to any person for consumption by a drunken person. It is very clear. Subsection (<i>d</i>) provides that the licensee shall not admit a drunken person to a bar. It is black and white inasmuch as anything can be. It is very difficult to comply with subsection (<i>c</i>), which provides that a licensee shall not permit drunkenness to take place in a bar. The Minister is asking someone to make a judgment that a person's next drink will make them drunk, but we have already decided what constitutes drunkenness.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Section 4(4) provides that the licensee may prove all reasonable steps were taken to prevent drunkenness taking place, which is very reasonable. I imagine it was the intention in section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) to make the same provision whereby a licensee would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent drunkenness taking place. It may well be impossible to prevent drunkenness. It is a bit like virginity. Can one say a person is a little bit drunk? At what stage is sobriety gone? When are we over the line? Things do not work that way, which is why section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) should be deleted and replaced with the wording used in section 4(4) which is much closer to achieving the Minister's ends. I believe that in section 4(1)(<i>c</i>) the Minister wishes to ensure that a licensee takes all reasonable steps to prevent drunkenness on the premises. The form of words used further down would fit in very well there. The Minister has already used them and I would like to hear his views on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">My other amendments are consequential on the first. Amendments Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, are aimed at achieving the same end. I would be very interested to hear Senator Bohan's view on the matter. Instead of indicating to the licensee that it is a crime to permit drunkenness to take place in a bar, which is easy to say but difficult to implement, it would be fairer to require that he or she takes all reasonable steps to prevent it. It would be fairer on the licensee and easier to adjudge. It would be more reasonable in every way.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">Section 4 places responsibilities on the licensee, but I am concerned that we are not providing formal recognition of the licensee's right to remove a person from a premises.

          <p eId="para_502">There is no formal recognition of the right of removal provided for in section 18 of the 1872 Act. Regardless of the restraints placed on the licensee in terms of what he can or cannot do under law, it would be beneficial if he had the formal right to remove a person from his premises. Like Senator O'Toole, I have served my time. I remember that when there was a bit of trouble in my grandfather's pub in west Cork, he had only to appear at the door and order somebody out and they would go. I realise times have changed, but the formal recognition of the right to remove existed then and I am concerned it is not repeated in this Act. I ask the Minister to comment on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">The two amendments tabled by the Labour Party seek to make more or less the same provisions as those sought by the amendments of Senator O'Toole. They are phrased completely differently which is why I am not sure the effect of Senator O'Toole's amendments would be the one he intends. That is for the Minister and his officials to tell us.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Mr. D. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_505">I accept that they are related. They deal with the same issue, though they approach it from different angles. I am happy to have the amendments taken together.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Labour Party amendments seek to apply the reasonable steps mentioned in section 4(4) to all of section 4 rather than simply to section 4(1)(<i>c</i>). The problem arises from the definition of “drunken”. While the Bill defines “drunkenness”, to make it an offence to supply drink to a drunken person demands that the supplier knows the person is drunk and is a danger to himself or herself, according to the definition in the Bill. It is fair to say, as Senator O'Toole has pointed out, that one would not necessarily know that. If a person approaches a bar, an instant judgment must be formed as to whether a person is drunk to the extent that supplying him or her with drink is an offence. It will not always be terribly clear that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">It is not unreasonable in those circumstances to assert that is a defence for a publican to prove he took reasonable steps. He should be provided with some defence, rather than, as appears to be the Minister's intention, subject to an automatic offence. As it stands, the section provides that if a person is proven to have been drunk, the publican has no defence.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bohan</from>
          <p eId="para_508">I agree with the comments of Senator O'Toole. It is very difficult to prevent drunkenness on a premises. No sane publican wishes people to get too drunk, but if a person enters a premises sober to have a pint while minding their own business and not causing problems, where do you draw the line? When do you say he has had enough if he has done nothing wrong and insulted nobody? Nobody would go out of their way to make a person drunk and it would be a bit unfair for a publican to be charged with allowing someone to get drunk on his premises. It is something the Minister should examine.</p>

          <p eId="para_509">We are in danger of tying ourselves in knots. I agree with Senator O'Toole's comments in relation to this amendment. In the case of a licensee who is unable to eject a drunken person and asks for the assistance of the Garda who arrive to find that person still on the premises, can the licensee be held accountable for having served drink to that person? Both the licensee and the drunken person could end up being charged. We are getting ourselves tied up in knots and I am not sure how it will be sorted out.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_510">The essence of the Bill is probably the definition of drunkenness, something which has engaged the minds of the Minister and the Department for some time. We expressed ourselves reasonably happy yesterday with the definition in the Bill but the more information we elicit from the Minister in this debate, the more clarity there will be. If we are debating it here, it will obviously give rise to considerable debate among solicitors and barristers in the courts. Taking the definition to mean the person is a danger to themselves or others, it can mean a person who has become obstreperous in a pub, even to a limited degree. The definition would also apply if the person appeared to be so intoxicated that they were a significant danger to themselves from falling.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I have one concern about the definition. One could have a definition of a danger to oneself which would be compatible with the drink driving regulations. If somebody drinks three or four pints and they have a motorcar outside the door, could the court assume that the person was allowed to consume too much drink and become a danger to themselves under the definition? I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments in that regard. Does the definition need to be refined further? I am not a lawyer so I do not know. The more clarity we can bring to the legislation, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">A judgment call will have to be made by publicans and that imposes a significant responsibility on them. There is an onus on the House, therefore, to make the legislation as clear as possible to ensure that the judgment call does not have such wide parameters that they will be interpreted differently by district justices.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_234" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I will examine Senator Minihan's point. The law at present provides that if a licensed person permits drunkenness on a premises, he is liable to a penalty under the 1872 Act. The phrase "permitting drunkenness" is already in use. We are not dealing with a novel concept. Subparagraph (<i>c</i>), therefore, is an existing offence and the defence provided for it in subsection (4) is reasonable. It provides that if somebody comes across drunkenness on the premises, “It is a defence to prove that the licensee took reasonable steps to prevent the drunkenness concerned taking place”. That is a complete defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">There are subtleties in section 4 which some of the amendments do not take on board. It is an offence for a licensee on licensed premises to supply drink to a drunken person or to any person for consumption by a drunken person or "(<i>b</i>) to permit a drunken person to consume intoxicating liquor” on the premises. There is a distinction between subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) which should be noted by the House. Subparagraphs (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) refer to the bar. This is of particular significance to hoteliers. If one is running a hotel and somebody returns drunk to the hotel, the hotelier cannot forbid the person to come into the hotel. He can allow the person on to the premises, bring the person to their room or even allow them into the residents' lounge to sleep off their condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Likewise, if somebody was found falling down drunk in a public house, it would be permissible for a publican, rather than throwing them out onto the street, to bring them to a room and avoid an offence in regard to the bar of the premises. A number of people from outside the House had asked if publicans would be throwing people out on the roadside in a state where they were a danger to themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">I am happy with the way the section is drafted. It is subtly drafted to distinguish between hotels and other premises and between bar situations and non-bar situations. It provides a defence for somebody who is accused of permitting drunkenness. The person can say: "I did not permit it; I run an operation which takes all reasonable steps to prevent this type of thing happening."</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The law provides that a licensee need not personally administer or serve the drink. That is a cornerstone of the licensing law. The licensee, through the barman or other staff, is vicariously liable in criminal law if he serves somebody to the point of drunkenness. We should leave this as it stands. It will strengthen the hand of a licensee in relation to his staff to be able to say that he will be criminally liable if they misbehave and that he will take a serious view of it if they do not run an orderly pub in his absence. That will bring a measure of discipline and allow the publican to say to the lounge and bar staff: "This is a serious matter. The law has changed and the premises can be temporarily closed. I expect you, therefore, to be vigilant for drunkenness in the pub and not to serve drink to drunk people."</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Furthermore, section 4(1)(<i>a</i>)(ii) allows a publican to withdraw drink from somebody if he forms the view that the person has consumed too much. If somebody has three pints in front of them and the publican considers that he has had enough, the publican can remove the drink. It would be a criminal offence for the publican to allow the person to continue to drink the alcohol in those circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The House should give credit to the parliamentary counsel for this provision. It is subtly drafted and distinguishes between different situations. The draftsman has taken on board the situation of the hotelier faced with guests tottering into the premises from the street. His duty is to keep them out of the bar and not to serve them more drink in the hotel. However, he need not put them out of the hotel and can, in this case, permit drunkenness in the hotel. He can allow the drunken person into his room to sleep it off or let him have a cup of coffee in the residents' lounge. He must be able to do that. It is not easy to draft this law and it cannot be done in a casual way. I am reasonably happy that this measure has been rigorously drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I will consider the point made by Senator Minihan and see if I have created a new lacuna with regard to the power of publicans to remove people from the premises. I also do not want to create a licence for heavy handed security in pubs. We know the consequences of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">In page 8, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_527">"(4) The Court may, if it sees fit, refer a person convicted under <i>subsection (3)</i> for alcohol abuse assessment and with his or her agreement, treatment if required.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">People who get themselves into this sort of state, particularly those who are obliged to go before the courts for repeat offences, have possibly got a serious problem with alcohol. This is not really being addressed in the Bill. However, I realise that the Minister is trying to do something on a very practical level with this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Within accident and emergency units, we are now trying to ensure that more is done for people brought in out of their minds with alcohol than just trying to get them to sober up and treating whatever injuries they have suffered. An attempt is being made to get them to see alcohol abuse nurses, who try to humour and humiliate people into agreeing that they must have some sort of treatment and simply cannot go on as they are at present. It is a trifle depressing to think that people who have got into such a state as to end up before the courts – not once, but twice – will not be offered a solution to their problems other than paying a fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">What I am attempting is a somewhat similar to what the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, has attempted with penalty points. It is not just a question of fines, which, unfortunately, people are inclined to pay – even if they are hefty – because this may only happen to the person once every couple of years. If the amendment is accepted, people would, instead, be made to take some cognisance of their actions. We can, in other legislation, ask for psychological reports, etc., on such people, but I do not know if that is useful in this context. I do not know if the Minister contacted any addiction centres, such as that in Trinity or the Rutland Centre, regarding the best place in which and the best way to deal with people who repeatedly offend in such a way.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">This is an awful problem because nobody wants these people rolling around the streets. I have spoken previously about my horror at the level of drink being taken by young women who do not seem to understand at all what it is doing to them physically. I am not a proud person, so if the Minister can bring forward a better wording at Report Stage, that would be absolutely fine. I hope that this legislation will be useful, but I would not like to dismiss such serious situations as people being out of their minds once, twice or three times and then paying fines without some attempt being made to try, as a society, to make them address their behaviour.</p>

          <p eId="para_533">I am not trying to dilute Senator Henry's amendment, which is very useful, but I want to introduce another issue – advertising – which affects people's thinking about alcohol. I apologise for introducing the issue at this point, but I could not see any other opportunity to do so. I ask the Minister to tell us when he intends to address the whole issue of advertising of drinks. Will that happen next year when he will return to address this area?</p>

          <p eId="para_534">I see considerable merit in the thrust of Senator Henry's amendment and I am glad that she is not pernickety about the exact wording or whatever. On foot of what she said on Second Stage, one of my officials attended a meeting of the strategic task force on alcohol this morning. The task force discussed the issue of responses other than just the fines imposed by the District Court, particularly for repeat offenders before the court, so that we do not simply wash our hands of them. People can commit one offence of being drunk and disorderly without anybody having to send them off for treatment or whatever. As a result of the discussion that took place this morning, we are exploring the possibility of devising a list of places where such treatment is available for circulation to members of the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Drunkenness offences are much more likely to occur in the context of the public order legislation, so the question arises as to whether we should attempt this in the context of the licensing law, the public order law or a sentencing powers statute. I am contemplating bringing proposals to Government, not for guidelines – I hate to use that word because it is misunderstood – but for a statutory statement of powers in respect of sentencing policy. There are a number of possible places where the Senator's proposal could be located legally. If we come to the view that it should be done in the context of the licensing law, then rather than attaching it to this particular area, I propose – in the context of the general revision in 2004 – to locate it in a new law where it would have effect, not just for this offence but for all sorts of licensing law offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I am grateful to the Senator for raising this matter. We are already taking this seriously to the point of complying with the substance of the Senator's argument by considering ways of bringing the District Court's attention to the options open to it in this area. It may be desirable to enshrine this principle in law in the first instance so that it will be brought to the attention of District Court judges in order that they will not simply stamp the conviction on to the charge sheet or summons and move on to the next business and that their attention will be drawn to the need to do something further. This is comparable to how, with some motoring offences, the need to re-sit the driving test has been introduced, rather than simply disqualifying people and letting them start all over again at the end of the disqualification period as if nothing had happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment now on the basis of my statement that I am exploring a practical policy to get District Court judges informed on this matter and exploring where such a general power should be located. It does not do justice to the merit of the Senator's point to apply this power in respect of this particular offence and nowhere else with regard to drunkenness and intoxication cases coming before the courts. This is likely to represent a tiny minority of those cases. Drunk and disorderly charges are more likely to arise under the public order legislation. I venture to suggest that this particular offence will not be the most usual of offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">We are already impressed by the Senator's argument and are doing something practical about it. We are looking for a place in which to incorporate into the law of the land some recognition of the need not to deal with repeat alcohol-related offences, in particular, as infractions of the public law and no more, but also to give an express nudge to District Court judges to do something further by making it a condition of a sentence, adjournment or whatever that the accused person should obtain treatment.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">I thank the Minister for his reply. I see his point, but I wonder if what he is suggesting could not be incorporated into this and other Bills, if required. This legislation has received much public attention and I would not like the idea to go out that if people get drunk, they will just get a fine of €300 on the first occasion and €500 on the next. I would like there to be some sort of cognisance also of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">The Minister mentioned the effect on people being told they would have to take the driving test again and the penalty points system certainly sharpened people up to a considerable degree in terms of the way they drive. I now keep an eye on the speedometer going through Donnybrook in case members of the Garda are out with their equipment trying to catch me.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I would be very grateful if the Minister looked at this matter between now and Report Stage, mainly because the legislation has already received a great deal of public attention and will attract more. It is just the sort of people at whom the Minister is trying to aim the legislation who will look at this. I thank the Minister for his reply and will withdraw the amendment. I hope he will have thought of something better by the time the Bill reaches Report Stage.</p>

From experience of living in the north inner city I know that those pubs which have a resident landlord, or a landlord on the premises all the time, are almost invariably well run. Those owned by people who live in Liverpool or Manchester, or wherever, and put in proxies with the instruction to squeeze as much money out of them as they can are the ones where problems arise. We cannot do very much about this because we cannot compel landlords to be on the premises, or live over the shop. It is a pity but that is one of the dangers of the super-pubs, or boozeramas as I call them.</p>

The fact that it takes place in a pub is not particularly relevant. Are we creating a new offence of being quarrelsome?

          <p eId="para_558">In this amendment we are saying that a breach of subsection (1) would not be a new offence.

          <p eId="para_564">We are trying to lower the bar somewhat in this amendment. Subsection (5) specifically allows the licensee to refuse admission if he or she thinks there is a substantial risk that the person would engage in disorderly conduct. Effectively, somebody is being barred. This gives the licensee legal authority to bar someone if there is a substantial risk. Perhaps we are setting the bar too high for the publican. If somebody has already been disorderly and is a known troublemaker, perhaps the requirement of "substantial risk" is too strong. That is the reason the amendment seeks to remove the word "substantial" and require merely that there be a "risk" that the person would engage in disorderly conduct.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">I have an open mind on this but the word "substantial" is included because anybody availing of this can say there was a risk. If it is a tiny risk, is that to be a reason for refusing admission? It has to be one of substance. What worries me is that if we do not have something of substance, we might have a pretext whereby people would mask discriminatory behaviour by saying a person was convicted 30 years previously of a violent offence, or whatever, and say there was a risk. Obviously there is a risk but is it a mathematical one? Is it a real risk? The term "substantial" is designed to prevent people from engaging in a refusal on a pretext that there was a risk that somebody would misbehave. It has to be a substantial view.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The real question is whether one regards the fact that a person has a previous conviction produces a risk or sufficient risk for him – it usually is a man – to be barred. It would not be unreasonable for a publican to take the view that if somebody had been convicted in court of disorderly behaviour there was a risk that he would do it again. I would not be inclined to say such a publican was acting unlawfully if he barred him.</p>

If all the publicans in his village barred him for life as a consequence, would that be a proportionate or reasonable thing for them to do ten years later? Would they still be able to refuse the person admission because he had beaten up a barman in another pub down the road and tell him that he would never be served in the town again? We have to be reasonable. The risk must be something of substance, not speculative or mathematical, or, to use the phrase used yesterday, "asyntotic to the zero axis."</p>

I do not want to give the Senator an off-the-cuff answer as to whether saying something is lawful is the same as saying that it shall not be unlawful. It may be that someone would claim that they have authority to do something by virtue of one proposition. A double negative says only that something is not unlawful in the circumstances without prejudice to whether it is lawful in the first place. When I was Attorney General, there was a "plain English" drafting manual in gestation, and I presume that it has been produced. I do not know whether the draughtsman in the Attorney General's office draws that distinction. There are sometimes occasions when saying that something is not unlawful is not the same as saying that it becomes lawful to do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_578">Section 8 deals with disorderly conduct, and I made a point about that yesterday, comparing the fine for the licensee on the one hand and that for the culprit in the disorderly conduct on the other. The Minister might examine this question before Report Stage, with a view to introducing heavier fines for the individual. The first offence attracts a fine of €300, and a €500 fine for the second offence is far too small. Unfortunately, publicans will be confronted, and in most towns one will find certain characters who are troublemakers. I am not talking about alcoholics. In some instances, all they need before they start to cause problems is a few pints. The penalty imposed on them should be sufficiently severe to deter them, and €500 is not enough. I suggest changing paragraph (<i>b</i>), allowing judicial discretion to impose a maximum fine of €1,500. I would be happier with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">Perhaps I might use this reflection on the section to fly a little kite. We were talking about people's behaviour and expelling them. Many people, in the two Houses and in the general public, are concerned about the behaviour of drunken people in accident and emergency units in hospitals. I wonder whether that might be covered by legislation. I do not think it is covered by any section of this legislation except, perhaps, by inference. We should examine it because of the enormous waste of time and resources and the prejudice to the health of people who suddenly become critically ill when the accident and emergency units are swamped by drunken idiots. There should be a quite strict little lesson for them. They should be severely fined or made to carry out community service or some such thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">I say that in general terms, but I presume it is not really covered by this Bill. I ask the Minister to examine the possibility, for otherwise we will have a further huge waste of resources at a critical point for society when people are admitted in what should be an emergency.

          <p eId="para_585">Exactly. As far as Senator Jim Walsh's point is concerned, the offences provided for here are the same as those covered in section 6. Whether the fine is €1,500 or €500, in the context of a court conviction there is a great deal of public opprobrium and disgrace. As I said, though perhaps not in this House, for several offences I am considering introducing the right for the Garda Síochána, rather than bring people to the District Court to face the music six months after the event, to serve notice that, if they do not pay a fixed sum, they will be liable for court summons. I sympathise with Senator Walsh in that, compared with a €500 fine, the cost of a garda teeing up a prosecution, the time of the court, serving the summons, the adjournment and so on is quite significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">I sympathise with the Senator's point that the fines are not huge. However, I am increasing the penalties substantially over their present level. I will not refer to how I have been described regarding this legislation, but I do not want people to say that it is repressive and that I am thinking of the heaviest penalties I can in this case. I would not like to give that impression, since there are plenty of people whose sole aim appears to be to exaggerate this legislation and make it appear anti-youth or oppressive. I am mindful of that when I say that the penalties for publicans are greater than for those who are causing the trouble, but I rely on the common sense of the District Court to sort out who is really guilty in such situations. In another context, people have mentioned that a closure order is a very tough remedy in the first instance. However, the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 allows the District Court, in cases that are purely technical or where there is no moral guilt of significance, to find the facts proven and not to convict at all.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">In page 9, subsection (2)(a), line 20, to delete "first" and substitute "second".</p>
          <p eId="para_590">These amendments are in the name of the Labour Party Senators. The Minister has anticipated the point in his last comments about penalties. The Bill creates several new offences, including serving drink to drunk people, permitting drunkenness and disorderly conduct and so on. It sets out, as the Minister has pointed out, fairly low financial penalties for publicans of €1,500 for a first offence or a maximum of €2,000 for second and subsequent offences in the District Court. I understand why he is doing that and, broadly speaking, I agree with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">This section provides for a mandatory closure order not exceeding a week for the first offence. Requiring a mandatory closure after the first offence is a little extreme. It is also obviously far more important to a publican than any of the small financial penalties that he or she will also suffer. The purpose of the amendment is to provide that the mandatory closure order – the important word here is "mandatory"– comes into play only after second or subsequent offences rather than the first, something that is a more proportionate response to the offences concerned. On the face of it, as the law currently stands, if one drunk person is served a drink too many, the pub can be closed for up to a week and must be closed for some period, it would seem. For a first offence, that seems a little harsh.</p>

        <speech by="#EddieBohan" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Mr. Bohan</from>
          <p eId="para_592">I agree with previous speakers about mandatory closing, which is a draconian measure. It is not just the loss of business for a week while staff are being paid but the effect that has on the reputation of the house. The effect would be enormous, even though the closure might occur for little reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">I assure the House that my organisation and I have no time for anyone who serves under age drinkers. I am amazed at where young people get drink. A member of Senator McDowell's party told me recently he was in Maynooth with one of his children, collecting leaving certificate results. He could not believe the number of 15 – and 16-year olds who were staggering around drunk. I assure the House they did not get drink in the pubs of Maynooth. I do not know where they are getting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Recently the <i>Evening Herald</i> sent out a young lady dressed up to look 22 or 23, which can easily be done. She was accompanied by two reporters and they called to 25 pubs in the Dublin area, with the reporters sending her to order drink at the bar. I was amazed she was served in five of those pubs and amazed at the five pubs which served her, as they are among the best-run houses in Dublin. That is entrapment, of course, and it would be draconian to close those pubs for seven days because that girl was served in them. A heavy fine of €5,000 or €10,000 for the first offence would be more appropriate than closing the premises for seven days.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_595">I mentioned this issue yesterday. I commend the Minister on what he is achieving with this necessary Bill, which addresses matters of public concern. I am concerned with the balance, given the responsibility of the licensee. The licensee has a responsibility but so has the individual. I am mindful of what Senator Bohan said and there have been situations of entrapment, particularly with the equality legislation, where people have availed of legislation to advance their own causes or finances. I am also conscious that the penalty is very severe in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Minister pointed out that allowing judicial discretion in the matter means that in all probability the Probation Act will be applied but it might be reassuring if the first time a person is caught a financial penalty rather than closure might be applied – the latter option might impact on the business further down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I also mentioned leaseholders yesterday. We have had some developments in this area of a leaseholder carrying full responsibility, though it would be the operator rather than the leaseholder in this instance. The Minister should look at this. If someone irresponsible offends, he or she is not managing their premises properly and will be caught again anyway. A genuine operator who is caught on a once-off basis could be closed down and the legislation should perhaps reflect a more lenient approach.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_599">I am much more in sympathy with the Minister's position. He made it quite clear that the Probation Act can come into play on the first offence, which is perfectly satisfactory. It is very interesting to hear from the honourable, decent people representing the drinks lobby – they have stated their interest – that it does not matter how high the fine is. They will pay the fine but do not want to be closed. That tells me one thing: close them if we are serious about this. That is the only thing that will hurt and it also tells us how much money they are making if they do not care about paying fines of €5,000 or €10,000. If that is cheaper than being closed then it tells us where the money is. We should hit them in the pocket and make them behave.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">Senator Bohan has a very high reputation, as do most of his members, and the decent ones will get the benefit of the Probation Act so that this will not happen again. As for the others, the Minister should take the advice he has been unintentionally given and make this pinch. The only way to make it pinch is to close the pubs.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_603">I am in broad agreement with what is in the legislation. First, it relates to a conviction and second, it specifies the sections in which this may apply – sections 4, 7 and 17. The only place where the sanction may be questionable is section 15, which amends the 1988 Act and states that the holder of a licence shall not allow a person under the age of 21 years to be in a bar if the person does not possess an age document. In that instance this might be a severe sanction but I would not quibble with the sanction in other respects.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_284" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_604">First, in the case that an injustice would be done by a conviction, there is always the Probation Act as a way out for the District Court. Having said that, if I accede to these amendments I would be saying that everyone has one free go at being done for drunkenness and the closure regime would not apply on that occasion. That would send out the wrong signal as it would suggest to every publican in Dublin that this will never happen to them unless it happens once and they are prosecuted. A point made constantly yesterday was enforcement, with Senators asking where the gardaí were, who would bring the prosecutions and if they would see any results.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">One advantage of the under age closure and this closure is that they work without a garda ever knocking on the door of a premises in advance, so there is a deterrent in place. It signals to the licensed trade, their customers and employees that this is serious and is hanging over everyone's head. If it were totally disproportionate a District Court judge would be able to resort to the Probation Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">It is not mandatory to close a pub for seven days. The closure can be for one day and I am told that that has happened already in the case of a supermarket, which is serious business. We talk about superpubs but if a supermarket closes for one day there is a lot of explaining to do to head office.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">While I have sympathy with the point that Senators Jim Walsh, Derek McDowell and Bohan made, I find the blood-thirsty language of Senator Norris used in agreeing with me slightly embarrassing.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">Taking the more judicious language used by Senator Dardis, I would damage the section and the entire idea if I was to send out the message that a person had one free go and that they would not face sanction unless they had transgressed on a previous occasion. This would make everybody complacent about it and it would not have the deterrent effect that I am seeking. I would prefer to leave the section as it stands and, therefore, I ask Senator Derek McDowell not to press his amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#DerekMcDowell" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Mr. D. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_611">I am not convinced that the Minister has the balance right. Perhaps the power should be there for a District Justice to impose, at his or her discretion, a closure order for up to a week on a first offence. However, what I am quibbling with is the mandatory nature of the closure. It seems that it might, in some circumstances, deter the prosecution of offences in the first instance. There is some evidence of that in the existing closure order provided for underage drinking and the way it is being employed in various parts of the country. Clearly, that would also work to negate the intention of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I am not sure that we would be sending out the wrong signal. There may well be circumstances in which there is widespread drunkenness with people falling around the place, breaking up a premises and causing trouble elsewhere afterwards. On a first offence, it would be quite appropriate to close such a premises for a week, but it should be a matter of discretion for the District Justice and not something which must be employed in every circumstance. Equally, if a prosecution was taken – perhaps it would be frivolous – because one drunken person was served, under the Bill, it would be necessary for some sort of closure order to be imposed. On a first offence, that would be too harsh. I do not intend to pursue the matter further today.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">I prefer what is in place for the reasons I outlined. I do not claim to be infallible on these matters, but if the message goes out from the Houses of the Oireachtas that drunkenness in a pub is a serious matter and that if there is a conviction, unless the Probation of Offenders Act is applied, there will be a closure attached to it, many of those who manage pubs will tell their staff that from now on they are playing a different ball game.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">I wish to digress slightly. The word "drunkenness" is defined in a peculiar way in the Bill. Does one person being drunk constitute drunkenness? I take it that it does. It is possible that a conviction could be obtained, simply by virtue of one person being drunk and being served drink, and that a premises would have to be closed. That strikes me as excessive on a first offence, but I do not intend to pursue the matter any further. Clearly, the Minister is of a mind—</p>

          <p eId="para_620">—or drove a car and killed somebody else, the fact that it was only one person and that the entire premises was not being run like some kind of Bacchanalian place does not diminish the seriousness of the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">I want to get across the message to the drinks industry – we will succeed in doing so – that, from now on, it is a serious matter if somebody gets drunk in a premises. The superpubs, in particular, cannot simply roll out the drink in a commercial industrial operation and have poor, hapless lounge staff earning pittances delivering it to people, without somebody at the top of this arrangement taking responsibility and realising – this applies especially in the case of superpubs which are frequently franchised out – that they face serious consequences, including up to a week of no trading, if they end up breaching the law in respect of drunkenness.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">New management policies will arise from this legislation. Staff, particularly in the superpubs, will be told by the management that they do not want the premises closed down for a week. As a result, members of staff will be obliged to monitor the state of the people being served. It will no longer be good enough for youngsters of 19 years of age to go around with trays of drinks and alcopops plonking them down in front of people without any regard to the consequence of what is happening in front of them. That is the message I have been preaching.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">I hope I am not a zealot on the issue, but, given what happens on the streets outside those premises and the consequences of that, the public is looking to the House to say to everyone who is a stakeholder in the entertainment industry – particularly in respect of intoxicating liquor – to get serious about this because it is a serious issue.</p>

He put it to the witness in the case that the elderly man was incapable of making a will, but was making very little progress. He said to the witness, "I have to suggest to you that the testator was in the hands of soliloquising."  The witness said, "To be honest with you, Sir, I do not understand that term."  The senior counsel then said, "I have to suggest to you that you know very well he was in the habit of talking to himself when there was nobody else around."

          <p eId="para_631">In page 10, after line 43, to insert the following new subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_632">"(14) A court exercising jurisdiction pursuant to this section may direct that the closure order shall commence on a date not later than 6 months from the date of the order of the court.".</p>
          <p eId="para_633">This amendment seeks to give the court more discretion than does the Bill regarding when the closure takes place. The Bill is quite strict as to exactly when the closure should start, that is, within a certain number of days following the conviction or the appeal. We seek to give the court some added discretion as to the specific period in which the closure would apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">My wife is from Lisdoonvarna in north Clare. I mention this only because the licensing laws in that part of the country are very interesting. I sometimes wonder whether the licensing laws extend there at all at certain times of the year. The trade is extremely cyclical and seasonal and there are times of the year when no business seems to be done in many pubs and there are other times when a huge amount of business is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">Obviously, the effect of a closure order would be greater or less depending on when it applied. By giving discretion to the court to decide the period in which – within six months – the order would apply, in a sense allows it some discretion to modulate the severity of the closure. There are times when a closure order would not affect pubs in some parts of the country very much, although there are times when it would affect them a great deal. It seems reasonable to give a judge discretion to modulate the order in that way.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">The first offence involves closure for one day. Bearing in mind that there has to be a prosecution, conviction and decision by a District Court judge that the Probation Act would not be appropriate in the case, the judge could order that the premises be closed for one day, 30 days after the order in question. In those circumstances, I do not believe that this is a draconian, appalling consequence. I agree with Senator Bohan that it is probably the shame and loss of reputation that is relevant rather than the exact timing of the order. The one day closure could fall on Sunday, which would make little difference to most publicans, but consider the effect of a one-day closure on a supermarket.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">Senator Moylan asked if this provision applies to off-licences. The answer is that it applies right across the board. I am not disposed to soften this sanction.</p>

The Minister rightly points out that, even if one takes it as a one day closure, if the court decides to close the pub or supermarket on a Monday, it would have quite a different effect than if they decide to close it on a Saturday. It would be open to the District Court justice to make the penalty much tougher by, for example, selecting a Saturday, rather than a Monday, for the closure. Rather than just leaving it haphazardly, as the Bill does at present, to the number of days following the conviction, it should be a matter of discretion for the judge to decide whether the penalty should be harsher or weaker, depending on the circumstances of the offence in the first instances.</p>

                    </p>
          <p eId="para_648">In page 11, lines 6 and 7, to delete "or Thursday" and substitute "Thursday, Friday and Saturday".</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The Minister has rowed back on Thursday night opening hours. These will revert from 12.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. I understand that he did so as a result of representations about schoolchildren turning up late for school or being drunk while there and people arriving late for work – or perhaps not at all – on Fridays. I agree with the action the Minister has taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The Commission on Liquor Licensing, in its final report, stated that since later opening hours were introduced for Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, public order incidents have increased significantly. It provided figures – I do not have them with me – which are startling and which must be attributed to late night opening.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Since I entered the House, the issue of street violence and the number of serious attacks – these resulted in death in a number of cases – that have occurred in the past 12 months has been raised on a weekly basis. The incidents to which I refer are a result of late night opening. The Minister has not tackled this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">It is not that I oppose late night opening, I would be amenable to having pubs – as is the case in other countries – remain open until much later, but only if we could ensure that the situation on the streets would be properly controlled and policed. The latter would ensure that people would not become involved in violent incidents because they would be aware that they would be apprehended on the spot.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">There is no law and order on our streets and that is due to a serious lack of a Garda presence. Until such time as this problem is tackled, we will have to revert to the earlier closing times. This will not be a popular move and it will probably not be supported here this evening. In light of the opinion expressed by the Liquor Licensing Commission, I am surprised that the Minister has not tackled this problem and stated that we must revert to earlier closing times. That is why I have tabled these amendments. I ask the Minister to consider accepting them until he is in a position to appoint the 2,000 additional gardaí to police the streets.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_312" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_654">I am grateful to the Senator for raising this matter. Her position is consistent with that adopted by her party at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, when Deputy Deasy outlined the same general approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">This is not a question of my rowing back on anything; it is a question of my accepting the recommendations of the Liquor Licensing Commission. In its final report, under the heading "Negative Impact on Work, Training and Education", the commission states:</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The Commission is concerned at reports that later opening on Thursday nights is having an adverse impact on young people reporting for work or training, or turning up for classes or lectures on Friday mornings. While the evidence is mainly anecdotal, the Commission accepts that the longer opening hours on Thursday nights are having an unintended negative impact on the participation of young people in work, training and education. This is a very worrying development and the Commission recommends, therefore, that closing time should revert to 11.30 p.m. on Thursdays. The Commission recommends that the normal closing time on Thursday should be set at 11.30 p.m., i.e., the same as Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">That was in the context of a broader consideration by the commission in respect of the hours which were dealt with and the effect of the recent changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The commission took a very broad view of this area. It referred to the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill – as it then was – which was going through the House, and said that it would serve to provide the Garda with additional means of combating anti-social behaviour and violence. That has now been passed by both Houses and is law.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I accept Senator Terry's comments. I agree that it would be preferable to have more gardaí on the streets at night. However, I am obliged to deal with the real world and not the world as I would like it to be. I have to deal with the real situation that I am confronted with, which is that an expert commission – the establishment of which was approved by the House – reported that it believes there is a case to change the law relating to Thursday night opening times.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">In Dublin, in particular – Senator Bohan will probably echo this point – Thursday night is very popular in terms of people going to public houses. That is a fact and it caused me to hesitate in accepting the Commission's report in respect of this matter. However, I will not extend the provision to cover Fridays and Saturdays at this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The other point I want to make – the House should reflect upon it – is that it is the special exemptions until 2.30 a.m. and 3 a.m. that create difficulties in terms of public order.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_314" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_663">It is not the 11.30 p.m. to 12.30 p.m. regime that is the real problem. I have to provide for a Garda force, rostered by the Commissioner, which has to combat very significant numbers of intoxicated people on our streets between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. This problem is a consequence of the special exemption order and the entertainment during drinking regime. It arises close to the changeover of Garda personnel at 8 a.m., at which time gardaí have to return to their stations with their charges and carry out other duties associated with the changeover. There is huge stress on the system at this time. Even if I doubled the number of gardaí to 24,000, a significant problem would still arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">The Senator should note that the closing time associated with the special exemption order is not affected if there is a closing time of 11.30 p.m. or 12.30 a.m. The special exemption order applies to premises closing between 2.30 a.m. and 3 a.m., be it on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. Therefore, the changing of the closing time on a Friday or a Saturday will not have any effect whatsoever on a club that stays open until 2.30 a.m. or 3 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">As the House knows, the nightclub owners have been lobbying very heavily to end the provision – we will probably deal with it later – pertaining to the drinking-up time and the entertainment they provide. The main issue is the threat they perceive to their businesses because of having to cease providing entertainment between 2.30 a.m. and 3 a.m. They would be prevented from providing unabated entertainment until 4 a.m. or 5 a.m., subject only to the provision that the last drink would, in theory, be consumed on the premises by 3 a.m. This is a separate argument and will probably have to be dealt with under another section.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Although I acknowledge the argument of the Fine Gael Party, I am not convinced that its argument about changing closing times from 12.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. is the crucial link in terms of public order. The recommendation of the Liquor Licensing Commission was not based on public order issues but on absenteeism from work, lateness for work and absenteeism from lectures by students on Friday mornings. As I indicated to Deputy Deasy, if I am wrong in respect of this matter – I do not believe I am – there will be an opportunity in 2004, by way of our major Bill, to standardise the closing time, including Friday and Saturday, to the time suggested by Senator Terry. I am relying on the recommendations I received and I am not thinking up some little wheeze of my own. Although I acknowledge the validity of much that the Senator has stated, the issues she has raised are much more related to the special exemption orders. In that context, I remind her that the legislation is also providing for local authorities to have a new, proactive role in part or all of their functional areas in respect of special exemption orders. This matter should not be ruled out of the equation.</p>

          <p eId="para_667">The Minister should read what the commission's report has to say on public order incidents since the opening hours were extended. It makes interesting reading and I am surprised that the commission did not make the recommendation that we should roll back the opening hours on Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The Minister stated he has to deal with the real world. He should do so and accept the commission's finding that the incidence of crime has increased significantly since the opening hours were extended. There is a serious fault in the Bill because the Minister is ignoring this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I will not press the amendment but take the Minister at his word that the matter will be reviewed. I hope that the measures in the Bill that deal with drunkenness will reduce the incidence of street violence and alleviate some of the problems. We will review the matter in a year to see if this is the case. I am disappointed that the Minister has not gone all the way to deal with this measure.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidNorris" eId="spk_316">
          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_670">I am taken by the Minister's very reasonable approach to this matter. He is correct in stating that Thursday is now a day of serious drinking. I remember when it was Saturday. Then it became Saturday and Friday, and then Saturday, Friday and Thursday. If this trend continues, every day of the week will become one of heavy drinking. It is a function of affluence – young people have a huge amount of disposable income and have not been educated on sensible drinking. They have been given a bad example and the whole culture is eaten into by the notion that it is hysterically funny to be drunk as that it is an excuse and alibi for anything.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">There are now advertisements in England inviting one to come to Ireland to get "out of your skull". That is why so many English visitors come to Ireland to have their hen parties. We have a reputation for drinking and it is perceived to be part of our culture. This has been the case for a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">It is interesting that we now say Thursday is a very busy drinking day. Every day of the week will be if we are not careful because there is so much money involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I am glad the Minister raised the issue of special exemptions, which I raised at some length on Second Stage, because it really needs to be examined. Publicans in my area have said that they get special exemptions for a whole month without their having any special reason other than that they like to have them. They state that they will get a belly dancer to entertain their customers and that they will fry them a few chips, but this is utter nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I was very careful when I said we need to examine the way in which licences are granted, the operation of the courts and the weight attached to the positions taken by the Garda, the city authorities and the local people. This has been catered for to some extent, especially in terms of neighbourhoods. I hope the Minister will identify and tidy up the problems in concert with the District Court. The issue of special exemptions is a real headache.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_675">In my area in the south east the late opening hours have not given rise to a significant increase in disorderly conduct, even on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. However, we have noticed that the special exemption orders definitely do. Our local authority has addressed the issue and has contacted the Garda on many occasions because of severe injuries incurred by people as a consequence of disorderly behaviour in local fast food outlets after their having emerged from nightclubs at 2 a.m. or 2.30 a.m. Since the discos in question have closed, there has not been a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I do not know what circumstances are like in Dublin but the legislation is for the whole country. In many ways, it has not led to an increase in people's drinking. I have noticed that people go out later on Friday and Saturday nights. I am not sure I would like to see the current regime removed without there being a definite case for doing so. The legislation is predicated on trying to ensure that public order is maintained. I do not think the extension of opening hours has been a major contributing factor to disorder, especially in rural areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_679">I do not believe that the roll-back of one hour on Thursdays will make any difference to the problem of absenteeism from work on Friday mornings. It will not affect many public houses in suburban areas but down town, where tourism has a major input and with late night shopping, especially on Thursdays, if people leave a pub at 11.30 p.m. instead of 12.30 a.m., they will go to the clubs, of which there are plenty around. As Senator Jim Walsh said, most of the problems and disturbances late at night occur as people leave late night establishments. I am not knocking the clubs which are entitled to make a living and at which there is not a great deal of trouble at those establishments which close at midnight or 12.30 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">With regard to absenteeism, closing an hour earlier on Thursdays will not make the slightest difference—</p>

          <p eId="para_682">—because the extension to 12.30 a.m. did not make much difference. However, I see where the Minister is coming from with the commission. As he said, he will bring forward a bigger Bill in 2004. In the meantime we will see how this works out.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_323" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_683">As Senator Terry posed some questions, I would not like to be accused of concealing the facts. In respect of intoxication in a public place, in 2000 there were 14,687 convictions and in 2001, 17,805; in respect of disorderly conduct in a public place, in 2000 there were 2,341 convictions and in 2001, 2,924; in respect of threatening abuse or insulting behaviour, in 2000 there were 14,251 and in 2001, 15,718. The commission took into account and gave careful consideration to all these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Perhaps I am wasting time since Senator Terry has generously indicated she will withdraw the amendment. However, I have taken note of her point that she believes the liberalisation of the licensing laws was a problem. However, it is concerned more with special exemption orders than the actual closing time of pubs. One curious footnote is that the nightclub industry, which is concerned about all of these issues, sought the abolition of the chicken and chips – the substantial meal – requirement and thought it was making life much easier by not having to adhere to this arrangement. In fact, it opened up the opportunity for every pub to continue in operation as an ordinary pub until 2.30 a.m. This agitation was a fine example of shooting oneself in the foot. The one thing that stopped ordinary publicans from seeking special exemptions into the early hours of the morning was the hassle of having to produce a chef, the chicken and chips, the baskets, the red serviettes and so on. When this was thrown away, it threw open competition and effectively widened the scope of the special exemption order way beyond what had been thought. Talk about spoiling the ship for a ha'p'worth of tar, it economised on the substantial meal and created vast competition for itself. Now the industry is asking me – I am open to persuasion – for a special nightclub licence again because it does not like competition from pubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">There is another huge hole in the licensing law which I will have to look at next year in relation to theatres which can continue all night without any control as long as "a performance" is in train. A performance has been liberally interpreted by the Judiciary as somebody twanging a guitar on a stage. This is very strange but next year's business.</p>

          <p eId="para_688">In page 11, before section 10 but in Part 3, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p eId="para_689">10.–It shall be lawful for a court which is considering an application for the grant or renewal of a licence to attach conditions requiring the putting in place of a system of closed circuit television monitoring in or outside the premises and conditions in relation to the operation of such a system.".</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Unlike some of the other amendments we have discussed, this amendment speaks for itself. It seeks to allow a judge, when considering an application for renewal of a licence, to impose an extra condition that closed circuit television cameras be placed at or near the premises. It is a proven fact that where there is closed circuit television monitoring, it acts as a deterrent for misbehaviour or disorderly conduct. Clearly, the immediate proximity of the pub is the place where there is likely to be disorderly conduct. If a pub does not have a good record or if there is doubt about the publican or the licensee and there are general complaints from the public concerning trouble or noise in the immediate vicinity of a pub, the judge should have discretion to oblige the publican to put cameras in place. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_326" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_691">Senator Terry has tabled a related amendment which would make it mandatory to have closed circuit television cameras. I confess to the House that I had thought along similar lines to Senator Derek McDowell's amendment. I thought twice about the issue and decided I would prefer to provide for next year rather than this year for the following reasons. There is no doubt that in certain public houses the obligation to have closed circuit television cameras, either within or at the entrance of premises, would be helpful to the Garda Síochána. Where there has been trouble in a public house, a public order Act passed recently provides that the District Court can make it a requirement, as a consequence of intervention in such cases, that a closed circuit television system should be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I accept that what Senator Derek McDowell has suggested is discretionary and that what Senator Terry has suggested is mandatory. My concern is that if one takes Killorglin, County Kerry – a favourite – or the town of Loughrea, of which I do not have as fond memories because I am usually involved in a traffic jam, and considers the number of pubs on the main street and the amount of closed circuit television monitors that would have to be installed, one would have to ask whether all those premises are getting five customers each night and if this requirement would be proportionate.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Senator Bohan's allies in the public house trade are mainly Dublin orientated but in rural Ireland many public houses are, at best, economically marginal and teetering on the brink of closure in many cases. With rates expenditure and so on, it is hard to make a living in many public houses, some of which are run more as hobbies than as real sources of a livelihood. I do not know the cost of a closed circuit television camera but I am sure it would cost a few thousand euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">If the district judge is of the opinion that this is a good idea for a publican, he or she can impose this liability but the question arises as to whether he or she could do so in respect of every pub in Killorglin or Loughrea and not in others. There would be a great deal of argument. I want to think about the matter further and 2004 will be the time to do it. It is not as if there is nothing in place. Under the Public Order Bill, where any of these establishments, including fast food outlets, become a focus of disorder, this power is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I will ask my officials to consider exactly what Senator McDowell has proposed as an amendment to this Bill. Rather than go down that road this time, I prefer to give myself time to think about whether it would be fair or proportionate or whether there would be a way out of it for people for whom it was disproportionate. Those are the kinds of issues in the back of my mind. I accept the bona fides of this amendment but at the same time I ask the House to bear with me for a year while I think the whole issue through. I do not want to impose huge liabilities on places which have three customers a night and for whom it would make practically no difference.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">Indeed, it is like that. It is the Workers' Party influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">Senator Bohan's point was reasonable. Most of the big pubs have installed these cameras for their own security and safety. A recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business dealt with insurance costs, which are appalling. In rural areas it should be at the discretion of the owners of premises whether to install CCTV. I do not want to see it in my area and I am glad the Minister does not propose to insist on it. When he looks at the issue again he should exempt pubs of a certain size or turnover. In regard to the turnover,there is a provision which identifies the size of pubs in regard to the cost of a licence. The Minister should allow the smaller pubs to have a discretion.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">The Senator is unreasonable. The Labour Party's amendment is a good one. Provision of CCTV assists the fight against crime. We have seen on "Crimeline" that it is of great assistance in apprehending a person. Some day there may be some undesirables passing through Castlecoote and it might come in handy.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I agree that CCTV is not relevant to every pub in the country, but I agree with Senator Derek McDowell that in the event of a case going to court or where a pub has had problems in this regard the judge should be able to insist that the pub install CCTV.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">To help the House, I should have mentioned that on page 12 of the Bill there is a new restatement of the provision for special exemption orders. It provides that where a special exemption order has been granted, CCTV may be stipulated as a condition for granting the order. That would differentiate between the cosy pubs of Castlecoote and places in the fast lane.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">10. – With effect from a date prescribed by order of the Minister, it shall not be lawful to employ a child in an employment which primarily involves work in a licensed premises.".</p>
          <p eId="para_712">This relates more to the employment of children rather than being specifically relevant to licensing legislation. Existing legislation defines a child as somebody under 16 years of age and somebody between 16 and 17 years of age is a young person. It is not appropriate that a child should be employed on premises where, if the legislation is passed, he or she could not be present at certain times of the day. Perhaps this is implicit already in the provisions the Minister has introduced in regard to the presence of children. It is a belt and braces approach to specifically prohibit the employment of children in pubs.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">The question of employment of young persons in licensed premises is not easy. Persons under the age of 16 are not permitted to work in licensed premises but the employment of certain 16 to 17 year olds is permitted. Their general duties are confined to serving tables and returning empty glasses to the counter. They are not permitted to sell intoxicating liquor.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">A code of practice specifying the conditions of employment has been adopted and appears as a Schedule to the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act 1996 and the regulations made in 2001. As the social partners in the licensed trade have signed up to the code of conduct it would be inappropriate to set it aside without the necessary consultation with them. It would also prevent family members of licensees from helping out in the premises at weekends or during school holidays and could have an adverse effect on young persons considering a career in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I have some sympathy for the proposition but generally speaking I am content to leave the law as it is. I know some people say young people should not be in bars under any circumstances. A lot of people in the Houses have taken up employment of this kind and it has done them no great harm. On balance the case has not been made for excluding young people from pubs.</p>

          <p eId="para_716">We have had three attempts at legislation on the employment of young persons, a matter on which I have spent much time in discussion with different groups in the trade union movement. It has always given me some difficulty. I tend to go along with the Minister's final point. The idea of rearing people away from the real world is not good. On the other hand, we must ensure that they are protected from exploitation. It is important to get the right balance between both.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I am aware of the amount of time that was put into getting the code of conduct together. No group was completely satisfied but it did find a balance between the needs of the different groups. Every month I hear instances of children, who have finished their middle years in post-primary school, looking for jobs in their local pubs and being refused because they are under 16 years of age. Publicans have been honourable, diligent and responsible in this area. I have walked into pubs where I have seen the opposite but in the main there is a positive development in this regard. A balance has emerged which did not exist five years ago. Where we have problems, they could be dealt with through a tighter policing of the code. I would be happy if the existing code of practice was being implemented solidly, as it is being done in responsible houses, although not in others and no change in the law will help them.</p>

I have noticed in pubs in my area that the trend has changed. There are no under 18s working in pubs any more. It is mostly foreign nationals, since young people no longer want to do that type of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Section 14 provides that the holder of a licence of a licensed premises shall not, "subject to subsections (2) and (3), allow a person under the age of 18 years to be in the bar of a licensed premises at any time".

In any business, irrespective of whether it is the licensed trade or otherwise, it is important for young people to come into the business through employment during school holidays and so on. Whether this applies to farming or otherwise, it is difficult to generate interest if children do not grow up in the business.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">The primary intention of the amendment is to avoid the exploitation of young people and their being brought into an environment most of us would prefer they were not. The 1996 Act provides that young people should not work beyond 10 p.m. According to the code of practice which the Minister has kindly supplied me with, that has been extended to 11 p.m. in certain circumstances at weekends. However, I suspect that it is not adhered to as strictly as it might be and that many people who work in pubs do not finish at 10 p.m. Since many of them are in school, the difficulty is that if they are working from 7 p.m. until closing time, which in any event is illegal, it inevitably affects them the following morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">The Minister may not have the information at the tip of his fingers, but I would be grateful if he could find out whether there have been any prosecutions in this regard. Some months ago there was a prosecution in regard to a fast food outlet, but I am not aware of any prosecutions of public houses. Is this legislation merely on paper, or is it enforced? If it were enforced, I would be happier to withdraw the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">We are living in a protective nanny-State world, where it is assumed that it would be a dreadful thing for a 16 or 17 year old to be in a pub working at night. However, it is not assumed to be such a terrible thing if he or she is out in an open space exposed to drugs, drink and so on. Who will protect young people in this scenario? We must bear in mind that childhood is not the uncomplicated thing many of us assume it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">Although I share the Senator's view that pubs may not be the most salubrious place for young people to work at night, there are many other less salubrious places in which idle youngsters find themselves spending their night time hours. It is not that they would be at home with their trigonometry book working out tomorrow's homework. The truth is that if they are not gainfully employed, they will probably be out in an open space in their own area with someone trying to get them to take drugs or experiment with alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">We have come full circle to a point at which it is suggested that work is a bad thing for young people – and work in a pub even worse. As a society living in the real world, the number of kids that come to grief in pubs is tiny compared with the number who do so loitering around their area with nothing to do, saying they are bored and being offered heroin and ecstasy by people who want to exploit them. Keeping them out of pubs will not save them from exploitation. Putting them out in open spaces in their own communities at night is probably a bigger source of danger to them than anything else.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">This is relevant to the discussion we had on section 10 in regard to special exemption orders and closing hours. Again, thinking about rural Ireland, it struck me that the argument as to whether closing time should be 10.30 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. was somewhat academic, particularly at weekends. If one holidays in the west of Ireland, on the route from Dublin to, say Newport, County Mayo, there is not a weekend that one cannot find licensed premises open until very late in the evening. There are festivals to celebrate everything, including grasshoppers, trout and whatever else happens to be the local delicacy. I am sure a person could, without difficulty, spend the summer months visiting licensed premises open until the early hours of the morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">In this respect, the debate is somewhat unreal, especially in the context of rural Ireland. While I take it local authorities and the Garda can have a view on this, it appears that a liberal view is taken of what constitutes a function or an event in terms of securing an exemption. By this I do not mean dinner dances or club functions but local festivals. I do not say they are a bad thing because the degree of rioting in the streets, about which Senator Norris is concerned, is minimal.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">On the question of 11.30 p.m. or 12.30 a.m. closings, there is a certain veracity in the traditional view in the west that pubs close sometime in November. It appears that each year every crossroads can avail of exemption orders between May and October. Is this subverting the intention regarding closing hours?</p>

If we continue in this vein, we will introduce prohibition. Rural Ireland takes the right approach. Drink is kept in its place and can be enjoyed by local communities. The licensing laws are implemented in a practical manner, which is to be recommended. I ask the Minister to disregard the comments made by his party colleague and Senator Terry.

          <p eId="para_776">It does not extend to boats or yachts, although perhaps an amendment could provide for this. There has been much debate about under age and binge drinking among 15 and 16 year olds. I am concerned that there should be more flexibility in these provisions. The overall circumstances of an offence must be taken into account, including the type of drink provided and the adequacy of the supervision. If the courts were allowed such flexibility, they would be able to make a decision based on all the circumstances of a case in the event of prosecution.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">As drafted, the provision means that if a prosecution were to take place and the parent were to give retrospective permission, the case would not stand up. I would prefer to see the matter before a court in which the judge could examine all relevant factors to allow him or her to conclude whether or not adequate supervision was provided or permission was forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I am a little concerned that we will trip ourselves up by making an unintentional provision in trying to curb the scourge of under age drinking. People order drink from off-licences in the name of an adult and send a taxi driver to collect and deliver it to them. It is the same as ordering a pizza. We must provide greater flexibility and control to courts to allow them to form an opinion on the overall circumstances surrounding such an occasion.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">I have some support for the comments of Senator Minihan in this regard. In my town a few unsavoury characters used to gather in the house of the parents of one of their number. The parents lived abroad and were not very reputable. A great deal of under age drinking took place in the house, which is why I would not like to see a scenario in which a parent could provide retrospective approval to such drinking to avoid convictions. Those who gathered in the house in question were of a nature which was highly intimidatory to the rest of the people in that neighbourhood.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">I can envisage circumstances in which parents could be intimidated into giving retrospective approval. Senator Minihan brought that to mind and it is something that should be examined. If it were to happen it would constitute a major flaw in the legislation. Perhaps in subsection (2) provision could be made to require the parents or guardians to be present in a residence when alcohol is consumed. It would be a simple amendment.</p>

The people involved were not being sold alcohol, they were bringing it to the house. It turned out that the problem persisted for a very considerable time and the council became involved. It met the superintendent to see if anything could be done. People on the estate came to us privately and did not wish it to be known they had done so for fear of intimidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">This was a genuine case. If we are serious as legislators, we must provide measures which ensure that what happened is illegal. Subsection (2) must be strengthened to achieve that, which is why I make the argument in support of Senator Minihan.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_791">I have heard the Senators' comments. According to existing law, if alcohol is delivered to a person in a private residence, no offence is committed regardless of parental consent. The new element of the law is that there has to be parental consent. I accept fully the point the Senators make that it is possible where an offence has been committed for a parent to absolve a youngster retrospectively. The parent may say to gardaí investigating an offence that their son had consent to receive drink in another person's house. There is a limit to the law and, on balance, I am unwilling to allow the Garda to set parents against a son or to challenge the parent's version of events even if the parent is bending the truth. The effect would be to set families against each other and to inquire too much into their private affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">I accept fully the counter argument that pressure could be put on parents to pretend there was consent after the fact, but we must be proportionate. Do we want gardaí to say, for example, that they disbelieve Mr. McDowell in respect of what he did or did not allow his son or daughter to do? Do we wish to allow the Garda to invite the court to disbelieve there was consent in the circumstances and to make a liar out of a parent in public or to say he attempted to mislead in relation to an incident in his own house? It is arguable whether we should go that far, but as I am strengthening the law I do not wish to be accused of reactions which have too much of the nanny State about them. We will go this far this year. If the point the Senators make is borne out, we can bring the law a stage further.</p>

With a view to accommodating holidaying families and people in rural areas and to avoiding complication of the law by providing different time limits at different times of the year, and taking into account the fact that sunset occurs in the west 40 minutes later than in the east, I am of the view that 9 p.m. is a reasonable time to set. We do not wish to do everything from a Dublin perspective. I am not in favour of a deadline of 8 p.m. for under 15s and of 9 p.m. for 15, 16 and 17 year olds as suggested. The law must be understandable and people must be permitted a clear view of what is involved.</p>

I agree that it would be unnecessarily complicated and burdensome to make distinctions among the various age groups. However, I am still concerned about the issue of hotels. The Minister made a distinction yesterday between a bar and eating area and said that if children were in an eating area it was a different matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Take the example of the family holiday hotel in the west where it would be normal practice for the family to eat at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. The family would usually go into the bar of the hotel before going to the restaurant. It will be virtually impossible to implement this provision when the family is together. Other Members gave the examples of people coming back from football matches and so forth but the 9 p.m. limit addresses this to an extent. However, I cannot see a hotelier being able to operate this measure. In most holiday hotels in the west the bar and dining room are beside each other and there is constant interchange between them. I do not see how this provision can work.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">In that case, I will rely on what I said on Second Stage. It seems silly and unfair to send young people between the ages of 15 and 18 years off to bed at 8 p.m. They should be allowed to stay until 9 p.m. With regard to the earlier amendment, however, I have no difficulty with providing that children should be out of a premises by 8 p.m. I will not call a vote on it but a public house is not a good place to bring young children in the evening. There is an argument for providing that children under 15 years should be out of the premises by 8 p.m. and giving the older children the distinction of having an extra hour because they are on the verge of adulthood. It is not an important point but it is valid.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">I am glad the Minister has changed the time from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. Like Senator Dardis, however, I do not know how it will be enforced. The hotels the Senator mentioned will have a major problem with it. A large number of public houses in the Minister's constituency have a thriving food business. Many take their families out on Saturday and Sunday evenings for a meal and, during the summer, it is not considered late to go at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. I do not understand how the Minister can expect a publican to tell a family sitting down to a meal that their children under 18 years of age must leave the premises at 9 p.m. Apart from the economic argument, it will be almost impossible to enforce on a busy evening, especially with tourists and foreigners who are accustomed to staying in a premises for as long as they wish when having a meal.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">I ask the Minister to go a step further and increase the time to 10 p.m. That would be reasonable and much appreciated. During the summer it is not considered late to serve food up to 10 p.m.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">This is proof that one cannot please everybody. I would have preferred the time to be left at 8 p.m. However, perhaps this is a difference between Dublin and the country. When one goes into a pub on a Sunday evening, one will regularly see children running around. They should not be there after 8 p.m. However, I do not have a difficulty with the provision because the single hour does not make a great deal of difference. Pubs that serve food could install a separate dining area which would only be used for dining and by families with young children. That would get around the problem outlined by Senator Bohan. If the premises is a public house, can it have a closed off restaurant where people can stay after the 9 p.m. deadline?</p>

As the Minister referred to the different times of sunrise and sunset in the west, is it not possible to propose a simple amendment whereby this amendment would apply only to the Pale?</p>

          <p eId="para_820">On Second Stage I suggested that there be staggered times during the summer for older children. I came to the Committee Stage debate to support Senator Bohan's request to extend the time limit to 10 p.m. for 16 and 17 year olds. There are family holiday hotels throughout the west. Families go for a meal and then to the residents' lounge for the music and dancing which children greatly enjoy.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">During weddings younger children are generally sent to the room with a babysitter while the parents remain at the wedding. However, how can the provision be applied to children between 15 and 17 years of age at wedding functions or during the holidays? I implore the Minister to go a step further and consider the later hour of 10 p.m. for that age group.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_836">The pints would be for the parents. As somebody who has brought children away to holiday hotels on many occasions, I know there will be an occasion when junior will march into the bar, probably in his pyjamas, to complain that one of the other children has been beating him up upstairs or something like that. I do not expect the Garda to seize or close the premises if they see this happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">What I am saying is that in a hotel, the rule is that at 9 p.m. children are no longer allowed in the bar. I put it to Senator Feeney that I am particularly concerned about 16 and 17 year olds. If I set a time of 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. for them, I have effectively lost control of the whole purpose of this identity card proposal, which is to get 16 and 17 year olds out of pubs. If I, or this House, makes a rule that 16 and 17 year olds who are in the company of their parents, cousins or whatever, cannot be in a bar after 9 p.m., I know that the law will be the same in North Great George's Street, Leeson Street or anywhere else. The rule is the rule right across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">If I have a rule which is better for hoteliers than for publicans, I know that the publicans will rise up as one and say that they are now at a disadvantage because families are all rushing down to the hotels for their evening drinks and deserting the pubs. This provision is not being put in as a piece of nanny-statery. We started from the proposition that we want to stop people under the age of 18 from drinking and from the proposition that people over 18 had to have a card and people under 18 were not be seen in a licensed premises at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">At present people under 18 can sit there all night drinking Club Orange in the company of a person over 18 who is drinking an alcopop that is visibly indistinguishable from the Club Orange. Nobody can supervise this is in a large premises and work out who is drinking what. The law is effectively unenforceable in that respect. We moved from that to say that there must be a time at which 15, 16 and 17 year olds are out of a premises so that a publican knows that everybody in his premises is over the age of 18. We have said that younger people, who would, in the ordinary course of events want to have soup, coffee and all the rest with their parents while out for an afternoon, would not be able to avail of that loophole to loiter around a pub and to drink in circumstances where they were not obliged to have any evidence of age or whatever.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">There has to be some cut off point at which kids generally, whether over or under 15, have to be out of the bar of licensed premises. I do not accept the proposition that this is anti-family. A hotel bar is a public bar and is in competition with the public bar across the road that is not a hotel. If I went to a hotel in rural Ireland and saw a notice above the door to the bar stating "No kids after 9 p.m." I would not decide to cancel my stay in that hotel because it is anti-family. That is a grotesque distortion of the reality. It is not anti-family.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Senator Bohan talked about families going out for meals in our neck of the woods, and I am thinking of two places in particular along the Dodder valley which cater for those kinds of situations. If their owners cannot, over the next few months, arrange a room where families can have a meal without having the kids in the bar, they are not as resourceful or legally imaginative as I think they really are.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">This is not a draconian measure and is not going to rip the heart out of family holidays. If I am going on a family holiday with a 16 or 17 year old, it is not a draconian or unreasonable step for me to have to tell him or her to respect the house rules and go out into the lounge, up to the TV room or residents' lounge or to the room specially provided for family meals or wherever, as long as it is out of the public bar of the hotel. If I did not do this, all of this business about identification cards would collapse like a house of cards. It would mean nothing. If we relax on this and say that 16 or 17 year olds can be in the public bar of a large hotel such as, say, the Burlington Hotel in Dublin, after 9 p.m., then it is a matter of people going around and sticking their fingers in people's glasses to see what they are drinking. In reality, that is not a workable law.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">Many people are getting a bit worked up on this subject. I am very flattered by Senator Leyden's suggestion that I am reasonable, but I am not being unreasonable in saying that this is the only way to make this legislation workable. If I acceded to the notion that 16 and 17 year olds should be allowed to loiter in public bars and hotels after hours, then the whole effect of this Bill would be more or less lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">All of this allows young people to be in a licensed premises, to be in any part of a hotel apart from the public bar, to attend weddings, funerals, confirmations, communion parties or whatever occasion is taking place as long as the portion of the hotel they are in is not a bar within the meaning of this Bill – that is, a portion of a hotel normally used either exclusively or predominantly for the sale of alcoholic liquor. That effectively means the public bar of the hotel.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Take any hotel around us here – we are getting hung upon Roundstone. We know the difference in Buswells, across the road, between the bar and the rest of the hotel. It would not be anti-family in that context to say that there are plenty of rooms, sitting spaces and so on which are not the public bar, and a family could go there and have a perfectly good evening together, eating whatever food is available without any imposition upon them. There is nothing unreasonable about this and it is not the end of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">If I made a concession for hoteliers I would be immediately attacked by the publicans, who would say that all the families in a particular resort were now going to the hotel because they had to bar the kids from their premises whereas the hoteliers did not. I ask the House to bear with me and stand with me on this. I am being reasonable, and moving the time limit to 9 p.m. deals with virtually all the real points of substance that were made about family holidays. After 9 p.m. parents will have to either ask their 16 and 17 year olds to sit outside the bar in the other portions of the hotel or move out with them. Alternatively, the hotelier will have to provide some space in which the family can get on with its revelry together.</p>

          <p eId="para_848">The Minister has been eminently reasonable. He has given us a clear, cogent, well argued version of his case which has persuaded me. The accusations of being anti-family are a form of cheap sloganeering which do not match reality. If a reasonable person went into a hotel and saw a notice saying, "Children are not allowed in the bar of this hotel after 9 p.m.", he or she would register that this was a place that cared about the family and was more interested in its welfare than in the profit it would make out of selling drink. That is pro-family. The Minister is perfectly correct and is being extremely reasonable.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">I also support the Minister. Like Senator Terry, I am dismayed by seeing small children in bars. It is a terrible sight and children do not much like it either. This section might appeal to adults because it might be nice to be in a pub without having a crowd of small children on top of one after 9 p.m. Perhaps it will encourage me to go into pubs more often than I have in the recent past.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Minister is right about 15, 16 and 17 year olds because when we discussed the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda, and accident and emergency departments in hospitals, one of the most difficult groups to deal with was children aged between 15 and 17 years. Dr. Mary Holohan, the consultant in charge of the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda, said the most difficult night to get anyone to staff the department – she always has to do it herself – was the night the junior certificate results came out, not the leaving certificate. This is a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Like the Minister, I rely on the ingenuity of the publican on Bere Island. I bet he would have a room somewhere in which to put children in order that he would not lose his clientele.</p>

Will a function room in a hotel, where there are two bars, be covered in barring young people after 9 p.m.? For example, in a hotel in Roscommon, from where I come, there is a fine function room. If a wedding is held there and a bar is operating after 9 p.m., it seems unreasonable that children will have to leave because it is a big family event and many children accompany the wedding couple.</p>

Does the definition of "bar" in section 2 which "includes any counter or barrier across which drink is or can be served to the public" include a function room or does the word "and" before "includes" rescue it from that provision? This goes back to the definition of "bar".</p>

I appreciate what Members on the other side are saying about those who may be attending weddings, or tourists. However, there is another group of children who would be in a pub up to 9 p.m., which is too late – the vulnerable children of irresponsible parents who bring their children to the pub in the afternoon, give them a glass of orange and a packet of crisps and stay for hours. I have seen this happen. That is what I think of when I hear talk about allowing children to stay in pubs up to 8 p.m. or 9 p.m. As the Minister says, other children can be catered for, outside the bar. I agree with this.</p>

The definition of "bar" is very clear in the Bill and we discussed it earlier. This is becoming tediously repetitive. It has been made absolutely clear that the function room is not part of what is "exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor".</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_438" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_857">It will have to be "any open bar or any part of licensed premises which is exclusively or mainly used for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor". One knows a bar when one sees one. Defining it is one thing but it is like an elephant, one knows it when one sees it. This is clear. The bar in a hotel or any licensed premises is not a place where youngsters can be found. I could have gone the whole way and brought forward a Bill which stated, "not portion of licensed premises" at which point I would have been in difficulty with hotels because an entire hotel is licensed. It remains an offence, for instance, to send beer up to a 14 year old in room 253 in a hotel but that is not what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">This subsection is trying to ensure that when gardaí arrive in a large Dublin city centre hotel and see a young person in the bar, they can ask for his or her ID and if it turns out to be a 17 year old, they can prosecute the hotelier. Everybody knows what is meant by the bar of the hotel and what is not the bar but the lounge. In that instance gardaí can say the hotelier is running a premises in competition with Senator Bohan's members and allowing 16 and 17 year olds to be in the premises in circumstances where no publican could be allowed to do so. In such circumstances the hotelier is committing an offence. There is no reason large, well organised pubs – I am not talking about super-pubs – cannot establish function rooms and have parties and so on as long as the portion of their premises arranged for this purpose cannot be described in the District Court as the bar in the premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">Let us be real. If we do not have this provision, we might as well throw our hats at the whole scheme. If somebody has some bright idea that I am missing, that is fine but I do not think I am missing any. I am carefully delineating what is reasonable from what is unreasonable. I have not heard any other formulation, apart from the question of hours, which is a different issue. If gardaí can walk into what we call the bar of any hotel and find a 17 year old and do nothing about it, how can a hotelier in those premises say anything other than the business about cards for 18-21 year olds is a farce because 17 year olds are allowed to be there anyway? What is the ID card scheme trying to achieve?</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Everybody talks about enforcement and asks where are the 2,000 gardaí required to enforce this? The subsection is trying to stop 17 year olds being in the places in question. If publicans and hoteliers use their creative genius, to the extent which I believe they have it, they would easily avoid anti-family or grotesque results by rearranging their businesses in an orderly manner. There are plenty of barristers who would give them opinions on these subjects if there was any difficulty.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_441" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_864">As I mentioned on Second Stage, I am only interested in enacting legislation that is enforceable. Having listened to the views of Deputies, Senators and other interested parties on the issue of age documents, I accept that it would be difficult for 15, 16 and 17 year olds to produce such a document, as many of them, such as age cards or drivers' licences, are not available to 15 and 16 year olds.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">In the circumstances, I consider it appropriate to propose an amendment to the age document requirement so that it will only apply after 9 p.m., since those under 18 must have left the premises by that stage. The amendment means that the mandatory requirement will apply only to 18 to 20 year olds who are in the bar of licensed premises at any time between 9 p.m. and 10.30 a.m. the following morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">I should add that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs has helpfully indicated a willingness to consider adding a photograph and date of birth to the public services card that is now issued to 16 year olds. If such a development comes about, it would mean that the card in question could be used for evidence of age purposes, and that would enable us to revisit this provision next year. I emphasise that the fact that the age document will be mandatory after 9 p.m. does not prevent the licensee from demanding evidence of age before 9 p.m. The licensee must also ensure that the underage provisions are complied with at all times and not just after 9 p.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">This makes the law totally rational and enforceable. The fact that evidence of age applies only at that stage does not mean that it is lawful in any circumstance to give alcohol to a person under the age of 18 in a pub at any time. We currently have a situation whereby, if one brings one's 17 year old into the pub to have crackers and soup on holiday, he or she will have to produce a card to be on the premises, which is ridiculous under such circumstances. The evidence of age card should be forgotten about before 9 p.m. The law will be rational and workable and no one will say that it is unreasonable or that it produces unfair results.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_442">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_868">I spoke at some length on this subject on Second Stage and I do not wish to hold up the business of the House. However, it is a step backwards and a decision against the little people. It means that those who are already vulnerable and feel exposed and discriminated against will have greater difficulty finding redress. The whole point and thrust of this Government has been to render procedures informal and ensure that what I might describe as "your own union" does not get further control over areas – I am talking about the legal profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Taking the appeals process away from the tribunal into the District Court effectively means that the individual – it might be a woman, a gay person or a Traveller – trying to seek his or her rights will have to face a panoply of legal eagles. It really is a deterrent and goes against the spirit of the equality legislation. I heard the arguments of the Minister and others yesterday about people feeling that this item of the law had been – while perhaps not abused – misused or overused. Ultimately, it is the courts which interpret whatever has irritated us about the use of this law. It was the outcome of court cases which said that young people, or whoever it may have been in the particular case to which reference is made, were being discriminated against. I did not table an amendment, but I raised the question and hoped that the Minister might respond.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">I could see sense in the Minister's argument about protecting all interests. However, this really makes it difficult for the little person. In the case of every tribunal established since I entered the House 16 years ago, each Minister who has proposed one has said that it was to make it easier for the people, be it the Small Claims Court or whatever. The Minister knows what eventually happens. I saw an employment appeals tribunal recently involving one person where, as I think I mentioned last night, there were two senior counsels, one junior and I do not know how many advising solicitors. Tribunals are difficult enough, but at least in those situations people with experience can represent individuals and do something. Going into the District Court changes matters and there are all sorts of difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">The thrust of my argument, and that of every speaker whom I have heard, is the importance of tribunals, small claims resolutions and domestic remedies for smaller cases to make it easier for people, remove legal costs, make it simpler to get a resolution and shorten the time involved. Something that could be done here as a compromise between our points of view would be to have an initial step at the employment appeals tribunal. Then, if the person against whom the complaint was being made – let us say a licensee – wished to have it dealt with in the District Court, I could, reluctantly, live with it. It might suit the licensee very often.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">The publicans' lobby has seen this as a game, but that might not be true in many cases if licensees have to start paying huge legal costs. There are no winners in this except the legal profession. I know that we have to protect people, and, running a union myself, I know what is involved. One must do one's best for them. However, I ask the Minister to reconsider this point. There must be easier ways of doing things. It is simply unacceptable and a step backwards. The Tánaiste has just established a body, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board – to which I am a nominee – with the idea of reducing court time and engagement. This is the first item of legislation that I have seen moving in a different direction and it will cause problems. It will certainly do so for those making complaints, and the licensees will also have a difficulty with it which they do not currently see. There is no gain in this and it is not part of what we are doing in the Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#EddieBohan" eId="spk_443">
          <from>Mr. Bohan</from>
          <p eId="para_873">I am surprised at Senator O'Toole. I thought that we should commend the Minister for making the change. Recently, matters reached a stage with the tribunal where there was a mini-industry of people, particularly members of the Traveller community, suing publicans – for whom I speak. The publican had no say in the matter and the equality officer or whoever it may have been was awarding sums of €2,000 or €3,000 at will, without the publican being able to put his or her case forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Some cases were ridiculous. In one, a publican refused two Travellers admission because it was 1 p.m. and they were absolutely twisted. They took him to the tribunal, which awarded them €2,000 each. The reason was that they could not have been drunk, since it was only 1 p.m. I might also point out that they had just driven 15 miles to get to the pub. Those are the sorts of decisions that were being made. I commend the Minister for bringing matters to the District Court, where there is a judge and where, if one has broken the law, one will be punished. That is where the licensing starts. One is granted a licence to run a public house there. That is where the licensing should end if one is not running it properly. It should then be up to the District Court to decide whether one is breaking the law.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TerryLeyden" eId="spk_444" as="#Acting_Chairman">
          <from>Mr. Leyden</from>
          <p eId="para_875">I commend the Minister on including this provision as this was becoming a mini-racket. People were being intimidated while publicans were getting letters and had to defend themselves. I have met many quality publicans who ran great premises and were reasonable to all sections of the community. However, they would not be reasonable to those who entered the premises in an intoxicated state, refusing to supply them with drink. They then received documents detailing the time and date on which this occurred and literally had to buy people off to avoid being sued. There is plenty of evidence of this, though I do not have it with me tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">Who is afraid of the District Court? It is a small court to which it is easy to gain access. Publicans have said to me that they are prepared to face the District Court rather than someone telling them they will have to pay €2,000. The Minister has received good advice on this in his Department and it is an excellent, workable provision with which publicans are pleased. Let us go before the District Court and make our case; let us change the law with this wonderful section, which I support fully.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_445" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_877">There are sharply divided opinions on this section, which I accept. Some have taken it as an implied criticism of the equality tribunal that this decision was made. I offer no such criticism. The tribunal is doing an excellent job but a licensed premises is not the same as Brown Thomas, for example. The decision to admit or not to admit is a matter of legal consequence and controlled by the District Court. Failure to admit to a public house is an issue in relation to the renewal of one's licence, the orderly conduct of one's premises and, when the Bill comes into force, drunkenness. I do not want a situation where a publican sees someone enter his or her premises and thinks: "Hold it, this person is gay or lesbian or from a minority racial group or a Traveller. If I say "No" and there is trouble afterwards, the local sergeant will threaten me with closure under the latest Intoxicating Liquor Bill, while if a complaint is made to a tribunal in Dublin which operates a concurrent jurisdiction, I may go down the tubes for €2,000. What do I do?"  That is not a fair dilemma for anyone.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">I was reminded today in the other House by Deputy Cuffe that 12 groups had spoken out, with one voice, against this move but the vast majority of those who have mentioned this to me – who are not members of any of the groups but living in the real world, as I put it – support this provision absolutely. They believe it is reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The District Court is organised as the people's court. It is not a difficult court in which to do business. The District Court clerk is under a duty to help anybody who has no legal representative in filling out any documents necessary to bring people to book in that court. Also, for Senator O'Toole's information, lawyers have been found present in 30% of equality tribunal cases. There is no holding them back.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_447" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_881">I am not altering the ground rules. It will still be compensatable discriminatory behaviour to refuse entry for a prohibited reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Furthermore, we are including a remedy in this provision whereby, in addition to paying compensation, if it is a gross case, the District Court can order closure to teach a lesson to someone who does not allow a black person into their pub on arbitrary grounds. A temporary closure order can be issued in order that the publican does not do so again. Furthermore, the District Court can rule that if it happens again, the licence may be lost completely. This is by no means a toothless jurisdiction being conferred on the District Court; it is tougher than anything the ODEI tribunal can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">To those who say the ordinary person may find it embarrassing to go to the District Court, in addition to having access to the court via the clerk if one has no representative, the Equality Authority is being given the statutory function to assist people who want to bring claims of this kind in an <i>amicus curiae</i> role.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">This is not one way traffic. It is not the great victory for recalcitrant publicans which people are claiming. This is a decision to put those closely related, interconnected decisions into one single venue where people can decide the rights and wrongs of a decision – before this provision, if one made a decision one way, it exposed one to one remedy, while another exposed one to another legal consequence. In this venue there are people who assess others' credibility day in, day out in every other aspect of their lives, from drink driving to prosecutions and licensing.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">I have great faith in the District Court being able to operate this section fairly. It has not been behind the door in kicking around publicans found to be discriminating against Travellers, threatening them with loss of their licences. This has happened in County Clare on a number of occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">We must have workable laws. If we are saying to publicans we will close their premises if they allow people come onto their premises drunk, we cannot say at the same time that if the people concerned come from any group which would allow them to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination in the equality tribunal, we will give publicans the cruel dilemma of choosing between two disasters. One disaster is having the licence attacked and pub closed, while the other is being ordered to pay compensation by a totally different tribunal which will not consider the other side of the coin.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">It is strange how vulnerable we in the political world are to NGOs saying something is a bad idea, which may also be true of the media. For Senator O'Toole's information, everyone I have spoken to out on the streets says this is the right way forward, that it is not reactionary, redneck conservatism. There is a disconnection in the minds of some who are reading the wrong newspapers, if I can put it that way. The great majority think what I am doing is sensible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_448">
          <from>Mr. O'Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_888">Unfortunately, the real world is the Law Library. In the same way that the Minister went to great pains to say this was no reflection on the Equality Authority, nothing I say is a reflection on the District Court, which I never mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">I always start to worry when people start to defend – an old Government trick. It implies something and forces me to defend something I have never said. Senator Bohan mentioned some strange, anonymous person and was backed up by Senator Leyden. The Minister also walked into it by mentioning a tribunal in Dublin. Let us get a few things right: no anonymous person can fine a publican without him or her having the right to put his or her case.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">I was one of the first people to take a case to the equality tribunal in 1977 or 1978 as soon as it was established. I had some experience of it before the legal eagles got involved and when it was a decent place to do business. I am not clear about the minutiae of that particular aspect of the law, and I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but the equality officer conducts a report and comes to a conclusion. I have often been deeply unhappy about the lack of consultation by equality officers. We have all been in that situation and have asked why something was not discussed, etc. In that respect, Senator Bohan is right. He is wrong, however, in respect of the next part.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">If one does not like the outcome, one can take one's case to the appeals tribunal. The appeals tribunal comprises a nominee of the business community, a nominee of the trade unions and an independent person. These are three ordinary people who listen to the case and reach a conclusion. If some publicans paid €2,000, as required by the anonymous person, they obviously did not want to put their case despite the fact that there was a forum in which they could do so. I am sure the Minister will confirm that these tribunals do not take place in Dublin, but in a venues convenient to the parties concerned. This is a trouble-free approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">The Minister has been vociferous and has made a cogent argument, with which I do not agree but which I accept is quite strong, on the issue of rights and about how people attain their rights in a modern democracy. He has often cogently articulated his view on the importance of those rights not being written into the Constitution and other such documents but that, nonetheless, people should have access to their rights. What the Minister is doing here runs contrary to that particular argument. He has not given a good reason, he has merely given a logical argument about why a matter should end up in the District Court. I do not disagree with that, but ending up in the District Court when dealing with such issues is quite different from beginning in the District Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">That is not to say that people will not get help in the District Court, but it does not meet the need and it will be more difficult for the type of people who might wish to take a case. If there are abuses, they are of the sort for which we, as legislators, have legislated. If the current law requires this to be implemented in a different way, then we should do so if people are unhappy with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">In regard to ordinary people, I guarantee the Minister that one third of the people present in the House could not explain how the system works in terms of equality officers, employment appeals tribunals and the situation in respect of the District Court. I place my reputation on the line by saying I am certain of that. The Minister said that people on the streets know the difference and what is best, but he can forget it. That argument sounds good, but it does not meet the needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">It is not my intention to put pressure on licensees. If a law is being abused in some way, we should ensure that we stitch it down in such a way that such abuse cannot happen. However, it is not good enough or acceptable for someone to state that a publican paid €2,000 because he or she could not put his or her case. That cannot happen under the current legislation, as I understand it. Why did the publicans not put their case? They could have gone to an appeals tribunal, which would have been set up locally. The Minister should reconsider this issue and include a step before the District Court. It can be brought back to the District Court, if necessary.</p>

        <speech by="#JimWalsh" eId="spk_449">
          <from>Mr. J. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_897">I do not think this is really about equality adjudication. There have been abuses of the legislation, of which everyone will be aware, but that is probably not the issue either. This legislation correctly places a great onus on licencees. In doing so, they will be subject to adjudication by the courts on whether they have complied. Equality officers probably come with a certain perspective, which perhaps a District Court judge would not have and would may well be more objective in dealing with the matter. Any equality issues that might arise would have to be adjudicated by the judge in the context of the intent and the licensing provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Bringing in equality officers and the District Court as two separate adjudicators is somewhat similar, if I can use the analogy, to having two referees in Croke Park – one watching for incidents of tripping and the other monitoring dangerous tackles. It would lead to all sorts of confusion. It is much more sensible to take the approach that is envisaged and that is no reflection on the District Court or the equality officers. We must ensure that licensees, publicans and those who will have responsibility for running licensed premises know that they will be dealt with in a consistent manner. That is imperative.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">We are hung up on this because perhaps we believe the thrust of equality legislation has been somehow reduced, although that is not the case. If we stand back and reflect on the intent of the Bill, we will see there is a lot of sense in what is being done.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">I am glad that the Minister introduced this section. The drinks usually supplied in these offers are disgusting because they put a lot of ice in them, so they are not giving twice the measure at all. The advertising of such offers is aimed at students and I have seen evidence of this. I pointed out to the House on a previous occasion that some are directly aimed at young women because advertisements stating "Three vodkas for €10"– which, I understand, is a bargain – were placed on the doors of the women's lavatories in Trinity College. I am glad that the Minister has included this section because it is important. Such offers have become an awful curse.

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_452" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_903">The happy hour provision is one we could manage by ourselves, but the fixed amounts and the promotions area are slightly more problematic. The Attorney General's office warned me that if I did something which potentially interfered with EU trade or the capacity to promote new products and so on, I would have to notify it to the Commission. I have no problem issuing such a notification, but, if I did so, I would not be able to get the Bill passed before the summer recess. The ever-inventive parliamentary counsel thought of a way around this. It is contained in section 21(1), which deals with those types of promotions by way of regulation. It does not prevent me from passing the legislation, but requires me to notify the Commission of the regulations I make.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">I know that the lawyers will look at everything with a microscope and, in the event that somebody states that it was an unintended consequence and that I got it wrong, I draw the House's attention to the happy hour provision. It states that "reduced price" means a price less than that regularly being charged for intoxicating liquor during an earlier period on the day concerned, so that allows somebody to increase the price at a later time during an evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">In case anybody says they did not know what was being put past them, if a licence holder has a special exemption or whatever, this provision does not prohibit them from charging a different rate at a later time, provided that the increase is imposed towards the end of the evening. In the event that anybody is of the impression that we did not notice this, it is deliberate and that is the way we have to deal with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">There are some pubs – I do not approve of such behaviour – which charge extra in the later part of the evening. On the other hand, whereas I may not approve of it, the market sometimes determines these issues. In addition, charging more during the special exemption period may deter some people from going out drinking during those periods. I am not making that illegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">I am drawing this matter to everyone's attention because I think some eagle-eyed lawyer will see it, anyway, and then claim that I got it wrong. We did not get it wrong, we did it deliberately.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_914">At present, some national sporting arenas are not properly provided for in respect of licensing. For example, Croke Park is not properly endowed with the capacity to have the sale of intoxicating liquor on its premises. It could try to bend the club rules in some way or establish a club. If it did so and then a convention, a meeting or whatever took place on the premises, the club rules are really being abused in an attempt to cover the use of some of the facilities on the campus for intoxicating liquor. As a result of representations I received, I agreed to come forward with a proposal with regard to these venues.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">The terms of the licence are restrictive and do not cater for hospitality offered in conjunction with non-sporting events. At present, in respect of other places, the conditions attaching to licences are often inappropriate and this makes compliance with an enforcement of the licensing laws very difficult. This situation compares unfavourably with the licensing arrangements for racecourses, greyhound tracks, national cultural institutions and the National Concert Hall.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The amendment that I am proposing would allow limited and controlled sale of alcohol, at both sporting and non-sporting events, in designated areas of national sporting arenas and would regularise the licensing positions of these arenas. Moreover, many national sporting arenas find it difficult to generate sufficient income from sporting events alone to cover the cost of their operation. Increasingly, such facilities are being used for non-sporting events, such as conferences, exhibitions or seminars to support the operation of the arenas.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">This amendment, which has been agreed with the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, would allow him to designate by means of a regulation, certain national sporting arenas. Such designated venues may then apply to the Minister for a certificate which would enable them to secure a licence for the sale and consumption of intoxicating liquor in designated areas on the premises. I am satisfied that the managers of the national sporting arenas will ensure that a responsible approach is adopted towards the sale and consumption of alcohol on their premises and that the facility which is currently being proposed will augment the enjoyable use of these venues for the benefit of the public and participants at functions in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">The phrase used is "national sporting arenas", and it does not refer to every club throughout the country. In respect of the designated areas, it is the intention that under no circumstances will the swilling of beer on stands at events be allowed. This is designed to be confined to after-match events, hospitality during events or whatever. The provision will not allow masses of fans to stand around with plastic beakers full of beer, as is the case in some countries. I do not believe it would be appropriate for us to go down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">I apologise that this is being introduced so belatedly. I also apologise for my own apparent unfamiliarity with my speaking notes. As far as I am concerned, this is worthwhile. If I do not take action now, I will not get around to doing so until well into next year. That would cause difficulties for, among others, the Gaelic Athletic Association, an organisation that I am anxious to facilitate. The GAA made an honourable approach to us in this regard and I think we are meeting them honourably and generously in response.</p>

          <p eId="para_920">All I can think about is drink at the Bertie Bowl.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">This is a sensible amendment. In terms of a practical approach, it is unique in that it is the only part of the Bill which opens up access to alcohol. To that extent, I thoroughly support it. I also believe that national stadia need to be able to provide this type of facility. We are talking about arenas, for example, Croke Park, which are under the control of national organisations such as the GAA. It would be odd if such a superb structure and facility as Croke Park was not able to provide a full service in this area. I fully support and endorse the Minister's words on this part of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">This is a positive approach and I do not believe there will by any objections to it. It does what we were discussing earlier, namely, it focuses on an item of law relating to clubs and similar organisations which has been twisted in every direction. The Minister has inserted the necessary wording to tidy it up and make it operable in a way that is open, transparent and responsible.</p>

          <p eId="para_923">I will not say very much more because Senator O'Toole has outlined the position well. There has been huge investment in sporting arenas. I hope that further investment will be made in the not too distant future. It is appropriate that they should have all the commercial underpinning necessary to make them viable. If one goes to places such as Old Trafford and sees the way it has been developed to provide facilities at different times and functions, it shows that the overall use of such a facility, which is a huge capital investment, is well underpinned. We should aspire to have those type of facilities here. The organisations that displayed courage in making investments should be supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">It was totally unacceptable that, in the past, small sports clubs in rural areas were governed by the same rules as designated national sporting arenas. The Minister is to be commended for recognising this anomaly and correcting it.</p>

I may be mischievous in suggesting that it also might be an indication of flexibility on the part of the Progressive Democrats, our partners in Government, towards provision of a national stadium, which the Minister should appreciate is definitely needed. I hope the Minister will see that it is provided. Such a facility is needed and the sporting organisations, fans and everyone else want it. I hope the Minister has as much flexibility in that regard as he has shown in not only this but in many other instances.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_927">Yes. As the Minister referred to national stadia, as distinct from national stadiums, one assumes that this law will apply to anything that will come on stream in the future. Notwithstanding the Minister's reference to designated areas within stadia and the fact that we would naturally expect those applying for certificates to be as honourable in discharging their obligations as the Minister will be in certifying them, I hope that in a stadium with a capacity of 80,000 – I refer to Croke Park – the designated areas will be adequate and plentiful and that there will not be a mass of people entering specific areas wherein will occur the kind of behaviour the Minister does not wish to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">Most sports events are family affairs. I am not in favour of the culture of drinking or accepting the fact that because everybody else is selling alcohol, a national sports body should have to do so in order to survive. Unfortunately, this would be reminiscent of King Canute. The reality is as the Minister has outlined. I hope and have no doubt that he will adopt a sensible, logical position, rather than a moral one, to the issue of young people being faced with the sale of alcoholic drinks in national sports stadia and during live music concerts – I am not referring to conferences or seminars. Any Senator who has had occasion to attend live music concerts will know that there is no question about the fact that there is a drink culture associated with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The city was festooned by Heineken to encourage people to go to the European rugby cup final in Dublin and I do not think anybody batted an eyelid. Unfortunately, the GAA is constantly pilloried about its sponsorship by drinks companies, which implies that there is a double standard. I know that the Minister will discharge his duties more than adequately in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">Subsection (7) affords the Minister the opportunity to ensure that, once he has granted an organisation a licence under section 21, the regulations will be carried out to the letter of the law and we will not have tokenism associated with costs or economies. As I said, Croke Park has a capacity of 80,000. If one goes to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, one will find that it, too, has plenty of resources and that there is no need to push or shove therein. I bring my children there and they do not feel they are exposed to the drink culture because of the manner in which intoxicating liquor is sold. Croke Park has a responsibility to young people to discharge its responsibilities under the law. I feel very strongly about this matter – it is the only one I raised in respect of this Bill – and hope the Minister will derive some sense from what I am suggesting.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">I, too, welcome this amendment. However, I am not sure that I fully understand how its provisions will work. Given that drink is already served at all matches in Croke Park, what difference will the amendment make?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_466" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_932">Croke Park is a registered club to which one is admitted as a guest. This situation could continue quite happily but if it was decided to hold events in the stadium that had nothing to do with the club or the playing of Gaelic games, as was the case in respect of a function associated with the EU Presidency, it would be over-stretching the rules to pretend that the club was having a function if the Government was hosting foreign Heads of State. I attended a trade mark and patent agents dinner in the club facilities of Croke Park, which are fantastic. This is fairly near the edge of what is legally permissible – I am not suggesting it was unlawful but remember thinking that it was odd that a sports club was hosting a semi-commercial activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">I fully accept the comments of Senator Mooney. It caused me to gulp when this amendment was put before me as an idea. One might ask if I am now in the business of identifying sport with drink. I am not because what happens at sports events in Croke Park is covered by the club. The amendment will allow the GAA to achieve maximum use of its conference facility, host large seminars, management conferences, etc., and will not further the connection between sport and drink. I have spoken to the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to ensure this provision will not be used as the thin end of the wedge to have drink sold on the terraces and everybody swilling beer while watching events. That would be disastrous for Irish sport and should not be permitted in any circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Senator Terry raised the issue of drink and advertising. Media commentary and the control of advertising do not come under the remit of my Department, which is concerned with intoxicating liquor and licensed premises. However, because the Fine Gael Party has been quite emphatic on this subject, the point must be made that the issue must be tackled carefully. It is not just a matter of banning all advertising of alcoholic drinks. In the happy days of the 1950s, when I was growing up, we were subjected to Guinness advertisements, including the one that stated that "Guinness is good for you", and I do not believe they demolished or subverted our culture. The real problem does not lie in sponsorship of the Irish Oaks by Guinness, the Derby by Budweiser or the Rugby World Cup by Heineken because advertising of alcoholic drinks on television, aimed at young people and suggesting that it is cool to drink and that sexual prowess and social expertise are augmented by alcohol consumption, is far worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">One of the problems we now face is that we cannot control what is carried on Sky Television or UTV. RTÉ, for instance, has a policy of not advertising spirits but Irish whiskey is now being advertised on UK channels beamed into Ireland. Under EU law, we cannot unilaterally adopt measures that could affect the sale of drink between countries or simply say advertising of drinks should be prohibited in its entirety. Whatever we do has to be notified to the European Union and must also be subject to its controls. It is not that I am not mindful of this issue but it is not the responsibility of my Department to take steps in this regard – it is more a matter for the Department of Health and Children. It will not be easy and anybody who thinks it will is deluding himself or herself. It is more complex than making a black and white decision that there should be no advertising.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">I wish to make an amendment, with the consent of the House. In section 25(2) "Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism" is repeated but it is unnecessary because "Minister" is already defined as such in section 21(1).</p>

          <p eId="para_939">I commend the Minister on subsection (1)(<i>a</i>) which prohibits promotions on a licensee's premises. I have seen extraordinary promotions, for example, for rum with bonny girls leaping around the place, which must have cost a fortune. Therefore, they must be well worth doing. I have a question about the subsection because at this hour of the night I can ask Senator Quinn for double Superclub points for having my wits about me. I realise the Minister has to bring forward regulations regarding this matter. Senator Quinn has pointed out to me and the Minister that there would be a great cost and a great deal of labour involved in affixing particulars to all containers of intoxicating liquor sold for consumption off licensed premises. In order that I can report back, has the Minister had any further thoughts on the matter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_470" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. M. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_940">Yes. I met Senator Quinn on Friday afternoon when he was donating a horse to the Garda Síochána in Ballinteer and discussed this matter with him. The same issue that arose in relation to the transport of goods between countries applies to the European dimension to this also. I have a problem, perhaps, in relation to this. Again, I had to take the regulation route because I did not want to go the notification route to the European Union. I have come to the conclusion that the previous law, which was never commenced because people began to worry about its practicality, was a very blunt instrument and that in some circumstances it might be possible, for example, in the case of sealed boxes of wine, champagne and brandy, to rip them open, stamp them and affix labels to them. That would be ridiculous and utterly futile if the aim was to stop under age drinking. The two issues would be totally unrelated.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">I have repealed the section which never commenced and I am replacing it with an enabling section which allows the Department to generate proposals effective by regulation to require the marking of alcohol sold for consumption off the premises. I have raised in the other House and mentioned here some of the difficulties in relation to this matter. Would one label every bottle in a six pack? How would one get to the bottles in the middle of the six pack? Would one rip open every bubble wrapped tray of drink and affix labels to every bottle and would one have to put them back together again to sell as one unit? Would one open every box of wine and affix stickers on each bottle? We have to ask ourselves whether this would be practical. If there is a practical way, I will bring forward regulations to achieve that end. I do not want the off-licence trade to be subjected to a crude obligation which was valueless compared to the disproportionate cost of implementing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Senator Henry can tell Senator Quinn, in getting her double Superclub points, that what we have decided to do is recast the existing mandatory provision which was never commenced with an enabling provision based on regulations which will be tailor made to the issue and only be made if practicality determines they will be of some benefit to the community.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">This is the amendment I withdrew on Committee Stage. I still have concerns about a drunken person who has got his or her skull full. Given our reputation abroad, stag parties are advertised here because one can get so drunk. That is the culture.

Society expects more than this because not only did the person get drunk but he or she also probably has a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The value of fines was explained very vividly by Senator Bohan who said that while publicans should be fined €10,000 or €20,000, the pub should not be closed down. For the person involved the same should apply. Where I would like to see the legislation take a stand is on the question that people in casualty departments should be encouraged to look at the fact that they may have a serious problem. What I have proposed in my amendment is pretty mild because one cannot force people to do much. I hope the Minister can accept it. Because the Bill will receive a great deal of publicity I would like to have it included to deal with those who, on occasion, are so seriously drunk that they are convicted for second and subsequent offences.

I have already acted on foot of the amendment, through my officials, to see whether we can direct the District Court towards putting people in touch with counselling and treatment centres in these kinds of offences. I am not sure, however, that this should be done in a licensing law context. I am not sure it should not be a general rule of the District Court that it should be done and that it should be done in relation to one offence only under the licensing code when there are many others to which it could also apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">While I am not accepting the amendment, I am grateful to the Senator for raising the matter. It is an important point which will have to be dealt with, either in the context of general public order legislation, the revised licensing Bill next year or future legislation dealing with the sentencing powers of the District Court. I have no doubt the Senator will remind me if I do not deal with it in any of those contexts.</p>

The unfortunate thing about this legislation is that it does not tackle the cause of what is a serious problem. I took seriously what Senator Mooney said about our corrosive culture. The Minister spoke about advertisements. There was, for example, the "Guinness is good for you" advertisement which depicted a man carrying a horse whereas now we have seductive advertising. I hope the notion of referral will not be pursued too far into the future and that an effort will be made to recommend it. Casualty departments try to insist that the people involved see someone about their problem. It would also be helpful if the District Court was enabled, under legislation, to refer people for help.</p>

I will keep at the Minister to try to get people to associate their drunkenness with the problem of alcohol abuse. Whether we want to describe alcoholism as a disease or a serious social problem, I do not mind. Whichever it is, we must try to tackle the issue as it is costing us a fortune.</p>

          <p eId="para_958">I thank the Minister, his officials and everyone who participated in the debate. Between 5 p.m. and 9.30 p.m. there were seldom less than 15 Members in the House. It was an expression of good will that everybody who spoke was so enthusiastic. The Minister's enthusiasm was unbridled, except that unbridled has a sort of raunchy association not quite appropriate in present circumstances. There is no doubt it was wonderful for us to have had such a good intimate debate on such an important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">I thank the staff of the House, in particular. Members of the Dáil have long gone home but the staff here are working away. It has been well worthwhile having the Minister here as he gives real value.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">I thank the Chair. I thank the Minister and his officials who have put a lot of time and work into this excellent Bill. We might be happier if he could accommodate us in some areas but all in all this is a good Bill with which the people I represent should be reasonably happy. I thank the Minister for meeting the representations we made at times when he was extremely busy.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. M. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_962">I thank Members for their kindness, good humour and generosity of spirit throughout the passage of this legislation. I thank the Cathaoirleach and officials of the Houses of the Oireachtas for facilitating the late sitting and all the efforts made to ensure the legislation was passed before the summer recess. It could have fallen casualty to the huge queue of legislation. It is important that the message goes out now rather than later. Nothing would have been gained by delaying the legislation until the autumn but a lot would have been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">I pay tribute to the officials in my Department who turned the Bill round so quickly. Gordon Holmes's commission reported in March and all the policy issues had to be teased out in April and May. As Senators can see, some of them in regard to hotels, hotel bars and the happy hour etc. required immense amounts of detailed thought. There were times when I thought that the idea of a compulsory age card could not be made work because of some of the issues that arose. My officials put huge ingenuity and skill into drafting the legislation. I was a hard taskmaster in asking that it be done so rapidly. I am grateful to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">I thank those involved in the Commission on Liquor Licensing, Gordon Holmes and the members of the commission and the others involved. The commission gave rise to this legislation. The full fruits of its labour will only be seen next year. The officials responsible for this legislation also played a large role in the functioning of the commission. An enormous amount of hard work was done behind the scenes.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">I am happy to confirm that the general rule of law that nobody is responsible criminally for the acts of another does not apply to licensees. I direct Members to page 104 and succeeding pages of <i>Liquor Licensing Law of Ireland</i> by James Woods, third edition, which set out at great length that, unfortunately, licensees are liable for the acts of their servants or agents acting within the scope of their employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_966">I thank Members of the House for what has been a rewarding and valuable experience. I fully appreciate that the law is a tiny fraction of the solutions that are available to us in relation to all the issues regarding drink and youth culture. However, I am equally clear that if we did not enact this law, the people would ask us what we were doing about the issue. Whereas it is not the entirety of the solution, or even the majority of it, it is a valuable piece of work and I am deeply grateful to this House for all the efforts Members have put into making it much better.</p>
