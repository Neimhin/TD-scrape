          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The Leader is well aware that last week the Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, Ms Emily O'Reilly, reported on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act since new charges were levied by the Government last year. The use of the Act by ordinary people who want ordinary information from the Government about the various decision making processes at the heart of Government has reduced by approximately 75%. This scandalous reduction is a direct result of the new charges the Government imposed on the use of the Act by ordinary citizens. Will the Leader agree to an amendment to the Order of Business to enable debate immediately on the conclusion of the Order of Business of No. 21, motion No. 2, in the name of the Fine Gael Party, which proposes to annul the charges introduced last year by the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The Government made a commitment when the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 was before the House that the Act would be reviewed independently by the Ombudsman and the Government would take due cognisance of the findings of the Ombudsman's report. It is clear that the amendment of the Act has been a disaster and ordinary people cannot obtain information. The House would do the country and the freedom of information process a great service by debating this matter this afternoon. I formally propose the amendment to the Order of Business.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">I take this opportunity to place on record my appreciation of the work of two members of the outgoing Government, if I may call it that. We may still have a Government but we do not know who is in charge of it. If we knew who was speaking on behalf of whom, the position could be explained to us. It is very difficult for the ordinary citizen to know who is speaking on behalf of Government.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_20">It sounds like a Minister bored his wife into submission by forcing her to listen to a speech and then swore he had delivered it somewhere to an election worker. It would be useful if the Government created a sense of stability and reality so that we know where we are.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">However, I appreciate the extraordinary work done by the Irish Presidency, led by the Taoiseach, over the past number of months and, particularly, in the past week. It is a remarkable tribute to and reflection of the work done by the Taoiseach, his civil servants and other staff. It also reflects well on the country. Nobody should begrudge this praise. The Taoiseach should seriously consider the position of President of the European Commission. I absolutely agree with Senator Brian Hayes that the appointment of an Irish person to that role would be good for all us in boosting morale and our standing in Europe. It could be an important step in providing people with a greater understanding of what is done by the Commission and it could demonstrate to the new member states that they do not need to have large economies to have influence within the EU. The appointment of an Irish person, in this case the Taoiseach, would be good in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The House should acknowledge the work done in the absence of the Taoiseach by the Minister for Finance in negotiations with the social partners over the past number of weeks. Whatever about moving to the right or the left, the Minister has demonstrated his capacity to deal with trade unions, voluntary bodies and the other social partners to put together a deal that will provide stability, certainty and ensure economic progress and development over the next number of years. I thank the Minister for doing so. It also gives the lie to comments of Members who say he cannot deal with trade unions. As a former president of ICTU, I assure them I have never had a difficulty dealing with him.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">We have had our differences but it is a measure of the man that one can have an argument with him and then move on to do business. That is the nature of good politics. It is about everybody sharing their views and finding a way forward; it is not about everybody agreeing. The Minister for Finance deserves credit. Senator Ross praised him highly and will agree his delivery of a new national agreement was the pinnacle of his achievements.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_26">The freedom of information issue is an example of <i>déjà vu</i>. The comments by Senator Brian Hayes reflect comments made by others previously. We knew this would happen. The points he made are absolutely correct. The Government should admit it got it wrong and review the amending legislation to return the pendulum to its previous position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_27">I happily second the proposal by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003. However, it is a mistake to state the legislation is not working as the Government intended. It filleted the Act and inhibited people applying to bodies outside Government control by imposing a charge of €150 per application to the Information Commissioner. Ireland is the only country in the commissioner's study that charges a fee of that scale while it is only one of two countries that even charges a fee. Our fee of €150 is ten times greater than the other charge while appeals to information commissioners in the other countries examined in the study are free. The Government made a decision to inhibit people making appeals which decision relates to freedom of information, not administrative inconvenience or cost. When the programme for Government was being negotiated in 1992, the one sticking point was Fianna Fáil's refusal to agree to a freedom of information Bill and we know why.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">It is true.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I am surprised at myself, as I regard myself as something of a Euro-critic, but this enthusiasm for an Irish person to be President of the European Commission irrespective of his political views astonishes me. I have no desire to have someone made President of the Commission who is an advocate of brutal competition for everybody else but who has managed to avoid the unpleasantness of competition for himself in every job to which he has been appointed. I would like the Taoiseach to be President of the Commission. I know what the Taoiseach stands for and I know he understands what competition does to ordinary people. To suggest that someone who has wreaked depredation on the developing world with his enthusiasm for free trade and the World Trade Organisation would be appropriate to preside over the one island of civilisation in an increasingly brutal world, namely the European Union, seems to be carrying national enthusiasm too far. I would not be particularly keen on that individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">Driving here today I heard the radio news and yet again was embarrassed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. A Pakistani doctor who has lived here for ten years described how his elderly parents were refused a visitors' visa to come here for the birth of their grandchild because the Department suspected they would sneak in, stay here and steal some national resource. I do not know the mind of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform but it embarrasses us every time something like this occurs. I wish we could have a transparent, accessible visa policy, where people did not have to make telephone calls at the convenience of a couple of officials in a Department which seems to believe that the best way to deal with all foreigners is to ignore them for as long as possible.</p>

It is good that we can fulfil the message and mission statement of Europe and that a country of our size can play such a role in bringing the whole Union forward.

We are all aware of the skills and talents of the Taoiseach and though sometimes we might regret them in a political sense, he would do a great job. All the European leaders accept that and we know it at home.

It is remarkable that the Irish Presidency got such a compliment from Mr. Chirac that it was the best Presidency he could remember. That type of statement is unusual at that level. It would be good if the Taoiseach took up the job. I am not being ironic but it would be a sacrifice for him because I believe he genuinely loves the job he is doing in this country, that he is at home among his own people and that he would find it a strain. It would, however, be to the general advantage of Ireland. Senator Ryan said somebody suggested Mr. Sutherland. I think Mr. Sutherland suggested himself.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">What is the state of progress of the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004 which is with the Dáil? There is some concern about it because it gives such <i>carte blanche</i> to the Minister. I ask this in light of the deteriorating situation in regard to conservation. I understand Dublin, the capital city, does not have a senior conservation officer. There is this terrible business in Sleigh Head where an enormous neolithic monument was arbitrarily destroyed over night. I raised the matter of Sweny’s chemist shop which people visited in their droves over the Bloomsday period and which is around the corner from the House. Yet again, it is being left open to the winds and is being burned. This is north side planning permission — owners leave buildings to become derelict and they encourage fires. This has happened with the same owner in the Academy Cinema which used to be the ancient concert rooms. When will we have some clear action?</p>
          <p eId="para_64">We should have a debate on the extraordinary growth in bureaucracy. A recent "Liveline" radio programme by Joe Duffy disclosed that people were being asked for their PPS numbers in order to buy prize bonds. Recently, when I wanted to renew my parking disc, I had to send in my driving licence and insurance, but they also wanted a copy of an electricity or gas bill. I sent them a telephone bill but that was not good enough, so they told me they would like to see my bank account. I do not see why anyone should have to surrender details of his or her bank account.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">I recently got a new Vodafone line from the same company to which I had already paid bills, yet it wanted to see a telephone bill. A representative rang me seeking this information and I said: "You know where I am living. You have telephoned me, so just look in the telephone book — that is the address." I do not understand why people are entitled to ask for personal details such as bank statements. It is all wrong.</p>

Local authority representatives, including county councillors, are faced with increasingly challenging situations in the planning process. We must start in this House by dismantling An Bord Pleanála because it is an unaccountable, opaque structure. People sitting on the board of An Bord Pleanála are out of touch with rural areas, including the west. They are not in tune with small-scale commercial planning or one-off housing. We should dismantle the board and start again rather than carrying out reviews or debating the issue. It will be our biggest challenge.

          <p eId="para_100">I ask the Leader to seriously consider the review of the Garda Síochána by the implementation steering group published in recent weeks. There has been some focus on this because of the attention given to the number of Garda stations that may be closed and the centralisation of the Garda Síochána. It would be useful to have an early debate on the review. The reason it comes to mind is that one of the difficulties for the Garda Síochána is that it is snowed under with requests from employers for references for prospective employees who have had a history of crime or, more seriously, abuse of children and other sexual misbehaviour. Today, a senior police officer in Britain was suspended because it appears the behaviour of the British police in regard to the murder of the two children in Soham was not effective. I would like to ensure we in Ireland are able to provide the service to our prospective employers. A suggestion was made some time ago, which I reported here, that it is not out of the question that employers should have to pay for this service. If the Garda is being snowed under, it may be necessary for employers to pay for this useful service but that should not, however, apply to schools, hospitals and State organisations. What happened in Britain was a disgrace.</p>

I joint with them in congratulating the Government, employers and trade unions on reaching agreement on a pay deal without consulting a single Member of this or the other House. It is quite an achievement and it should be acknowledged. If they want to bypass democracy, that is something about which we should be concerned and perhaps debate here. We should have a debate on pay deals here before they are agreed rather than after they are agreed. We should ask why concessions have been made on the tax band in the next budget already, a long time before that occurs, without consultation with this House and how on earth issues such as Aer Rianta got to the top of the agenda in a pay deal. Aer Rianta has absolutely nothing to do with a pay deal. This tells us who is writing the agenda for the other issues which concern this nation, rather than the pay deal.

Every party and many other Members reflected on it. It was a wonderful achievement. The hard work paid off. The nature and character of the Taoiseach had a huge effect on it. He was supremely suited for the difficult role of trying to bring the representatives of 25 countries with him, a task that would have tested anybody's endurance, but the Taoiseach came through it with great dash. I will convey the views of the House to him.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">Senator Brian Hayes proposed, and Senator Ryan seconded the proposal, that we debate the change in the freedom of information regulations as the fee is inhibiting people from making requests under the FOI legislation. Senator Ryan questioned whether we were carrying our national enthusiasm for an Irish person too far in terms of whether we were prepared to propose somebody who was very much involved in the global debate and the marketing ploys behind it.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">The Senator also raised a question on the policy regarding visas. The public has raised with Members examples of aberrations in the visa policy. I do not know if there is a policy as it seems to be hit and miss. I too have a case where a visa was not granted to a mother and father wishing to visit their daughter who is married with a family and settled in Athlone. They only want to visit her and her family and have no desire to stay in Ireland. We could put forward this issue for debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">The Bill will come before the Seanad before the recess. I understand operational control will not transfer until April 2005. The Bill, as published, is what was in the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. This was to give the three airports operational control, although they are still linked to the parent board. The second stage would be another step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Senator Coghlan must have experienced a thrill when he noticed the housing Bill he tabled had reached Committee Stage, without knowing how it happened. The Cathaoirleach said it was an error and it will be rectified.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Senator Leyden raised the issue of smokers standing outside to smoke. He was not taking the publicans' point of view but that of the citizens who must stand outside. This is a health issue. If people's health is better served by the ban on smoking, it is a good deed. However, one sees groups of people outdoors, which is acceptable at this time of year when the day is bright until 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. Will they don their hats and coats in winter? Perhaps they will stay at home, as Senator Quinn said, referring to the upsurge in sales at off-licence outlets. People are bringing their wine or whatever home to drink it there.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Senator Norris also congratulated the Taoiseach on achieving agreement on the EU constitutional treaty. President Chirac's statement that this was the best Presidency he could remember was amazing given that the French think they are wonderful, the best in the world and can run everything. We will discuss the National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004 on Thursday, 1 July. I hope Senator Norris will be here to contribute to that debate to talk about the sites being demolished.</p>

An Bord Pleanála is an independent body but occasionally it issues odd decisions which have no bearing on the inspectors' reports. That is where the difficulty arises. The board employs professionals who submit reports which it seems able to dismiss arbitrarily.</p>

People have a legitimate right to express their displeasure or distaste if they so wish. Nobody denies we have an affinity with the United States but that is a different matter from having an affinity with the President. I put my money where my mouth is last week when I was invited to dinner at the American Embassy. I turned down the invitation on the basis that I cannot object here to events in Guantanamo Bay and then go to dinner in the home of the American ambassador.

I hope it has proven satisfactory for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">The Senator also sought a debate on the recent Garda Síochána report, which would be worthwhile. The chief constables in England have got into difficulties in respect of what happened at Soham because of a failure to share certain data between the two police authorities concerned. We should consider how we might learn from what happened in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Senator Ross referred to the pay deal. In a letter to the Sub-committee on Seanad Reform, the Taoiseach suggested the Seanad would be a worthwhile forum in which to debate social partnership deals. I am aware that he is visiting Tokyo at present and that he is extremely busy. However, I wrote to him earlier today pointing out that he put forward this suggestion. However, such deals should be debated before, not after, they are agreed. The Government is part of the social partnership but such a far-reaching decision which affects everybody should be debated. The Senator also inquired as to why the issue of Aer Rianta was included in the deal and what it had to do with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">I looked at the debate in the other House, as the amendment was also tabled there. The authority has both a consumer protection and a prudential role. The problem with appointing somebody who represents a particular interest is that he or she represents that interest rather than having a more general role. I have listened to people involved in consumer protection over the years and some of them tend to be very strident and are primarily looking for publicity. It is probably better not to constrain the Minister's choice. Bearing in mind the core functions of the authority, he will be aware of the need to choose people from different backgrounds.

It is important to note that the board of the financial regulator is a public interest board. We are talking about the board of a regulator, not a board where one brings in representatives from different sectors. The board's responsibility as regulator is, in itself, to take a detached view of the business of financial regulation and for that reason the Minister does not consider it desirable to be prescriptive about the composition of the board in the manner suggested by the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The authority's consumer director is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board and the Minister is satisfied that the board has performed very well since its appointment in regard to consumer protection.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_207">The effect of the amendment would be to set the maximum fine that the regulator can impose as either €5,000,000 or a sum equal to the amount involved in the financial impropriety. That is the substance of the proposal. The fine is a punitive fine, not a restitutionary fine. The fine prescribed in legislation is what the Oireachtas marks as the just punishment for a particular wrongdoing. In that sense it is different from the issue of a sum equal to the amount involved in the financial impropriety. Section 33AQ(3) already provides that one of the sanctions the regulator can impose is a direction to refund or withhold all or part of an amount of money charged or paid by a financial institution. This legislation contains a provision that the regulator can require a refund in the case of an impropriety. At present there is no legislative power to do that and civil proceedings would require to be instituted in the courts to ensure the necessary recompense took place. This legislation will confer upon the regulator an express power to require a refund. That addresses to some extent the amendment raised by the Senator.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">From the point of view of a customer of a financial institution, this is the most important sanction the regulator can impose because it means the consumer is given direct financial compensation without the need to institute proceedings in the courts which may be expensive and protracted. One can easily envisage circumstances based on recent events where the cost to an institution of refunding its customers in respect of a charge incorrectly imposed could exceed in a significant way the figure of €5 million if inserted in the legislation. That is possible under this legislation once the regulator makes the necessary direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The question of €5 million is the amount which we propose the regulator can impose by way of exaction, irrespective of the element of wrongdoing. The Minister has power under paragraph (4)(<i>c</i>) to increase this maximum fine if experience suggests it is desirable. In those circumstances, the Minister is of the opinion that €5 million is a very substantial sanction, especially if it is in addition to an order to refund customers and to pay some or all of the costs of the regulator’s investigation. If experience suggests that the limit of €5 million should be increased, the Bill gives the Minister a simple mechanism to do so. I hope I have addressed the legitimate concerns raised by the Senator.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_217">I accept that Senator Cummins raises a very interesting and difficult question. However, it is not as simple or straightforward as the Senator understandably outlined. The amendment seeks to require the regulatory authority to publicly justify a decision not to investigate or to discontinue an investigation of an alleged contravention. It addresses a concern expressed also during the debate in the other House that the regulatory authority will not use its new powers of sanction in a robust fashion for fear of damaging the reputation of a financial institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">The key arguments against what the Senator has proposed are that the Government's policy aim is to make institutions comply with their obligations, not to punish or publicly reprimand them for contravention. The whole thrust of this legislation is to encourage a much greater culture of compliance.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_220">It is not there at present but the purpose of this legislation is to produce it. That fits in with the Government's general policy in recent years which is to raise the standard of corporate behaviour in business generally, particularly in the case of financial institutions who are entrusted with other people's money. The progress report published last week by the authority confirms that is the approach it is adopting in dealings with financial institutions, focusing on the probity of senior management and the adequacy of compliance arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">The crucial point is the authority has to encourage a co-operative rather than an adversarial approach in this area. We need the financial institutions to be forthcoming with the regulator when they have breached their legal obligations, rather than having them adopt an unduly defensive approach. The regulator must be focused on remedying any wrong that may have been done to customers and putting systems in place to ensure that such behaviour is unlikely to occur. In those circumstances it is important that the regulator has available a discretionary power which would not exist were the Senator's amendment passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">For example, if a financial institution commits a minor breach by some error and immediately notifies the regulator when it discovers the error, there is a case for the regulator to consider requiring the institution to make good any loss to its customers and perhaps pay a fine, but without requiring the institution to go through a drawn-out public process. This might be the case particularly if the institution had a good record of compliance. On the other hand, if the institution had a bad record of compliance or there had been a more serious breach, it might be more appropriate for the regulator to use the formal public inquiry procedure involving the right to legal representation and the further rights of appeal to the appeals tribunal and the High Court. Even when the regulator uses its discretion to act under those sections, it is obliged to publish an annual summary of its actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">It is important that the authority has these discretionary powers not to hold formal investigations and to reach agreements with institutions without necessarily requiring an admission of fault. That allows the regulator to have a carefully calibrated response in the particular circumstances of an alleged contravention, taking into account the seriousness of the contravention and the compliance record of the institution concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">I do not believe the public would accept such an explanation. The public has a right to know in such situations. In most cases, the financial institutions are putting their hands up when they have been found out. It is like putting the cart before the horse because very few institutions have put their hands up without first being found out and informed of the errors and mistakes made. I do not think it would be in the public interest for the public not to be informed.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">As I stated on Second Stage, this legislation effectively deals with two commercial sectors. It deals with customer banks but also with international financial services who are mostly not dealing with Irish customers. It is essential that we retain some flexibility and discretion in regulation. If we become too rigid, we will discourage very valuable international investment in this country. The amendment is based on almost a certain sort of distrust of the authority. If such authorities are established, they must be given a certain amount of discretion, flexibility and trust if they are to perform to their best.</p>

The amendment does not take into account paragraph 57BB(<i>d</i>), for which I forgive him because the legislation is sequenced in a very difficult manner.

The new paragraph states that one of the objects in the Part of the Bill in question is “to improve public understanding of issues related to complaints against regulated financial service providers and related consumer protection matters.” The ombudsman has, therefore, specific obligations under other sections of this Part to publish information on her or his activities and to advise the authority on steps it might take to address persistent patterns of complaint and to improve the manner in which financial institutions deal with a complaint.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_237">The idea of an ombudsman council arose from the public consultation process on the Bill. The existing voluntary ombudsman schemes both have such councils and there has been no objection to the principle of such a council. The council will play an important role in setting out detailed regulations governing the ombudsman scheme and appointing the ombudsman. The Minister's intention is that there should be a broad balance between representatives of the financial services industry and consumer representatives and that the chairperson should have knowledge and experience of consumer issues. Given its central role, the Minister believes it is important the council should have the confidence of consumers and the financial services industry and the provisions for appointment are drafted accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The amendment seeks to introduce an additional requirement that a majority of the council members should be persons independent of ties to business engaged in the provision of financial services. The Bill provides that the Minister must consult his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. In addition, he would expect to consult widely among consumer and industry bodies before making appointments to the council. It is, therefore, likely that the council, in its composition, will be broadly acceptable to industry and consumer interests and that is certainly the Minister's intention.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">It could be difficult for representatives of consumer interests to meet the test that they be independent of ties to business engaged in financial services. After all, in the vindication of the consumer interest the poacher can often be the best gamekeeper. A person with knowledge, experience and connections to financial services who is independent and detached from particular interests can be the best person to vindicate the consumers' point of view. This matter occasioned considerable debate but that is the Minister's view of the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">I am conscious the Acting Chairman probably has a particular interest in the amendment. The Government has a long-standing policy of State boards in principle having at least 40% of members of each gender. That is, however, a policy statement as opposed to a legal requirement. In the interests of flexibility, particularly in this area, I would hesitate to impose a legal requirement of this nature because it would introduce a strong element of inflexibility. This does not alter the fact that in I am in general terms supportive of Government policy in this regard or that more needs to be done to fulfil it across the board.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_246">As Senators are aware, it is Government policy to seek to have a minimum of 40% of State boards made up of members of each gender. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to achieve this objective given the pool of persons available to serve on particular boards, which varies between sectors. While I accept that criticism can be levelled at the Government in that in some sectors in which there is a degree of availability, the target has not always been reached, financial services is a particularly difficult sector. The current Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland board has one female member while the ten person IFSRA board has two female members.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">In general, the Minister's view is that while he will try to ensure adequate representation of both genders on boards for which he is the appointing Minister, he cannot accept the prescriptive approach suggested by these amendments, given the many other factors he must take into account when making appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The Senator has raised an important issue, of which I have been very conscious as Minister of State. I have endeavoured in my office to have equality of representation but in my limited experience as Minister of State I have found that any prescription on the appointment of a board can lead to more difficulties than the Legislature envisages.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">As regards the appointment of boards, I accept that for a long time the criticism has been voiced that where Ministers are left with wide discretion the wrong people tend to be appointed or persons who should not be appointed are slipped in. The difficulty is that when one writes limitations into law, one narrows dramatically the capacity to appoint good persons to boards. While the Government has a stated policy in this area, it is undesirable to fetter Ministers too much in legislation. The most important issue in this regard is that they must ultimately be responsible for their appointments.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">The suggestion that members of the financial services ombudsman council and the panels should be selected by a process of open recruitment is not in accordance with general practice, which is that a Minister makes such appointments following appropriate consultation. There is no reason to depart from the general practice for these appointments, particularly given the requirements in the legislation, which limit ministerial discretion. The Minister looked into the feasibility of publicly inviting expressions of interest in the council and the panels. He was unable to guarantee that the names of persons which were put forward but which were not selected would not have to be published because of the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. This severely limits the usefulness of a public advertising approach.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_262">Amendment No. 10 relates to section 16(3)(<i>a</i>), which the Minister introduced in the Dáil to address concerns in this area. The subsection addresses the points raised in Senator John Paul Phelan’s amendments, without trespassing on the jurisdiction of the courts. The new subsection provides that where a financial institution acts in bad faith by commencing legal proceedings to frustrate the actions of the ombudsman, he or she can still deal with the complaint. This provision goes as far as we reasonably can, without risking a legal challenge on the constitutional prerogatives of the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">The Bill states a consumer is not entitled to make a complaint if the conduct complained of has been the subject of legal proceedings. If a financial institution takes court proceedings to recover an amount allegedly due from a customer, there is nothing in the subsection to suggest this should prevent the customer from complaining to the financial services ombudsman that, for example, the institution had mis-sold the financial product concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The spirit of the Senator's amendment is that it is important that legal proceedings cannot be used by financial institutions to prevent, delay or hinder the ombudsman from carrying out his or her duties. The Minister made an amendment, which went as far as he felt he could go constitutionally to address that concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">Amendment No. 11 relates to dispute resolution and credit unions which have made reasonable efforts to use fully the dispute resolution options available to a consumer as a member of the union. This is an important issue for the credit union movement. Section 57BX(1)(<i>c</i>) lays down a general principle that before the ombudsman can consider a complaint, the consumer must have given the financial service provider concerned a reasonable opportunity to deal with it, as should be the case. The aim is that the financial service provider should avoid causes for complaint and, where complaints are made, make an effort to deal with them in a way that is satisfactory to its customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">I expect the ombudsman council to further define what is meant by "reasonable efforts". It will want to ensure reasonable time limits are set for an institution's internal review of a complaint so that their is no undue delay from the consumer's point of view in having an unresolved complaint dealt with by the ombudsman. The same general principle applies to all financial service providers, including credit unions. I reiterate the assurance I gave in the other House that credit unions fall fully within the protection of section 57BX(6) and they are entitled to insist their members should exhaust their internal complaint procedures before recourse can be had to the ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Unlike other financial institutions, considerable detailed provisions are in place for credit unions and they have been advanced in this respect. The financial services ombudsman will always have the right to review the regulations to ensure they are satisfactory but an arrangement is in place with credit unions and, subject to a review by the ombudsman, it will meet the requirements of the legislation. I give that assurance to the credit union movement. Every effort will be made to settle a dispute internally. If a consumer is not happy with the way a credit union has dealt with a complaint, he or she should have the same right as the customers of other financial institutions to have it addressed by the ombudsman within a reasonable period.</p>

I have no doubt that consumer organisations will support the appointment of persons with direct experience of consumer protection but, to be of most use to the authorities as a sounding board for consumer interests, it is very important that others with a contribution to make in this area should also be on the board. Here the Minister has in mind persons involved in consumer education and advocacy, including those who write on the subject.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">This amendment is based on a misunderstanding. The regulatory authority is structured as a constituent part of the bank and the consumer director is a member of the regulatory authority. Section 33C of the principal Act makes it clear that it is the regulatory authority which has the function of ensuring compliance by finance institutions with their obligations under financial services legislation. It will therefore be the regulatory authority, not the bank, which will exercise the powers conferred by this Part regarding compliance statements. There is nothing to prevent the authority from giving the consumer director the authority to act in its name under this Part.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">On the second amendment, section 27A already empowers the authority not only to issue guidelines on compliance statements but also more general guidelines on the governance of financial institutions. All such guidelines must be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>. It is very likely that the authority will wish to develop and publish such guidelines to supplement the guidance and corporate governance that have already been issued using existing powers. It would not be helpful to be too prescriptive about the content of such guidelines since the compliance statement requirement is discretionary.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">It is important that any such guidelines take account of the particular features of financial institutions and the Minister does not believe we should tie the hands of the authority in this area.</p>

This amendment would limit the application of this provision to subsection (3) only, which deals with the duty of an auditor to report to the regulator in certain circumstances. The Minister is satisfied that the duty to report should extend to the entire section, including, for example, section 7, which also imposes a duty on the auditor to report to the regulator.</p>

Under the provisions of section 27, the bank may require an auditor or an affiliate of the auditor to provide it with a copy of any record relating to work carried out for the service provider that is in the possession of the auditor or the affiliate. The Minister is satisfied that the thrust and provisions of this part make it clear that the regulator will only use the powers being provided when there is an express need to do so. Adding the qualifier "and that is reasonably required by the Bank for a specific purpose" would unnecessarily create the potential for obstructive behaviour by auditors.</p>

The amendments may have been put forward in view of an omission in the Bill, as published, which meant that the right of appeal in regard to the revocation of an intermediaries' authorisation was inadvertently eliminated. The representative body for intermediaries pointed out this error in the Bill, as published, namely, that there was no appeals mechanism. On Committee Stage, the Minister signalled his intention to repair this omission on Report Stage, which he has now done. The omission was corrected in the Dáil as approved by the insertion of section 12A on page 128. There is an appeals procedure which is a new procedure by way of appeal to the appeals tribunal established under the legislation and not the former system of a direct application to the court, as provided for in the Senator's amendment.</p>

The Director of Consumer Affairs originally indicated that the practice of using mortgage introducers, namely, persons who, though not authorised as mortgage intermediaries in their own right, introduce clients to authorised intermediaries in return for a commission, was on the increase and that the lack of regulation gave scope for abuse. With the establishment of the regulatory authority, this became a matter for it rather than for the Director of Consumer Affairs.

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_336">I thank the Cathaoirleach for selecting this matter for debate on the Adjournment, and I also thank the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, for attending the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, should indicate his willingness to upgrade Portiuncula Hospital to the status of a general hospital by utilising funds from the sale by the Western Health Board of property at St. Bridget's Hospital, Ballinasloe. Following improvements in the Western Health Board's psychiatric services, the facilities at St. Bridget's Hospital, Ballinasloe, are surplus to requirements in many cases. This is due to the change from an institutionalised service to a community-based service, which has been welcomed by all involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Minister and the Western Health Board should ringfence funds accruing to the Department and the health board from the sale of property at St. Bridget's Hospital for the development of Portiuncula Hospital, Ballinasloe. The latter hospital should be upgraded from its current status to that of a general hospital, similar to Castlebar Hospital, which is also within that health board's area.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">An outline development plan was put in place at Portiuncula by the hospital's management prior to the purchase of the hospital by the Western Health Board some years ago. This was done in consultation with the health board and all parties signed off on how the project would be developed into the future. This would involve an increase in bed capacity from the current 206 to approximately 340 beds, which is the number required for the development of all areas of speciality services currently provided at the hospital, namely cardiac, maternity, accident and emergency and geriatric care.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Portiuncula Hospital cannot develop further due to a lack of facilities. As with all other hospitals, the accident and emergency unit is under severe pressure due to the increasing numbers presenting for treatment on an ongoing basis. The hospital's speciality services cannot expand due to physical constraints as well as the need for additional medical, nursing and support staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">Portiuncula Hospital requires capital investment to provide the additional infrastructure to support speciality services, such as the rehab, laboratory and x-ray units. The newest accommodation in many of these areas dates from the mid-1980s. It will be difficult to cater for the current demand for services at the hospital without upgrading it. Many support services are provided in makeshift accommodation, so the hospital requires proper facilities to allow for expansion.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The Minister should indicate that funding accruing from the sale of property at St. Bridget's Hospital will be ringfenced to provide for such facilities at Portiuncula Hospital. The health board and the Minister have already indicated that a modern psychiatric unit will be provided at Portiuncula, partly due to the sale of property at St. Bridget's. I am requesting the Minister to use all the funds from the sale of the remainder of the property at St. Bridget's to upgrade Portiuncula to a general hospital.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_343">I welcome the opportunity to respond to Senator Ulick Burke's desire to secure the future of Portiuncula Hospital. I want to place on record my commitment to ensuring the future of Portiuncula Hospital as part of an integrated network of hospitals, providing the highest quality treatment and care for patients. That is the starting point of any discussion on its future status. We have heard many times about downgrading or closure——</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_345">——but I ask the Senator to ensure the message concerning my commitment to the future of Portiuncula Hospital is heard loud and clear in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The Senator raises the question of transferring resources from the sale of St. Bridget's Hospital, Ballinasloe, to benefit solely Portiuncula Hospital. My personal view is that proceeds of the sale of such assets, including land, should first be invested in the care programme in the immediate area to which the lands belong. This will ensure we do not allow gaps in services. After the initial investment in the immediate requirements, improvements and upgrades for any other priority care programme services will also be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">In this instance the Western Health Board is the service provider in the area to which the Senator has referred and it will prioritise the identified needs. The health board has agreed in principle to sell St. Bridget's Hospital and lands, with the proviso that the proceeds of the sale are utilised for the development of mental health services in east Galway. As Senator Ulick Burke quite rightly said, the board has plans for the development of an acute psychiatric unit at Portiuncula Hospital, a high support unit, a continuing care facility, a community nursing unit for the elderly mentally ill, and some community residences.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I want to see the moneys that may come in being used for the proposed services. Rather than using the word "ringfenced", we should examine how the service provider in the region intends to upgrade the required services in consultation with the Department of Health and Children. I would like to see reinvestment in the provision of services in the immediate area. How the service provider will prioritise and decide that is, in the first instance, a matter for the health board. I have no doubt the service provider would be interested in hearing from Senator Ulick Burke on how he considers the money generated should be utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">As Senator Ulick Burke is aware, I visited the community nursing unit for the elderly mentally ill and some community residences and wholeheartedly support this type of development. It will be of tremendous benefit to the quality of life of the patients who require such services.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">In regard to the motion, I am confident the future of Portiuncula Hospital is secure as a vital element of health care provision in the region. I hope my comments have been helpful to the Senator.</p>

        <heading>Deposit Interest Retention Tax.</heading>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_184">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I thank the Minster of State for coming before the House to take this important Adjournment matter regarding DIRT on court invested awards for injured minors. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that taking money from young children under any guise is reprehensible and doubly so when they are injured, vulnerable and in need of care and long-term medical treatment. The situation that has lead to the imposition of DIRT on the interest of moneys invested by the courts on behalf of minors who have been awarded compensation for injury is, I am sure, an oversight and not the deliberate action of anyone in the Department of Finance. However, as stealth taxes go this has to be one of the most shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The days of cruelly pushing children up chimneys and down mines to make a few pence are long gone but this oversight is leading to a situation in which money is still being made from the suffering of young children. Actions for compensation of minors are taken on their behalf by parents or guardians but those parents have no control over any ensuing compensatory award. These moneys are invested on the child's behalf under the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act 1958 and the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Order 1958. Part 4 chapter 4 of the Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the levying of deposit interest retention tax on certain interest paid or credited on deposits held with all financial institutions. The situation <i>vis-à-vis</i> injured minors does not appear to have been considered under exemptions except in cases of total incapacity and it is such an exemption I urge the Minister for Finance to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Parents have no rights as to where or on what terms their child's money is invested and I am sure that almost 100% of them are unaware that the interest gained is subject to DIRT. It would appear the State, acting on behalf of these children, does not have their best interests at heart. Rather than investing this money where it is liable to DIRT, it could avoid any tax by investing the money entrusted to its care in alternative areas such as An Post savings certificates which are tax-free. However, of course there is no benefit to the Exchequer in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">DIRT tax was introduced to close a loophole whereby people failed to disclose interest on deposit accounts where that interest was under £50, spreading their money over several accounts to evade liability. DIRT is now deducted from everyone with a deposit account, including children. At concept stage, I am sure this tax was never intended to cover interest accruing to injured minors but, more importantly, neither was an exemption considered in the case of children relying on court awards and interest gained, to access necessary treatment. These compensatory awards are hard fought for and ensue as a direct consequence of the injury suffered by the child. In the majority of the cases, care is ongoing, sometimes over a lifetime.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Despite the common awareness that interest is currently extremely low, can the Minister of State imagine the shock when families discover that most of this meagre interest gain has been considerably eroded by tax? We do not countenance child labour of any nature, but surely making money on the backs of interest awarded to a young child is open to question. Normally, children would not have a significant deposit interest income and therefore DIRT would not be applied. However, the possibility that injured children could have such income has been overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">It is interesting to note that while in replies to parliamentary questions the Minister for Finance has stated there is no automatic entitlement to minors or a refund of DIRT, even where their income is under the relevant thresholds for income tax purposes, I have a letter from the accounts section of Dublin District Court which states that "if a minor or guardian wishes to reclaim DIRT, they are directed to the Revenue Commissioners." The letter also states the court, "will provide certificates of interest on request." It is extraordinary that a court accounts section should be unaware of the requirements, but they too would not believe a Government could inflict such hardship on children. Nonetheless, a reply from the Revenue Commissioners to a request for a refund on a form 54D sets the record straight, saying that to be exempt from tax one must be more than 65 years old. Given that it would be difficult to find a child fitting into this category, it is imperative that this oversight in the existing regulations be amended as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Injury to children knows no boundaries. It is spread across a broad social and income spectrum. Whether parents can afford it, they are forced to make up any shortfall to meet the cost of necessary treatment. It is up to the Government to take this opportunity to lessen that burden and, in the interest of fairness and compassion, extend the boundaries of exemption in relation to DIRT to all injured children. I would appreciate a favourable response.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#IvorCallely" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_358">I thank Senator Bannon for raising this important and interesting question. I apologise on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, who attempted to come to the House but was called to the Lower House for a division.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Minister for Finance has been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Part 8 chapter 4 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for the levying of deposit interest retention tax on certain interest paid or credited on deposits held with banks, building societies and certain other financial institutions. Subject to certain statutory exceptions, financial institutions are required to deduct the tax from interest paid or credited in respect of the income on deposit. In the case of individuals, entitlement to repayment of DIRT deducted is limited to situations where he or she or his or her spouse is either aged 65 years or over at any time during the tax year or permanently incapacitated by reason of mental or physical infirmity from maintaining himself or herself, or became so incapacitated at any time during the tax year; and the income of the individuals, inclusive of the deposit interest, is below the appropriate income exemption limit for tax purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">Partial refund may be due to such individuals whose income, inclusive of the deposit interest, does not greatly exceed the appropriate income exemption limit. There is no automatic entitlement to minors for a refund of DIRT even where their income is under the relevant income thresholds for tax purposes. The Senator raised this issue in a compassionate manner. DIRT does not apply to people who are incapacitated or people over 65 years of age.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">In addition to the foregoing as regards awards in respect of personal injuries, section 189 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that certain income arising to individuals including minors, including deposit interest, from the investment of compensation payment awarded by the courts or under an out of court settlement in respect of a personal injuries claim is exempt from tax. However, the following conditions apply to this exemption. As a result of personal injuries the individual must be permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental or physical injury from maintaining himself or herself and the income from the investment of the compensation award must be the sole or main income of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Accordingly, a minor who as a result of personal injuries is permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental and physical injury from maintaining himself or herself has a statutory entitlement to repayment of deposit interest retention tax deducted from the investment of compensation awarded where his or her income is below the income threshold for tax purposes. However, a minor who as a result of personal injuries is not permanently and totally incapacitated by reason of mental and physical injury from maintaining himself or herself does not have a statutory entitlement to repayment of DIRT from the investment of compensation awarded, even where his or her income is below the income threshold for tax purposes. My understanding is that DIRT is applied on a wide basis and there are very few repayments. I understand the Minister for Finance has no plans at present to extend the present DIRT repayment rules to cover the cases referred to by the Senator. I am sorry the news is not more favourable. Perhaps Senator Bannon would look at the qualifying criteria and if somebody has received a compensation award due to personal injury and is permanently and totally incapacitated he or she should qualify. I hope this is helpful.</p>
