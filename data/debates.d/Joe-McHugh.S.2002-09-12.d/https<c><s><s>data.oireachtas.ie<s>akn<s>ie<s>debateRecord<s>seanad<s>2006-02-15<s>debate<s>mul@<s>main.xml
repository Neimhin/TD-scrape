          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator Tuffy that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to give an update on the situation of a person aged 66 to 70 years, in receipt of an old age contributory pension, with one adult dependant, namely, their spouse, who in October 2005 qualified for a medical card but who is now over the medical card income guidelines because of the increased rate in the old age contributory pension and the increased payment for qualified adult dependant under budget 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide an update with regard to funding for community employment staff on whom the Irish Wheelchair Association relies for the provision of care, driving and other core and essential services, in its resource and outreach centres at 62 locations nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_6">The Order of Business is No. 1, statements on planning and related issues (resumed), to be taken on the conclusion of the Order of Business and to conclude not later than 5 p.m.; and No. 22, motion 25, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m. As regards No. 1, Senators will have ten minutes each and may share time. Notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, Members who contributed previously to the debate may contribute again, that is up to a Senator's party whip. The Minister shall be called on to reply not later than ten minutes before the conclusion of the statements. If it seems that Senators who wish to contribute to the debate will not be able to because of time constraints, the Minister will not reply because the debate will be resumed. We will monitor the situation as the debate progresses. It seems from the interest in this matter that we may need to resume the debate another day, in which case the Minister will not reply today.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_15">Last night's "Prime Time" programme on the Stardust disaster cast serious doubt on the findings of the tribunal of investigation by Mr. Justice Keane 23 years ago. Would the Leader agree that a way forward must be found, in terms of ensuring that new evidence is brought to bear in this appalling case but also to reopen the matter to bring closure for the families of the victims concerned? Last night's "Prime Time" programme has shown public broadcasting in a very positive light and I congratulate the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">The way in which the State has treated these families over the past 25 years has been appalling. They have had to persuade the State, kicking and screaming, as a means of bringing closure to this issue. We must find a way forward at this stage, whether by way of a parliamentary investigation, a commission of inquiry or the work of a senior counsel to look at the new evidence. However, closure must be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I would ask the Leader of the House to consult with the Government to find out what its current position is on this matter and to consult with other group leaders on this issue. This is not just an issue for the Government, given that the tribunal was established on an all-party basis some 25 years ago. In fairness to those involved, I would ask the Government to make a statement at the earliest possible time on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">It shows the worst possible taste and it is the most insensitive decision possible for a planning authority to grant a public licence to a premises on that site some 25 years later. I cannot understand that decision which permits a pub to be re-established at that location.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_13">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_20">Most people in the country were horrified when that decision was taken. I would ask that that decision be examined.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I must support the points made by Senator Brian Hayes. The Stardust fire has caught the public imagination again after 25 years. I am not sure whether an inquiry will bring closure but it is a positive idea which I support. It has been put to the Taoiseach several times that he should meet formally with the survivors and their families. He should make it clear that he will do so. The connection between people suffering such a trauma and political leaders is important and should not be difficult to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I understood the fire services and the number of fire officers and all operators in that area had increased exponentially in the 25 years since the Stardust inquiry. I now hear there has been no improvement in the services. It would be helpful if the Leader invited the appropriate Minister to outline to the House what has been changed. This is not a political football. Both sides of the House are equally concerned about the issue. Let us hear what has been done in the meantime so that we can answer people who tell us there has been no improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">I have also been told that we are no better prepared for dealing with a similar significant emergency. I find that hard to believe but would like the facts to be put before the House. Those are the issues that people have raised with me over recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Why was such an insensitive decision made in regard to the licensed premises on the site? Wherever a major tragedy rocks a community the sequel is a need for sensitivity towards, and understanding of, the people who are suffering. As Senator Brian Hayes said this was in the worst possible taste. It is appalling and whoever is in a position to object should do so, even at this late stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">I support the idea of using the 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising in 1916 to discuss important issues but wonder what the Government plans as a commemoration on the day. The Army is entitled to be involved in the commemoration. Whatever we do after 90 years, however, should reflect what has happened in Ireland during that time, and the Ireland of today. It should not be confined to a military demonstration or march. That is precisely what would detract from a good idea because the event has a wider significance. The commemoration should be open and reflect modern Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenOMeara" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_26">I understand the Taoiseach is preparing to meet the families of the Stardust victims. I hope that is the case and that it will happen soon. The Taoiseach is to meet them not simply on his own behalf but as leader of the country, and therefore on behalf of all of us, which is appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">It is also necessary to find some mechanism to bring closure to the families of the victims. I recall hearing about the Stardust fire when I was in university and being shocked. The recent television programme about it was stark and upsetting. We must take into account that families continue to live with the impact of the event. I propose that the Leader suggest to the Taoiseach a review of all the Garda files in the case by senior counsel or a judge. This would be short of a tribunal but could include consultation with experts. It is disturbing to hear, as "Prime Time" revealed, that some experts dispute the original findings. It is important to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">It occurred to me when watching the programme that the awful event yielded some positive outcomes as halls around the country closed. There was an overnight awareness of the importance of knowing the location of fire exits, of safety and of the role of the fire officer. While it is disturbing to find the number of fire safety officers in Dublin is the same now as in 1981, there is a raised consciousness of the issue of safety, particularly in public places and where young people gather. The recent programmes are very fine examples of public service broadcasting at its best. If one needed an example of a good reason to invest in public service broadcasting, that was it, without doubt.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Meara</from>
          <p eId="para_30">I congratulate RTE in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the report in the media today on early school leaving and the finding that poorly qualified students are either unemployed or underemployed. In the context of the current economic situation it is shocking to find that the high early school leaving rate is the same as it was 20 years ago. It is clear this problem is not being tackled and it behoves us to examine how this can be done. The Government has not invested in pre-school education which is the one measure that would have an impact and make a difference. Pre-school education investment in disadvantaged areas has been shown to make a difference in that regard. This issue is related to the Private Members' motion which will be debated today. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the report as soon as possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoryKiely" as="#Cathaoirleach" eId="spk_18">
          <from>An Cathaoirleach</from>
          <p eId="para_32">There is a long-standing precedent in this House that latitude be allowed to the group leaders. I remind Senators that while the time for the Order of Business has been extended by ten minutes, the purpose was to accommodate everyone who wishes to speak and not to over-elaborate on the reasons for raising a matter on the Order of Business. I ask Senators to be brief.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AnnOrmonde" eId="spk_19">
          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I also wish to reiterate the points made by the leaders of the Opposition parties that the Stardust inquiry be revisited. The programme was very disturbing viewing. I watched the documentary on Sunday and Monday night. I recall the event because our party was in the middle of an Ard-Fheis which was cancelled when the horrific news broke. I welcome the Taoiseach's comments that he is sensitive to this issue and intends to meet the victims and the families concerned. I know the Leader will convey the views of this House regarding that awful tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">With reference to the ESRI report, it is quite disturbing that a percentage of young students have not completed the leaving certificate programme and are not finding employment. I question the role of FÁS and its ability to link up with the Department and with local schools to find out how best to help students who are not progressing to third level education so that they can be given an opportunity of attending proper courses to help them get into the world of work. This issue is the concern of both the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and it calls for a debate in the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_35">In November 2001, the cost of the Dublin Port tunnel was estimated at €448 million and it is now projected that it will cost €1.3 billion. It is very worrying that information from video cameras printed in a tabloid newspaper today shows that hundreds of gallons of water is going into that tunnel. It has been stated that the thickness of the tunnel wall is only one tenth of what it should be. Dublin City Council officials issued a reassurance last December that the leaks had been rectified. This news today is very worrying. In order to allay concerns and to give us the true, unvarnished situation regarding the port tunnel, I ask that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, come to the House to inform us of the position, to allay the concerns that exist and to give an indication of when the tunnel will be opening.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaschalMooney" eId="spk_21">

          <p eId="para_36">I endorse all that has been said about the Stardust tragedy and, in particular, I echo the remarks of Senator O'Meara about the two RTE programmes. At a time when public service broadcasting is coming under yet another round of criticism this was a perfect example of why we should continue to support such broadcasting.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">I wish to draw the attention of the Leader of the House to recent remarks by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at an RTE symposium on public service broadcasting. I have to confess that the remarks were received with some concern because, after all, the Minister is responsible for maintaining law and order in the State. I have enormous respect and admiration for Deputy McDowell but his comments last week, which were widely reported, must be seen in the context of the forthcoming broadcasting Bill, the heads of which are currently under discussion. The Bill should be published before the Easter recess and, therefore, I ask the Leader to ensure it will come before this House to allow for a measured debate not only on the legislation but also on public service broadcasting generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I am also seeking a debate on the outcome of the elections in Palestine, including the occupied territories. The debate should include the impact of Hamas on wider regional issues, namely, the relationship between the European Union and Palestine and Israel, as well as the relationship between Ireland and Palestine as a result of the elections. This House has a long tradition of holding good debates on Middle East matters, so I ask the Leader to arrange for such a debate in the next few weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_39">I support my colleagues who have called for a further discussion on the tragic Stardust situation and I also support their compliments to RTE. I did not see the entire programme but I saw some of it. From what I saw, it seemed to me that they were talking not so much about new evidence but a new interpretation of evidence and the unearthing of the fact that certain evidence was missing at the time, which is very puzzling. That evidence included a list of items that were contained in a store room where the fire may have started, and the fact that electrical short-circuits were reported from that location.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">That information was not referred to at the original tribunal, although it seems to have been crucial. We have further work to do in that regard. We owe it to the bereaved families and to the memory of those who were killed, to do so. It does not surprise me, however, that Mr. Butterly got his licence. I have never known a licence to be refused. We could re-examine how the licensing laws operate with regard to these facilities.</p>

If my opinion is not respected, at least his will be. The letter stated that the Department’s quota system enabled it to limit the annual catch of wild salmon in line with scientific advice on conservation requirements, a responsibility it has failed to discharge. Dr.Whitaker said that if this is not done it will lead to the extinction of our salmon stocks.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I join Senators O'Meara and Ormonde in requesting an early debate on the annual ESRI survey on school leavers. It is a frightening indictment of Government inactivity in this area that 68% of the students who leave school without a qualification are without a job one year later, at a time when we have a booming economy. For students who leave with a junior certificate, the jobless figure after one year is reduced to 28% or 30%, and when they leave with a leaving certificate, the figure falls to 15%.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">Those are frightening statistics. Some 18% of second-level students drop out. Approximately 1,000 students per annum fail the transition between primary and second level. As the Leader is aware, the root of that lies with the failure to appoint educational welfare officers. We were supposed to have a minimum of 330 such officers throughout the country but currently have only some 69 or 70. Each of those officers must deal with in the region of 185 cases. It is time for the Minister for Education and Science and the Government to respond to the situation so that drop-outs and the disadvantaged are dealt with in a meaningful way and can look forward to some future.</p>

I agree with Senator O'Toole that there were many different aspects to the coverage. The one which got to me most, and broke my heart, involved the parents in four or five families, the bodies of whose loved ones could not be identified and remain unidentified. One poor couple spoke of having to visit four or five different graves because they do not know where their son or daughter is buried.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">We are talking of children aged 16, 17 or 18. One does not have to be a parent to feel these parents' anguish, loss and terrible heartbreak. Will the Leader write to the relevant Minister, perhaps the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and ask him to consider the request by those four or five families to have the bodies exhumed? There was no DNA testing 25 years ago. However, now that we are living in an age when DNA testing is common practice, those four or five families could be given final closure by having headstones for the graves. They have no headstones, only numbers. It would be important to have the headstones.</p>

On the political response to the issues raised by the documentary, we should examine, 25 years on from the event, the ways in which the parliamentary process can ease the pain of the families involved. What can be done should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on policing? It is an issue of ongoing importance. A number of matters are of significant concern for many people around the country, particularly regarding Garda stations in rural areas and the intention of the Minister to start selling some of them to raise revenue for the Department. This is worrying in an urban area and does not augur well for policing in rural areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">With regard to car insurance, there is strong evidence to suggest that many cars on our roads come from backyard operators and a number of car auctions are not insured. Garages insure each of their cars. A debate in the House a year or two ago concentrated on a very serious accident involving a car bought in one of the above locations. Lives were lost. We must all insure our cars. Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline to the House his proposals on what will be done to stamp out this practice?</p>

I do not know what and I am unsure whether this House is the place to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The situation has changed in 25 years. Reference was made yesterday to the fact that forensic techniques have developed, such as Senator Feeney's comments on DNA. Therefore, we can determine more about the cause of this disaster and the action taken at the time. Whether it is an opening of the investigation or something to attempt to bring closure to help those families, it is a part of what we are trying to achieve. However, our major task is to ensure that nothing similar ever happens again. Those of us who knew and know those people and their families know their hearts are not only looking to the past but also to the future. They want to ensure nothing like this happens again. I am not sure we have taken sufficient steps so I support those who call for action.</p>

I suggest we invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House to ask how many prosecutions for breaches of fire safety have occurred since the Stardust tragedy. I refer in particular to nightclubs, pubs and hotels in regard to which I suspect there have been very few. Will the Leader ask the Minister to indicate how many inspections of these premises have taken place while fully occupied? I have never seen a fire officer in the middle of 2,000 people in a nightclub to see how they would react in the case of a fire. From being involved in a fire in a school, I am aware basic mistakes can be made in this situation. We all think we would react correctly but this may not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">A fire occurred in Enniscorthy recently and when the fire services went to the scene they discovered the water pressure at the fire hydrants was not sufficient to treat the fire. We should have a debate on fire safety to discover if we have learned anything from the Stardust tragedy and if premises frequented by thousands of people are being monitored. I hope we never have a repeat of such a tragedy.</p>

We cannot allow the continued importation of beef from Argentina and Brazil when there is evidence of outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in those countries. We have an extremely restrictive system in Ireland and I do not see why those countries should be allowed to export to the EU while getting away with having an extremely lax control system.

          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_106">I welcome the call for a debate on early school leavers. It is also important to point out that the statistics produced by the ESRI are not startling. We are well aware that people leave school early and it will always be an issue. In Donegal during the 1980s and 1990s young girls left school at the age of 16 because of the attraction of earning money at Fruit of the Loom in Buncrana. The fact that people will leave school early was acknowledged by the National Economic and Social Forum and cited in the document it produced this month. It is important to read that document.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">People will leave school early to enter vulnerable job sectors, such as manufacturing, where they exist. The critical point to make is that it is necessary to improve the education and talents of those people while they are in the vulnerable job market. Today's reality is that early school leavers, predominantly young males, leave school early to enter the vulnerable job market in the construction sector. What we should do——</p>

In Donegal, FÁS came in to upskill people after Unifi and Fruit of Loom closed down. At that stage the horse had bolted and it was too late. Upskilling should be done when people are in the vulnerable job sector, such as when these young men are in the construction sector.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Rourke</from>
          <p eId="para_115">Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition, raised the issue of the Stardust, which is on everyone's lips and in everyone's hearts over the past number of days, particularly since the weekend. It was heartbreaking to view the programmes on RTE and consider the young boys and girls who went out with their hair slicked back and full of life and joy to have a good night, but who never returned. It is a story that has stayed in people's minds because of the enormity and horror involved. Last night I watched the simple people talking about their children, the hurt still so evident in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Senator Hayes asked whether there is a way to re-open the case. The Taoiseach said if there is new evidence, he would be in favour of doing that. The Senator also asked for closure. I agree with Senator O'Toole in that it must be asked how could one ever find closure in one's heart having lost one's children in such an horrific way, but I take the Senator's point.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">I listened carefully to what the Taoiseach said yesterday on this issue because I knew it would come up today. He and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be willing to meet people if the debate can be intensified and if new technology and new ways of looking at things are available. Surely after 25 years, matters have changed and there is some way to do that. However, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform are open to meeting people concerned and to looking at the case again if there is new evidence. Senator Brian Hayes also said the planning authority had granted a licence for a pub on the same site. I could not believe people would be so crass as to seek such a licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Senator O'Toole was right to seek a debate on the fire service. I cannot believe that with the increase in the population, the size of the service has remained the same. We should have a debate on it and get the facts. The Senator asked if we could get detail on what the Government plans for the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. Perhaps the Taoiseach might come to the House to speak about it. That would be useful and I will endeavour to arrange that.</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Senator O'Meara called for a review of all the material on the Stardust fire. That is interesting because I listened to her party leader yesterday and this morning in the other House and that is what he put forward. It sounded sensible because it echoed something the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said, that is, rather than hold another tribunal, we should look at the material in another way. The Senator commended RTE for its programmes on the matter, something with which I concur. RTE performed a wonderful feat of public sector broadcasting.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">Senator O'Meara also referred to the report on early school leavers, which I had marked out. We should have a debate on that issue. She also talked about the pivotal role of pre-school education and that it can have an ongoing, long-term effect on education for young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_121">Senator Ormonde raised the issues of the Stardust fire and the ERSI report. She highlighted the role of FÁS interlinking with industry and keeping a tab on early school leavers and perhaps trying to forestall them from leaving. Even if, as Senator McHugh said, they are not going to jobs in manufacturing, there are many worthwhile courses on which they get a training allowance at the end of the week. I suppose many of them say they are not too interested in geometry, geography or whatever and that perhaps they will attend such courses to get the training allowance. There are many issues in what I am sure is a complex matter but we will seek to debate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_122">Senator Finance raised the issue of the Dublin Port tunnel and requested that the Minister come to the House. We could do with some elucidation on that point. The situation seems to be going from bad to worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Senator Mooney referred to the recent remarks by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at the RTE lecture in UCD, which I found interesting. The Minister is charged with the debate on the media and legislation. The Senator also called for a debate on Palestine.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Senator Norris raised the issue of the Stardust fire and the interpretation of the evidence. What has changed is the interpretation of the evidence 25 years ago and now. That would feed into the review of papers which have been amassed since then.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">The Senator also asked that the new Minister of State with responsibility for fisheries come to the House. I am sure he would like to do so and he will be welcome. Senator Norris also asked about the budget for the 1916 commemoration and from whence it will come. I understand it will come from the Department of the Taoiseach but I do not suppose it has been drawn up yet. We will, however, have a commemoration.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">Senator Jim Walsh raised the issue of public service broadcasting. He also requested a report on the role of the Judiciary. I will not use the word he used.</p>

There will always be those who hear the sound of distant drums and wish to escape the confines of a classroom. That is as old as time.</p>
          <p eId="para_132">Senator Feeney referred to the Stardust tragedy and the particularly poignant case of the four or five families who do not know where their children are buried. It is hard to imagine living with that for 25 years. Senator McCarthy called for RTE to be congratulated and I do so, as it did a fine job. He also requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come before the House to debate policing, which would be a good idea.</p>
          <p eId="para_133">Senator Glynn discussed the denuding of canals and small lakes of fish, with people fishing from both banks. The new Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, is returning to familiar territory in this respect. He has debated such issues in this House previously and I will ask him back. Senator Glynn also raised the issue of uninsured cars. On that subject, the cost of insurance has not fallen much this year. I do not know whether Members have noticed that although we were told it would fall dramatically, this has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_134">Senator Feighan asked for a debate on drugs. I refute the notion that the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, is an <i>à la carte</i> Minister.

Regardless of how such appointments come about, I have never found or heard of a judge who did not act completely independently and completely within his or her own judicial rights. We must rely on the independence of the Judiciary. It is our bulwark and is where we go to seek redress. Civilised countries, including Ireland, have good judiciaries. I have never encountered anything untoward and while we may disagree and shout and roar about a particular decision, by and large, that is the system. A judge's viewpoint of a particular case depends on the characteristics of that judge. However, in the operation of their duties, judges are independent.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnPaulPhelan" eId="spk_102">
          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_149">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to the House for this debate. It is some 18 months since I last spoke on this issue. I pride myself on my good memory but I had to jog it to recall what I said on the previous occasion. I wish to reiterate a number of the points I made then.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">It is time for the Government to give serious consideration to a review of the activities of An Bord Pleanála, with a particular view to securing its disbandment and the establishment of a number of regional planning boards. It is inappropriate that the same body is charged with administering planning and dealing with development issues in Dublin city centre, for example, an area with its own particular planning issues and problems, and also charged with overseeing planning in, for instance, south County Kilkenny. It would make for a much fairer and more balanced process if the Government were to enact legislation to provide for An Bord Pleanála to be broken up into sub-boards or regional boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">From a planning perspective, what infuriates most public representatives and members of the public is the inconsistencies still evident in planning decisions from different local authorities and even within the same local authority area. Although new rural planning guidelines have been published in the last several months, there is no evidence these inconsistencies have been eliminated. If we are to establish the confidence of the public in the planning process, the current levels of consistencies must not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Reference was made during the last debate on this issue that there is a strong tradition in this country of dispersed rural housing. It is the case in my own area. In the last several years, however, there seems to be growing emphasis from local authority planners and even within regional planning guidelines on a move away from that dispersed housing tradition. The reality is that the traditions of housing in Ireland are very different from those of most of our neighbours. We have the tradition of one-off rural houses scattered throughout the countryside; it is something that is embedded in our culture. One can travel to any part of the country and see any number of ruins of houses and houses in different stages of decay which show the tradition of the dispersed rural housing pattern. This is something that must be firmly reflected in whatever guidelines we establish in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Another controversial subject in the area of planning and development and one about which I receive numerous representations is the area of development charges. I have spoken on this issue before in the House. For the main part, particularly in rural areas where people get virtually no service for the charges paid, they are an entirely unfair and inequitable tax on those seeking to maintain their own home. It is one matter to impose development charges on new housing schemes and developments in towns, villages and cities where much needed public facilities and amenities are being provided, such as connections to a sewerage line, public water supply, public parks and other active recreational facilities. Some people living in rural Ireland, however, cannot even get the county council to repair their road, have no access to a public water supply and do not enjoy services to maintain footpaths and lighting. In these circumstances the charges are wholly unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Moreover, the charges vary wildly from one local authority area to another. In County Kilkenny, for example, they are substantially higher than those levied in County Carlow, which for electoral purposes is in the same constituency. This type of inconsistency and inequity leads to much anger among those who are trying to secure and maintain their own home. It is something that could usefully be examined by the Government in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">In regard to rural housing, I spoke also about the local need issue. The success of a person's application for planning permission in a rural area is often determined on the basis of whether he or she has a connection with the area and can trace some form of family link. It is vitally important that any rural area should be able to attract new people. People from outside the area who wish to build a house in a particular parish or village should not be prohibited from so doing. In many areas, however, including in large swathes of Kilkenny, this prohibition exists. This is not appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">I have always believed there is a consistent problem with regard to the interpretation that planning authorities put on development plans. I was a member of Kilkenny County Council when the latest county development plan was drawn up. I found that the interpretation put on the development plan was in marked contrast to the intentions of the councillors in drafting the plan. So many of the problems public representatives encounter in regard to planning relate to the difficulties arising from the incorrect interpretations often taken by officials of planning authorities in regard to the planning applications that come before them.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">It is significant that planning and development in many parts of the country is grossly hindered by the continuing lack of the provision of adequate public sewerage facilities in smaller towns and villages. In the village of Killmacow in County Kilkenny, located not far from Waterford city, the sewerage scheme has still not been constructed. It has been a political issue for the past 30 years but has never been resolved even though this is an area under significant development pressure. Far more resources must be invested into this scheme to ensure these small rural towns and villages will have adequate sewerage facilities into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">We are all aware of the ongoing debate about the nitrates directive and the quality of the water supply. Some of the greatest contributors to water problems are local authorities. There are countless villages and towns in which, often untreated, sewage is still pumped into rivers. That still happens throughout the country. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has an issue with the impact of the nitrates directive on agriculture. The Department needs to seriously examine the role played by local authorities in ensuring that the position whereby untreated sewage finds it way into our rivers is not allowed to continue into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">There is a discrepancy in the amount of grant awarded to people throughout the country who wish to connect to established group sewerage schemes. In Kilkenny the grant is approximately €1,200 or €1,300 per house. That figure should be reviewed and significantly increased because it is not commensurate with the cost of the provision of such facilities into the future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_103">
          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_160">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I also welcome the opportunity to return to this debate. We had a good debate last year on the planning guidelines on rural housing. We welcomed what the Minister said at the time about promoting and supporting a vibrant rural community. The guidelines on sustainable rural housing, published in March 2004, provided an opportunity to comment initially on the guidelines and to discuss relevant matters more fully with council members and management.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">I welcome the development that for the first time a Minister considered examining the question of exceptional health circumstances. Representations on this point were made by people in the disability area to the Minister, Deputy Roche. I understand that these guidelines have been adhered to by the local authorities. That issue of trying to facilitate emigrants who returned home to retire or for some other reason was also considered. Consideration of these issues was welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">I support a proposal put forward at that time to strengthen rural villages and small towns, but we need to strongly state the need to provide water and sewerage schemes, to which Senator John Paul Phelan referred. While I favour these guidelines applying to small towns and villages I note that work on the provision of 13 small water and sewerage schemes in the Galway County Council area which was due to commence last year has been postponed until the 2007 programme. If we continue to delay the provision of these schemes, we will have great difficulty in achieving the objective of strengthening rural villages and smaller towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The Minister announced prior to Christmas that any scheme costing under €5 million could proceed without reference to the Department, which was a welcome announcement. However, a difficulty with that development is that small schemes are part of a bundle of schemes the cost of which will exceed €5 million. If a small scheme is removed from a bundle of schemes, planning permission for the scheme will have to be obtained again. I would like to bring that difficulty to the attention of the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Galway County Council has been allocated €68 million this year for the provision of water and sewerage schemes. The allocation for next year will be €256 million, which will include provision for the small schemes. We need to check with the management of Galway County Council, Galway being one of our bigger counties and it having many water and sewerage schemes, whether it intends to proceed with the provision of small schemes the cost of which come under €5 million or whether they will be provided as stand-alone schemes as opposed to being part of a bundle of schemes. That is critical to the provision of houses in our small towns and villages.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">Many public representatives have raised the question of the provision of septic tanks and water and sewerage treatment for houses. A test known as the SR6 was used some years ago. It was a simple and effective test carried out in regard to the building of houses, particularly one-off housing. Now an EPA test from the Environmental Protection Agency is used. In some counties a small panel of people carry out this test, the cost of which adds to the cost of building a house in terms of the provision of a septic tank and a treatment area. This point should be taken up by the Minister. Perhaps he could ensure that more people are put on this panel. Is it not anti-competitive that only a small number of people in a county can carry out this specialised test? These are practical points that should be taken up.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">The Minister said he is trying to make the planning process more friendly for the applicant. He has put in place a facility for pre-planning meetings which are working out well in each local authority. A simple facility was provided by councillors in Galway, which I am sure is also provided in other county council areas, whereby a potential applicant could obtain prior notice of a proposed planning application if there were difficulties involved. That prior notice facility is no longer provided in County Galway. That decision was taken by the management and majority of the councillors in the county. I do not agree with it, however, because it is useful for a public representative to be informed of a difficulty. In that way the issues can be discussed with the agent and the applicant and can perhaps be resolved. I now note that many planning applications are withdrawn. Galway County Council is reported to have a planning permission record of 80% to 85% but that does not take into consideration the fact that many applications are withdrawn because people know they will be refused. Therefore, I do not agree with some of those figures, given that the facility to which I referred is no longer allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_167">I was pleased that the Minister produced and published the Building Control Bill. As the Minister said, it is a good day for the consumer that this Bill has been published. It will assure members of the public that architects, building surveyors and quantity surveyors are properly qualified, which is a welcome development. However, I return to the issue of people qualified to carry out work related to the building of a house, whether it is the person carrying out the EPA test or building work. We should be able to get answers to the question of making it easier for an applicant to get planning permission with the putting in place of these new controls. Under this Bill, new homes and businesses will be more energy efficient and better provision will be made for people with disabilities. However, I do not know if adequate staff are in place to implement this legislation. The Bill refers to the putting in place of stricter controls on fire protection. The question of fire protection is very much on our minds following the programmes on the Stardust tragedy of 25 years ago. There is also the question of the enforcement of building codes. The Minister of State might reply on whether sufficient staff are in place to deal with the enforcement of building codes and controls on fire protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">I want to take up the point mentioned by Senator John Paul Phelan about An Bord Pleanála. As he said, there are inconsistencies in its decisions but there are probably inconsistencies in decisions made by local authorities. We cannot say they are all producing a definite development plan or even that their decisions are in line with development plans. I would like the Minister to focus on the question of planning for amenity areas. In some parts of Galway, and I am sure the position is the same elsewhere throughout the country, some towns are suffering because of major development. There is considerable pressure involved in securing an amenity area. GAA clubs report they cannot get a second field and soccer and rugby clubs report that they cannot get an area for their members to train or play games. There is an idea that developers will be like Santa Claus or the fairy godmother and provide these facilities. That will not happen unless the county councils are pro-active and take a definite stand stating that their quite substantial development levies should go to provide sports facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">While there is a good system of sports grants and there are different aids from rural development groups and from local authorities, the biggest problem is in getting a sports field for a sporting body. If this position continues, with sports fields and clubs being located ever farther out of town and the people going up boithríns and bad roads to get to a field where sports can be played, it should be taken up pro-actively by the local authorities to ensure there is always enough land for sporting activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House. I am sure he will address some of these points and I hope we will have more opportunities to discuss planning issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_171">I also welcome the Minister of State to the House and I look forward to hearing his views. The most significant problem with planning is that nobody understands it. I have been listening here for the past 19 years to people from different local authorities around the country wondering why an application was refused. As long as that remains the case there will be doubt, there will be lack of trust and confidence and it will always be a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">The following are simple questions: How, why and on what conditions is a place designated a special area of conservation? How does one come to that conclusion? Who decides? What are the rules? What are the conditions? Perhaps there are rules and conditions. However, I do not know what they are and I do not know anybody else who knows them. It should surely be something that could be applied to an area about which there is no further doubt.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">How can An Bord Pleanála overturn a local authority planning decision if they are both working to the same national objectives? It should not happen. It turns logic on its head, unless somebody made a mistake. It reminds me of the health boards, where the Government created 11 independent republics all of which had their own rules and regulations. The Minister of State knew about that better than most. In many cases there was no uniformity of approach. It seems that county development plans should fit into a national plan of some description. In other words, there should be national guidelines which would then be implemented with plenty of local discretion as to how it would be done. At least then all concerned would see the direction in which it was going.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I speak from a disinterested point of view in that, unlike my colleagues, I do not deal with planning issues. Having driven around the country, I have asked planners why they insist on small windows in every house in rural Ireland. It is a simple question. Why is it that in many counties one cannot get planning permission for a house with large windows? One planner told me it was because of vernacular architecture. There is no vernacular architecture in this country. The only reason there are small windows in Irish houses is because there was once a tax on windows and if the house looked too attractive, the tenant was thrown out. All we are doing is continuing an age of repression.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I asked planners why they allow white houses in the middle of the countryside and they said they do so because white-washed houses are the vernacular. White-washed houses are in the Irish countryside because white wash was all we could afford at one time. It is the most incorrect colour to put in the countryside. Nothing jumps out of the countryside as much as a white house. They should not be allowed.</p>
          <p eId="para_176">The problem is that nobody is asking the questions or demanding explanations because we are not allowed to do so. If one starts getting edgy about these matters one is suddenly asked if one is interfering with the planning process and trying to bring political influence to bear. It is time we did exactly that. I would like to know that there was an understandable basis to decisions by An Bord Pleanála. I would also like to know that at least the Minister of State was happy that somebody in his Department looking at these matters would state that even though perhaps the Department did not like the decision, it could understand how it occurred, it fits into the general plan and we must live with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">A development charge must be a charge for something. I am completely in favour of the idea of such charges but I am not in favour of a rip-off. If somebody is paying a development charge we should all be fully aware of what he or she is getting in return. It should not be a case of one size fits all or of billing all those who seek planning permission. There must be something given in return. That is not much to ask and it is something we should look at.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I have previously asked a simple question, namely, why are hollow-block houses still being allowed in Dublin city? Everybody knows that this goes completely against the spirit of the recent European insulation directive. The directive does not apply in Ireland for another 18 months. I would like an explanation for that. Is it because it would create hardship for the building industry? The real impact of this delay falls on youngsters who are buying houses over the next 18 months and who will probably find themselves outside the remit of the planning regulations which will apply to everybody afterwards. When the houses in question are sold or disposed of in five, six or seven years' time we will see the error of our ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Since 1998 we have been aware of what would happen in terms of insulation guidelines. Recently I raised this with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, who told me I had nothing to worry about, but that is not the case. Almost 250,000 hollow-block houses have been built speculatively in Dublin since 1998 and this should not have happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">This does not happen outside of Dublin. People are more sensible in the country. Why is it being allowed in one place and not in the other? Is it because HomeBond is a self-regulated system, owned by the building and construction industry, which does not have the interests of the consumer or the State at heart?</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The Minister at one stage told me he had information on the level of insulation and heat loss in this country, and that we compare favourably with the best in Europe. He promised the relevant data to me but I did not receive it. In fairness, it slipped his mind. He gave a commitment, maybe not in the House but afterwards. Whereas the rest of Europe has a particular method of measuring insulation standards, I want to know why have we invented a brand new Irish solution to an Irish problem by developing something which I understand is called "heat loss through the roof", which is a different issue altogether. I seek reassurance in what we are doing in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Other areas of concern include the attitude of An Bord Pleanála to a national plan, the relationship between local authority development plans with the national plan, the way in which these matters interact and how we can gain a greater understanding of what is happening. As well as looking at insulation factors, we should also look at the question of energy, not just in terms of insulation but in the wider area to encourage people to develop new forms of energy. For example, is it acceptable to object and get rid of a proposal for a wind farm on the basis that it might upset the view of city dwellers when we go for a drive in the country? On the plus side, wind energy is silent and non-invasive but it occasionally spoils the view of the lovely landscape. Is it not worthwhile in order to achieve the gains? Is it not time we said this? Is it not time that people brought some moderation to the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I want there to be a debate on the issue of planning instead of listening on the one hand to zealots, who say we cannot build a house anywhere and, on the other hand, entrepreneurs, who want to build a house everywhere. The voice of ordinary people should intercede and moderate this debate, to make a decision and hold to it. Otherwise, we are on the road to nowhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">An Bord Pleanála should take the educational aspect of development on board when making decisions. It recently objected to an eco-friendly and environmentally sympathetic proposal for a development around Lough Key. I know every yard of the shoreline around Lough Key very well and it needs some development. There have always been a few big houses there but surely it is possible to develop it further.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Only when large developments are put in place can people be educated about what to look for and protect in an area. That was one reason why I supported the Burren interpretative centre which unfortunately was ruled out. I love the Burren and have walked its hills regularly but do not know enough about it. Every time I go there, however, I see well-meaning people damaging the area because they know no better. There is nobody to tell them about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I do not play golf but I cannot see how the development of a golf course poses a significant environmental threat unless it impacts on something fragile in the environment or an archaeological site which can be dealt with. I do not understand how there can ever be an objection to a marina which must be the most environmentally sympathetic type of development imaginable because it encourages people to love the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">We do not need an empty west of Ireland, or to hear people say we must not develop rural Ireland thereby depriving people in rural areas of realising their potential, so that those of us who live on the east coast can go back down and enjoy it all the better because there is nothing there. That is the way we are going. We need balance and moderation in planning. This discussion is worthwhile. I could speak for another hour on this topic and not say all I want to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">We have argued here about An Taisce. Much of what An Taisce has done in recent years has irritated me. While it should exist as an important part of a democracy it fails to win the trust and confidence of ordinary people as do the planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála and development proposals. We have much work to educate ourselves and other people as to what we are trying to do in the planning area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelBrennan" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Mr. Brennan</from>
          <p eId="para_189">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. In April 2005 we welcomed the Government's policy on rural housing and the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government outlined the draft proposals on rural housing development.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">Are the Minister and the Members of the Oireachtas satisfied that planning authorities are implementing these regulations consistently around the country? Are the planning authorities playing their crucial role in strengthening rural areas, towns and villages? Many counties have a surplus of up to €9 million in planning contributions after the first year of operating the regulations, which raises the question are planning authorities developing their areas to their best advantage?</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The national Water Services Investment Programme 2000-2007 is at its mid-point and the Minister has sanctioned many sewerage and water schemes throughout the country but implementation of many of those schemes at local level has fallen behind. If that was brought on stream and those problems addressed, the small towns and villages would have an opportunity for the development they need. If the funding available nationally was used for the major schemes small towns could use the local planning contributions wisely. The Minister should study how those funds can be used, even with matching funds because if they accumulate but are not used for the purpose for which they were collected it would leave much to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Are planning authorities playing their role in respect of water services? Treatment plants are being used under the planning regulations at a cost of €12,000 to €15,000 a year. Is the body charged with certifying waste water treatment systems a statutory body under the aegis of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government? Is the Minister of State happy that the certification and testing of the apparatus is consistent with the planning regulations? Many questions are being asked nationally about this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I watch with interest and welcome some of An Bord Pleanála's recent decisions in regard to rural housing. It has the flexibility of considering applications made in the first instance to the local authorities. Some of its decisions have been more favourable to people in rural Ireland than those of the local planning authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">Local authority members should realise their own power as planning authorities to make those regulations law. All county development plans were to be reviewed within a 12-month period but the councillors have the power to make it easier for people to apply in rural Ireland. It is hard to expect the Minister to legislate for all but he has given local authorities the power to take into consideration housing needs in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">Housing need is one of the most controversial items in the draft guidelines. It refers to a person's first house in an area to which he or she has returned. One's housing needs change over the course of a lifetime. A person born in a rural area who worked for 20 or 30 years outside the area will find it almost impossible to get planning permission for a house in that area given the way these regulations are being implemented in some areas. The Minister has given the local authorities some flexibility but the implementation of the regulations nationally should be considered soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I urge the Minister of State to see whether the programme for development of the sewerage schemes and the infrastructure in the counties is on stream and how they might be helped in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBannon" eId="spk_106">
          <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_197">I welcome the Minister of State to the House. While I welcome the opportunity to speak on planning issues, I regret that this is the only business of the House today. This House should be legislating on important issues, including planning and not simply making statements that have no binding influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">That said, there is much to be discussed on planning, an issue with which the Government has failed to get to grips in recent years. Its new mantra might be "thou shalt not build", given the shambles in the planning process. We want and expect to see from the Government a proposal to change the system and make a difference. Fine Gael wants to see a different planning system and an end to the back door, unofficial nod and wink planning that has been exposed through many tribunals. We want realistic sustainable development plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">The rural housing planning guidelines published by the Minister some time ago are welcome in that they provide for people to live in their own communities. They are, however, blinkered and fail to allow for the sustainable development that will enable those communities to thrive. It is heartening to see that after so many years, the Government has come around to the Fine Gael way of thinking and recognises that people should have the right to live in the areas where they were born and raised. Building a house on a family site is often the only way a young person or returning emigrant can put a roof over his or her head. Fine Gael, however, is disappointed that the guidelines do not provide the necessary environmental protection our countryside needs. Special areas of conservation should remain but an exception should be made for family members who reside in the area and provided there are no local objections.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Ribbon development is simply unsustainable and the guidelines are far from unambiguous in their opposition to it. Yet again it seems the Minister has concentrated solely on the volume rather than the design of rural housing. If one-off housing is properly designed it can complement the landscape and revitalise depopulated areas of the countryside. This has happened in some, but not all, counties. I have seen houses built in townlands where there were no houses ten years ago while 100 years ago such a townland had 15 or 16 houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">In a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, the Minister stated he would introduce changes to the planning and development regulations 2005. One of the commitments he made in the reply was that he would address the need for a uniform planning application form throughout the country. I have called for such a measure on a number of occasions, including when this matter was debated in the House, but the Minister has done nothing in this regard to date. In the reply to Deputy Olivia Mitchell's question he stated he would also address the fact that a very significant number of applications are turned down by local authorities, as brought to his attention by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, by Members of this House and by councillors.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">A large percentage of applications are turned down by county councils because of errors made in filling out application forms. Has the Minister honoured his word regarding these issues? There should not be a delay in bringing about this change. It seems the Minister has not made the necessary changes to the regulations and this House has not been offered any clarification of the situation. There is neither clarity of thought nor intent, which the Government ought to demonstrate in dealing with these issues. There is a lack of clarity in the planning departments of some local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">In 2005, more planning permissions were overturned in Dublin than in any other county, with 14 developments, comprising 2,081 apartments or houses turned down by An Bord Pleanála. This was followed by my own county of Longford with five developments, representing a total of 333 units rejected by the board. County Cork was third when 239 units in four developments were refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">According to an analysis of the decisions of An Bord Pleanála, appeals against planning permission are more likely to be successful than appeals against refusals. Over the past two years, the board has upheld one third of all appeals against grants of planning permission. An Bord Pleanála needs to be totally overhauled, with regional structures put in place. I called for such measures the last time this matter was discussed in the House and on many other occasions since I came into this House. When I was secretary of the Local Authority Members Association, this subject was raised at regular intervals at our conferences. There is unified opinion among public representatives on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">The current policy is that what suits Dublin suits the rest of the country. This is not the case. The situation in each rural area is unique and should be addressed accordingly by those who live and work in that particular region and are aware of its requirements. What suits a capital city will not suit a rural environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">A situation has arisen in the midlands — I assume the situation is the same throughout the country — whereby farmers who are trying to comply with the nitrates directive need to provide additional slurry storage facilities, but are being refused the necessary planning permission for such facilities. On top of the Minister's disastrous action in signing the directive into law, does he now intend to drive the final nail into the coffin in his efforts to destroy Irish farming? This is a very serious situation not just in my county but in all counties. Two people came to my office last Saturday who are very annoyed because their planning permission to accommodate the nitrates directive was refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Another crucial planning issue is the scourge of unfinished housing estates throughout the country. This vital issue must be dealt with and it is high time the minority of developers who engage in this disgraceful behaviour were called to account for their misdeeds. Local authority members up and down the country are crying out for change and legislation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">Fine Gael has brought forward Private Members' legislation to prevent builders who do not finish housing estates from getting permission to build another. This is a common-sense proposal. The Government's lack of action on this matter is a sign of just how beholden it is to vested interests. The lack of co-operation and co-ordination in Government is reflected in the lack of cross-departmental co-operation on the national spatial strategy; a national integrated poverty strategy or an integrated transport policy. It is a tale of two worlds: one world where the Government has so much money from an economic boom and no accountability worries and the second world where there is stability in the economy with the Government aware of what resources it will get to a greater degree. In the second scenario, any money expended must show a value greater than the alternative uses for that money.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">It is clear this Government is not choosing wisely. There is no coherent approach to the major challenges facing Ireland today and there has been almost total failure on the part of this Government to implement any coherent approach to the national spatial strategy. There are no initiatives to ease congestion in Dublin and to rejuvenate depopulated regional towns and other areas. The promise to decentralise 10,000 civil servants has been a distraction to keep desperate communities from demanding a response from Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">There has been a distinct lack of cohesion in targeting transportation congestion, particularly in Dublin. We all witness this congestion as we come into Dublin each morning. One can spend up to three hours in a traffic jam from Lucan to Leinster House. Each side of the argument, from car to train to truck and bus, has been given little of what it wants but there is no overall vision to reduce the wastage of traffic jams.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Under the Planning and Development Act 2000, development levies were designed to allow for flexibility in the type of infrastructure that can be funded under the development contribution scheme. My party did not oppose this proposal when the Act was passing through the Oireachtas. Fine Gael took responsibility because we saw that Ireland had a First World economy with a Third World infrastructure and something needed to be done. What we did not know was that these levies would not be used to fund infrastructural development but rather to make up for the shortfall in Government funding for infrastructure.</p>

The incredibly high level of development levies that will be forced on home buyers and businesses were never envisaged when the Planning and Development Act passed into law.

          <from>Mr. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_220">Over 81,000 new housing units were built in this country last year and it is projected that there will be another 80,000 this year. Some 280,000 people are employed in the construction industry but if Fine Gael had its way those people would be out of a job.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">We are here to discuss planning, however, and with such unprecedented growth nobody is denying that such issues will arise. The planning process plays a big role in managing such unprecedented growth. Changes have been made in this regard, including the guidelines issued by the Minister. Some Senators have referred to rural planning guidelines but we also require urban ones. For example, in a small pocket of my own area, in the North Wall, some 4,500 units will be built over the next two years, which will have a major impact locally. Planning will play a big part in that process, whether through infrastructure, schools or other facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Sustainability is a major issue also, particularly concerning apartment dwellings. Issues have arisen concerning how property management companies and the maintenance of apartment blocks can be dealt with. That is all part of the planning process and given the phenomenal growth we are experiencing, these issues must be taken into consideration and tackled at an early stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">We have all had experience of trying to arrange meetings with planners where staffing and technology must be examined. While there are problem areas in the current planning system, the fact that such matters are being tackled is to be welcomed. This is particularly so when it comes to discussing infrastructure. In the north inner city, thousands of apartments have been constructed in recent times, placing major pressures on infrastructure. The problem is not limited to the inner city, however, because it also affects the suburbs.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">One-off housing is not solely a rural issue either since it is now occurring in front, rear and side gardens in the city. This is putting pressure on infrastructure, including roads which are carrying an increasing volume of traffic both to and from Dublin. Proper strategic planning should form a strong part of any new developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The sustainability of some apartment blocks in Dublin must be questioned. Neighbours may not see each other from one end of the year to the other because they are coming and going day and night. They may never meet each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Traffic is a major issue in areas just outside the city centre, such as the East Wall and Cabra where there has been a big increase in volumes. There are plans for major developments, including apartments and housing, in these areas. Around the Phoenix Park and out to west Dublin, there has been a phenomenal increase in the number of housing units. Such development brings its own problems so the more strategically we plan for the future, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Dublin City Council has been discussing housing density and there have always been flat complexes around the city centre, which have produced social problems over the years. The general consensus is that with proper urban planning, the development of duplex housing and own-door housing in the inner city, whereby everybody has their own entrance, we can still facilitate the required densities. The issue is currently under discussion as part of the planning process, including decisions that are made in the early stages of that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">It is particularly difficult to meet with planners because their offices are understaffed and they have a problem obtaining properly qualified staff. A number of people are coming from other countries to work in the planning sector here. Unfortunately, however, if a planner does not know the area and is unaware of the wider context, some decisions may go astray. When that happens it can have catastrophic consequences not only for immediate neighbours but also for entire housing estates. Therefore, the more technological resources that are put into the planning process the better. A wide variety of technology is available in the planning sector, so we should be examining it with a view to investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Issues have also arisen over the enforcement of planning laws and regulations. A bad decision at an early point of the planning process, whether it concerns a small house extension or the development of a housing estate, can have major consequences later on. Enforcement is a big issue for local authorities whose responsibility it is. However, such authorities must be properly resourced and trained in this regard. They must also have access to proper legal advice. In my experience, when some cases reach court, local authorities are not in a position to enforce the existing laws and by-laws. Local authorities require more support in this regard. In some cases, the original problems that arose during the planning process may tend to disappear because the appeal process can take so long. The more resources we put into these areas, therefore, the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">As regards the management of apartment complexes and estates, up until recent times local authorities automatically took charge of roads and other services relatively shortly after the completion of a housing estate. That was the case up until ten or 15 years ago but they now have an opt-out. The Minister has made it clear to local authorities around the country that he will insist on them fulfilling their obligations in taking charge of estates and services. The procurement of management services through management companies now forms part of the planning application process for apartment complexes. That system must be re-examined, however, because in some cases it is not working. There may be a different management company from one year to the next in some complexes, while others have no management company so residents take it upon themselves to establish one. That is the case in a number of apartment complexes around Dublin city. If that sector needs to be changed either by regulation or legislation, it should be done. It is only right to examine the matter now, given the amount of urban and rural development occurring. We must plan strategically for such development in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Recent changes introduced by the Department will help to bolster the existing planning process but certain areas need to examined. If the current volume of growth continues we must be prepared to invest in people and technological resources to sustain such growth. In that way, we can look forward to many more years of growth.</p>

          <p eId="para_236">It is great to see the Minister present for this important debate on a matter of concern to all Members. Dealing with planning has become very complex for the ordinary man or woman on the street. We are living in a time of unprecedented growth and development, which is no bad thing. However, when a person living on a road or estate suddenly notices in a newspaper a planning application for the field behind, or across the road, interfacing with the planning process becomes very complex. It is no longer a case of simply making an objection and proceeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">I will give an example of a situation in which I am involved because it is near where I live. An initial application was made by developers. I queried it with the developers and discovered they had been alerted early on by the authorities that they would be asked for further information. However, the further information they are being asked for is in effect an entirely different application. That is fine for me to manage, given my knowledge of the process and my experience, but for the average person, trying to cope with the different levels of a major planning application is very difficult and quite intimidating. We need to find better ways to guide people through the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I understand that a local authority needs to communicate a decision in a particular way. It must be legally framed and is a particular kind of document, but many people who read it do not understand it, or elements of it. We need to work harder to ensure that the average person on the street who has any interface with the planning process understands everything that goes on, and that his or her concerns are heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The process has become much more complex. There is also too much going on between the planner and developer which the public will never know about. Pre-planning meetings, discussions and so on should be recorded and transparent. There is no reason that should not happen, nor should developers be concerned about it happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">With regard to implementation and follow-up, when conditions are attached to a planning decision it is important that the resources are made available to local authorities — current resources are not sufficient — to ensure those conditions are upheld. From the public's point of view, it is critical that conditions are attached to planning decisions. It often happens that a year or a year and a half later, a public representative gets a complaint from someone that something which was supposed to happen is not happening. It is important that the local authority has the resources to implement decisions. One is usually talking of the average citizen who does not have access to major resources or professional advice, but who knows what the decision was and does not know how to ensure it is implemented. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that local authorities have sufficient resources to see that planning conditions are adhered to.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">Linked to that are resources with regard to taking in charge, to which Senator Brady referred. Taking an estate in charge is a major issue for communities. We are talking of quality of life, of communities in which people live. Such issues concern people daily, and cause people most anxiety and aggravation. We have a duty to support them as much as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Rural planning is not urban planning. I am concerned that many of our planners are trained in urban planning but are not familiar with issues of rural Ireland such as the expansion of villages. Some current village developments are simply not appropriate. We have also had a great deal of discussion on one-off rural housing. I ask the Minister to consider that those who take up jobs in planning offices around the country do not necessarily have training in, consideration for, or sympathy with issues pertaining to rural planning — with agriculture, families, the structure of communities or how our communities manifest themselves. It is one of the biggest concerns of public representatives from rural areas that there is no sympathy in planning offices for issues relevant and specific to rural Ireland.</p>

          <from>Mr. Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_243">I thank Senator O'Meara for sharing time and I welcome the Minister to the House. I am concerned with the decision by An Bord Pleanála regarding the development adjacent to Lough Key forest park. As well as being a Senator from the area I am chairperson of the Lough Key forest park action group, and have been for seven years. We have seen the park decline. We have worked closely with Roscommon County Council and Coillte and now have an €8 million development on which the first sod will be turned next week by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue. That is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">The Newfound Consortium approached the council with a good, eco-friendly development which would involve €150 million being poured into an area which needs tourism. The consortium has already proved itself in the Humber Valley in Newfoundland, in Canada. The Minister knows of this consortium. Its members met the Taoiseach, and possibly the Minister and his officials. The consortium had the backing of the vast, cross-party majority of people in County Roscommon. It went about its business in a professional, enthusiastic manner and consulted closely with local people. However, the consortium's plan for a 100-bedroom hotel and 98 golf chalets was turned down by An Bord Pleanála. An observation or objection was made on behalf of the scientific section of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The nature of this objection was flawed. Everyone deserves due process and I ask the Minister to meet the consortium, listen to its fears and look at the nature of the objection made.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">We will try to get the second planning permission on stream. Other issues have been alluded to by An Bord Pleanála, including concerns for the lesser horseshoe bat, and the Lough Key development plan. The crucial issue was the objection or observation made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which scuppered the project.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I welcome that the Minister is here to listen to what I will say. The area of planning is a very complex issue. As many other Senators have said, there is urban planning, rural planning, a national spatial strategy and the Building Control Bill 2005. It begs the question as to whether we can divide the issue into sections. One cannot talk about planning in a broad sense, which I am trying to do today.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">We have experienced an economic boom over the past ten years and a significant escalation in planning applications. A statistic from last year indicated that over 86,000 planning applications were made. God knows what it will be in 2006 if it continues to increase. We also have a better-educated population and a better environment. I welcome the current draft guidelines for consultation, a part of which is the attempt to upgrade a quality service in terms of a better interaction between the applicant and the planning authority in the context of processing the application, consultation, filling out forms and talking generally about the impact of the intended house or larger project on an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">In his regulations and planning guidelines, the Minister indicated that we must streamline the process and have staff to facilitate it. They must be courteous, open and transparent in their interaction with applicants. Other Senators stated that many members of the public do not understand what the development plan means. The Minister spoke about providing it on-line and making applications via electronic means. Having said this, we must get the message out about the development plan and how it works so people will have an interest in it if their own areas are affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Development charges were referred to. There seems to be some inconsistency among local authorities concerning development charges on applications, whether they are for one-off houses or a development of 300 houses. I do not understand how the system works and the applicants do not understand how these charges are arrived at. I would welcome further discussion on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The Minister referred to performance indicators but I find it hard to understand what this means regarding facilitating and processing difficulties in the context of better interaction with officials behind counters. I am concerned that with all of the applications being received, we have the number of staff to deal with them. That is the problem. I have experience in this area in that well-qualified planners come here from other countries but cannot get onto planning courses for whatever reason. They are postgraduate students and qualified in their primary degrees with a subject matter related to planning but when they apply for postgraduate courses, they are turned down. I do not understand why. The Minister has heard me say this previously. It would be no harm were he to have a discussion with the powers that be in universities running these courses to produce a greater number of qualified people to deal with the backlog of applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I welcome the streamlining in the area of An Bord Pleanála but there is still some inconsistency in how it arrives at its decisions. I have raised this matter time and again in that I question the composition of An Bord Pleanála. If a member of its staff has the duty of visiting a site and returns with a positive presentation to proceed with the application, I cannot understand why the board would overrule him or her. Why would one send the official out if one is not prepared to abide by his or her opinion? What is his or her role? The reverse can happen, in that planning permission could be granted by a local authority, an official from An Bord Pleanála would gainsay the permission but the board would go with the local authority's opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">I do not know how the system works. There is no transparency in how the board arrives at its decisions. The area is complex and there is a feeling among the public that we are not getting value for money. People must pay a lot of money when they appeal to An Bord Pleanála. This issue must be discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">I welcome the decision on one-off housing. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s one was faced with blanket darkness when one moved out of Dublin or any of the major cities. One would arrive into a town at 7 p.m. on a winter evening but would not see a light. Over the past ten years, we have suddenly seen the blossoming of sparkling lights in small towns and villages. This is welcome as communities have come alive. There are people there. People are going back to their roots and why not? I am not asking for Southfork-style housing designs. I am asking for local authorities to grant——</p>

          <p eId="para_270">I would like local authorities to grant permission for designs that accommodate and complement an area, not dominate it. We are not into the latter, as the Senator knows better than I. Having said that, it is a golden opportunity to allow the countryside to develop and have vibrant communities up and running again. I welcome that the Minister has taken this view on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Minister must tidy up the area of charges but I do not know how he will get that right. He is trying to do so and is entering into discussions. The Minister should say that for any large application for 300 or 400 houses in an area, if the snag list is not addressed within six months of the estate's completion, the financial charge on the developer should be increased. If the developer does not address the situation, the Minister has enough resources and personnel for the estate to be finished by the local authority. We are well aware that this issue has not been tidied up.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I also wish to refer to stakeholders in the national spatial strategy and how they work. I am referring to, for example, sections within local authorities such as those dealing with roads and planning. It is often the case that the planning section is in favour of the granting of permission but the roads section is against, as the building in question might be too near a corner. We have not got this matter right either. We have come a long way but there should be more transparency and openness. Planning applications should be streamlined so that people feel comfortable presenting at the planning office and interacting with the staff, who should understand and empathise with the applicant, particularly in the case of one-off housing. People are often apprehensive and they approach their local representative to assist them in filling out the application form and to support them through the process. People are concerned they will be associated with the bad press that exists in regard to this matter if they submit an application for one-off housing or 300 houses. We must build goodwill between planners, the public and the applicant.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Much good work has been done. The draft guidelines have been published and the Minister has undertaken the consultation process. Perhaps he will take on board the points made today.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I never know the difference between the guidelines and the regulations. I thought these were all the same but they are not. There is too much confusion between planning laws, regulations, guidelines and by-laws and these should be tidied up.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_277">Perhaps we can reach some accommodation. I agreed with much of what Senator Ormonde said about the lack of accountability, openness and transparency in planning. I do not need to rub people's faces in it but Members of both Houses are under a serious cloud because of the appalling corruption prevalent throughout local authorities in this land. That is an outrageous situation and one which abides. Planning is a very murky area, with nasty little things in the undergrowth. Sometimes there is a lack of transparency and accountability, at times it is more sinister and on other occasions it is just folly.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">This Minister has been critical, sometimes in a disingenuous way, of An Taisce, a statutory body with particular functions. For political reasons there is an attempt to erode this body, which has operated responsibly, particularly with regard to the principles enunciated in the national spatial strategy. Politicians are great at enunciating great principles but the proof of the pudding is if they live up to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">In some areas the national spatial strategy seems to have been almost entirely abandoned. One instance is a case raised by Senator Ormonde concerning one-off housing in the countryside. Senior planning authorities have warned that housing development is spreading throughout the greater Dublin area to an extent not envisaged by the spatial planning guidelines, accompanied by an increase in long distance commuting. The spread of housing development has made the provision of attractive public transport difficult. The consequent travel mode decisions lead to a car-based commuting pattern and increasing congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">By the very measure Senator Ormonde is praising we are defeating the main elements of the national spatial strategy. In this situation it is very difficult to plan for a coherent transport system. The overriding provision for sustainable land and transport planning in section 1.5 of the national spatial strategy states that "Ireland needs to renew, consolidate and develop its existing cities, towns and villages i.e. keeping them as physically compact and public transport friendly as possible and minimising urban sprawl". This will not happen because of the relaxation of these guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">Section 6.1.2 of the National Spatial Strategy 2002 states that objectives for:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_282">...integrated spatial planning frameworks, including land-use and transportation elements, will be prepared and adopted by the local authorities or combinations of authorities responsible for the development of new gateways and hubs. Integrated spatial planning frameworks for existing gateways that are in the course of preparation will be completed and adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Concerning transport, section 3.7.1 states "Ireland's transport networks must ... ensure through building up the capacity and effectiveness of Ireland's public transport networks, that increases in energy demand and emissions of CO2 arising from the demand for movement are minimised". These objectives have not been met because of the issues Senator Ormonde helpfully raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">People with a house outside a village seek traffic lights for one house. They are at risk but why did they build there? Half the time the lights, about which Senator Ormonde was so lyrical, are turned off because many of these houses are holiday homes that blister the west coast of Ireland, making it much less attractive from the point of view of tourism. People squawk when they are expected to pay for services where they are two miles from a settlement. They expect the taxpayer to pay for electricity and sewerage. I understand there is local pressure but let us be realistic. People who are effectively elected by county councillors form a strong lobby so let us be honest and declare our interest in these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">I have a series of concerns and I wish to illustrate two more, towards which the Minister will be sympathetic on one count. I hope to persuade him to be open-minded on the second. The first is the notorious failure of planning in Dublin but my second example relates to rural Ireland, to demonstrate that I am not too Dublin-centred. The Minister is aware of a dangerous situation in Gardiner Street, where a man posing as an architect designed a remodelling of two or three listed 18th century buildings. He built dormitory style accommodation for immigrants, which was absolutely illegal. He applied for retention and was being prosecuted by the local authority on the same day as it granted him planning permission to build an extension of this noxious development in the back yard. How coherent, transparent or accountable was that decision?</p>

          <p eId="para_289">The Cathaoirleach will be as delighted as I am to realise the Minister has the gift of prophesy because I had not mentioned the second case. If the Minister thinks it is the Standish Sawmills case, I will be very pleased if he provides good news on this. He and the Government have prevaricated on this matter on the numerous occasions I attempted to raise it in this House. I was told there was no ministerial responsibility and when I demonstrated that there was, the matter had become <i>sub judice</i>. The court lacks the capacity to enforce injunctions in this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">How can anyone respect the planning process when the ridiculous case of the Gardiner Street development exists, and is multiplied by ten in the case of Standish Sawmills? An excerpt from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 26 May 2005 reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_291">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has decided to grant a new pollution control licence to T&amp;J Standish Sawmills in Co. Offaly. The EPA said, however, that it would go ahead with a prosecution against the sawmills in Roscrea District Court this morning for breaches of the company's current integrated pollution control licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">These are continuing polluters, cocking a snook at the Minister and the planning authorities. This development was established without planning permission, farm animals have died, the water table has been affected, wells have been polluted and it is a gross visual intrusion on the outskirts of a national monument, Leap Castle.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_318">The Minister is lucky to have the teachers doing the job in Ireland today for the Government. The Government takes credit and lives in the reflected glory of the extraordinary good work done by teachers. That is a fact. Time and again the question is asked whether people are ready to change. I do not have time to state all I would like on what teachers have done. I know the Minister supports that. The recent movement towards the publication of school reports is a major step forward and teachers deserve credit for risking it. It is a good move so long as it is used positively. It will be a protection for teachers and will show them in the best light if no one plays ducks and drakes with it. We should recognise that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">We should also recognise that teachers have implemented a revised curriculum during the past number of years at lower cost to the State than in any other European country. That is value for money, an argument always applied to teaching and education. Everybody in this country can be proud of that fact.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Schools do their very best to deal with "newcomer" children of other nationalities, people who come to this country unaware of our culture and try to settle in. That has put pressures on schools and they are trying to cope. The INTO made it extremely clear to me that teachers are not managing. They do their best but they are not able to cope with the pressure. Will the Minister examine that issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_321">Regarding class sizes, I will state the first part of the Minister's speech. The Minister has provided a great number of extra primary school teachers. No one will deny that and I acknowledge it with my first statement. It is positive and in terms of additional teachers, it is superb. However, a clear commitment creating expectations was given at the last election and it has not been delivered. I accept that it cannot be done tomorrow morning. However, I want the Minister to state here that she intends to get there.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">I remember listening to the Minister state that she will not give commitments beyond the next election. Come on, Minister. Let the Minister's leader hear her state that. I dare the Minister to state that in front of Bertie. There is no way she would do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I could give the House 24 examples of items put in place in such a way that they continue after elections. There is nothing wrong with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The real selling point is that the Minister should state that this is her intention and that of the Government, along with the date on which it will be delivered. If, horrors or horrors, the Minister is not back in Government the next time, at least she will be able to point from the Opposition benches to the group running the country refusing to meet the well-deserved commitments she gave. The Minister wins every way. If she gets back into office she can provide the extra teachers, if that is how long it takes to do so. There is no reason the Minister cannot take that action. It is straight forward, honest bargaining, and the Minister should stand up and do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">I know there are difficulties in the Minister's constituency and in places such as west Limerick, where small rural two-teacher schools have more than 50 pupils. It is a difficulty. I will not state to the Minister that situation is worse than the situation of a developing school in Balbriggan or Ashbourne in the new Minister of State's constituency, where difficulty in finding teachers is experienced.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I recognise that other needs exist. However, that does not take from meeting the commitment given. We can deal with all needs over a period of time. People want to know they have something to which they can look forward. There should not be argument on this. Everybody agrees it is the way to progress. Surely it is a matter of how long it will take and when and how it will be done. Will the Minister return to that point?</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I remind the Minister that she put forward a five-year schools building programme. She did not worry about whether there would be an election. She just put it in place and fair play to her. I ask her to do the same for class sizes and teacher numbers. Of course the Minister can do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_339">The Minister has done a very good job in fighting for extra primary school teachers. I do not see why it should be stopped now. I demand that the Minister continues it until the end of the road. I do not have time to develop that part of the argument much further.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">My next point is on the much-heralded and long-awaited initiative on disadvantage. Reading today's newspapers and listening to the news, children who drop out of school and do not get jobs are making the headlines again. From where do they come? If we walk into the nursery of the nearest maternity hospital, we can pick them out. We know where the problems are. The ball is at the Minister's feet. Everybody wants to work with it. We can see areas and addresses which supply the largest proportion of the prison population and the long-term unemployed and a significant amount of those who go no further in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">There was a time, not so long ago, when people could leave school without qualifications and walk into certain types of jobs. Those jobs have left this country. Manufacturing industry and those low-level jobs have gone to the Far East or other places. The more menial jobs are done by people who have come to this country and are prepared to do them. Irish people are not prepared to do them. Put it all together, and one sees the entire workplace has moved upwards. We have moved up the food chain and people must have some level of qualification or training in order to progress. I ask the Minister to consider that.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">An area I would tie into that is that of apprenticeships which somebody needs to grasp. People should be told that going into apprenticeships is something to which they should look forward. I wish apprenticeships included elements of literature, drama, arts and culture as part of their training in the grand tradition of the likes of Brendan Behan and others so that the Abbey Theatre would be filled with plumbers as well as architects and carpenters or brickies would go to the National Concert Hall as well as graduates. We have lost something in this country in that regard. We must begin at the lowest level — the child beginning school.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Two hours ago outside the gates of the House people were agitating, demonstrating and pleading for help to deal with drugs in their community. This is the same issue, namely, one of education. Racism also comes from a lack of education. I am not saying it is the Minister's fault; it is the fault of us all. It is a cultural issue at which we need to look. Drugs and violence, of which we have never seen so much, tend to occur in the same areas. It is all happening in these areas and these children must live through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The real architects of Irish education policy are in Merrion Street. They do not want the Minister to put money into reducing class size. They do not know what this special education issue is all about. They seek to put children into the same school and give them a bit of help here and there. There is an agenda, which I know is not the Minister's, to wind down special schools. There cannot be a system without special education schools. There is a possibility to look at the idea of dual enrolment or of a federation of schools, including mainstream, special education and multi-disciplinary schools, to deal with children with all types of needs and to enable teachers and pupils to interact on one campus. That is a useful suggestion but it needs to be done on a pilot basis. We should examine how it might work. I am always afraid of new initiatives, whatever they are. If they are simply introduced without proper planning, they will not work. However, this suggestion surely merits consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">When I reply to the debate, I will deal with issues such as the complexity of the classroom, etc. I have asked that teachers' salaries and awards be addressed in the new national programme. I will pick one example to which I would like the Minister to respond. Yesterday I saw the principal of a school on the south side of Dublin who was dealing with a terrible tragedy and describing how he was trying to explain it to children. It is certainly not easier to explain that tragedy to five to eight year olds than to 15 or 16 year olds as the younger the child, the more difficult it is. However, primary school principals are paid less than their post-primary colleagues. It is an anomaly which is wrong in every way, and I could give 24 examples as to why. I ask the Minister to look at teachers' pay, wipe out that anomaly and recognise the additional pressure of school reports. When I reply to the debate, I will deal with the legislation on special educational needs. I have compiled a memorandum which might be helpful to teachers but the shortened version runs to 11 pages.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ShaneRoss" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p eId="para_346">I second the motion and I thank Senator O'Toole for tabling it. In support of what he said, there is plenty of precedent for the Government accepting motions encompassing amendments and passing them without of vote. I see nothing to quarrel with in what the Government has to say and given the aspirational nature of our motion, the Government should not have any problem with it. It would be welcome if the Minister took it on board and if we could act in a spirit of unanimity and not divide the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I welcome this motion which I read with a certain amount of scepticism. My scepticism was relieved quickly because it is the first motion on education for many years which puts the pupil first. Indeed, of the eight points in the motion, seven put the pupil first and only one puts the teacher first. That is somewhat of a reversal of the priorities we have tended to hear from Members of the Oireachtas and vested interests, which we should welcome. It means many people are beginning to recognise that in the past, teachers had a position which was particularly strong and that pupils were subjected to a lower place in the pecking order of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">I welcome those points Senator O'Toole made in favour of the pupil, particularly the one on the pupil-teacher ratio which will involve the employment of more teachers but which will also benefit the pupil. I welcome this motion if it helps to put the pupil back at the centre of Irish education because the high profile was taken by the teacher for so long that one would have thought education was for teachers and not for pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">It is fair to acknowledge that in the common parlance, there is another stakeholder involved, namely parents. The Minister has by her actions acknowledged them as well, which I welcome. Of course the position, pay and conditions of teachers is vital but let us now say it is the pupils who really matter and that education is for them. That is why I also welcome the particular emphasis Senator O'Toole has placed on special needs education. This House and its Leader have taken several initiatives on the issue of autistic children and we have brought it to the front of the political arena. We have successfully debated this issue and Senator O'Toole was right when he said the requirements of special needs children should be paramount and that funding for them should be a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The days when the ASTI was striking did much damage to the cause, profile and reputation of teachers. This is, to some extent, an acknowledgement that in those days, they regarded their own selfish interests as far more important than those of their pupils. Indeed, they engaged in strike action in circumstances which were deplorable in the light of the interests of pupils and the examinations taking place at the time. The softer and more caring approach of the INTO will pay off, not only for the pupils but for the teachers because public opinion has moved again to acknowledge the great work teachers do, which tended to be forgotten at the time the strikes were taking place when public opinion reacted against teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">I refer to teachers' pay which is mentioned in the second last point in the motion. It states that teachers should be adequately and fairly rewarded for the challenging and responsible work they undertake and it demands, in particular, that the anomaly to which Senator O'Toole referred should be addressed. Teachers' pay is always a difficult subject and it is one which will be addressed both outside and inside the next partnership talks. I wish to mention benchmarking in that regard. I have no problem with public servants, in particular teachers, being well rewarded for what they do. However, I have a problem with a benchmarking deal which sets performance targets that are bogus and with a future deal which sets similar performance targets that are not adhered to or met.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">I have a problem with the establishment of performance verification groups which then pass, almost without question, all those performance targets whose novelty is in extreme doubt or which will certainly not be policed or implemented. While teachers should be well paid, their performance should be monitored. We should be able to state with confidence, conviction, honesty and integrity that such performance indicators have actually been achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Members are aware that after the last partnership talks, teachers in particular had real difficulties regarding their particular performance targets and in meeting some of the timetables involved. It will not be right to exercise this kind of muscle in the future. Targets should be clear and transparent and teachers should be suitably rewarded for the work they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">This should not be expressed in terms of league tables, which are absolutely invidious and should be completely excluded from our educational platform or agenda. They pressurise teachers to perform like automata or robots and to deliver pupils in a certain state, which is only measured by examination results. This is the antithesis of education. We should ensure that while we avoid such league tables, we develop other performance targets which ensure that teachers can meet them, will compete to meet them and will deliver well-rounded pupils who are not simply judged on examination points.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">It is fair to pay teachers well, if the job is seen to be done effectively and efficiently and they should be judged fairly and independently. However, they should not be paid, willy-nilly, certain amounts from the partnership pot——</p>

        <speech by="#LiamFitzgerald" eId="spk_181">
          <from>Mr. Fitzgerald</from>
          <p eId="para_370">While the criticism is unjustified, the sentiments expressed and the key issues raised in the motion are relevant to the central issues in primary education today. This is welcome. As for embracing Senator O'Toole's motion to form a composite motion, it would be necessary to introduce some significant amendments to the wording of his motion, before that could be possible, notwithstanding Government Members' welcome of the motion. As I stated, some of the key issues mentioned, such as class sizes, educational disadvantage, special needs and the increasing numbers of newcomer pupils to our primary schools, pose some of the real challenges in primary education today.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">The amendment fairly, accurately and reasonably reflects the unambiguous commitment of the Government to all primary school children. As I have stated, the issues outlined by Senator O'Toole are key, because they help to direct our focus on the need to deliver opportunities to all children, irrespective of their abilities, interests and cultures. As the Government delivers on the key issues, it acknowledges that every child deserves the chance to reach its full potential. I agree with Senators O'Toole and Ross that the child is and must be at the centre of this debate, irrespective of the reference towards the end of the motion to teachers' pay and allowances for principals.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">As the amendment points out, the Government is delivering, as far as all the key areas are concerned. I will outline some of its delivery highlights during recent years. First, every primary school now has the services of a resource teacher. No reasonable primary school principal or teacher will deny that this is a significant step forward. Since last year, a total of 600 extra resource teachers have been put in place. Moreover, as has already been stated frequently in this House in the past year, more than 5,000 additional teachers have been brought into service in the primary school sector. Most have rightly been targeted at special needs and educational disadvantage. The pupil-teacher ratio has been reduced from 22:1 in 1997, to 17:1 today. At present, the big issue is of course class size. Class sizes have been reduced from 27:1 to 24:1 over the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I will now consider the developments planned for this year and next year. As all Members must admit, the education sector did well in the budget. Its current expenditure allocation has been increased by 9% and now exceeds €7 billion. A total of 500 additional primary teachers will be introduced into schools during the next two years. They will ensure smaller class sizes and will be targeted at educational disadvantage. Moreover, the Minister has requested primary school principals to deploy them at junior school level in the first instance. Educational disadvantage has also been targeted through increasing aid for school books grants by 25%. As for the old chestnut of the capitation grant, it will come to €146 per pupil this year, in contrast to the figure of €57 per pupil, which was payable in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">Last year, as all Members are all aware, the Minister launched the delivering equality of opportunity in schools programme, DEIS. The Minister intends to discuss it in more detail. Its implementation is well under way and it has many interesting features, to which Senator O'Toole and, more briefly, Senator Ross have referred. Given the programme's enormous significance for schools, principals and teachers, I join with Senator O'Toole in paying tribute to our principals and primary school teachers for the enthusiasm with which they have embraced all the many new initiatives which have been targeted at educational disadvantage and special needs in recent years. The degree of professionalism that is in evidence in the face of these significant challenges is commendable.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Equally, we must pay tribute to them for the manner in which they have embraced the involvement of parents at the very centre of the delivery of education, both in terms of special education and in the context of the special educational needs Act. The Act has significant implications for the interaction between principals and parents, class teachers and parents and indeed among principals, parents and the community, as well as for the new post of the special educational needs organiser, SENO. This level of outreaching by teachers and principals in highly commendable. Having paid tribute in this regard, I must also insist that there has been a definite, coherent, consistent and ongoing programme of delivery by the Government and its immediate predecessor during its term of office from 1997 to 2002, to target these areas of special need. This has enabled our schools to have better learning outcomes, to provide equality of opportunity and to deliver for all pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">Under this Minister, children with special needs and disadvantaged children have received the first call on resources. The Minister and her immediate predecessors have targeted the 5,000 additional teachers at special needs and educational disadvantage. No one, inside or outside the education sector, could quibble with this and it was the correct priority. The provision of 500 extra teachers in the next two years has been budgeted for, and is backed by the Minister for Finance. This will be aimed at lowering class sizes and the reduction by one point of the class size ratio in mainstream schools. This constitutes significant progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">The Government can hold its head high across the spectrum of special education and educational disadvantage. Significant resources have been poured in to tackle educational disadvantage in recent years. Apart from the appointment of 5,000 additional resource teachers, the reading recovery programme was introduced while the key feature of the delivering equality of opportunity in schools programme is intervention at an early age to help children so that the problems they experience do not become entrenched. Breakfast and homework clubs and summer programmes greatly benefit young pupils, particularly on the north side of Dublin, which I represent. The improvement in school attendance, motivation and achievement as a result of these initiatives has been remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I commend the amendment because it accurately, fairly and reasonably encapsulates the unstinting commitment and determination of the Minister and her predecessors to deliver additional resources to schools so that principals and teachers can provide a more professional service while targeting the most needy. Over the next few years, the Minister will address class size in mainstream schools on an ongoing basis, without the need to set targets, as proposed by Senator O'Toole.</p>

        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_182">
          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_379">I welcome the Minister to the House and am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate. Everybody welcomes improvements in the education system, which provide children with an opportunity to improve their lot. Earlier on the Order of Business, I again raised an education issue, which is the failure of more than 1,000 children to transfer from primary to second level education annually. That will not improve overnight but whatever needs to be done to reverse that trend must be done. I have raised the issue of school drop outs on numerous occasions with the Minister and her predecessor.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The kernel of the early school leaving issue relates to the appointment of educational welfare officers. The Government gave an undertaking that the resources necessary to ensure the appointment 330 educational welfare officers would be provided on a phased basis. It was intended that the educational welfare officer system would replace the juvenile liaison scheme involving the Garda and other schemes, which were totally unacceptable. However, only 70 officers have been recruited, meaning that each officer is assigned 185 pupils. No person can monitor a child with educational difficulties over the course of his or her primary education and prevent him or her from dropping out in these circumstances. Most children play truant or drop out between the ages of nine and 12 but if the necessary personnel are not appointed, the numbers dropping out will increase significantly. These children will present further problems as they get older and it will cost the State much more to counter their activities outside the education system than it would if they were encouraged to stay in school. It is important that the proposed number of educational welfare officers be recruited, as they would provide excellent value for money. I hope the Minister will give a commitment to dramatically increase the number of such officers in the near future. The Minister has immediately shaken her head but if she does not address this issue, another Department will pay the price.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Statistics published by the Department and the Minister are, in the main, contradictory. A total of 108,619 children are in classes of more than 30 pupils. It is unfair of the Minister to repeatedly state that the problem is at local level, given that boards of management of schools are forced to shuffle resource teachers so that they deal primarily with children aged under nine, who have greater needs. That is not the solution to the problem. In addition, a significant number of pupils are in class sizes of more than 35 or more than 40. A total of 160 pupils are in the latter category, which is unacceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Minister should definitively outline what is the position regarding the larger class sizes because the figures published by the Department and the Minister are contradictory. In the school year 2004-05, 9,946 pupils were in classes that numbered between 30 and 34 pupils while in 2003-04, the equivalent figure was 4,499. The number of pupils in this category, therefore, doubled. If people welcome that——</p>

          <from>Mr. U. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_386">The Minister provided this figures to Members in the Lower House. She should provide the definitive, true and accurate figures so that people will not be misled further on class sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">Everybody welcomes the improvement in special needs provision, particularly the appointment of additional resource teachers and personal assistants. Most schools are in receipt of such support, although a number of them have experienced a reduction. While the Minister does not have sole responsibility for special needs provision, it is important that she should maintain this support at second level. The withdrawal of special needs services from pupils when they transfer from primary to second level presents an increasing problem. This issue needs urgent attention so that the valuable work done by primary teachers is not undone.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">I support previous speakers who referred to the workload of principals and their remuneration. Their increasing administrative workload must be recognised. There are far more demands on their time now than was the case in the past. We must recognise and respond to this in a positive way by providing them with adequate support. In some cases, their workload is proportionate to the numbers in their school and the difficulties with which they contend.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I draw the Minister's attention to a sad situation, a matter I raised on the Adjournment some time ago. In my local national school, some 30% of the student intake require special needs support of some type. The last time I visited this two-teacher, two-room school, a severely disabled child in great need was being taught in the midst of eight students in need of other support. The provision of such specialist support is an impossible task when teachers must also deliver the regular school programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I am sorry to raise a parochial matter but I stress the urgency of this school's requirement for an emergency prefabricated building. Coincidentally, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, who replied to this matter in the Minister's absence, was principal in that school some 30 years ago. He admitted nothing had changed in the school in that time. There must be a review of cases such as this is where there is an absolute immediacy in terms of a school's requirements. The Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, said he would bring this case to the attention of the Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_391">I welcome the Minister for Education and Science to the House and I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this motion. Along with health care, care of the elderly and child care, education is one of the key policy areas that define a society. Decisions made in the area of education have far-reaching and long-lasting affects not only on our economy but on our society. The influence of education is all pervading. Law and order, social integration, race relations and civil society are all affected by education policy. The position of Minister for Education and Science brings with it huge responsibilities responsibilities to which this Minister has risen with the assurance and sure-footedness of one who has spent much of her working life promoting the cause of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">It was with disappointment that I first viewed the motion put forward by Senators O'Toole, Ross and Norris. Challenges remain in this area but I am proud that the Government has achieved much and will continue to make progress on delivering the facilities people need and deserve. The Senators' ire would be better directed at previous Administrations where underprovision took its toll on all aspects of education. When this Government took office in 1997, it resolved to make amends by addressing these issues in a strategic and meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">The facts speak for themselves. A decade ago, some 190,000 primary school pupils were in ordinary classes of more than 30, of which 52,000 had class sizes greater than 35. Today, those figures have reduced by 44% and 83%, respectively. The Senators' ire should have been directed at those Administrations which allowed nearly 42% of primary school pupils to be taught in classes of more than 30.</p>

          <from>Mr. Minihan</from>
          <p eId="para_397">Since 1997, the pupil-teacher ratio has been slashed from 22:1 to 17:1. To achieve this figure, the Government has placed 5,000 extra primary teachers in our schools. Many of these extra teachers have been targeted at pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas to ensure they are getting the extra help they need to reach their potential. The average class size has been brought down from 27 to 24. This means there is now one classroom teacher for every 24 pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The Government has made a conscious decision to target resources at pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. This is as it should be and no sane person would condemn such a decision. Some 243 disadvantaged schools have benefited from this policy, with reduced class sizes of 15 to 20 pupils per class. Now that class sizes have been reduced in disadvantaged schools, mainstream schools too will begin to see substantial improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio, with the emphasis on infants and young children. The Minister for Education and Science has major responsibilities, ranging from the care and nurturing of junior infants to promoting innovation and research at fourth level. In many respects, however, one of her most important roles is that of special needs education.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Time constraints do not allow us to do justice to this complex issue. On the occasion of the debate that took place in this House last April, I put on the record a number of figures that went some way to illustrate the Government's commitment in this area. In terms of special needs, there are now some 5,000 resource teachers, up from 104 in 1998.</p>

          <p eId="para_403">Perhaps the INTO was better off getting rid of Senator O'Toole; it has done so well since he left.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">There are nearly 6,000 special needs assistants in schools, compared to just 300 in 1998. This progress must be acknowledged, commended and welcomed. Nevertheless, despite this progress, the Government is not resting on its laurels. In the coming years, as the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 is phased in, resources will be provided to ensure the Government's obligations are met.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">A new and welcome development in the past several years has been the increased number of foreign workers arriving here. While welcome, these workers and their families present a number of challenges to the Government, challenges that no previous Government had to face. It is vital that the Government provides adequate funding to ensure language support teachers are provided where necessary and in adequate numbers. I welcome the Minister's commitment at the recent primary principals conference that she will keep this area under review and, in the next 12 months, devote a significant amount of her time to ensuring children whose first language is not English and whose cultures and expectations of education can be very different to our own are given every opportunity. In other countries with an immigrant population, problems occur not with the younger generation but with their parents. It is here that social isolation begins and resentment eventually grows. I urge the Government to do all it can to ensure adults too benefit from any English language programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Education is the key to work, social inclusion and a well-grounded, civilised society. It is not a silver bullet; it will not and cannot solve all society's problems. However, in recognising the role education has to play and ensuring adequate resources are provided to all levels of education, this Government has laid the foundations for Irish society into the 21st century. I support the Government's amendment to the motion.</p>

I am not partisan on this nor am I am as surprisingly politically naive as my friend and colleague, Senator Ross, if he imagines for one minute that the Government will accept a motion that refers to regretting the Government's failure and the Minister's procrastination and goes on to make demands.</p>

          <from>Mr. Norris</from>
          <p eId="para_411">They are only words. However, I have managed this trick in the past but always when there was some degree of accommodation between the two elements. That is a good move but I do not see any realistic possibility of it in this case. Although Senator O'Toole has good relations, by and large, with the Department of Education and Science and the Minister, he is right to be critical because we need to keep the Minister and the Department up to the appropriate standard all the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Senator Minihan was kind in explaining the position to those of us who are numerically challenged, among whom I count myself. However, even I can detect that there are anomalies occurring but I accept that since the introduction of the budget, the Minister has managed to achieve an amelioration in the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">I will give a number of examples. One is a recent survey carried out by the INTO which showed that some of the country's most severely disadvantaged schools, instead of their pupil-teacher ratio improving, have suffered a decrease in the number of teachers because of the implementation of the new weighted system of allocation. I note the Minister is shaking her head, perhaps she has an alternative explanation. As reported it is a worrying development.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">According to a report in <i>The Irish Times </i>today, the INTO has called for a freeze on job losses in disadvantaged schools pending the implementation of a new plan to tackle educational disadvantage. It indicated that a number of schools in the north inner city lost the equivalent of eight teacher places because of the implementation of this plan whereas on the south side there was a net gain of one teacher. It seems extraordinary that there should be this drain away from the areas that are most disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Minister has heard me previously talk with some passion about the breaking the cycle system, about how good it is and that it should be continued all the way through primary, secondary and up to university level. According to the latest reports I have to hand, there is a drain away from the areas of greatest disadvantage because of the rigid application of a particular system. I look forward to the Minister's comments on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">This position is highlighted and accentuated by the fact that we know from another survey — which was launched by the Minister and therefore I am sure she will comment on it — that 30% of children in poorer areas continue to have serious reading difficulties. This is broadly unchanged since the previous survey of 1999. If these two developments are taken together, in other words, if teachers are being taken away from the areas of greatest disadvantage in Dublin — the north inner city — because of the application the new system when we know that in those areas there is the greatest impact of disadvantage, in particular with regard to literacy skills and so on, the developing situation gives rise to concern. I do not want to carp at the Minister over this because she has done some good work. However, this anomaly needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">To compound matters, I will quote from a third report, from the Education Disadvantage Committee commissioned by the Minister. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_418">It was clear that there is a serious lack of ‘joined-up thinking' and ‘joined-up action' at both local and national levels in addressing issues of educational disadvantage. The committee has attempted to join up at least some of the ‘dots' on the map and to develop a coherent strategy for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">These are three areas in which there is criticism of the effect of the current policies, even taking into account that there has been an improvement in the average position. I am always a little suspicious when we have average figures because there may be one group of people who are advantaged to the disadvantage of another. When we get an average figure, we have to look for the anomalies because that is where the shoe pinches.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">Another issue that needs to be addressed is the multi-ethnic element in schools. I welcome this and the very healthy attitude not only of the teachers but the pupils, which is an astonishing change since my time in school. Some 170 nationalities are now represented in the State. I want to record an example of that because it is a positive aspect. In Palmerstown community school there was a celebrated case of Olukunle Elukanlo. One of his classmates said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_421">We have guys from South Africa, Romania, Nigeria, in our class, but we've grown up with them and we don't consider them in those terms. They're mates.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">That sounds like a good school to me if children come out of the school system with that attitude. Perhaps they have a lot to teach the adults. I could elaborate on the question of numbers because there are alternative figures which suggest we are still comparatively poor in terms of class sizes compared to the other European countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">My final point, with which I am sure Senator O'Toole will deal because I will not have time to do so, is the question of special schools on which there is a debate. We need clear, firm policy on that area. I heard Olan McGowan, who is an extremely good broadcaster, speak the other night. He appeared to be against special schools because they put people in a ghetto, so to speak. These are very effective resources, however, if properly managed and we should not tie people into an either-or situation.</p>

In the short time available I want to focus on one clause in the important motion. It states: "Demands that the Government give special weighting and provision to those schools and classes with significant numbers of ‘newcomer' pupils, from other countries and cultures ...".

          <p eId="para_428">If it is included, I apologise. I read the amendment but may not have read the later part of it on the next page. Perhaps that is where I made my mistake. If that is so, I look forward to hearing the Minister's contribution on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Until fairly recently it was a novelty for a primary school to have a pupil from abroad. The challenge facing us is to adapt our system to suit that circumstance. The biggest challenge we face on immigration is the task of integrating these newcomers into Irish society. On the one hand, we must fully respect their culture and religious heritage and, on the other hand, ensure that those people who come to live among us are fully equipped to play a meaningful role as members of the society into which they have come.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The first element of that, above everything else, is that they should learn to speak English but that will not happen to them if they learn it from their friends. We must ensure that they learn to speak English correctly because if they do not they risk falling behind in everything they learn. There is also the risk that when they leave school they will be unable to play a part in our society. That will not happen by accident. It will happen only if the Government and the Minister allocate the resources to recognise that a very large number of newcomers into our society are pupils in our schools. As far as I am aware, nobody in education or elsewhere is taking responsibility for integrating those newcomers, whom we need so badly, into our society. We have not taken the first steps in that regard and the first steps must be taken in education.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">I was interested to hear Senator Norris talk about the school pupils who referred to strangers to our country as "mates". We know we can succeed in this but it will not happen if these people do not learn English early and if we do not allocate the resources to provide for that. I urge the Minister to regard that as an urgent requirement. This is a nettle we must grasp. If we do not grasp it, we will face in the future something for which we will have been responsible, that is, encouraging people to come to our country, encouraging the children to go to school here and not giving them the education they need. They need a difference in emphasis, the emphasis on learning the English language as somebody who did not grow up with it. The Minister needs to allocate the necessary resources and I hope she will do so.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_206" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_432">Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Seanadóirí as ucht an díospóireacht seo a chur ar bun inniu. It is not the first time we have discussed education in this House. As somebody who, as Minister for Education and Science, is responsible for everything from preschool to postgraduate studies, involving 1 million students, 50,000 teachers, 4,000 schools, seven universities, 15 institutes of technology, training colleges and a budget of €7.8 billion, there is plenty for us to discuss.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">While the Independent Senators have focussed their attention just on the primary school sector, they would be the first to admit that in all elements across the sector significant progress has been made. This has been achieved in a spirit of partnership with the teachers, management, the parents and in consultation with the young people, building on considerable investment by the Government and a desire on everybody's part to ensure that we continue to make progress in the area of education to ensure that it continues to be at the core of the social and cultural development, as well as the economic development, of our nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">A number of different issues have been raised. As 15 minutes will not allow me to address all of them, I will focus on some. The important matter, as Senator Ross stated, is that the child is at the centre and there is no doubt about that in all that we do. Whether it is the child in the mainstream class, the special class or the special school, the child from a disadvantaged area or the one who has come new to our country and who needs special attention, each of those children is now being afforded greater opportunities than children had in the past to reach his or her own potential. Similarly, each of their teachers is now being afforded greater support than teachers had in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">It is with a desire to continue in that vein that I, as Minister for Education and Science, will be moving towards the next year in building on our policies and continuing to develop other ones. That includes such matters as the physical school environment as well as what is happening in the schools. It is interesting that a number of years ago we probably would have had a lengthy debate on the capital programme for schools, etc., and yet it is not even mentioned in the motion.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_208" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_437">In its own way this reflects the progress that has been made, with €500 million being spent this year alone. Last year 1,200 schools had building programmes. To date this year, I have announced 65 schools going into the building programme. Next week I will be announcing 200 schools, in the context of small and rural schools and of extra classrooms, etc. We have already announced 740 schools for the summer works this year and there will be other ones arising over the next few months. That, in itself, shows a commitment to improving the physical structure, not just because of under investment over a number of years and the fact that some of our schools are over 100 years old, but it also reflects the changing needs of the new curriculum and the inclusion of children with special needs with the extra demands which that has put on schools, including the attempts to support the teachers in that situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I will take the issues addressed in the motion in the order of the priorities of the Government over the past couple of years. No doubt children with special needs have been and are a priority for the Government. That was not in the programme for Government. It was not in the programme for Government that we would put 5,000 extra teachers into our schools over a number of years, nor that we should focus our attention on children with learning difficulties, but we have achieved that. It is important it is recognised because priorities change as society changes. That is why where it may not address a complete commitment, it is necessary to consider what we have done with the money and resources available to us. We have focussed on those children with special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">When one sees that one in five primary school teachers is now dealing with children with special needs and learning difficulties, one realises the significance of the investment in this area. It is a case of dealing not just with a child where there are more severe difficulties but even the child who was always in danger of falling behind in the classroom, that is, the child who was not able to catch up with the teacher and who continually fell behind for years. The needs of such children can now be identified at an early stage. The teacher in the classroom, the best person to recognise it, can identify the child and ensure that the learning support teacher or resource teacher in the school is able to give the child the support and early intervention to ensure that problems do not continue and arise later. That is the type of intervention which I hope will contribute to ensuring that students remain in school at a later stage and that there will not be the continued drop-out experienced in some areas by some children at second level.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">The National Council for Special Education is a very significant development in supporting children, their families and schools. The special education needs organisers, SENOs, over 70 of them locally based, are making the links between the schools, the parents and the services. It is new and I accept it has taken time to bed down. People are now beginning to realise that this is a real resource because they can get to know the person concerned and ensure that the child's individual needs are met, whether it be through resource teaching hours or receiving a special needs assistant, of whom there are 6,000 — 7,000 people but 6,000 whole-time equivalents — in the schools at present. It can also pertain in the use of technology which is beneficial in enabling so many children in special education to reach their potential. The SENOs have made a significant difference for children, recognising that our schools are being very open and welcoming of children with special needs and the particular difficulties and challenges which that poses for the schools and the teacher in the classroom.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">Reference has been made to the role of the special school and to the fact that in other places they have been shut down and that others have stated they should be shut down. The special schools should be at the core, as a centre of excellence, for the expertise which they have developed over the years. I have visited a special school for children with behavioural difficulties, a special school for children with intellectual disabilities, a special school in the CRC clinic, a special school for young people who are deaf-blind and as a result cannot speak and various other special classes and special schools around the country. The care, attention and devotion that those teachers give to the children concerned cannot be found anywhere. They have developed a level of expertise over the years in recognising the best technology available, the best methodologies available and the best support structures needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">We are actively working on a pilot programme with two of those special schools to see how they can not only develop and strengthen in themselves to meet the needs of their children but also be able to reach out and provide a resource to the other schools in the area. That is why I wish to see it develop. In the UK they made a serious mistake in that they shut down the special school and they are now living to regret it. Many parents want their children to be in the mainstream class, then some of them realise that not all children are suitable for the mainstream class and the mainstream class is not suitable for all children. The special schools have a very special role to play and I will continue to support it and ensure they feel that they will be even more highly regarded as we move forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The area of autism is also developing. I would be the first to state it is an area where we need to do a great deal more. There has been a considerable increase in the number of special classes and special schools for children with autism. It is a growing issue into which we will continue to put investment and special supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The second area of commitment and priority, both by me and my predecessors, has been disadvantage. Everybody would recognise that where one has resources and when one has extra teachers, one puts them where they are needed most, which is in disadvantage. Over the years all of the results have shown us this is so. There are approximately ten schemes dealing with disadvantage. The idea behind the DEIS programme is to co-ordinate those schemes and to ensure that those with the most serious educational disadvantage are the ones who would benefit most. It has taken some time for the education research centre to work out, on the basis of the information supplied from the schools, which schools should be included in this. It has taken time because it is crucial that we get it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Quality control continues. People check whether the form is completed correctly because substantial benefits can accrue to the schools, namely, extra resources of over €40 million and 300 extra posts across the system. A total of 600 primary schools, 300 urban and town, 300 rural and 150 second level schools will benefit from this plan which is in the final stages of implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The key measures will focus on the schools, for example, targeting early childhood education, extending the home-school liaison programme, the school completion programme, ensuring there are more administrative principals, giving recognition to teachers and principals who have made a commitment to disadvantaged schools by allowing them to take paid sabbatical leave, and different measures working with the other agencies to enhance student attendance, etc. They will be put in place immediately. I am not waiting until next September; as soon as this is finalised I will roll out those supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The key point in all the studies and surveys on disadvantage is that schools cannot work alone. Families and society have a significant bearing on education. Senator Norris referred to the reading report which was a study in community disadvantage rather than simply learning disadvantage. The same is true of the study I launched in 2004 to cover illiteracy and innumeracy in disadvantaged schools. In schools where the pupil-teacher ratio was 11:1 literacy and numeracy were worse than ever because there were no books in the children's homes. Nobody read to the children, there were no language skills or nursery rhymes. They ticked the box for between zero and nine books. That shows that there is only so much a teacher can do in the classroom with significant resources and commitment but without the support of the wider community, particularly the parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">We have included family literacy in the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, programme and greater emphasis on the home-school community liaison to support the teacher in the classroom. I hope that key change will make a difference to young people coming from a position of economic and educational disadvantage. Economic disadvantage does not mean educational disadvantage. People from Leitrim often tell us how economically disadvantaged they are but they have the highest participation rate in third level education in the country. In areas of Connemara which claim rural and economic disadvantage there is a strong tradition of commitment to, and participation in, education.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The real disadvantage is in urban areas. Last week I visited two schools in Tallaght which have wonderful principals and young dedicated staff who want to make a difference. They are trying to work with a small group of parents, many children and serious family problems. The saddest meeting of my past year was with the little girl in that school who asked me if she could sleep in the school at night. That was not because the school was an oasis for her but raised many questions about what was happening outside. The principal knew about the problem and was on top of it. Those are the kind of circumstances that create educational disadvantage. We will make the investment and put the teachers in place but that must be coupled with family support which is the aim of these programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">It is not necessary to set up a five or six year programme for class size as there is in the third level or research programmes. One cannot run a capital programme for a year at a time because it is no use leaving a school without a roof because there is no money to finish it. That is why a capital programme must run for five years. One cannot tell a researcher to study the next cure for cancer for only a year and say one does not know how much money there is for the second or third year of research.</p>

          <from>Ms M. Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_452">I am announcing this year that I am reducing class size and will do so again next year. In any one year one can decide in February to reduce the schedule and put more teachers into a school and it can happen the following September. It should be recognised that all the extra teachers have been put in first to reduce the class size in disadvantaged schools and will again be so placed. This will ensure not only a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 20:1 in junior classes but to 24:1 at senior levels to ensure some continuity.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">For the schedule this year teachers will be allocated not on the basis of a ratio of 29:1 generally, but of 28:1 and the following year on the basis of 27:1. Half of the schools in the country can have four teachers or fewer and are on a lower pupil-teacher ratio. It is completely unacceptable that any school has 40 or more children in a classroom. That is not my fault. The schools have a teacher for 29 pupils but have 12 or 13 children extra in one class and 16 or fewer in another class in the school, which should not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">There is no reason for any school to have 35 in a class. While schools need some flexibility between 28 and 31 pupils there is no excuse for a principal or board of management to have a class of that size. It happens because the school chooses to have a smaller class somewhere else. Some schools, particularly in urban areas, choose not to have split classes. Half the country is learning in split classes. There is nothing to indicate that one cannot receive a top quality education in a split class. Children all over the country have been taught this way for years yet in urban areas they prefer to have the bigger class size. If they choose this they should not complain about the high pupil-teacher ratio because since September they have had a teacher for every 28 pupils.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">I have also seen schools where one teacher is devoted entirely to art. That may be a lovely idea but the mainstream teachers are provided to teach as such. I checked the guidelines to ensure that is the case. Another school complained of large class sizes but I knew its numbers offhand because I am good at reading my brief. I said there could not be large class numbers until I discovered that one teacher was teaching only technology. What a luxury. The mainstream teachers are supposed to be in the classes.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I will look very closely at the three classes which have more than 40 children and the others which have more than 35 and ask why that is so. This should not happen because the schools have the necessary teachers. I continue to reduce class sizes and hopefully will do so after the next election but I want to make sure those teachers are in the classroom and teaching because that is the only way it can happen on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">People worry most about the quality of the teaching. We have been fortunate for generations in the commitment and quality of our teachers. Other countries with smaller class sizes have not had the same quality of education. There is no direct correlation between pupil-teacher ratio and a good outcome. The commitment of Irish-trained teachers over many years proves that. Teachers are anxious to ensure that we continue to have good quality teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I accept Senator O'Toole's comments about the introduction of the new curriculum and teachers welcoming students in all their diversity including special needs, and I commend them on that. Parents may not know how many children are in their children's classes but they know whether the teachers are good. We must continue to focus on that. I will continue to do my bit in respect of class size, pumping in extra resources and putting more teachers into the schools, as long as we can ensure we have good quality teaching, co-operation with the whole-school evaluation programme, publication, and standardised testing. These factors will highlight the value of the education in our schools and we can continue to be proud, as I am, of what is happening in schools throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">The other major change in our society is the arrival of non-nationals. Senator Quinn asked me to put resources into educating them. He may be surprised, as I am when I look at the number, to hear that there are 800 teachers devoted exclusively to teaching English to the children of non-nationals. That is not in the programme for Government, showing another change in priorities in recent years to which we have had to respond. Those teachers cost €46.5 million each year. There are 600 at primary level and approximately 200 at secondary level. Schools with fewer than 13 children are given a grant to enable teaching hours to be bought in. A school with 14 children is given one teacher and a school with 28 children is given two teachers. I accept there are schools which have a large proportion of non-national intake and children with difficulties speaking English and these schools need extra supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">A departmental group has visited those schools and has also visited refugees and asylum seekers living on direct provision in Mosney and in Cork. It has met with bodies such as the INTO, the ASTI, the JMB and will be meeting the others. It is carefully considering the needs which include the teaching of English but also family support which those who are disadvantaged also need.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">Those children go home to parents who cannot speak English. There are also serious cultural differences between attitudes to school and in the way those parents discipline or treat their children and how this is reflected in the school situation. I acknowledge the importance of home-school-community service for those schools. Even with 800 teachers and the €46.5 million expenditure, I accept that in schools where there is a large proportion of children with English language difficulties, more imaginative investment is needed. I have met the principals of some of those schools so I am familiar with the issues.</p>

The Government has commenced the reduction of the mainstream class sizes and the capital infrastructure of schools has been improved. This has been achieved in a spirit of partnership with all the bodies and partners involved in education. This is the best way to continue. Everyone will recognise the progress that has been made and continues to be made. The Government is committed to ensuring that the high standard of education in primary schools continues to be of the same high quality it has been for the past 100 years.</p>

She brings a level of knowledge and sincerity to her office.

          <p eId="para_474">I welcome most of her remarks but I support the motion tabled by my Independent colleagues. I wish to state a number of areas in which my views differ from those of the Minister. She referred to educational disadvantage as being an urban phenomenon. I represent a constituency with large urban and rural areas, comprising significant towns as well as large rural parts of counties Kilkenny and Carlow. I have some knowledge of this city and of other urban areas. The most extreme forms of isolation, poverty and disadvantage, are to be found in rural Ireland. The Minister referred to Tallaght and other places with concentrations of disadvantage but there is nothing that compares with what exists in some parts of rural Ireland where people still live in very bad circumstances. There are children in County Leitrim — to which the Minister referred — who are significantly disadvantaged with difficult backgrounds. There may not be a concentration of numbers of such children in rural areas but the Minister was wrong in her assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I agree with the Minister that there have been significant achievements in the provision of new schools and new school buildings under the schools building programme. However, I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a number of glaring examples of the lack of provision of new facilities for schools. She referred to special schools and special education. This is a hobby-horse of mine and it also ties in with the schools building programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">I have raised the matter of the school of the Holy Spirit in Kilkenny city on umpteen occasions in this House. It caters for children with special educational needs, primarily those with autism. A site has been identified but they have no school building. I was approached in recent weeks by two sets of parents whose children will be finishing the primary school curriculum this year. Due to the fact that the school building is prefabricated and occupies land which was originally part of the county veterinary officer's premises, some of these parents will be forced to leave the workforce to care for children who will be finished in primary school. This is a parochial example but it applies across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Much emphasis has been placed on special education. I compliment the Minister for allocating funding to special education. I have been asking for a debate on the subject in this House since the summer recess. The National Educational Psychological Service is available to only 17% of students in County Kilkenny and 30% in County Carlow but the coverage is 100% in County Kerry. This inconsistency does not lead me to have any faith in the Government's plans for children with special educational needs when the children cannot even have their needs assessed by NEPS.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">I know of a case in County Kilkenny some years ago involving a girl who was unable to speak and who required psychological assessment. The Department thwarted the child, her school principal and the board of management at every opportunity. She was allowed access to NEPS as a result of the matter being raised on the Adjournment of the House. The Government maintains the special educational needs situation has been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">Significant numbers of teachers have been taken on for special educational needs but there is still a problem regarding NEPS. The Minister should do more in that area. I am not challenging the fact that a high level of resources is being provided because it is obvious. The figures for resources speak for themselves. It is a fact, however, that in the programme for Government, the Administration committed itself to a 20:1 pupil-teacher ratio for children under nine years of age. As Senator Minihan pointed out, the current ratio is 24:1, so the Government has failed to honour its promised commitment. The situation has changed and I accept the Government must respond to events as they occur. It is clear, however, from the first line of the motion that the Government has singularly failed with regard to that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">I am not an expert in mathematics, although I must admit that in what seems like the dim and distant past, I was a secondary school mathematics teacher. It is not a job that I want to go back to in a hurry but the people of Carlow-Kilkenny will decide that.</p>

          <p eId="para_482">In another aspect of my life — I suppose that politicians wear different caps all the time — I am a member of my local primary school's board of management. While it is only a four-teacher school, I am amazed by the phenomenal level of administration the principal has to undertake. The increase has occurred since I left primary school 14 years ago, which is not that long. In his earlier remarks, Senator Ulick Burke mentioned the need to significantly improve the resources available to principals to ensure they can carry out the necessary administration of a school without classes in small schools — such as the one of which I am a member of the board of management — suffering as a result. The Minister should examine that area as there is a need for improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I disagree with what the Minister said concerning split classes. In 1989, I was in a fourth class which was deemed to be too large so the pupils were split up. Five of us were put into another classroom with fifth and sixth class pupils. I can honestly say that my education and that of my four friends suffered as a result because we were cut off from the group with which we had spent the previous six years. When the five of us were lumped in, an extra burden was placed on the teacher who was already teaching 30 fifth and sixth class students. She had to try to teach different curricular courses to three distinct groups within the same classroom. Split classes, therefore, need to be carefully examined. Maybe I am being overly idealistic in pursuing the idea that we should not have split classes.</p>

          <from>Ms Ormonde</from>
          <p eId="para_500">I welcome the Minister to the House. We have seen a lot of her in the House of late, which reflects the importance of her role and how equipped she is to handle it. Last week we discussed funding for third-level education and the reform of our medical schools. This week we are debating funding allocated to education through the Estimates, which has reached €7.2 billion for this year alone. That clearly indicates the Minister's commitment to education and her knowledge of the sector. I am inclined to discard my script because having listened to the Minister there is no point in saying what I had set out to state. The Minister herself has said it all and Senator O'Toole has acknowledged that in listening to the debate as it unfolded.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">While the Opposition continues to focus on areas that are still being developed and where further growth may be needed in the educational sector, it is important to take a step back and examine how much has been achieved recently by the Minister and the Government. I would like to put those facts on the record. The Minister secured an increase of 8% in the education budget announced during the Estimates for 2006 in November — a rise of €530 million to bring the total budget to over €7.2 billion for this year. That says it all.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Minister prioritised class sizes, special needs and the disadvantaged. I will put down my script at this stage and will talk from my knowledge of education. If we do not get it right for disadvantaged students we will have knock-on effects, including a breakdown of law and order involving dropouts and misfits in society. The Minister is correct in stating that resources must be used to reduce class sizes and deploy teachers who will deal with disadvantaged pupils. As she said, one can pump all the money one likes into various educational schemes but they will not work in the absence of home-school links and one-to-one contacts. Nobody is better placed than teachers who are qualified to acknowledge deficits in children's needs as they commence primary school education. That is where such deficiencies are picked up by highly qualified teachers who know how students are fitting into the classroom ambience.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">Psychological services in schools must be streamlined and I think the Minister would acknowledge there are some inconsistencies. We will try to put that right. Home-school links, the psychological services and parents are critical elements in this regard but, as we all know, parents must be on side. If the main stakeholders in primary education — the principals, teachers, school management, parents and the psychological services — are working together we will have no problems when students move on to second level. There always was a problem in the transition from primary to secondary school but I know it is not there now, having discussed the matter with colleagues. There were gaps in the educational process because there was no follow-on or continuity between both levels. That situation has changed absolutely in recent years and I am glad to say that resources are being prioritised for that area. Our approach to the transition period between primary and second levels will reflect the future shape of our educational system. I acknowledge the Minister's statement in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">The Minister also referred to special needs and in particular the role of special schools. I welcome her comments on that subject because too often in the past we disregarded students with special needs. Many parents felt that their sons or daughters with special needs should be in mainstream education but nine times out of ten it does not work. Teachers are well qualified to devote their attention and expertise to trying to bring these special needs students on board and give them an education. Very often, these students are highly intelligent but simply need the patience, commitment and expertise of the teachers. I welcome the resources being put into that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">Class sizes must be reduced and the Minister has given a commitment to carry on reducing them. I see nothing wrong with splitting classes at primary level. That has always worked. It depends on attitudes of the boards of management and of teachers. It has worked where one would not have expected it to work, where substantial numbers were involved. It is all down to the philosophy, policy and attitudes of teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Minister has created 800 posts for helping non-nationals with language lessons. Clearly, the needs of students coming in from different countries must be met. As the Minister said, all children must be treasured and should be at the centre of our debate. It is great to see that not alone will the children have to be educated in English, but that their parents will learn English too. It is important this is acknowledged.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This is a good debate. I am delighted that Senator O'Toole tabled the motion and gave us and the Minister the opportunity to put the facts right, where they should be. The Senator has given me the opportunity to acknowledge the work the Minister is doing, that the Government is committed and to note where its priorities lie. Senator O'Toole did a good job for us tonight. We have given him the answers and I hope he will acknowledge them.</p>

          <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_509">The Minister and Senator Ormonde are responding to this motion by blaming the schools. The Minister spoke of an imbalance in schools whereby there are some classes of 16 and others of 35. There could well be a reason for classes of such different size. Different years might be involved. Perhaps the Minister can produce figures to show that for some students in the same year, such differences in class sizes exist. She may be talking of different years. A class might be smaller because of special needs in the class, for example.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Going by the Minister's figures supplied as responses to parliamentary questions, that issue is a red herring. It is quite obvious that the bulk of pupils are in classes of 20 to 24 and 30 to 34. When the issue was raised by teachers in my area as part of the INTO campaign, the basic issue involved classes with about 30 pupils. Most of the schools in my area had class numbers of high 20s and low 30s, and there seemed to be many classes in those size ranges. The Minister is aware of numerous such meetings held during the INTO campaign between local teachers and public representatives. That never happened before. The impression I got from the principals and teachers involved was that they were very concerned about the issue, which was putting them under a lot of pressure in schools. Organising such meetings with public representatives and bringing the issue into the political arena was very much a last resort for teachers.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I do not believe that teachers would not do something themselves about class sizes, if they could. In my local schools, teachers have done everything they can to maximise resources in order to ensure class sizes are not too big. However, they still have class sizes well beyond what would be considered best practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">The Minister has announced there will be 400 extra teachers in the next couple of years, so she acknowledges the problem. It is good that she has made this announcement. The INTO welcomed it but said that further progress is necessary. That is the message of this debate and of Senator O'Toole's motion. The issue will not go away merely because an announcement was made. People need to see changes on the ground and very little has changed so far.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">The Minister is talking of reducing the average class size from 29 to 28 this year, and to 27 the following year. Will a class of 34 drop down to 33 or 32? Class sizes will remain too big for the next couple of years. Despite the Minister's announcement, progress will be slow.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The issue of disadvantaged schools was raised by many Members. A recent report has confirmed that in poor areas there are 30% levels of poor literacy. That is not much of an improvement on the figures in 1999 when a similar report was published. We know one of the keys to dealing with poor literacy levels is a reduction in class size. Research has consistently shown that the outcome for pupils in smaller classes is better.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">We all know that education is the key to dealing with life chances. We are one of the richest economies in the world, definitely at the top of the scale in Europe, yet we are at the bottom of the league in terms of expenditure on education as a percentage of GNP. We must do more. The Minister is doing something but must do a lot more if she wants to change in terms of class sizes and disadvantaged pupils. The Minister is nowhere near delivering the Government commitment to class sizes of 20 or less.</p>

          <p eId="para_521">The Minister made a good point. As someone involved for the best part of 20 years in one form or another in helping to draft programmes for Government, I can say that they naturally cover only a certain amount of what the Government will do, and other priorities will come forward. Unfortunately, Governments do not tend to get credit for all the things they have done which they did not promise to do. They get criticised for things which are perhaps less a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I pay tribute to the Minister for what she has done in reducing the general class size, in terms of the pupil-teacher ratio, and providing additional resource teachers and special teachers of various kinds. I am very impressed by the figure of 800 posts towards helping non-nationals with languages.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">However, I must say that the class size problem raised with me at a local Tipperary level is very different than that being discussed in this debate. I have attended union meetings across that county in which the drum has been banged on pupil-teacher ratios but the class size problem with which I am continually confronted is that of physical space. This is particularly the case when people lack space for resource teachers in schools built 50 or 60 years ago. That configuration is no longer necessary and is bursting at the seams. New schools and extensions cope with that type of class size problem but we must recognise that there is more than one dimension to the problem. The building programme is extremely worthwhile. If I have any criticisms, it is that the Minister for Finance should invest more money in the area. When new schools are opened, it highlights the contrast with poorer facilities elsewhere.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_530">I take a different view than Senator Tuffy on the INTO and complaints about what must be done. In the December issue of the INTO's magazine, the general secretary commented that, at last, there is progress on class sizes. The magazine goes on to read that this promised reduction in class sizes is the first for four years. The issue also states that much more work must be done, with which I agree. I was impressed by the INTO's pre-budget submission, of which there is a short version in the magazine. The full details are on the website.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">I welcome the publication by the INTO of an issue of its magazine dealing with class sizes, to which the Minister has tried to respond. She probably knows I have been campaigning in my constituency for small schools in particular. Last year, I established that five three-teacher schools fell short of the retention of the third teacher by just one pupil. This year, there will be help in this regard, as the Minister announced, but we will still have problems. I always wonder why we examine the previous September's enrolment figures when many schools would have had smaller enrolments than their figures for this year. In the case of three-teacher schools where pupil numbers have fallen from 50 to 49, there must be some way of helping. Some schools will have more than 50 pupils next September but will still lose a teacher based on last year's figures.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">This issue must be addressed and those figures should be highlighted in the partnership talks. It is a good situation for two-teacher schools, in which the number of teachers will not fall irrespective of pupil numbers, but three-teacher and larger schools have a particular problem. Principal teachers of a number of the smaller schools are making a point about their workloads. I have discussed this matter with the Minister and a number of public meetings are being held throughout the country on the extra work that principals must do. Many of the meetings deal with school buildings, which have improved due to the devolved grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I welcome the fact that Tuam, a RAPID town, now has an educational welfare officer. It did not have any for a long time. I am sorry that many of the <i>ad hoc</i> committees composed of gardaí, social workers, principal teachers and health authority staff seem to have fallen out of the loop because of the educational welfare service. We cannot have one without the other. Those committees should continue, even on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. I hope the Minister and her Department will examine the example of Tuam, where there are many ethnic minorities and difficulties in respect of school attendance and school leavers, and encourage the committees to remain in place for as long as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_534">I thank Senator Mansergh for sharing his time. It is a pity the Government has tabled an amendment to this motion, as we are all on the Minister's side. We want her to get everything she wants from the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">Every issue has been well covered but I wish there was more cohesion between the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science regarding primary school children. The Minister is nodding her head. This must come forward in every solitary area. The two Departments are too divided but it is important that they be in tune with each other in the area of mental health. For example, in A Vision for Change, the policy document and new report on what we hope to do in the mental health services in Ireland, there is a very good section on child and adolescent mental health services and how they will impinge on the education of the child. We must have better cohesion between the various Departments.</p>

          <p eId="para_536">I thank all of the contributors to the debate and the Minister for attending it in full, which I appreciate. I did not finish what I had hoped to say at the beginning of the debate. Ach ba mhaith liom cúpla rud a rá mar gheall ar an nGaolainn ionas go dtuigfí cén fáth go bhfuil déistin orm mar gheall ar an méid a fheicim. Do chaitheas leathuair a' chloig ar maidin ag éisteacht leis an Aire Gnóthaí Pobail Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, an Teachta Ó Cuív, istigh sa Teach eile. Bhí liosta mór fada nua aige de chomhlachtaí a chaithfeadh a gcuid cuntas bliantúla agus pé rud a bheidh á gcur i gcló acu a fhoilsiú i mBéarla agus i nGaolainn. There is nothing wrong with that. I am delighted with it, but is mór an trua é nach dtuigeann sé that, while we can now read the National Roads Authority's glossy magazine and end-of-year reports with photographs from all over the country, ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, tá múinteoirí sna Gaeltachtaí, agus ní féidir leo teacht ar leabhar staire le téacs Gaolainne ann. How in the name of God could anyone supply that?</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Does anyone share that level of frustration leis na múinteoirí sin atá ag iarraidh jab a dhéanamh ar ár son gan na téacsanna acu. Nach mbeadh sé i bhfad ní ba thábhachtaí go mbeadh téacsanna Gaolainne ar fáil acu sna scoileanna ná cuntais bhliantúla na gcomhlachtaí seo? Last week, I was looking for a Government strategy document but was told go mbeadh moill air mar bhí siad ag feitheamh ar an leagan Gaolainne. This is ridiculous. Agus bhí an fear céanna ag tabhairt ceacht staire dúinn ar an difríocht idir Dingle, An Daingean agus Daingean Uí Chúis, cad as a dtáinig siad, an Seabhac agus gach rud eile.</p>

          <p eId="para_539">Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, tá múinteoirí san áit chéanna, agus níl na téacsanna acu chun an jab a dhéanamh. Ó thaobh na nGaeltachtaí de, tá seanaithne ag an Aire ar Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne. Níl dhá bhliain imithe ó bhuaileas isteach go dtí scoil i gceartlár fhoinse na Gaolainne, Scoil Dhún Chaoin — I will name it. Bhuaileas isteach sa rang sóisearach, áit a raibh beirt ón Spáinn, beirt ó Londain agus ní raibh nach mór deichniúr ann. Tá na múinteoirí ansin ag iarraidh an Ghaolainn a chur i bhfeidhm agus a chur chun cinn. Seo an cheist a chuir siad orm. Why can we not have the same appointment ratio as Gaelscoileanna in the Gaeltacht? There is no sense to it. In no place was there 50%. The Minister may respond by saying "An Ghaeltacht, na Gaeltachtaí" but that is the business of some other Minister, not mine. I am informing the Minister of what is happening on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">There is a shortage of every kind of special needs therapist. One can place any word in front of "therapist" and there is a shortage of people to fill the role. The National Educational Psychological Service has not been filled and is not working properly. Pupils are still being denied access to special education. Why are we separating the National Educational Psychological Service from special education? The National Educational Psychological Service does not have access to special education and this must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">I have received a short memorandum on the operation of the Act. When teachers and principles discover a whole new range of assessments, educational plans, appeals and structures to report to in the new national authority, the Minister will hear about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The Minister was correct in praising the job done by a principal in Tallaght. I point out to Senator Mansergh that my successors, Mr. John Carr and the current president, Ms Sheila Noonan, are doing a far better job than I did. If I pass on the Minister's comments they will tell me that fine words are great but the Minister did not state she will support the elimination of the anomaly between first and second level schools. That should be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_549">Priorities change, as Senator Fitzgerald will agree, so we must change our objectives. The Minister should meet the education community and explain that priorities have changed, a commitment was given and that she now seeks to agree a new commitment. Senator John Paul Phelan explained why mixed and split classes, like shared jobs and split jobs, are different and we must examine why this is done. Splitting classes involves separating pupils who have built up a dynamic since junior infants class</p>
          <p eId="para_550">I have some sympathy with the Minister's point on the use of teachers within schools so I will not address it. Regarding language support teachers, the Minister is correct in stating she has appointed 800 teachers. This is not enough and though no one is blaming the Minister this must be examined. Senator Brian Hayes issued a statement on this matter during the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Three times in her speech the Minister stated that disadvantage cannot be addressed entirely in school. Although it involves the family and the community, the pupils of today will be the families and communities in that area tomorrow. They will still be disadvantaged if we do not intervene. If we do not break the cycle of deprivation, underprivileged and disadvantage we will experience it forever. One of the most effective places to break this is at school level and this is where money should be allocated.</p>

            <from>Ms Tuffy</from>
            <p eId="para_601">My question to the Minister of State concerns a particular case of a married couple. The husband is in receipt of an old age contributory pension, and claims qualifying adult allowance for his wife. Their joint income is €298.80. In October they qualified for the medical card, under the medical card income guidelines. It has come to my attention that because of the budget increases, that couple may be over the income limit for the medical card as they are now in receipt of a total income of €322.10. Will the Minister of State clarify the position? Does he analyse the situation in the same way? It is a matter of concern. A few months ago, when the income guidelines were announced, the couple qualified for the medical card. However, the social welfare increase made a couple of months later means they are outside the income limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">Since formulating the question, I examined this issue and found other incidents where people qualified for the medical card or the GP visit card on a social welfare income in October 2005 but, following budget increases, are now outside the income guidelines. A married couple aged under 65 years, where the husband is in receipt of an invalidity pension and claims qualifying adult allowance for his wife, had a total income of €264.30 before Christmas. That brought them within the medical card income guidelines limit of €266.50 for a married couple up to 65 years. The new social welfare rates introduced in the budget mean their income is more than the medical card income limits as they are in receipt of €293.50. That is made up of €171.30 for the claimant and €122.20 for the qualifying adult.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Another example is a married couple aged between 66 and 69 years where the husband was in receipt of the old age non-contributory pension and claiming qualified adult allowance for his wife. That is made of €166 for the claimant and €109.70 for the qualifying adult totalling €275.70. That would leave them under the medical card income guidelines of €298 for a married couple aged between 66 and 69 years. However, with the new social welfare rates following the budget, the claimant will have an income €182 and the qualifying adult will have an income of €120 totalling €302. That brings the couple over the medical card income limit.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">I am concerned, although some people might be within the guidelines because they might have receipts which they could include in their application for the card. However, some people might not have those receipts and within two months, they will find themselves outside the income limits for the medical card. Surely the Government should now increase the income limits as a matter of urgency. Am I correct in my analysis of the position or am I missing something? Is there any way around this?</p>

          <speech by="#SeanPower" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_266">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_605">I thank Senator Tuffy for raising this matter. The determination of eligibility of applicants to medical cards is a matter for the Health Service Executive, HSE, as provided for under the provisions of the Health Act 1970. Since 2001, persons aged 70 and over have an automatic statutory entitlement to a medical card. In all other cases, medical cards are issued to persons for whom, in the opinion of the executive, the provision of general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants would prove unduly burdensome. In assessing applications, the HSE has regard to the financial circumstances and medical needs of the applicant.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">Income guidelines are used by the executive in determining eligibility. They are not statutorily binding and in cases where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the executive considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. In the past, the Department of Health and Children has requested that increases in social welfare payments would not adversely affect the eligibility to medical cards of people in receipt of such payments. I understand from the HSE that it has been established practice for many years that anyone whose income was solely derived from social welfare sources would qualify for a medical card.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">Furthermore, in December 2005, the Department asked the HSE to take account of the welfare, taxation and other changes announced in the budget in the operation of the income guidelines and to identify any changes which may be required in order to ensure that medical cards and GP visit cards will continue to be available to those who need them. In this regard, the HSE has indicated it is completing a review of the guidelines and expects to be in a position to make a recommendation in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">The Senator will be aware the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children has made significant improvements to the way in which an applicant's eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. From 1 January 2005, the income guidelines were increased by 7.5% and significant rises were also made in the allowances provided for dependent children.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">In June 2005, the Tánaiste simplified the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after income tax and PRSI and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. On 13 October 2005, the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards were further increased by 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than at the end of 2004. It will also be noted that income guidelines used for the assessment for GP visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">The Health Act 2004 provided that the HSE has responsibility to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services. Given this, I would be happy to request the executive, on provision of the relevant details as outlined by Senator Tuffy to investigate and report directly to the Senator in respect of any specific cases which she raised.</p>

            <from>Mr. Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_611">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for taking this important matter on community employment mainstreaming. I ask him to provide us with an update on funding for community employment project staff on whom the Irish Wheelchair Association relies for the provision of care and driving personnel for core and essential services within its resource and outreach centres in 62 locations nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">I have received many representations on this issue, particularly in the run up to and since the last budget, asking that I raise the issue of funding for community employment project staff. The Disability Act was passed in the last 12 months. It claims to protect and develop services for people with disabilities. It is unsatisfactory that the most vital and basic services are being delivered by community employment participants. As the Minister of State knows, the Irish Wheelchair Association relies on community employment schemes to provide care and driving staff to core and essential services in its resource and outreach centres in 62 locations nationally serving approximately 3,000 people weekly.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">I acknowledge the great work of community employment schemes. They have played a major role in the development and provision of services for the disability sector in several areas over many years. The Irish Wheelchair Association also acknowledges this. However, use of community employment is no longer sufficient or appropriate to those very necessary services and the quality and number of participants available to community employment is threatening the ability to continue to deliver this service. That has been highlighted to me in clinics over the past few months by people involved in the Irish Wheelchair Association. I cannot overstate the importance of addressing this issue and I hope the Minister of State has good news for me.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">Last year the Irish Wheelchair Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland made a joint presentation to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children. As a result of this presentation, we were guaranteed the situation would be prioritised and a budget submission was made to the Minister outlining the possible solutions to guarantee core funding for the critical positions. They also presented their concerns to Ministers and Members of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">We continue to get representations on this issue. On behalf of the Irish Wheelchair Association and people with disabilities, I appeal for funding on an incremental basis to secure staff and services beyond 2006. I would welcome a favourable response from the Minister of State who is trying to do his best in this area. I hope funding will be put on a firmer footing in the years to come. Community employment schemes have done a good job and many services have been provided but there has been much insecurity. It is important funding is available on a permanent basis.</p>

          <speech by="#SeanPower" eId="spk_268" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_616">I thank Senator Bannon for raising this matter. It gives me the opportunity to clarify the position in regard to the employment of staff by the Irish Wheelchair Association. I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">In the Estimates for 2006, significant additional funding totalling €100 million has been included for the improvement of health services for people with disabilities. As part of this provision, funding of €10 million has been made available to address core underfunding and core staffing issues in services provided by the non-statutory sector. The Health Service Executive has been asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities. I expect the executive's consideration of these needs will take into account any urgent case for funding of necessary services which may be made by the Irish Wheelchair Association.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">In this connection, I am aware that the Irish Wheelchair Association is highly dependent on community employment schemes to provide services to people with disabilities. This means there is a regular turnover of highly experienced, well trained and committed staff when their stints on community employment schemes expire. For agencies such as the Irish Wheelchair Association which have a significant involvement in community employment schemes, there can be particular difficulties associated with the lack of eligible participants, difficulties in recruiting people of the required calibre and problems associated with training participants who must then leave the schemes after a defined period, resulting in the need on the part of the agency and service user to recruit and train all over again.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">If the association is of the view that such services should be fully funded by the Health Services Executive instead, it should make this case directly to the executive. It will then be a matter for the HSE to decide on the level of priority to be given to this funding application, taking into account the advice of the regional co-ordinating committees and bearing in mind other competing demands for funding for disability services.</p>
